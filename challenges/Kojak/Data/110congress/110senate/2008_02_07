When he gets back, we will \nmeet again.\n  All Senators should know that we have to finish FISA this week. \nHopefully, we can finish it today and, if not, tomorrow. We have to \nfinish it this week. As for the stimulus package, it would be good to \nfinish it today, but we may not be able to. Procedurally, we may have \nto wait until tomorrow or maybe even Tuesday. But we are working on \nthat.\n  Like I said, I have a way forward, but we don't have a way forward. I \nwill try to see if we can have a situation where it is ``we'' rather \nthan ``I.'' I hope that works out well.\n  As I indicated last night, we had a good bipartisan vote. It would \nhave been better if we had one more bipartisan vote, but it was still \nsomething we should all feel good about. We are trying to move this \ncountry forward. The economy is in real trouble now, as indicated in \ntoday's press. Now the Fed is worried about inflation, and in addition \nto that, we have other countries worried about inflation--European \ncountries. It is really a time of trouble. That is why we have to \ncontinue to work on the stimulus package to see if we can come up with \nsomething.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S753-8", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as you know, I very seldom come to the \nfloor. Last week, I came to the floor to talk a little bit about the \nstimulus package that is before us now. Last night, we had a vote that \nblocked the Senate Finance Committee package. I know that probably \nsometime during the course of this day--or very soon--we will be voting \non the House version of the stimulus package. I have to say that I \nrealize I am a voice in the wilderness--actually more of a voice in the \nwilderness this week than last--but I continue to be almost shocked at \nthe lack of debate regarding this stimulus package and its nature and \neffect on our economy.\n  This is a roughly $150 billion package. Most of this package is \noriented toward sprinkling, if you will, checks around our country. I \nknow there are many people in our country in need, and there have been \nattempts to add various groups that ``have been left out'' of the \npackage. I really feel for people around our country who are in \ntremendous economic distress. But I have to say that, to me--and this \nis just one opinion, and I have tremendous respect for this body and \nthe various opinions that exist here--this has to be, in my humble \nopinion, one of the most irresponsible things we have done since I have \nbeen in the Senate.\n  I think about all the debate we have had here, for instance, \nregarding earmarks, the wasteful spending that can sometimes take place \nover congressional earmarks. I know the public has been focused on that \nparticular item now for over a year, as that issue has been debated on \nthe floor and as people have tried to weed out, if you will, wasteful \nearmarks.\n  In one fell swoop today--or tomorrow--we are going to be taking $150 \nbillion and, from the standpoint of having an effect on our economy for \nthe long term, in essence, wadding it up and throwing it, for lack of a \nbetter expression, into a mud bowl. I have heard no serious \neconomists--and I have not read every economist--speak to the virtues \nof this stimulus package.\n  I think you know the President just put forth a budget that shows a \n$410 billion budget deficit next year. All of us know that is not even \nclose to the real number because operations in Afghanistan and Iraq are \nnot fully funded by that budget.\n  We are talking about in 2009 a half-a-trillion-dollar budget deficit, \nmoney that none of us will ever, of course, pay for. Mr. President, you \nand I will never have anything to do with paying back this money. Our \ngrandchildren and their children will pay this back.\n  As I mentioned last week on the floor, $150 billion becomes in a \ngeneration, 20 years, $322 billion. We, in essence, are borrowing this \nmoney. All of us know much of this money will be lent to us from \ncountries such as China and other places. Most of us know that between \nthe fiscal policy we are talking about today and the monetary policy \nthat has been followed recently by the Fed, the U.S. dollar has \ndevalued. Companies in our country are becoming greater bargains for \npeople in other countries. There has been tremendous investment by \nother countries buying up companies in our country.\n  Many of the products people will spend this money on, if they spend \nit on items other than electricity bills and those kinds of items, will \nbe products that are made in other countries.\n  All of us--and, Mr. President, I know you are new to this body as I \nam--came here recognizing the tremendous recklessness that has occurred \nas it relates to our country's fiscal and financial matters. I think \nall of us came here wanting to rectify that situation. I find it truly \nhard to believe there is such a rush in this Congress to take $150 \nbillion and sprinkle it around America as if we feel that is going to \ndo something to stimulate our economy.\n  I know that much of this--again, I am not saying by any measure this \nrelates to every Senator, but I know much of this is politically \nmotivated, to make sure people in our country think we are doing \nsomething, even if it is wrong. I know this is an election year. In \nsome ways, to some constituent groups, this might build political \nfavor. I certainly have not had private conversations with every \nSenator, so that should be noted. But I have to tell my colleagues, in \nprivate, I have not found one Senator--not one--who believes what we \nare getting ready to do is going to do anything to stimulate this \neconomy. Again, economists around the country are mentioning the fact \ndaily that this will have little or no effect.\n  Recently a well-respected person I know, whom I will not quote, said: \nLook, this is an awful lot of money. It probably will not do any harm. \nI think about what $150 billion would do invested in ways that actually \ncreated jobs for the long haul, whether it is in research, whether it \nis in promotion of energy security, maybe doing something to solve some \nof the health issues we have in our country. Certainly, there are other \nways for us to spend $150 billion.\n  I have listened to some of the debates on the floor that go on for \ndays, if you will, over spending $1 billion or over spending $10 \nbillion maybe at a university or something such as that. I realized \nthat in the very near future, this body, without any real debate, is \ngetting ready to spend $150 billion we will never pay back.\n  I will close with this, and I said this the last time I spoke. There \nare children all over America today in classrooms. We have some who got \nup this morning who are in front of us--our pages--at 5 in the morning \nand went to class at 6. They come here every day and work with us. They \nare looking to their parents, their teachers, their coaches, their \nSunday school teachers to help teach them life principles and to help \nmake decisions that hopefully will cause their lives to be more whole \nand more full, and hopefully from time to time they look to those of us \nin Washington to do the same--their elected officials.\n  I hope, and I say this with all due respect to the Members in this \nbody who have a different opinion--this is solely my opinion, and I \nhave deep respect for the other 99 Members of this body, but from my \nown personal vantage point, I hope they are not looking at us this \nweek. I do not think there are many Members in this body who believe \nthis $150 billion these young people and their children will pay back \nis being spent in a meaningful way. I think many Members of this body \nrealize this is an election-year stunt, if you will, to make it look as \nif we are addressing a problem when, in my humble opinion, we are not.\n  I do hope that sometime, in a bipartisan way, all of us can work \ntogether and address the fundamental fiscal problems which our country \nhas to deal with. I know there is a bill that is going to be debated on \nthe floor, hopefully in the near future, the Conrad-Gregg bill, to get \nus together and focus on Social Security and Medicare. Again, we have \nnot even begun to see the stresses those programs are going to create \nfor our country. Yet in this next fiscal year, we are looking at half a \ntrillion dollars in a 1-year annual budget deficit.\n  We have been fiscally reckless as a country. As they say back in my \nhome State, the chickens are going to come home to roost. I am \ntremendously discouraged that we in this body are getting ready to \nspend $150 billion the way that we are and to ask these young pages and \nthe young people across our country and the young people coming after \nthem to pay the tap on that money so that in this election year, we can \nact like we have actually done something to solve a problem, when I \nthink there are many in this body who know that is not what we are \ndoing.\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\n  Obviously, it has been made clear, I am going to vote against the \nHouse package, the Senate package, and any other package that focuses \non sprinkling money around America in a way we know is not going to \naffect our economy in any meaningful way.\n  Mr. President, as you know, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to \nserve with you in the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about the stimulus \npackage and I wish to talk about our economy and I wish to talk about \nthe Senate.\n  I am very frustrated with the Senate. We spent a week maneuvering and \ntwisting over parliamentary procedure. Our processes are slowing us \ndown in meeting the day-to-day needs of the American people and the \nlong-range needs of our country.\n  Our country is at risk. We are fighting a global war against \nterrorism. Our dollar is worth a box of Kleenex. We need an economic \nstimulus and an economic recovery package, and we are fooling around on \nmotions to proceed and clotures and backward and forward, and so on. \nThe American people wonder what are we doing. They believe that when \nall is said and done, more gets said than does get done. And guess \nwhat. Put me in the column with the American people.\n  I am very frustrated with this institution. The rules were designed \nto make sure the minority party could always be able to express their \nview. That should happen. But it was not to bottle up progress. It was \nnot to stifle the opportunity to get our economy back on track. It was \nnot to tie up the Senate so we could not help 250,000 vets, 20 million \nsenior citizens, and actually get money in the pocketbooks of people so \nwe can start getting our economy back on the track.\n  Everyone agrees we need to jump-start our economy, everyone agrees we \nneed to do it now--everybody but the other side of the aisle who is \nsitting on their hands and sitting on parliamentary procedure and \nsitting on you know what. I think it is time they get up, and I call \nout to the people: Flood our phones, get them off this, and get this \neconomy going.\n  We know we are being very hard hit. Last month, we lost 17,000 jobs \nin the service sector. That was supposed to be job-loss proof. Families \nall over the country are losing their homes to the subprime crisis. The \nprice of food, gas, and health care is going up.\n  We voted last night on a parliamentary procedure that would have \nmoved this legislation on the economic stimulus forward. It lost. It \nlost by one vote. But did it lose on a majority? No. Under the rules of \nthe Senate, we need 60 votes to win a majority or we need 67 votes to \nwin a majority. I thought a majority used to be a majority. Now we find \nthat one vote--one vote--is standing in the way of moving the economic \nstimulus package.\n  I say to America: You watch cable TV, you listen to the chattering \nclass, you read the newspapers. You know where that one vote lies. You \nsee those empty chairs over there? One vote lies there. Flood our \nphones with calls, flood our Internet, flood our fax machines so we can \nget moving.\n  Last night what we had was a plan to move the economy forward. It was \na well-thought-out plan of tax rebates to help families. We included \nnot only that but 250,000 disabled veterans and 20 million seniors. At \nthe same time, we extended unemployment insurance for an extra 13 weeks \nbecause for people who lost their job, it is now taking a longer time \nto find another job. And we help small business.\n  Last night, we Democrats voted to stand up for those disabled vets, \nfor those senior citizens, for those people who have lost their jobs to \nmake sure they will have the opportunity to benefit from the stimulus, \nand as they benefit from the stimulus, because they have such modest \nincomes, the money they get will go right into the economy. It will not \ngo into paying the bar bill for somebody who has a fifth home in the \nHamptons. It will go into the economy.\n  This bill helps 250,000 disabled vets. They say they did not qualify; \nthey did not have earned income. My God, my God. I have a veterans \nadvisory board. I meet with the disabled vets. Some of them belong to \nthe Purple Heart Association, some come in wheelchairs, some come with \ncanes because they bear the permanent wounds of war.\n  We always say a grateful nation never forgets, but we forgot them in \nthe stimulus package. We forgot 250,000 of them. If a grateful nation \nnever forgets, let's say we think you earned that. We think you earned \nthat at Iwo Jima. We think you earned it at Normandy and Porkchop Hill \nand the Mekong Delta. If you have worn the uniform, you have earned it.\n  Now we want to help 20 million seniors who are left out because they \nsaid those Social Security benefits are not earned income. You pay your \nSocial Security based on your wages. I think that is earned \nincome. Every day there are people out there working, or who have \nworked every day. They have spent their whole lives building our \neconomy, building our Nation, and they are ready to do it again. All \nthey need right now is to qualify for what they should be entitled to.\n\n  People say: Well, there she goes again. You know, Barb has a master's \ndegree in social work. Well, you bet I do. And that social work took me \ninto the neighborhoods and families of our constituents, and as a \nSenator I often try to think that way. While everybody here likes to \ntalk about the macroeconomics and they take codels to Davos to hang out \nwith the rich and famous, who want to be even more rich and more \nfamous, I worry about the macaroni and cheese issues. And the macaroni \nand cheese issues that we have to focus on are what is happening in our \neconomy.\n  But I just don't want to be a bleeding heart--though I am happy to be \na bleeding heart. I am happy to be a bleeding heart, but I know that \nsomething called Moody's Economy.com--Moody's Economy.com--tells us \nwhere we get the most stimulus from the techniques used to do the \nstimulus, and what do they tell us? They tell us to give it to the \npeople who need it the most--to extend unemployment benefits and to \nextend other benefits, such as LIHEAP, which helps people with their \nenergy costs.\n  Now, 41 Republicans blocked this bill. They called it a Christmas \ntree. They said it was loaded with pet projects. Well, yes, disabled \nvets are a pet project with me. I stand guilty. Disabled veterans are a \npet project with me. Clean up the mess at Walter Reed, clean up the \ncompensation system, and include them in the stimulus package. You bet. \nBut I also resent that. Disabled veterans are not ornaments or \ndecorations, they are heroes, and they are the backbone of our country. \nSo one vote stands between the American people and some help during \nthese tough times.\n  I thank the eight Republicans who voted with us last night to move \nthe bill forward so we could vote up or down on amendments. We need one \nmore Senator to join us, one more Senator who will stand up for the \npeople, for families, for seniors, for wounded warriors, one more vote \nagainst politics as usual. I say over there to those empty chairs: Will \none of you come forward and join this very important effort?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wanted to rise briefly to express my concerns at the \nprocess as it presently stands here in the Senate. I am tempted to say: \nWherefore art thou the stimulus package, because there is no reason \nthere should not be action on it now.\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\n  I had some very serious reservations about this whole effort on the \nstimulus package. I believe very strongly that we need some sort of \nstimulus to this economy, that the economy is beginning to slow fairly \ndramatically, but that the present framework of the stimulus packages, \nas they were agreed to in the House and certainly the Senate Finance \nCommittee, have very distinct flaws. But that does not mean we should \nnot bring the packages up and vote on them. Last night we voted on the \nFinance package. It did not pass. It did not pass because it added $44 \nbillion of additional money to an agreement which had already been \nreached between Speaker Pelosi, Republican Leader Boehner, and the \nadministration, a bipartisan agreement which was reached with the tacit \napproval of the leadership of the Senate, as I understand it.\n  Although I was not intimately involved in the negotiations, my \nunderstanding is the way this proceeded was that the Senate basically \nsaid to the House--the Senate leadership in the sense of Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell said to the administration and the House: You see \nif you can reach an agreement on this stimulus initiative. And the \nadministration, in good faith, under the leadership of the Secretary of \nTreasury, negotiated with Speaker of the House Pelosi and with \nCongressman Boehner, and they reached an agreement. It was an agreement \nthat involved very distinct compromises, compromises which basically \nreflected a classic political process where you basically put on the \ntable your ideas, the other side puts on the table their ideas, then \nyou work to the middle and come up with a concept that both sides can \nat least be comfortable with, even if they do not accept all of the \ndetails.\n  This package, as we all know, is a $150 billion package, the majority \nof which is a rebate, to people who pay taxes, of $600 to $1,200, and \nthe balance of which is an incentive, especially to small businesses to \ngo out and invest and as a result create hopefully more jobs and a more \nefficient economy.\n  When it got to the Senate, for reasons which I still do not \nunderstand, the Senate decided it wanted to assert some prerogative \nhere, even though the Senate leadership had said: Let the House \nleadership and the administration do the basic negotiations. We got a \npackage out of the Finance Committee which took a $450 billion package \nand increased it by $44 billion.\n  A lot of that package was basically baggage being thrown on a train \nleaving the station. It had clearly nothing to do with stimulating the \neconomy over the short run. There were tax benefits for the coal \nindustry, tax benefits for the wind industry; there were a whole \nvariety of things that had nothing at all to do with stimulus. They \nsimply were there due to the fact that certain groups around here had \nenough influence to be able to put their baggage on this train.\n  What we have to remember is every dollar that is being spent on the \nstimulus package is being borrowed from our children and our children's \nchildren, because we do not have a surplus now. We do not have money to \nrebate. I mean ``rebate'' is the wrong term. This is basically money \nbeing borrowed from our children being paid to us, people who are \nworking today or people who are paying taxes today under the House \npackage.\n  Then on the Senate package, it is another $44 billion of money being \nborrowed from our children and our children's children to be sent out \nthe door today, for the purposes of different interest groups who have \nput their points forward.\n  The majority leader said we would take the Senate package or we take \nno package, which makes no sense at all. The House package was a \nbipartisan, negotiated package, which had the Speaker of the House, who \nnobody can accuse of being a conservative--she comes from San \nFrancisco. I do not think she is a conservative--the Speaker of the \nHouse, and the majority leader, the Republican leader of the House, Mr. \nBoehner, whom nobody can accuse of being a liberal, comes from \nsomeplace in Ohio, but he has quite a track record around here, Mr. \nBoehner, of being a conservative of note.\n  They reached an agreement. It was not as though it was the \nRepublicans saying, ``This is the package,'' or Democrats saying, \n``This is the package.'' It was an agreement.\n  So when it came over here, yes, there might have been adjustments \nthat needed to be made, but to add $44 billion to it and say: Take that \n$44 billion addition or leave it, makes no sense at all in the context \nof reaching some agreement quickly and moving it out the door.\n  In fact, Senator McConnell, I think, had the best idea. He said: \nLet's take the House package and add three things to it, three things \nthat there seems to be consensus on around here: One was to make sure \nthat seniors got a rebate so they could also participate in the \nstimulus initiative; two was to make sure that disabled veterans got a \nrebate so they could participate; and, three, to correct the technical \nerror in the bill relative to illegal immigrants.\n  So Senator McConnell said: Let's do those three things; add them to \nthe House package, send it to back to the House, the House has agreed \nto approve that, we will send it to the President, and we will be done \nquickly, which is the whole purpose here.\n  I am not arguing for the stimulus package. We know a stimulus of this \nnature, which is pure Keynesian economics, where you take money and you \nthrow it at the economy without any sort of discretion on how the money \nis going to be used in order to produce long-term productive forces in \nthe economy, which is simply saying to consumers: Here is the money, go \nout and spend it, hopefully that will raise the economy--we know under \nclassic Keynesian approaches, which is what this stimulus package is, \nthat the essence of that is to get it out the door, get those dollars \ninto the consumers' hands quickly. So every day, every week of delay \nonly aggravates the relative effectiveness of this stimulus exercise.\n  We also know that because of the way our Internal Revenue Service is \nstructured, the earliest they are going to be able to get these rebate \nchecks out the door, if we were to act today, this week, would probably \nbe May, middle of May; more likely that they are going to get out in \nJune and, according to the economists who testify around here and give \nus our counsel--for example, Dr. Orszag, head of the CBO, said that the \nimpact of those dollars going out the door, those $600 or $1,200 \nrebates under the House bill will not be felt probably until the late \nthird quarter of this year.\n\n  That is the fast track. Who knows what the late third quarter of this \nyear will bring. I hope it will bring some turnaround in the economy. \nAnd certainly with monetary policy being changed in this country, where \nyou are seeing significant reductions in the interest rates by the Fed, \nit is very likely we will see some uptick in our economy as we head \ninto the third and fourth quarter of this year. I certainly hope that \nwill occur; that the housing industry which has created this problem, \nas a result of having a housing bubble, will have begun to work its way \nthrough.\n  But in any event, we know that to delay this further, so we push \nthese stimulus events, such as giving people $600 to go out and spend, \nfarther and farther into the year, potentially into the Christmas \nseason or into next year, is not going to address the underlying \nproblem, which is the next two to three quarters, which look as if they \nare going to be extremely soft, potentially extraordinarily soft \nrelative to economic activity.\n  So action should be taken now. What has been suggested here to \naccomplish action--it is a very reasonable suggestion--is to take the \nHouse package, which was negotiated between the Speaker of the House, \nthe Republican leader in the House, and Secretary Paulson, add to it \nthe two or three things which there is consensus on over here, which is \nthe payment to seniors, payment to veterans, and correcting the illegal \nimmigration language, and passing it, and then move forward.\n  If you accept this concept that we should do this sort of Keynesian \nstimulus event, that is what we should do. I must, as a matter of \ndisclosure, say I have serious reservations about not only--I think the \nSenate package is terribly irresponsible, because it adds $44 billion \nto an agreed-to bipartisan agreement, but I also have problems with the \nunderlying package. Because, for me, I believe we do need to stimulate \nthe economy, but I think we need\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nto focus the dollars on the problem, and the problem is the credit \nlockdown that is occurring generally in the economy but that is \nspecifically being driven by the housing market problems. We know that \nfor the last few years there has been an expansion in lending in the \nhousing arena which was not supported by the underlying collateral or \nby the ability of people who were getting these loans to pay those \nloans under the terms of those loans. These were called subprime loans.\n  What happened was people were attracted into buying a house, which \nhad been built on speculation, and they were attracted in on an \ninterest rate on the mortgage on that house which was very low, with \nthe understanding that 2 or 3 years later that mortgage rate would jump \nfairly considerably.\n  Well, unfortunately in many instances what happened here was, we \nbuilt a lot of housing stock that could not be purchased, or if it was \npurchased, it was being purchased at costs which were below the real \nvalue of production, and on top of that, we were saying to people who \ndid not have the incomes necessary to support the higher interest rate \nwhich was going to hit them in 2 or 3 years, the 2 or 3 years being \nnow: You take the loan, we will worry about that later.\n  Well, the ``later'' is today. The bubble is bursting. People are \nbeing put under extreme stress because many people who bought these \nhomes cannot afford the increase on what is known as their ARM, their \nadjustable rate mortgage.\n  It is severe. In parts of this country it is extremely severe--in \nFlorida, Arizona, California. What is happening is you see a classic \nbubble where as the housing market starts to contract, lending \ngenerally starts to contract. Lenders who have these housing loans on \ntheir books, or who have sold these housing loans and cannot figure out \nhow to get out of their contracts, are now trying to figure out how to \nget their books in order, to rebuild their capital and restructure \nthemselves.\n  As a result, good loans in other areas that are being repaid are \nstarting to be chilled, as is new lending. Consequently, the entire \neconomy starts to lock up because it is hard to get loans for anything, \nespecially in distressed housing areas. The people who have these loans \nand live in these homes are finding themselves under the pressure of \nforeclosure. In many instances, these people are hard-working Americans \nwho can pay a reasonable rate, but because the adjustment is not \nreasonable--it is very high under ARM agreements--they are not able to \nmeet the obligations of the mortgage. So we should be focusing our \nefforts on that part of the economy.\n  I congratulate the Secretary of the Treasury because he has tried to \ndo that both through jawboning, the lending community, and by setting \nup the new HOPE proposal which has put a big chunk of money out there, \nover $100 billion, the purpose of which is to help people restructure \nthose loans so that people who can make their payments under the \noriginal loan agreement or something near to the original loan \nagreement, because they have good jobs and they can make their interest \npayments, aren't forced out of their homes as a result of a jump in \ntheir mortgage rate. Progress is being made there. Over 370,000 people \nhave been helped.\n  But the problem is so large that that is not necessarily going to \nstabilize the market and free up the lending machines in America. So \nadditional things should be done. For example, Senator Isakson of \nGeorgia has suggested we have a one-time focused tax credit given to \npeople who buy one of these homes in the inventory within the next year \nand that the home has been produced during this period of excess \nproduction and allow that to incentivize people to go back in the \nmarket and start to get this market going again. That is what we need \nto do.\n  There are other ideas. The expansion of the FHA is an idea which--I \ndon't quite understand why we haven't seen that bill come back to the \nSenate. It is in conference. It should be done soon. Increasing the \nlending limits on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is a dangerous step unless \nit is coupled with reforms necessary to make sure Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae have the underlying capital to support an expansion, but it \nis certainly something that should be considered. There are initiatives \nthat could be focused much more in a targeted way and would actually do \nsomething to correct the problem and would, in the long and short run, \nfrom my viewpoint, have a much better effect on the economy.\n  In addition, if we are going to try to stimulate the economy through \nclassic Keynesian activity, I am not too excited about that, but we \nought to put it on the productive side so we actually create a more \nefficient economy that is more productive and, therefore, capable of \nproducing more jobs as we move into the future. Our problem may be that \nwe don't have enough jobs as we move into the future. The way you get \naround that is to create an attitude in the marketplace so people are \nwilling to go out and invest, take risks, be entrepreneurs, and create \nmore jobs. There are ways to do that other than just giving people $600 \nto go out and spend arbitrarily, which they may spend on a product that \nis not even manufactured in the United States, in which case there has \nbeen no stimulus to the economy. If somebody buys a TV made in China \nwith their $600, that has no stimulus effect on our economy because the \ndollars end up in China.\n  It is important to understand that all this money comes from our \nchildren. We don't have a surplus to fund this stimulus package. \nTherefore, when we do stimulate, we need to do it in a much more \nfocused way which is going to strengthen our economy and is going to \naddress the underlying problem of the credit lockup which has been fed \nby the housing bubble. I hope we will take that up first. But, \nobviously, we will not take that approach. There is a significant \nmajority that is going to support a stimulus package which is Keynesian \nbased. So be it. But if we are going to do it, let's do it in the way \nwhich causes the least harm. The way to do that is to get it out the \ndoor quickly, have it be the package which essentially left the House, \nand not have the Senate throw in another $44 billion which we have to \nborrow from our children on top.\n  Those are my concerns.

Mr. President, our Nation needs to take a critical step \nto move our economy forward. We had a chance last night to make that \nhappen. We had a chance in the Senate to make that happen. We had a \nchance to pass a package that would provide relief to more Americans, \nwould put rebates in the hands of more taxpayers, would give checks to \nmore than 20 million seniors who were not in the House bill, would have \ntaken the opportunity to put money in the hands of 250,000 disabled \nveterans, would extend unemployment benefits for those who are looking \nto find work but cannot in this economy and who are on the verge of \nfinding themselves without unemployment compensation benefits, and \nwould provide important relief for businesses suffering and help those \nmost in need with the cost of heating their homes this winter.\n  Enough to stop the process, many of our Republican colleagues bucked \nthat opportunity. They said they wanted to deliver relief as quickly as \npossible, but when they had the chance to provide that relief to the \nmost Americans, far more than the House bill, they said no.\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\n  I listen to our colleagues and I ask myself: What is it that says so \nmany in our country--seniors on fixed incomes with increasing demands \nin their fuel and heating costs, those who still own their homes or \nthose who pay utility bills, rising prescription costs, so many \ndifferent elements of their lives, and they have fixed incomes, they \nhave worked a lifetime and find themselves with challenges they cannot \nmeet economically--why do those 20 million not deserve to be part of a \nstimulus package, especially when they will put that money right back \ninto the economy quickly, which is the whole purpose of a stimulus in \nthe first place? If we can have a stimulus that also helps a broad \nsection of our universe, those who have worked hard, played by the \nrules, helped build families and communities and now find themselves \nstruggling, why wouldn't we do that?\n  Why wouldn't we take care of disabled veterans and have them be part \nof helping meet their challenges? They have served their Nation with \nhonor and dignity and now find themselves challenged. Why wouldn't we \nhave them be part of a solution that also helps to stimulate the \neconomy?\n  For all this talk about quickness, it is also quickness in the \nability to make this happen in a way that will have a real impact on \nour economy but a real impact, also, in the lives of Americans who are \nstruggling. Far too many Americans have already suffered at the hands \nof an economy that is sliding backward. Far too many have seen their \nhomes taken away from them on the brink of foreclosure. Far too many \nhave been in search of work or have been waiting in vain for their \npaychecks to increase.\n  For those who have not yet felt the effects of an economy that is \nsputtering, they fear and worry, wondering when they will feel the \nsqueeze. That worry is understandable. The signs are less than good.\n  Last Friday, we learned that 17,000 jobs were lost in January alone--\nthe first monthly loss of jobs in more than 4 years. Growth slowed to a \nnear halt at the end of last year, coming in under 1 percent. We saw \nthe biggest increase in unemployment rates since after September 11.\n  We all overwhelmingly agree on the need to take action to stimulate \nour economy, and fast. It is wonderful to have come to that type of \nconsensus on the need. What we need is a genuine spirit of \nbipartisanship in the Senate to bring us forward to conclusion. We had \nthat opportunity yesterday.\n  Certainly, what the House did is a solid start. It would largely \nachieve what we would hope to see in a stimulus plan. But, as with many \nfirst attempts, there are clearly some significant holes. The House \nplan would get us almost but not quite where we should be. This was our \nchance--hopefully, we will revisit it--to get it right. We are not \ntalking about adding a load of new provisions, as some are implying. We \nare talking about making sensible changes to make sure we will have the \nmost benefit for those most in need, and at the same time, because we \nare providing a benefit for those who are most in need, we are helping \nachieve the goal we want: stimulating the economy in a way that we will \neither avoid a recession--although certainly Wall Street is telling us \nthey are convinced there is a recession--or at least narrow the time, \nthe scope, and the impact of a recession.\n  The value of any plan we consider should be based on one simple \nbenchmark: the number of people we can reach and how effectively we can \nput needed dollars into the economy. Based on that benchmark, the \nSenate clearly has a better plan. The economic stimulus package we have \nbefore us is a plan the Senate and the country can get behind. It will \nget money into the hands of people who have basic needs to cover, \npeople who will spend it immediately. That is the first goal of a \nstimulus.\n  Our plan puts rebates in the hands of 20 million seniors. It may not \nhave been intentional, but the fact is, the House plan leaves out \nmillions of seniors who are low income, whose primary source of income \nis Social Security. In my State of New Jersey, more than 1 million \nseniors are eligible for a rebate under the Senate plan. Under the \nHouse bill, they would not receive a dime. If we think there is no \neconomic link to including seniors, the fact is, seniors spend much \nmore of their income than any other age group. People over the age of \n65 are responsible for a full 14 percent of all consumer spending.\n  The bottom line is, a true stimulus package would help those who \nspend the most and are most in need. The Senate plan does just that.\n  The Senate plan also reaches another group that is excluded from the \nHouse bill--disabled veterans. Under our plan, we ensure that a quarter \nmillion disabled veterans who would not otherwise receive a rebate will \nget a check. When those veterans went to war, they never forgot whom \nthey were fighting for, and we cannot forget them now.\n  In several ways, the Senate plan puts resources toward where \neconomists agree they are most effective--extending unemployment \nbenefits. It isn't just common sense, because it helps those who are \nsuffering most. That is, of course, common sense, but it also gets the \nbest bang for the buck in economic terms. For every dollar we invest in \nextending unemployment benefits, we generate $1.64 in economic \nactivity.\n  This universe is known. They are out there. They are facing an \nimmediate challenge. They will have the resources in their hands much \nquicker than formulating a rebate check. It is another reason--\ntimeliness. Despite broad consensus that such a stimulus plan must \ninclude additional benefits for those who have been out of work for an \nextended period of time, such benefits are absent from the House bill.\n  There is no question unemployed workers are facing tough times. Long-\nterm unemployment is far higher than usual and nearly twice what it was \nwhen we were facing our last recession in the year 2001.\n  In New Jersey, more than 66,000 workers will be exhausting their \nunemployment benefits by June of this year, joining more than a million \nworkers nationwide facing long-term unemployment.\n  Last week, almost 70,000 new workers filed for unemployment \nbenefits--the highest level since Hurricane Katrina.\n  The need to address the economic hardships facing unemployed workers \nis real. We have seen in the past that unemployment benefits have \nstimulated the economy in times of hardship, and they should be part of \nthis plan this time around.\n  The Senate plan also includes important extensions of tax credits for \nenergy efficiency and the production of alternative energy, including \nsolar energy. Credits such as these help consumers purchase new \nappliances and greener sources of energy for their home. We also extend \nthe solar energy credit, which helps drive the purchase of solar \npanels. In New Jersey, which is only second to California in the number \nof solar installations, this has an enormous impact. This provision \ncould save more than 40,000 jobs, at a time when we see increasing job \nlosses, and it can do something to help stimulate the economy by the \npurchase of these products immediately--so save jobs, purchase \nproducts, make the investments and, at the same time, stem the tide of \nthe movement toward greater unemployment that we see in the country.\n  Finally, our plan provides needed relief to industries that are \nhurting and may have to lay off employees in the coming months. I am \npleased this package takes into account the unique challenges facing \nthe housing industry right now. We all know this is a sector of our \neconomy that is under incredible strains right now. The Senate plan \nwould ensure they are able to spread out their losses so hopefully we \ncan stop some of the bleeding in the housing sector and, in the \nprocess, prevent thousands from losing their jobs.\n  This stimulus package we have before us is not perfect. Some of us \nwould have liked to have included increased Medicaid payments to \nStates, which would have provided a needed boost to States struggling \nto provide health care. But the fact is, if we only pass the House \nversion, we would be falling far short.\n  All of what I have talked about--20 million seniors, a quarter \nmillion disabled veterans, the essence of how the provisions on the \nhousing components were included, the whole question of the universe of \nthe unemployed seeking to get a job, not being able to find it, and not \nhaving the resources to sustain\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\nthemselves and their families--all of that would not be in the plan. \nAll of that would not be in the plan.\n  We can do this. Of course, that is in addition to the rebates for \nboth single people and married couples and married couples who have \nchildren who are already a part of our package as well, building upon \nthe House proposals.\n  So let's pass a package that has the widest possible impact. Let's \npass a package that does not leave out 20 million seniors, that takes \ncare of a quarter million disabled veterans, and provides rebates to as \nmany Americans as possible.\n  That is acting wisely, and it can be done quickly. We need our \ncolleagues to join with us in the sense of urgency that exists, and to \nsay to those 20 million seniors, those quarter of a million veterans, \nthe millions who are unemployed: We stand with you as fellow Americans \nin this time of need in turning our economy around for all of us.\n  That was the choice we had yesterday. I hope we will have that choice \nagain. I hope the hearts of some will be softened in this process and \nthat they will cast a vote to move in a much different direction.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S759-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S759-S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WIRED FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I rise to speak for a few \nmoments about health care and to recognize the extraordinary work four \nMembers of this body have done to promote an integrated, interoperable \nhealth information technology infrastructure in this country. Senators \nKennedy and Enzi on the HELP Committee, Senator Hillary Clinton, and \nSenator Hatch, along with their talented staffs, have balanced a \ntremendous number of interests to put forward a very promising first \nstep in our long journey toward reforming our ailing health care \nsystem. I commend their tremendous effort in drafting the Wired Act. I \nlook forward to working to see strong health information technology \nlegislation passed in the Senate, in the House, and signed into law by \nthe President.\n  Adoption of health information technology is a vital part of saving \nlives and lowering costs in our health care system. The RAND \nCorporation estimates, in its most conservative estimation, that a \nnational, interoperable HIT system could save $81 billion per year. As \nSenators Kennedy, Enzi, Clinton, and Hatch are so aware, America's \nhealth care information infrastructure is decades behind where it \nshould be. We are losing billions and billions of dollars--I sound like \nCarl Sagan: billions and billions of stars--billions and billions of \ndollars to waste, inefficiency, and poor quality care as a result of \nthat failure. Ultimately, and most tragically, lives are lost to \npreventable medical errors because health care providers do not have \nadequate decision support for their determinations on medical \ntreatment, medication, and so forth.\n  I am an enthusiastic supporter of health IT as one mechanism of \nfixing our broken health care system. In fact, one of the first bills I \nintroduced as a Senator was the National Health Information Technology \nand Privacy Advancement Act, in which I proposed a national not-for-\nprofit entity with Presidential appointment subject to advice and \nconsent of the Senate, possessing rulemaking power to set national \nstandards under the Administrative Procedures Act, and with the ability \nto set licensing and access fees to raise capital for necessary \ninvestments outside the Federal budget process.\n  I still believe that is the best and most effective kind of \nauthority. I also recognize there are many good ideas out there. But \ntime is short. We cannot snap our fingers and be an IT-enabled health \ncare environment. Development, testing, buildout, and adoption will all \ntake time. We do not have much time. A tsunami of health care costs is \nsweeping down on us, inevitably, as baby boomers age and costs \nincrease.\n  The Comptroller General of the United States has warned us of what he \ncalled ``unprecedented stormy seas ahead that threaten to swamp the \nship of state.'' He testified that ``we've never seen anything like \nwhat we're headed into''--never in our history. Our present Federal \nhealth care liability, if nothing changes, is $34 trillion. That is a \n``34'' with 12 zeros behind it. It comprises the bulk of the $53 \ntrillion in Federal liabilities we are presently obliged to pay in \ncoming years. Now--now--is the time to get started in humane ways to \navert this fiscal crisis. Health IT is a baseline platform necessary to \neven try to respond humanely to the looming crisis.\n\n  Unfortunately, in moving toward our ultimate objective, we must \nrealize that health IT adoption alone will not stop the tidal wave of \nhealth care costs. As I think we all know, our health care system is \nbroken in more ways than one. Look at the signs of its failure.\n  The number of uninsured Americans is climbing and will soon hit 50 \nmillion. Despite the best doctors, the best nurses, the best equipment \nand procedures, and the best medical education in the world, as many as \n100,000 Americans are killed every year by unnecessary and avoidable \nmedical errors. Life expectancy, obesity rates, and infant mortality \nrates are a cause for national embarrassment compared to other \nindustrialized nations. The annual cost of the system exceeds $2 \ntrillion, and is expected soon to double.\n  We spend more of our country's GDP on health care than any other \nindustrialized country: 16 percent--double the average of the European \nUnion. More American families are bankrupted by health care costs than \nany other cause. There is more health care than steel in Ford cars. \nThere is more health care than coffee beans in Starbucks coffee.\n  Hospitals are broke. Doctors are furious. Paperwork is choking the \nsystem. This system is crying out for reform.\n  I believe that comprehensive restructuring of our health care system \nmust rapidly address three critical issues. As I have already said, the \nfirst is the development of a national, interoperable, secure health \ninformation technology infrastructure. But there are two other equally \nimportant issues: One, the American health care system must invest \nproperly in quality and prevention, promising areas where better care \nactually lowers cost; and, two, the way we pay for all this, the way we \npay for health care, sends perverse price signals that drive market \nbehavior away from the public interest, that drive behavior away from \nwhat we want.\n  So these are the three critical issues at the core of the health care \ncrisis in this country--inadequate health information technology, \ninadequate attention to quality and prevention, and a perverse price \nsignal system.\n  Let us look first at how improved quality of care can lower cost. \nThat intersection of where improved quality of care and lower cost \nintersect should be our national holy grail in health care. The \nKeystone Project in Michigan shows how effective this can be. It went \ninto a significant number of Michigan ICUs--not all of them but a \nsignificant number--to improve quality and reduce, for instance, line \ninfections and respiratory complications. Between March 2004 and June \n2005, the project saved 1,578 lives--in just that year and 2 months. It \nsaved 81,000-plus patient days that otherwise would have been spent in \nthe hospital, saving over $156 million. It is a win-win.\n  The Rhode Island Quality Institute in my State took this model \nstatewide, with every hospital participating, and we are already seeing \nthe number of hospital-acquired infections declining, and the costs \ndeclining as well. The same principles can be applied to prevention, as \nwell as to quality improvement.\n  Local efforts around the country, such as the Rhode Island Quality \nInstitute, Washington State's Puget Sound Health Care Alliance, and \nUtah's Health Information Network, are leading the way. We need, as a \nnation, to get behind these State and local efforts. As many Members of \nthe Chamber know, any good business needs to do research and \ndevelopment and these local efforts are the R on which we can base \nreform of our broken health care system.\n  All across America, in local communities, where people know and trust \neach other, the reforms of our system are being dreamed, negotiated, \ntested, and implemented. We need to nourish this effort, and I thank my \n15 bipartisan cosponsors for supporting a small grant program I \nproposed to do just that.\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\n  Now, consider why this quality reform is not happening spontaneously \nall over the country if those big savings are there waiting to be \ntapped. Think of Michigan: In 15 months, in one State, with not even \nall of the intensive care units participating, $156 million was saved. \nA report out of Pennsylvania showed they spent over $2 billion a year \non hospital-acquired infections.\n  Why is quality reform not happening everywhere? Well, primarily \nbecause the economics of health care punish you if you try. For \nexample, a group of hospitals in Utah began following guidelines of the \nAmerican Thoracic Society for treating community-acquired pneumonia. \nSignificant complications fell from 15.3 percent to 11.6 percent. \nInpatient mortality--a nice way of saying fewer people died--fell from \n7.2 percent to 5.3 percent, and the resulting cost savings exceeded \n$500,000 per year.\n  Sounds like another success story. But the net operating income of \nthe facilities participating dropped by over $200,000 a year because \nthe treatment that resulted in the healthier patients was reimbursed at \n$12,000 per case less.\n  In Rhode Island, we saw the same thing. When we started the ICU \nreform, I talked to the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, and they \nestimated a $400,000 cost per intensive care unit, but as much as $8 \nmillion in savings--a 20-to-1 payback. I said: Why not go for this? \nThey said: You don't understand. All the savings go to the insurers. \nFor us, this is $400,000 cash out of our pockets, and potentially $8 \nmillion out of our top line in revenues.\n  Name a business that will sensibly invest $400,000 out of its cash to \nlose $8 million in revenues. With reimbursement incentives like those, \nit is no wonder reform is such an uphill struggle.\n\n  We are at such a primitive stage in developing cost-saving, quality \nmeasures, and the economics work against us, so we have to tackle this \nnow. An idea that will get us started: In my Improved Medical Incentive \nAct, I propose that State medical societies and specialty groups be \nallowed to present ``best practices'' to their local State health \ndepartments. If they do, and a Health Department determines this is a \nbest practice that will save money and save lives, then two \nconsequences follow. CMS would be obliged to create a pricing \ndifferential favoring those best practices, and private insurers would \nbe forbidden to deny claims for services consistent with the approved \nbest practices. If people want to object, fine. Go to the hearing. \nLet's do this in a regular fashion.\n  The determination of what gets paid for in our health care system \nright now is made in back rooms of the claims denial operations of \ninsurance companies in scattered fashion, largely without oversight or \nreview and laboring under heavy conflict of interest. If we move that \ndetermination toward proper formal hearings, we can expand statewide \nbest practices in a way that the economics will support.\n  Our health care problem is serious, it is vast, and it is looming. \nHealth care IT is a crucial instrument in the health care reform \ntoolbox, but it is not an end in itself. To fully realize its benefits, \nit must be coupled with a focus on quality improvement and a \nrealignment of payment incentives. These three elements must move \nforward together.\n  Let me emphasize in conclusion as energetically as I can: The time is \nnow. Time is wasting now. The need is urgent. It may not feel like it, \nbut solving this problem with system reforms such as this will take \nseveral years. If we don't start now, when the fiscal tsunami hits, we \nwill be left with only fiscal solutions to the problem. It is immediate \nones but unpleasant ones, including massive tax hikes or massive \nbenefit cuts. If we are standing here, and if I am standing here 5 or \n10 years from now having that tragic choice in front of me, well, shame \non us if in our folly, in our improvidence, we were too intellectually \nlazy and too bereft of basic foresight to have taken the steps now that \ncould have averted that sickening choice.\n  As my colleagues know, we are seeing the beginnings of this debate \nnow. The Bush administration has squandered its opportunity for \nmeaningful health information technology reform, has squandered its \nopportunity for meaningful quality reform, and has squandered its \nopportunity for meaningful reimbursement design reform. Now, in the \n2009 budget the President presented, he is proposing deep cuts in \nMedicare. We have to get ahead of this problem. This is a wake-up call. \nThe time is now.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to get this important work done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 98 years ago today, William Dickson Boyce \ncreated one of this country's longest standing and most important \ncommunity organizations--the Boy Scouts of America. Today, we join \nScouting groups across the country and Ohio--Toledo and Cincinnati, \nChillicothe and Lakewood--in celebrating Boy Scout Day.\n  The Boy Scouts of America has a rich tradition of teaching valuable \nskills to the young men of this country. The values which Scouting \ninstills--fairness, honor, courage, and respect for others--prepare \nyoung men to serve their families and their Nation.\n  There are more than 3 million boys in the Scouting program, and in \nthe past year alone Scouts have earned nearly 2 million merit badges \nand completed more than 33 million hours of community service.\n  As an Eagle Scout, I recognize the hard work involved in Scouting and \ncommend the dedication and commitment of Boy Scouts and the Scouting \nmovement across our country. The journey to Eagle is sometimes \ndifficult, often fun, occasionally disappointing, and always rewarding. \nMy time as a Boy Scout, in the end, provided me with opportunities to \ndevelop leadership and organizational skills, helped me to clarify and \narticulate my guiding principles, and instilled a commitment to public \nservice.\n  The emphasis on community service I learned with Troop 110 in \nMansfield, OH, has strongly influenced my lifelong commitment to public \nservice. The memories and lessons of Camp Avery Hand and Philmont Scout \nRanch, of success and failure in earning merit badges, will always \nremain with me.\n  The Scout Law is a framework that continues to inspire my work to \nthis day:\n\n       A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, \n     Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, \n     and Reverent.\n\n  I am a proud supporter of the Boy Scouts of America. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in celebrating Boy Scout Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S760-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S760-S762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, the United States should not be playing\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\nRussian roulette with our Nation's economy and our Nation's future. We \nneed to craft trade policies that deliver the long-term results we \nneed, not just the short-term profits which a few multinational \ncorporations want and which those multinational corporations \nincessantly lobby this institution to get.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President advocated signing \nmore free-trade deals. Given where past trade deals have led this \ncountry, the President's dogged pursuit of outdated trade deals would \nbe perplexing if it weren't simply more of the same and par for the \ncourse. When it comes to trade, it is often the case that ideology \ntrumps outcomes, and it is always the case that special interests trump \nAmerican interests. Looking at where our Nation is headed, advocating \ncommon sense is a luxury we can no longer afford. We need to confront \nthe problems our lax trade policies have engendered, and we need to do \nit now.\n  We are running a huge trade deficit. When I was elected to the House \nof Representatives in 1992, our trade deficit was $38 billion. In 2007, \nit exceeded $800 billion. The first President Bush said that a billion-\ndollar trade deficit translated into 13,000 jobs. Do the math and see \nwhat damage these trade deficits--from $38 billion a decade and a half \nago to over $800 billion today--have caused us. We are bleeding jobs, \nand we are letting dangerous products cross our borders and land in the \nhands of our families and children.\n  When we write trade deals that favor gains for multinational \ncorporations over evenhanded competition for both trading partners, we \nshouldn't be surprised when U.S.-based companies are crippled. Our \ncurrent trade policy betrays our Nation's middle class, it cripples \nAmerica's small business--especially manufacturing--and it destroys \ncommunities across the country.\n  I was recently in Tiffin, OH--a community of about 20,000 people \nabout an hour from Toledo in northwest Ohio--talking with workers from \nAmerican Standard. American Standard is a company that makes plumbing \nfixtures and that most Americans are familiar with. These workers' jobs \nhave recently gone to Mexico and China. A venture capitalist--in this \ncase, Bain Capital out of Boston, MA--came in and bought the company, \nshut it down, and moved the production overseas. Many workers lost much \nof their pension and their health care that they had worked for decade \nafter decade. Many of these workers are in their fifties and won't be \nable to find jobs in Tiffin that pay anything close to the money they \nhad earned. Many of them lost their pensions, their health care, while \nenriching Bain Capital to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.\n  These are not trivial matters. These are workers in Ohio and across \nthe country, workers who are often in small towns and don't have the \noption of finding comparable jobs anyplace nearby to support their \nfamilies and ultimately to benefit from the pension and the health care \nthey have earned--they have earned.\n  Free trade is a dangerous myth--a false idol. Trade has never been \nfree. Even the most basic of barter systems have been guided by rules. \nToday's free-trade agreements are ripe with rules, rules that are \nclearly producing the wrong results for our Nation--deficits, job \nloss, dangerous imports, and compromised manufacturing capabilities.\n\n  Again, there are rules. The North American Free Trade Agreement was \nsold to us a decade and a half ago simply by saying this will reduce \ntariffs and open markets in Mexico and in Canada for U.S. goods. But it \nwas 2,000 pages. So it wasn't simply a free-trade agreement; it was a \ntrade agreement replete with rules that supported and helped those \nspecial interests--special interest investors and companies that wanted \nto privatize, that wanted to outsource, that wanted to use these rules \nto make more money for the companies at the expense of workers in \nMexico, in Canada, and in Gallipolis, Portsmouth, and Cleveland, OH.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, who has been \na leader on trade policy. He even wrote a book called ``Take This Job \nand Ship It'' about trade and is proposing that we take a far more \npragmatic approach to U.S. trade policy, one based on achieving \npositive results and on accountability. Thanks to his leadership, we \nhave legislation that would focus trade policy away from the blind \nadherence to outdated trade agreements and toward policies that \nincrease U.S. trade, that bolster U.S. jobs, that lift our communities, \nand that will reinforce U.S. manufacturing in the days and years ahead, \nand toward a trade policy that builds our Nation's middle class.\n  His bill establishes concrete benchmarks for trade bills. It is a \ncommonsense idea, a prescription for U.S. success in a global trade \narena that will help us bring back the manufacturing base in this \ncountry. We should pass this bill and also take immediate steps to \naddress the dysfunction that has infiltrated virtually every aspect of \nour trade relationship with China.\n  China is manipulating its currency, it is low-balling the price of \nits exports through Government subsidies, it is sending our Nation \ndangerous toys and contaminated food, it is generating unheard of \nlevels of pollution, and the list goes on and on.\n  Last month, New Page, a paper manufacturing company based in \nMiamisburg, a town in southwest Ohio, announced it was shutting down \nplants in Wisconsin, in Maine, and in my State of Ohio, in the city of \nChillicothe, once the State capital.\n  Heavily Government-subsidized Chinese paper producers account for 50 \npercent of the world's market. Fifty percent of the world's paper \nproducing is in China and is heavily Government subsidized in China. It \nhas meant the loss of jobs in places such as Chillicothe and Dayton and \nall over my State and this country. It is not free trade. The Chinese \nhave benefited. And when I say the Chinese, I don't mean Chinese \nworkers, I mean the Communist Party of China, the Government, the \nPeople's Liberation Army, and too often U.S. investors who are so often \ncomplicit with the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army and \nthe Chinese Government. Think about that. It is not free trade with \nChina; it is a wreck.\n  These factors, in addition to low wages, in addition to unsafe \nworking conditions, and the absence of worker rights have contributed \nto the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs and our country's \nreliance on imports.\n  What does that mean for the future? When I look around this Chamber, \nI see seven young pages, high school students who work here--and \nseveral on the other side, too, whom I can't see; I apologize--and I \nthink about what their world is going to look like in 20 years. Are we \ngoing to look back and say: Why did we give away our country? Why did \nwe sacrifice our national security and our economic security and \noutsource all these jobs and outsource all this wealth and watch a \nmiddle class decline? Is that what we are going to look back on in 20 \nyears and say? Why did we let this happen? How did we let this happen?\n  Madam President, restoring sanity to our trade relationship with \nChina should be an immediate, No. 1 domestic and international priority \nfor this Nation.\n  Last week I was joined by seven freshmen colleagues affirming that \nour trade policy should focus on China; that is, our trade priority. We \nneed to imagine 20 years from now, as I said, what is manufacturing in \nour country going to look like? This country's wealth--much of it--has \nbeen dependent on manufacturing, on making everything from newsprint to \nairplanes, being able to manufacture and create wealth in small towns \nand large cities alike.\n  Instead of littering our Nation's path with more flawed trade \nagreements, we should say: Time out. No more trade agreements. Look \nback, establish this commission we have discussed that will look at \nboth parties, both houses, look back at what our trade policy--what \nNAFTA, what CAFTA, PNTR with China, what our other bilateral smaller \ntrade agreements have done, what they have done to our country, what \nhave they done for our country, make that analysis and then fix those \ntrade agreements and move forward.\n  It is not in the Nation's best interests to rely on other nations for \nour defense infrastructure, for our transportation infrastructure, for \nour industrial infrastructure, for creating the wealth in our \ncommunities that manufacturing does. In this country, we do\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\nthe best research and development in the world. Yet multinational \ncorporations often take that research and development and do the \nproduction in other countries.\n  Sure, there are great jobs in research and development. It is good \nfor our country. We should continue to give tax incentives for that \nresearch and development, but it is more than that. It is also what do \nyou do afterwards, in commercializing, in producing and manufacturing \nthose products the research and development has generated? That is the \nlarger number of jobs, that is the greater part of the wealth creation, \nthat is what is essential to providing the goods and services in our \ncommunities for police and fire and education and all of what that \nmeans.\n  We cannot simply continue to do the R and then farm out the \nproduction to exploit low-wage workers, exploit the consumer product \nand food safety net. Because that is what happens. When this research \nand development is done in the United States, and the production is \nmoved to China, it is moved there to exploit low-wage labor, and it is \nmoved there as a way, frankly, in many cases, or at least it becomes \nthat, that we end up with inferior, less safe, less high-quality \nproducts back into our country.\n  We need to take responsibility for the consequences of our inaction \nwhen it comes to trade policy and take responsibility for the mistake \nwe have made in formulating trade policy. We need to do it now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar.)

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that in \naddition to myself, Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, and Senator Grassley, \nSenator Stevens be added as an original sponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, a key provision in the Senate Finance \nCommittee package was an extension of unemployment benefits. This is \none of the most effective ways to stimulate the company. These benefits \ncan be distributed quickly, and they are likely to be spent.\n  This is not a matter of ideology; it is matter of economics. And a \nbroad range of economists agrees with this. Even Alan Greenspan, hardly \na liberal Democrat, has testified in favor of expanding unemployment \nbenefits during periods of economic slowdown. Expanding unemployment \nbenefits works, and this is a matter of basic compassion.\n  The long-term unemployed are among those Americans with the most \npressing needs. Unfortunately, there are well over a million Americans \nwho are expected to exhaust their regular unemployment benefits between \nJanuary and June of this year. They need our help. If we extend the \nsame assistance to them that we have to the long-term unemployed in the \npast, our entire economy will benefit.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, the unemployment insurance provision of \nthe Senate Finance Committee package be added as an amendment to the \nbill currently before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I simply \nnote that when unemployment exceeds a certain level, there is reason to \nextend it, but this Nation's unemployment now is under 5 percent which \nis deemed to be full employment. There is no trigger attached to this \nproposal.\n  In a State such as New Hampshire where unemployment is at 3.6 \npercent, an extension might have an opposite effect. Rather than \nstimulating the economy, it might undermine the ability to create more \nproductivity. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the State of Nevada is 5 percent, as is \nMichigan and a number of other States. It would not apply to every \nState but some States. I am disappointed my friend objected to the \nrequest, but I understand.\n  The stimulus package I introduced earlier this week included a $1 \nbillion increase for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or \nLIHEAP. I commend my colleagues, my friend Jack Reed, Bernie Sanders, \nSusan Collins, and a number of others, for their strong advocacy for \nLIHEAP and for the broad support that they have helped build for the \nprogram. They know LIHEAP is critical for many Americans who otherwise \nwill be forced to choose between heating their homes, putting food on \nthe table, or buying medicine or gas for their car. These are people \nwho will spend any additional assistance and help stimulate the \neconomy.\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, the LIHEAP provision in the previously \nwithdrawn first-degree amendment be added as an amendment to the bill \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I note \nthat I strongly supported LIHEAP and have supported it on numerous \noccasions and continue to support its expansion. I happen to believe it \nshould be paid for. I don't think we should pass on to our children and \nour grandchildren the cost of the oil bills today. We should expand \nLIHEAP, but as part of expanding LIHEAP, we should offset that with an \noffsetting savings somewhere else. So at this time I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am on my best behavior today, so I am \nnot going to dwell on the fact that the war has cost us about $800 \nbillion, all borrowed money. But I understand the objection to this \nLIHEAP amendment.\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I also am on \nmy best behavior today, I can assure the majority leader. I have other \nunanimous consent requests I wish to make, but I am reserving my \nenergy.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senate Finance Committee package \ncontained tax incentives to encourage the development of alternative \nand renewable sources of energy, as well as investments in energy \nefficiency.\n  Senator Cantwell has been a champion of these provisions. There is \nnot enough I can say to commend her for her good work. It is \noutstanding.\n  These tax incentives make sense from the standpoint of our economy \nand our Nation. They would create jobs for Americans and, in the \nprocess, they would reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  I have seen the importance of developing alternative renewable \nsources of energy in Nevada. The geothermal industry has taken off in \nmy State, providing hundreds of jobs for Nevadans and increasing \nNevada's energy independence.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, the energy tax provisions in the Senate \nFinance Committee package be added as an amendment to the bill \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I am very \nsympathetic to the work of the Senator from Washington. She does \nexceptional work. As a practical matter, I am always interested in \nareas where we can develop energy and alternative energy, but that is \nnot part of a stimulus package.\n  These tax credits would essentially not kick in for literally years, \nin many instances, and are not going to do a great deal of stimulating \nand should not be added to the package. So on behalf of the leadership, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Finance Committee, rightfully so, by \nan overwhelming bipartisan vote, agreed to include a provision in this \nlegislation that is designed to help homeowners avoid foreclosures by \nallowing them to refinance. The President of the United States proposed \nthis in his State of the Union Address, and this proposal has been \nchampioned by my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry. It also would add $10 million in bonds that \nStates could use to help address the serious housing crisis facing our \ncountry. They can sell homes that are in foreclosure or refinance \nloans.\n  I commend Senator Kerry for getting this proposal added in the \nFinance Committee. It makes tremendous sense. I suggest it would be the \nright thing to do. The President supports it--or said he did in the \nFinance Committee--and I hope we can get agreement on it.\n  I therefore ask, Madam President, that, notwithstanding the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, the mortgage revenue bond provision in the \nFinance Committee package be added as an amendment to the bill \ncurrently before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think \nthis proposal makes a great deal of sense, but in the name of the \nSpeaker of the House, I would have to object. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I don't know if there is an economist who \ndisagrees--there could be; I don't know who it would be--that the best \nway to stimulate the economy is to get money into the hands of those \nwho will spend it immediately and the people who need it the most. That \nis why, according to more than one economic study, the absolutely best \nway to stimulate the economy is to increase food stamp benefits. \nAccording to that study, for every $1 allocated to food stamps, \neconomic activity is increased by $1.84. That is the best thing we \ncould do. It is the best bang for the buck.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, the underlying bill be modified by adding \na provision that would appropriate $5 billion to increase nutritional \nassistance for the rest of the calendar year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Again, this package was worked out between the House \nRepublican leadership, the House Democratic leadership, and the \nadministration, and basically the purpose here is to move the package \nquickly. That was not part of the package. Therefore, on behalf of the \nleadership, I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that there is now \n20 minutes allocated, 10 minutes for me and 10 minutes for Senator \nMcConnell; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, 2 weeks ago, the majority of Senate \nRepublicans was quick to endorse the House stimulus bill with no \nrevisions, even though they knew it was inadequate and that the Senate \nhad an obligation to improve the bill and to deliver a timely, \ntemporary, and targeted bill by Presidents Day weekend. We have done \nthat. Senate Democrats, and with the help of a number of Republicans in \nthe Senate, joined to move forward. It is our responsibility to pass \nthe strongest bill we can, and we have done that.\n  If we had listened to the advice of the House, we would have 21\\1/2\\ \nmillion seniors with nothing out of this package. If we had listened to \nthe advice of the House, 250,000 disabled veterans and their widows \nwould have been left behind. We have been able to make the House bill \nbetter, and I am pleased with that result.\n  There is much more to do, and that is why we focused today, as we did \nfor a few minutes, on what is not being done. But I think we all have \nto acknowledge that the House bill has been improved significantly. We \nhave gotten the President to agree the House bill was not perfect. I \nhave said before that I wish there had been another vote. There wasn't, \nand I accept that. But I think we have to look at the good work that \nhas been done.\n  I can't leave this floor without expressing my appreciation to the \nFinance Committee, led by Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. They \nhave been champions of the American people. The American people have \nwitnessed the last couple of weeks a lot of disagreements here on the \nSenate floor. We have had two difficult issues, the Senate stimulus \npackage and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We are basically \nabout ready to finish the stimulus package, but we will be back and do \nmore to help stimulate the economy.\n  Today, though, I think we should feel good about what we have done. \nFifty-nine of us believe the country needs an economic stimulus, and we \nvoted that way yesterday. Everybody in the Senate, I believe--and I am \nconfident, with rare exception, that it is true--we cannot have an \neconomic stimulus package and leave behind senior citizens and our \nwounded veterans, and we haven't done that. We have picked them up. I \nam confident we will do better.\n  I extend my appreciation to the distinguished Republican leader. It \nhas been difficult to work through all this. And while it didn't work \nthrough the way I wanted it, it worked through a lot better than if we \nhad accepted the House bill. I feel better today. The American people \nare going to be better off as a result of the work done in the Finance \nCommittee by Senators Baucus, Grassley, and the entire Finance \nCommittee.\n  Madam President, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me say to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, we are on the verge here of an important bipartisan \naccomplishment. The American people looked with incredulity to a press \nconference a couple of weeks ago among the Speaker of the House, the \nHouse Republican leader, and the Secretary of the Treasury indicating \nthey had reached an agreement for a stimulus package that would be \ntimely, targeted and, as the Speaker said, temporary. We have now, \nafter going through the legislative process here in the Senate, been \nable to reach an important bipartisan agreement that will be supported \nby the majority leader, myself, Senator Baucus,\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\nSenator Grassley, and Senator Stevens, who was the principal cosponsor \nof an amendment I had indicated a couple of days ago we would offer.\n  This is the Senate at its finest, recognizing that this was an \nopportunity to demonstrate to the public that we could come together, \ndo something important for the country, and do it quickly. The \nlegislative process is frequently time consuming, complicated, \nlaborious, and slow, and I think we have demonstrated today, or will \ndemonstrate shortly, when we cast this vote, that we were able to put \naside our differences, not only here in the Senate but with our \ncolleagues in the House, as well, and the administration, to make an \nimportant statement that we are concerned about the slowing of our \neconomy and we want to do something significant about it very quickly. \nSo I think this is a fine day, a great day for the Senate, and \nsomething we can all feel good about.\n  I again commend the majority leader for his spirit in working this \nout, and congratulate the Senate and both parties for what I think will \nbe perceived by the American people as a significant accomplishment for \nour country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want the record to be clear that I \nfully support swift enactment of an economic stimulus measure. Having \nspent the past weeks and months traveling across America, I have heard \nfirst-hand of the difficulties facing so many hardworking families. I \nam pleased that the majority and the minority have finally reached an \nagreement to allow us to improve the underlying bill to address the \nneeds of seniors and disabled veterans, and to close a loophole in the \nbill concerning the distribution of rebates. Now, we will be able to \npass this measure today.\n  The bill pending before the Senate--a compromise product between the \nHouse and the President--is not perfect. Certainly we can all agree on \nthe important yet limited improvements I mentioned such as ensuring our \nsenior citizens and disabled veterans are not left out of this stimulus \npackage. While perhaps none of us will be fully satisfied with the \nfinal measure, we simply cannot afford to include every member's wish \nlist in this package. I believe the measure we will send to the \nPresident is one that almost all of us can and will support.\n  Beyond the short-term economic fix being debated, we must also \nconsider the best long-term economic approach and to take action \naccordingly. In my judgement, there is no question that Congress must \nreign in wasteful porkbarrel spending. We need to make permanent the \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts at our soonest opportunity and avoid a crippling \ntax increase for millions of Americans. We should eliminate the AMT, \nthe poster child for the notion of unintended consequences, which \nthreatens to affect millions of middle class families. These are steps \nwe should take now to end the uncertainty facing American families and \nbusinesses.\n  America has the second highest corporate tax rate in the world. \nCutting corporate taxes will spur economic growth immediately and over \nthe long run. We need to allow first year expensing of technology and \nequipment investment for businesses, which would further simplify our \ncode and provide incentives for capital expenditure. We must also work \nto reform and make permanent the research and development tax credit so \nthat our businesses can do what they do best--create jobs and expand \ninnovation--without the continued uncertainty of the whims of Congress. \nThese are important and necessary steps toward reforming our tax code \nto make it simpler, flatter, and fairer for all Americans.\n  Clearly, we have much ahead of us to do and the American public is \ncounting on us to fulfill the jobs that they sent us here to do. I, for \none, have heard the voters. They want us to work together to stimulate \nand strengthen our economy and promote our Nation's long-term economic \ngrowth. Let's finally pass the economic stimulus plan and send it to \nthe President. After all, time is of the essence if this effort is to \nbe successful. The American public is waiting.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will support the bipartisan stimulus \npackage today. It is better than doing nothing at all but not as good \nas we might have made it.\n  I commend the Finance Committee chair and ranking member, as well as \nour majority leader, Senator Reid, for their untiring efforts to make \nimprovements to the House-passed stimulus package. In the last few \nweeks, there has been a broad consensus that a properly crafted fiscal \nstimulus package could help ease the economic downturn we are \nexperiencing. The measure passed by the House was a step in the right \ndirection, and the amendment we will adopt today will improve on the \nHouse bill. Notably, the bipartisan amendment will ensure that 20 \nmillion lower income seniors who rely primarily on Social Security will \nbe included in the tax rebate program, and it will do the same for a \nquarter of a million wounded veterans with lower incomes.\n  I regret that a particularly effective and desperately needed \nprovision from the Finance Committee proposal was dropped from this \nagreement; namely, an extension of unemployment insurance benefits for \nthe long-term unemployed. Not only was that provision the right thing \nto do to cushion the impact of this economic downturn on those who have \nbeen out of work for half a year or more, but we know from past \nexperience that such a provision was one of the most effective ways to \nstimulate the economy. Another provision we should have included in \nthis package, expansion of food stamps benefits, also shares those \nattributes. I very much hope that soon Congress will act on those two \nideas.\n  Finally, I was disappointed that little or no effort was made to \nensure the cost of this stimulus package would not add to our already \nmountainous public debt that will be borne by our children and \ngrandchildren. Make no mistake; there is no free lunch here. Even \nthough no offsetting savings were included in this package to defray \nits cost, the bill will be paid--if not by this generation, then \ncertainly by coming generations. Our children and grandchildren will \npay for our stimulus package.\n  Congress owes those future generations some consideration. We should \nreturn to the fiscally responsible budgeting of the 1990s, when we \nactually balanced the Federal books and began to pay down the Federal \ndebt. We need not do so in a way that hurts the present economy, but \npaying for this stimulus package over the next 5 years or so would not \nundermine current economic growth, and Congress should consider such an \napproach.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, for too long the Federal Government has \nstood idle as Michigan's unemployment rate has soared, 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost, and working families have felt the \nsqueeze of the rising costs of energy, health care and food. I am glad \nthat we are moving today on these short-term measures to stimulate our \nlagging economy--heaven knows we can't afford not to. But there is more \nwe must do to fight for American jobs, and I am disappointed that the \nRepublican Leadership blocked our attempt to significantly improve this \npackage. I look forward to addressing the shortcomings of this bill \nwith additional legislation in the near future.\n  At a minimum, we need to pass the provisions that were in the \namendment offered yesterday that was based on the work done by the \nSenate Finance Committee. Unfortunately, that amendment with bipartisan \nsupport fell only 1 vote shy of the 60 it needed to overcome the \nRepublican filibuster. I am hopeful that under new circumstances we can \nget those provisions done.\n  The Finance Committee amendment would have made this a much better \npackage for stimulating the economy. Extending unemployment insurance, \nraising the cap on mortgage revenue bonds to help keep people in their \nhomes, and funding the LIHEAP program to help people heat their homes \nare all timely provisions that offer temporary assistance that \nprecisely targets the people who need this help the most. Putting money \ninto their hands is the most effective way to kick-start our economy in \nthe shortest time possible.\n  There are a number of reasons it is important that we ultimately \napprove the extension of much-needed unemployment insurance, which most \neconomists agree is one of the most effective ways to stimulate the \neconomy, dollar for dollar. Workers who receive these unemployment \nbenefits--which could\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\nreach them in as few as 2 weeks from enactment of the stimulus--are \nlikely to spend them quickly, making this one of the fastest ways to \ninfuse money into our economy in the shortterm. In my own State of \nMichigan, about 145,000 residents have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits and can't find jobs. Between now and June, 72,000 more people \nwill face the same difficult situation. Extending unemployment \ninsurance during times of recession is nothing new. In the past 30 \nyears, the Congress has acted three times to establish temporary \nextended unemployment benefits, each time during a recession. Studies \nindicate that extending unemployment insurance during tough times \nprovides the best return of economic benefits compared to other \nstimulus options, and this money can be distributed within weeks. \nExtending unemployment insurance is essential to provide much-needed \nsupport to those who have lost their jobs and are struggling to reenter \nthe job market.\n  To achieve success, the second economic stimulus package now being \nformulated must also help families stand up against the intensifying \nwave of housing foreclosures. More than 89,000 Michigan home loans are \ncurrently in foreclosure and over 40,000 subprime loans have scheduled \nrate increases this year. Across the Nation, too many families are at \nrisk of losing their homes, with devastating consequences. Beyond the \npersonal impact, rampant foreclosures can decimate communities. Home \nownership is a central tenet of the American dream, but with the number \nof home foreclosures increasing at an alarming rate, that dream is \nslipping away from Americans across the country.\n  I am pleased that the bill we will pass today will increase the loan \nlimits for the Federal Housing Administration, Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae. These are modest moves in the midst of a full-blown crisis, but it \nis better than nothing.\n  I am hopeful that soon we can also pass the measure included in the \nFinance Committee amendment that would have raised the volume cap on \nState-issued tax-exempt mortgage-revenue bonds by $10 billion. The \nproceeds from these bonds would allow State and local agencies to \nprovide additional mortgage refinancing options to homeowners so that \nthey could keep their homes. It is critical that we help prevent the \nfurther deepening of the foreclosure crisis, keep families in their \nhomes, and protect neighborhoods from the blight which results from \nlarge numbers of vacant houses.\n  On a positive note, I am glad that we have adopted the Senate's \nimprovements to what we are calling a ``tax rebate'' program. This bill \nwill give a tax credit to be sent out as quickly as possible to provide \nfast cash for many struggling families, thereby ameliorating their \nhardship at the same time as giving a boost to spending. Today's bill \nis a package of inclusion, one that recognizes the importance of giving \nour Nation's aging citizens and disabled veterans their share of \nstimulus support. These tax rebates will give $600 to individual \ntaxpayers with at least $3,000 of qualifying income, or $1,200 for \nmarried couples filing jointly, and an additional $300 for each \nqualifying child. A prudent stimulus package should not neglect the \nelderly and disabled veterans, and the tax rebate program we have \nadopted includes social security and disabled veterans' benefits as \nqualifying income for the purpose of determining eligibility for the \nrebate, thereby putting money directly into the hands of some of our \nnation's neediest some 20 million seniors and 250,000 veterans. Not \nonly will this help these folks attend to their families' most basic \nneeds, but it will further stimulate the economy for the betterment of \nthe whole Nation.\n  I am also pleased this package includes tax provisions to stimulate \nsmall businesses, which are the heart of America's economic strength. \nIt allows small businesses to double the amount they can expense, \nmeaning immediately write off, their taxes for certain capital \ninvestments made in 2008 from $125,000 to $250,000. It also provides \nimmediate tax relief for all businesses to invest in new machinery and \nequipment by speeding up depreciation provisions, so that firms can \nwrite off an additional 50 percent depreciation in the first year.\n  However, given the importance of small businesses' contribution to \nthe economy and to job creation, much more needs to be done to help \nsmall businesses find access to credit in this slowing economy. For \ninstance, as a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I have \njoined some of my colleagues in calling for a temporary reduction of \nfees on small business loans to help reverse the recent decline in SBA \nguaranteed lending to small businesses. I think a temporary reduction \nin the fees charged to borrowers will put more money in the pockets of \nsmall businesses by lowering their monthly loan payments. Equally \nimportant is reducing the fees SBA charges lenders because we need to \ntake steps to make lending to small businesses more profitable and thus \nmore appealing so that banks will continue to be willing to make these \nimportant loans.\n  We should also make a one-time enhancement of $10 million to the SBA \nmicroloan program's revolving fund to increase credit availability for \nvery small business concerns, especially those who face additional \nbarriers to economic opportunity. The SBA's microloan program provides \nfunding for small-scale business loans, which banks are typically \nreluctant to service.\n  When the economy is slowing, the Federal Government should be doing \nall it can to keep America's small businesses viable so that they can \ncontinue to be the economic engine of our economy that they have been \nin the past. I hope some of these ideas will be included in the longer \nterm stimulus package.\n  I am also disappointed that this stimulus package does not include \nthe 1-year extension of the production tax credit for renewable energy, \nwhich was included in the Senate Finance package. Current law provides \na 1.8 cent per kilowatt tax credit for electricity produced from \nrenewable sources including wind, solar, and biomass, but this \nprovision will expire at the end of 2008. An effort was made to extend \nit for 2 years in the energy bill last year, but that effort also \nfailed. This tax credit is critical to many developers of renewable \nenergy projects--without an extension, many projects will be put on \nhold because they will be less financially viable. With the tax credit, \nthese projects can go forward, and provide both investment in the \neconomy and creation of new jobs.\n  Failure to approve yesterday's amendment also means that the stimulus \npackage will not include an additional $1 billion for the LIHEAP \nprogram, which provides energy assistance to many low-income families. \nThis program has been seriously underfunded for the current fiscal \nyear, and this additional infusion of LIHEAP funding would have put \nmoney quickly and directly into the hands of individuals who need it. \nLIHEAP funds would be spent quickly and immediately, thus stimulating \nthe economy and providing a vital safety net to families and seniors so \nthey do not need to choose between eating and paying their energy bill. \nIn addition to being targeted to those most in need, LIHEAP funding \nwould provide benefits to the economy. Studies have shown that every \nLIHEAP dollar distributed generates up to five $5 of economic activity. \nBy helping to offset home heating costs, these low-income households \nwill be able to spend money on other vital essentials that will in turn \nhelp to stimulate the economy.\n  Beyond needing to ultimately pass the provisions in the Finance \nCommittee package, it is also important that we take up legislation in \nthe near future to target Federal spending on infrastructure, advanced \ntechnology and redevelopment projects that will create jobs. Our long-\nterm economic growth requires investments by the Federal Government to \ncreate jobs and help our businesses grow and compete. Infrastructure \nand advanced technology should be our top priorities. Businesses that \nare successful are more inclined to hire new workers and expand. In \nMichigan, we know that success for many of our industries requires good \nroads, safe bridges, and harbors that are dredged to promote dependable \nshipping. Immediate Federal spending on infrastructure and dredging \nprojects can put people to work and lay the foundation for future \neconomic growth.\n  Investments in advanced technology can have similar long-term \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\nFor example, developing the next-generation advanced batteries for \nhybrid cars could lead to enormous growth of our auto industry. I have \nproposed public-private partnerships for research and development of a \nhost of technologies that offer much potential for job creation.\n  No State is struggling more than Michigan in this tough economy, and, \nunfortunately, evidence is growing by the day to indicate that families \nand workers all across the Nation are facing tougher economic \nchallenges. I will support this short-term stimulus package as a start, \nbut I will also continue to push for further, stronger efforts to \naddress the problems on a broader level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any votes \nregarding H.R. 5140--and there will be either one or two votes, \nwhatever is determined--we could get by with one vote, but there may be \nsomeone who wants two votes, and if that is in fact the case, we will \nhave two--that we not start voting until 4:10 this afternoon. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and then be divided between the majority and the minority, \nand I would ask the chairman how much time he needs out of the half \nhour.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Six or seven minutes.\n  Mr. REID. With 5 minutes to Senator Durbin, 5 minutes to Senator \nMurray, 3 minutes to Senator Boxer, and 4 minutes to Senator Salazar.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Leader, I don't know, but we might want to have \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. You have it. I gave it to you.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The time is divided.\n  Mr. REID. And that Senator Schumer have 5 minutes. Does that add up \nto more than my half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). We are calculating it.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think it does, but if it does, let's trim it a \nlittle bit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nis on this side?\n  Mr. REID. A half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A half hour.\n  The majority leader has allocated 29 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I think in the spirit of bipartisanship \ntoday, we will alternate back and forth, Democrat and Republican. The \nfirst will be Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a big one. The victory before us \nis a victory for 20 million seniors who came of age during the Great \nDepression and World War II. They have been called the Greatest \nGeneration. They fought for their country. They gave a lifetime of \nlabor. They gave a lifetime of service. They paid a lifetime of taxes. \nThey contribute to our economy today. And now they will get stimulus \nchecks, too, like other Americans. Today is another victory for the \nGreatest Generation.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for a quarter million disabled \nveterans. No one can question their sacrifice. No one can question \ntheir contribution. They have fought for America. Today is a victory \nfor disabled veterans.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for the rule of law. That is because \nthe agreement ensures that the stimulus checks will go to Americans. It \nguards against sending checks to people who have violated our Nation's \nimmigration laws.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for the Founding Fathers, who created \nthe Senate and who created the Finance Committee. There were those who \nsaid we should take what the House of Representatives told us to take. \nThere were those who said we should take what the White House told us \nto take. But our Founding Fathers created a legislature with two \nChambers. The Founding Fathers created a government with checks and \nbalances. Today is a victory for those of us who want the Congress to \nwork as the Founding Fathers intended it.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for open government. The elements of \nthis agreement came out of the open process of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Americans need not settle for the products of back-room \ndeals. Legislation gets better when people meet in the open and debate \nit in the open this way. That is what we did in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and today's agreement is a victory for open government.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for moderates. Today's agreement is a \nvictory for men and women of good will, such as Chuck Grassley, Blanche \nLincoln, and Olympia Snowe. Today's agreement is a victory for people \nwho are willing to reach across the aisle and work with other people of \ngood will, even if they belong to another political party.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for people of courage, who were \nwilling to buck their party's leadership, to buck the administration, \nfor a better America. Today's agreement is a victory for people willing \nto stand up for what they think is right. Senator Grassley and I will \nremember who stood with us.\n  Today's agreement is a victory for a better, more effective economic \nstimulus. Economists agree that consumer spending, fueled by tax \nrebates, can boost America's economy. Americans over age 65 spend 92 \npercent of their incomes in any given year. They will spend their \nrebate checks quickly, and that will boost the economy quickly.\n  Most of all, today's agreement is a victory for the American people. \nToday's agreement will speed rebate checks to the overwhelming majority \nof Americans, giving them needed tax relief. Today is a victory for the \nAmerican people.\n  I thank my colleagues who have supported this package. I thank my \ncolleagues for their help in crafting it along the way, and I urge the \nSenate to adopt it right away.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lincoln be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Finally, Madam President, I say again how proud I am to \nwork with my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He, more than any \nother Senator I can think of, always does what is right for his home \nState of Iowa and for the country. I know of no Senator with greater \ncourage than the Senator from Iowa, and I say to everyone, anyone \nlistening, that we are here today in large part because this is a \nbipartisan agreement. We stood together. We did not want to buckle \ndown, we did not want to cave in to the House and the White House, \nbecause we wanted something a little better--something a little bit \nbetter--and we stood together, worked hard on this Finance Committee \npackage, with our hearings and amendments we adopted, and we did it \nvery quickly. So we are going to finally have an agreement by both \nbodies and by the White House, and I am quite certain very quickly, so \nAmericans can get those rebate checks they expected and they deserve to \nreceive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First, Madam President, following on where Senator \nBaucus left off, I thank him for his remarks, and I would be glad to \nassociate myself with them and put his words in my mouth so that I \nwould say the same thing about him. It is a pleasure to work with him \nbut, more importantly, a pleasure to have this opportunity to say that \na product we have worked on, that was an expression of 59 Members of \nthe Senate, is finally going to go to the President of the United \nStates.\n  So I say that about Senator Baucus personally, but I also say, for \nthose people who are listening, and who think that nothing in this city \never gets done in a bipartisan way, we are proving to the rest of the \nNation that everything in Washington is not partisan and we eventually \nget things worked out in a bipartisan way. I will add to that: Nothing \ngets done in the Senate unless it is bipartisan.\n  I would add a second point, and that second point is that a week \nbefore the House of Representatives passed their product, the House of \nRepresentatives, Republican and Democratic leaders, reached an \nagreement with the White House of a so-called perfect package that was \ngoing to stimulate the economy. They wanted to get it to the\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nPresident immediately, and it was something that the Senate ought to go \nalong with, without question. Then in a speech a week ago, I spoke here \nabout the functions of the Senate--to distill and cool and observe and \nput in a laboratory the legislation that comes from the other body--and \nthat it wasn't the function of the Senate to rubberstamp the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I mean, we are not, I guess you would say, like the Senate of France, \nas an example, or the House of Lords of London, we are the United \nStates Senate representing our constituents and are not a rubberstamp \nbody.\n  And the Constitution was written with the Senate to give greater \ndeliberation to legislation than what the House of Representatives \ndoes. This action right now is a perfect example of what we are set up \nto do as the Senate, and that perfect piece of legislation that we were \ntold was so perfect, after it went through the process of 21 members of \nthe Senate Finance Committee looking at it, came to the conclusion \nthere were about three things wrong with it: 20 million seniors \ncitizens left out. If you want to stimulate the economy, including low-\nincome seniors as consumers in America who need to spend money as one \nof the chief stimulants; and then the House of Representatives did not \nhonor the disabled veterans of America the way they should have--I \nshould say the low-income disabled veterans of America the way they \nshould. And then the second one was the possibility, very real \npossibility, of people who are here illegally maybe being able to \nqualify for a rebate check. So all of those are shortcomings in that \nperfect piece of legislation worked out between the White House and the \nDemocratic leadership of the House of Representatives.\n  As intelligent as those people are, and they are intelligent, it was \nnot so perfect. So the Senate did its work. Here we are. I am pleased \nwe are prepared to finish the job on the economic stimulus package this \nvery day--in fact, within a few minutes.\n  One week ago today, I spoke at length about the improvement the \nFinance Committee made in the House bill. The key improvements were on \nthe structure of the rebate. The Finance Committee members added 20 \nmillion low-income seniors, and several hundred thousand disabled \nveterans are now about to be able to participate in the rebate checks.\n  Illegal immigrants will not benefit from the rebate checks, and they \nshould not. I know that is a no-brainer, but it is something you have \nto make certain is in law because it will happen.\n  All these changes are a result of the work, under the leadership of \nSenator Baucus, of 21 members coming together to do what needed to be \ndone to correct the House bill. Now, this took a while. But my leaders \nsaw the light of the Finance Committee improvements.\n  My understanding is the House and the White House agree with us as \nwell. Through the process, we will approve a truly bipartisan, \nbicameral bill. The American people will witness, in this process, a \ndeliberative body, deliberating as we should but doing it in an \nexpeditious way.\n  The best bill would be the full Finance Committee bill. That bill \nwould have provided more business tax relief, more incentive for \ninvestment with probably longer--the certainty of the creation of more \njobs. And, of course, we had an energy investment package in it.\n  Well, those will come up another time. My colleagues who favor those \nissues are not going to be left out in the cold. The House and the \nWhite House did not want these provisions in this bill. So in the \ninterests of compromise, those provisions are dropped but not dropped \nout of sight.\n  I wish to thank our leaders for accepting, after some reluctance, the \nFinance Committee changes. We have a better product because the \nchairman and the committee process has worked. The committee members \nmade this a better deal, and I thank Chairman Baucus for his \nleadership.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent when we come back to this \nside, Senator Alexander would have 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, If we \nare doing it this way, I would ask unanimous consent to follow Senator \nAlexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSnowe be added as an original cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas an original cosponsor of the amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, this is a fine moment for the Senate \nbecause it is a group of Senators coming together and saying we need to \njump-start the economy, we cannot delay, we need to move forward very \nquickly.\n  Because of the action this Chamber will take later today, we will see \n100 million Americans receive tax rebate checks in the mail that then \nwill help us jump-start the economy. But as Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley have pointed out, we have taken a package from the House and \nhave significantly improved it, significantly improved it in two major \nways.\n  First, the 21 million seniors who receive Social Security who were \nleft out of the House package will now be receiving those tax rebates \nin the mail. So it is important to note this is a very important step \nin us standing up for the elders of America, for whom we have so much \nrespect.\n  The second major improvement in this legislation is we also have \nhonored our disabled veterans, 250,000 disabled veterans, who were left \nout of the House package, out of the package negotiated by the White \nHouse. We have included those in this legislation.\n  So in that way, this legislation represents a very significant \nimprovement upon the package that came over from the House. Let me also \nsay this is a business-friendly package because the product of the \nFinance Committee will put money in the pockets of small businessmen \nand women, as well as large businesses so they can invest in equipment, \nso they can create jobs and they can help start getting our economy \nfrom going further into the ditch and back on solid track.\n  Having said that, I also think it is incumbent upon all of us to \nunderstand this is a short-term fix and that there are longer term \neconomic and fiscal problems that face this country that need to be \ngrappled with. It would be my hope, as one Senator, in the days ahead, \nwe move forward and embrace a phase two of economic recovery for this \nNation.\n\n  I believe No. 1 on that agenda of this recovery program should be a \nfocus on housing legislation that will help us address the major issues \nthat are being faced across the country, including so poignantly in the \nState of California, where my good friend, Senator Boxer, was \ndescribing to us what is happening with the foreclosure rate, which is \ngoing to be six times higher than it was last year.\n  In my State of Colorado, 1 in 375,000 homes is in foreclosure. In my \nState of Colorado, there is a significant decline in real estate \nvalues. Across the country it is projected that everyone's home is \ngoing to decline on average by 14 percent.\n  So housing, I hope, is immediately on our agenda; that we move from \nthere and get a good farm bill passed for our food and fuel security \nfor our country; and, thirdly, that we embrace the Finance Committee \npackage on energy legislation that will help us get to that new \nfrontier of a clean energy economy for the 21st century.\n  So while I applaud this package and support it 100 percent, our work \nhas just begun. This is simply a first step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, there is one message we hear \nconsistently from the people we represent in this country. It is: They \nwould like for us to change the way we do business in Washington, DC. \nThey would like for us to come and focus our attention on big problems \nthat affect everyday Americans--whether it is helping each American \nhave health care insurance, whether it is keeping our jobs from going \noverseas, whether it is the $3 price of gasoline--and work together in \na principled way to solve it.\n  They do not mind our having big debates on big issues, about big \nprinciples\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nsuch as liberty versus security or terrorism. What they do not like is \nthe ``playpen'' politics, when we bring out the charts and hire the \ncampaign strategists and degenerate into what ought to be in a \nkindergarten or in a political campaign.\n  I am pleased to say this is a good way to begin the year the way that \nthis has worked out, because the President and the House of \nRepresentatives deserve great credit for agreeing quickly on a timely, \ntargeted proposal to help our economy be stimulated and move along.\n  They made it temporary, so it was not anymore of an infringement on \nthe budget, and they sent it to us. I am very proud of the Senate. But \nI do not think it is such a bad idea, every now and then, to concede \nthat even President Bush and the House of Representatives are not wrong \nall the time. They actually sent us an excellent package and gave us a \ngood start. What we have done is essentially accept the House package \nthat Speaker Pelosi, Mr. Boehner, and the President negotiated, and we \nhave improved on it in a couple ways involving seniors and disabled \nveterans.\n  All of us agreed about that, almost all of us. The Republican leader \nsuggested we do that a couple days ago. So I think there is plenty of \ncredit to go around. I would start by giving it to the President and \nthe House of Representatives. Of course we should thank the Finance \nCommittee for the work it did, the Republican leader for his \nsuggestion, with Senator Stevens, that we add the disabled veterans and \nseniors, which he made a couple days ago. And we should feel good that, \nby the end of this week, as Senator McConnell said earlier this week, \nwe will have sent to the House and hopefully to the President a piece \nof legislation that will help taxpayers keep more of their own money, \nhelp small businesses keep more of their own money, and in doing that, \nhelp create jobs and help create additional spending that will \nstimulate our economy.\n  We had a disagreement, in actually a very good way. The Finance \nCommittee recommendations included a number of proposals that many of \nus felt amounted to an excuse to spend, rather than economic stimulus. \nWe voted on that yesterday, and we took most of those off. But that \ndoes not mean the Finance Committee was wrong to make the suggestion; \nit meant we did not agree with them. So we put those things aside for \nnow. We will debate them later, and we will go forward with this bill.\n  A number of us on this side of the aisle, the Republican side, have \nsome things we would like to add to any bill that has to do with \neconomic stimulus. And Senator Hutchinson of Texas and Senator Vitter \nof Louisiana and Senator Isakson today talked about a number of those \nsuch as including long-term lower tax rates whether it is marginal \nrates or dividends or capital gains.\n  Those include Senator Isakson's proposal to give a tax credit to \nthose who would buy foreclosed homes, $5,000 for 3 years so we can get \nthe consumer back into the housing market. It would include the \nproposals, as Senators Hutchinson and Ensign and others have made in \nthe America Competes Act, which we passed together, Democrats and \nRepublicans. Now we need to implement it so we can give more incentives \nto outstanding teachers, help low-income students take more advanced \nplacement courses, bring in more talented people from other countries \nwho get graduate degrees in science and technology, and allow them to \nhave a green card and stay here and create jobs in the United States \ninstead of going overseas.\n  We have some work to do on controlling runaway litigation. All of \nthat has to do with job creation in America. We could have said: Yes, \nwe would like to have that on this. But we agree, we will set that \naside for now. But those are the long-term objections we have. We look \nforward to the debate on those issues and those steps.\n  I wish to congratulate the majority leader and the Republican leader, \nthe Finance Committee, and the others who worked hard on this. I wish \nto thank the House and the President for sending us a good piece of \nlegislation. I would ask my colleagues to consider this: We may want to \nsend the House something sometime we hope they pass. So why not give \nthem some credit for sending us something that substantially we agree \nwith, and with a couple of improvements, we believe is better for the \npeople of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I had asked for 3 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, yesterday we were all very saddened when \nwe failed to get the Senate Finance Committee stimulus package passed. \nWe lost by one vote because Republicans filibustered, and they forced \nus to get 60. We got 59 votes for that package, but it was not good \nenough. So now today our Republican friends happily are joining us on \ntwo elements of that package, and we are adding it to the House \nproposal.\n  I am pleased that 20 million senior citizens will get a check as part \nof the stimulus package, our stimulus package, the Senate's. I thank \nthe senior citizens and their organizations for calling all Senators \nand telling them it is outrageous to leave out the seniors. I am beyond \npleased as well that 250,000 disabled veterans will get a check as part \nof the Senate's stimulus package. I thank the veterans and their \norganizations for calling Senators constantly in their offices to say: \nMake us part of the package. To have left them out would have been \noutrageous on its face, just as it was outrageous that when the \nPresident suggested his package, he wanted to leave out more than 30 \nmillion Americans who didn't file tax returns, just paid payroll taxes, \nand acted as if those working Americans don't deserve to have a check. \nI thank Speaker Pelosi for fixing that problem. That was a huge \nproblem. She did fix that problem, and now we fixed some more problems.\n  Democrats want to do more. We were stopped again today from doing \nmore. Let me go into that because I stood here on the floor as the \nRepublicans objected to request after request after request to add the \nrest of the Senate Finance package to the stimulus bill.\n  Senator Reid said: We need to have low-income energy assistance. We \nknow the cost of heating is high, and we know people are suffering \nunder the burden of paying it. No, that was objected to. That was \nobjected to. Then we said, there are some States that have very high \nunemployment rates, and we see a high unemployment rate beginning to \nhit many States. We want to extend unemployment insurance to the long-\nterm unemployed. Those are the people who would go right out and spend \nthose checks at the corner store, which is just what we wanted to do. \nNo, our Republican friends said, no. Then we asked unanimous consent to \nhelp the homebuilders get a tax break. They are struggling under the \nhorrendous situation we find ourselves in today in the housing market. \nNo, there was objection from our Republican friends. Then we asked, \nthrough Senator Reid, for green energy tax breaks so the folks who are \nout there who are trying to build this economy and get us off foreign \noil can get those tax breaks. Republicans said no. Then we were asking \nif they would allow us to put in here a program President Bush himself \nendorses--housing revenue bonds to help with the housing crisis. The \nRepublicans said no.\n  We are all very happy that seniors and the disabled veterans are \ngoing to have a smile on their face tonight, but we are far from done. \nWe Democrats are going to fight.\n  I come from a State that has 25 percent of the defaults. When I go to \ntowns in my State, we have five roundtable discussions about the \nterrible situation that our mayors are facing, that our States are \nfacing, that our counties are facing. We need to do more, and we \nDemocrats are not going to give up. This is phase 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes to say to my \ndistinguished friend from California, who is chairman of one committee \non which I serve: I am a little puzzled about why, when we come to a \ngood conclusion and we stand up and compliment the Democratic members \nand the majority leader for a good job and adopt the provision, when we \ncompliment the recommendations of\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\nSpeaker Pelosi, a great friend of the Senator from California and \nsomeone I admire greatly for her work on this stimulus package, why she \nfeels it necessary to stand up and begin to make a political speech \nabout Republicans saying no. Republicans have said yes. Democrats have \nsaid yes. We are saying it to the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for an answer since he mentioned \nme?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I speak the truth. I speak the truth. I \nstood next to Senator Reid, and he made requests on all those issues I \noutlined--LIHEAP, extended unemployment benefits, tax breaks for solar, \net cetera--and the Republican side objected. I speak the truth. I am \nhappy we have joined together on two aspects of the proposal, but the \ntruth is, there is more to the story. We have more work to do. The fact \nthat I mentioned this is to sort of spur you on, to say: Come to the \ntable with us again, and let's do more. That is the reason I said what \nI said.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, if I may say, the Senator is certainly entitled \nto say whatever she wishes to say, but if she wants to bring it up, we \nwill begin with the fact that the Speaker of the House and the \nRepublican leader and almost 400 Members of the House sent us this \nbill. It was not the intention of the Speaker of the House, I assume, \nto throw grandma from the train by sending us an economic stimulus \npackage. It was her intention to send us a targeted, timely proposal \nthat would be temporary and that the American people could look at and \nsay: The Congress has come to a good result in a bipartisan way. They \nhave many opinions, but they decided what to do. And they will discuss \nthe other issues on down the road.\n\n  I would like to give the Speaker of the House credit for that, not \ncriticize her for leaving out seniors, not criticize her for leaving \nout disabled veterans, not criticize our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle on the Finance Committee for leaving out widows of disabled \nveterans, which would have happened in their first draft. I see no \nbenefit to that. It is much better to do what my friend, the late Alex \nHaley, used to say: Find the good and praise it. I think there is a \ngood deal to praise here.\n  I am certainly not objecting to the Senator's right to say whatever \nshe wishes. She is eloquent, she is effective, and she works in her \ncommittee in a very good way. I would just like to see the tone of the \ndebate on this Senate floor change so that it is possible from time to \ntime, when we do accomplish something together, that we recognize we \nhave different opinions but we can give credit to other people. When we \ndo, we often succeed. I think the majority leader and the Republican \nleader, the Finance Committee, the Speaker of the House, the President, \nand the Republican leader in the House deserve a pat on the back for \nthis. There are many other issues to discuss down the road. I can think \nof some things I would criticize the Democratic majority for spending \non, but I see no need to do that. There is nothing constructive to be \ngained by it, and we will defer that for another time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, like all of our colleagues, I have gone \nhome, I have listened to my constituents who are deeply concerned about \nthe state of the economy today. We are concerned about the housing \ncrisis, about the rising cost of fuel and gas, about the rising cost of \nhealth care. The economic crisis that is facing many people today was \nreflected in the economic numbers we have seen coming in over the last \nquarter. We came back here a month ago united to make sure we did what \neveryone agreed to--a temporary, targeted package to get money back \ninto the economy quickly. Today, we are about to do that.\n  But I have to say--and I heard my colleague from California say it--\nthe Speaker of the House did a good job in the limited amount of time \nwith the agreement she had to do to get a package here. The Senate, in \ndoing its job of looking at it carefully and asking, What do we need to \ndo to improve this to make sure it works, was highly commendable.\n  The package we voted on last night had a number of very important \nprovisions: extension of unemployment insurance; LIHEAP for millions of \nfamilies who are very concerned about being able to heat their homes; \nthe energy package that my colleague, Senator Cantwell, worked hard to \nput in to stimulate jobs and bring jobs in critical regions of the \nNation and deal with the energy crisis as well. We are all disappointed \non this side that but for one vote those would be part of this package \nwhich would then go back to the House and, we would hope, be signed by \nthe President. But because we were stymied by one vote, we are here \ntoday saying: What can we do?\n  We are delighted that our Republican colleagues have come with us to \nsay we can do better, and we added money to make sure millions of \nseniors as well as thousands of disabled veterans would be part of this \neconomic stimulus, families that are really struggling today.\n  We did agree with the Republicans, and I commend our leader, Senator \nHarry Reid, as well as Max Baucus, the minority leader, as well as \nSenator Grassley, who have worked hard over the morning hours to come \nto this. But I would say to the Senator from Tennessee, we can express \nour disappointment that but for one vote, we feel we could have had a \nbetter package. But we are pragmatic on this side. We believe we need \nto move forward. We know we cannot face days and days of delay. We know \nwe need to get this done, and we have come together with Democrats and \nRepublicans to move a package that I believe is in the best interest of \nthe country at this time.\n  This is not the end of this debate. This is our answer to get quickly \na short economic stimulus. But we are committed on this side--and with \na number of Republican Senators who joined us last night in that vote--\nto continue to work to do a long-term economic stimulus.\n  This crisis started with a housing issue that became the face of this \ncrisis as millions of homeowners were losing their homes across the \ncountry and facing foreclosure. We are committed to continue to move \nforward to address that housing crisis in a smart, pragmatic way to \nmake sure we can do everything to help those families and to get this \neconomy back on its feet. We are committed to work with our colleagues \nfrom Michigan and California and other States that are facing high \nunemployment to get extended unemployment insurance benefits for those \nfamilies that are now facing a very real crisis in their homes and with \ntheir ability to put food on the table. We are committed to continue to \ntry to get that one last vote for an energy package that will mean our \njobs will be brought here to the United States to create new \nalternative energy that will help not only job creation but our energy \ncrisis as well.\n  I commend all of us for coming together and, in a few short minutes, \nvoting to pass quick, temporary relief that is well needed but also a \ncommitment from all of us to continue to work to make sure we address \nthe long-term economic stimulus as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I join my colleagues in saying this is \na very fine day for the American people. It is a good day. I thank \neverybody who came together on this issue, particularly Senator Reid \nand Senator Baucus, who were steadfast leaders as we began to put \ntogether a stimulus package. I also thank my colleagues in the House, \nled by Speaker Pelosi.\n  We do have a serious economic crisis. Most economists would say we \nare headed to recession. It is unfortunate; that recession could have \nbeen avoided because the housing crisis is at the bull's-eye of that \nrecession. Unfortunately, this administration, with ideological \nhandcuffs around its wrists, was unable to intervene. So the crisis \nspread. Housing prices declined, and then consumers stopped buying. We \nhad a very weak Christmas season. Housing prices declined. Foreclosures \nincreased. And there is a credit freeze, so many who wish to build and \ncreate commercial projects, factories, businesses that wish to borrow \ncan't get the lending they need. As a result, we stand here at the \nprecipice of a fairly severe economic downturn. We must do everything \nwe can to make sure the severe effects of that downturn are mitigated. \nToday's package does that.\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\n  Early on, we enunciated on our side three goals--that a stimulus \npackage be timely, targeted, and temporary.\n  The package today meets all three of those goals. Leader Reid \npromised that we would get a package to the President's desk on \nFebruary 15, that we would not let squabbles, dilatory effects get in \nthe way. The package is on track to be signed by February 15 so that \nchecks can be sent out to the American people as quickly as possible, \nand they, because they are--most of them--hard pressed, will spend \nthose checks and get the economy revved up.\n  We added to the package. The House gave us a very good start. Make no \nmistake about it, the Senate package is based on the House's basic \nstructure. But we fought hard to include 21 million senior citizens and \n250,000 disabled veterans. They are now included in the package, and it \nis a better package than the one that passed the House.\n  The package in the House was good. The package that is passing the \nSenate is better. It could have been better still. It could have been \nbest. But our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--again, in \nthose ideological handcuffs--said: We cannot spend money. Tax cuts are \nOK, spending is not. Well, I know that is part of the old-time, hard-\nright philosophy. It is outdated now, but it is there.\n  Economists tell us, for instance, that spending on unemployment \ninsurance is the quickest way to get the money into the economy. The \nchecks will flow, hopefully, in the spring, but they cannot flow more \nquickly because the IRS needs to gear up its computers, and they are \nbusy with tax returns and tax refunds. If we were to extend \nunemployment insurance, we would mainstream money into the economy much \nmore quickly. Unemployment insurance gives the biggest bang for the \nbuck: $1.74 for every $1 spent. Tax breaks are good, but they give \nabout $1.19.\n  So if one were not ideological, did not care if the money went to the \nrich, the middle class, or the poor but just said, ``Let's get the \neconomy going,'' unemployment insurance and nutrition assistance would \nbe included in the package. But the ideological predispositions of the \nother side, not listening to economists--Martin Feldstein testified \nbefore our Finance Committee, a conservative economist who worked for \nRepublican Presidents, and said unemployment insurance makes sense. \nThey refused to do it. We made a valiant attempt. We tried. We were \nblocked by the other side by one vote.\n  We tried to bring in LIHEAP funds. Those of us from Northern States \nknow how hard it is to heat your home with the price of oil and gas \nthrough the roof. They said no.\n  Housing, as I said, is at the bull's-eye of this crisis. We tried to \nbring in mortgage revenue bonds, which the President himself supported. \nBut those on the other side said no.\n  So good, better, best. The House package: good; the Senate package: \nbetter. It could have been best, except our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle decided to block it.\n  Let me say two other things in conclusion.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes, \nnot to come out of Democratic time, just 2 minutes added on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if you want to delay the vote and add \n2 minutes to the Republican time, that would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, two other points quickly.\n  We will come back. There are structural problems in this economy that \nrebate checks will not solve. There are problems with housing, and we \nare putting together a good housing package that will include not only \nmortgage revenue bonds but assistance for loan supervisors, loan \ncounselors, who will help people restructure, and it will encourage \nFannie and Freddie to get money so mortgages can be refinanced. There \nare the conforming loan limits, which should pass in this package. That \nwill help our housing area.\n  We also will put together a package that deals with infrastructure--a \ntime-honored way of getting the economy moving. Hopefully, there will \nbe some local assistance to help States with their increased Medicaid \nburden and energy assistance--not just LIHEAP but also the kinds of \nthings the Senator from Washington State, Ms. Cantwell, has pioneered: \ntax breaks for green energy to create jobs and keep jobs here.\n  We will put together a package that will do all of that. We expect \nthere will be resistance from the other side. The only thing that will \nprobably stop that is if the economy hurdles south even further.\n  The second thing I want to say is this: Some asked me outside: Well, \ndid you do this for politics? Absolutely not. We tried to craft--and I \nknow it because I am on the Finance Committee and worked closely with \nSenator Baucus--we tried to craft the package that would give the \neconomy bang for the buck. But if today Members on the other side of \nthe aisle are squirming because they voted no, that is what democracy \nis all about. There were real choices here--real choices. Some said \nyes; some said no. We each should be held accountable by our \nconstituents for that. That is what democracy is all about. So while it \nwas substance--totally substance; I can tell you that, having been \nthere--that motivated our package, the political chips will fall where \nthey may.\n  This is a great day for the American people, a day to try to improve \nour economy. I am proud of what we have done and will work hard to make \nit better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in response to the comments of the \nSenator from New York, I simply would say that it is reassuring to see \nthe chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee come to \nthe floor and hear him say: Let the political chips fall where they \nmay, while denying he had any political motives in his comments.\n  I tried to begin the remarks here, after the majority leader made an \nexcellent talk and the Republican leader made an excellent talk, by \ncomplimenting Speaker Pelosi, by complimenting Mr. Boehner, by \ncomplimenting the President, by saying Senator Baucus and Senator Chuck \nGrassley deserve a lot of credit for bringing to our attention some \nthings that needed to been done. Then, by complimenting Senator Stevens \nand Senator McConnell--who a few days ago offered an amendment to add \nseniors and disabled veterans and to fix a problem that apparently \nneeded fixing by leaving out widows of disabled veterans. They offered \nthat, and we all agreed that was a good result.\n  I guess the Senate floor is always appropriate for whatever any \nindividual Senator may wish to say. But sometimes I wish it were more \nabout substance and less about politics.\n  This is an opportunity when we can talk more about substance. We have \nour principled differences of opinion on where we go from here, but we \nhave agreed on the temporary. As the Senator from New York said: Good \nfrom the House; better from the Senate. I agree with that. Now, when we \nget to ``best'' we will have a different kind of debate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will be glad to complete my remarks \nand turn the floor over to the Senator in just a moment.\n  But when we get to the question about ``best,'' I assume we are going \nto be arguing from principles, and we are going to say: To make this \neconomy better for the long term, we need to limit runaway lawsuits. \nAnd he may say we do not. I do not mean that will make him politically \nsquirm. I assume he actually believes that.\n  We may say we want to continue tax cuts, and he may want to raise \ntaxes. Should he say that, I do not intend to try to make him \npolitically squirm. I assume he just believes that.\n  Perhaps we can agree that we ought to implement the America COMPETES \nlaw which we worked together to pass last year. Perhaps we can agree \nthat we ought to increase the number of HB-2 visas so talented foreign \npeople can come do research and work and then stay here and create jobs \nhere instead of creating them overseas in India.\n  When it comes to an energy package, I may say more nuclear power, and\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\nsomeone on the other side may say less. But I do not say that to make \nthem squirm politically.\n  So I like the fact that we can come here and compete. I like his \ncharacterization, if I may say so, of ``good,'' ``better,'' ``best'' \nbecause I think if we have an economic stimulus package, the right kind \nof competition is to say they have an even better one, and then we will \nhave to go to work and come up with an even better one than that. But I \nreject the notion that what has been done here is to cause Republican \nSenators to squirm. We feel pretty good about avoiding turning this \nbill into an excuse to spend more money. But we respect the fact that \nthose on the other side have a genuine belief that spending more money \nis the way they would prefer to go over the long term.\n  So I guess I am expressing a little bit of disappointment in the tone \nof the debate here at the end. That is all I am expressing. But I \nthought I ought to express it instead of letting this go on and on in \nthe same tone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just so everyone knows, the Republican side \nhas 11 minutes 17 seconds remaining; the Democratic side has 8 minute 6 \nseconds.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute \nfrom the majority's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, certainly we come here today supportive of what has \nbeen done to this point, congratulating the House for beginning this \nprocess, on which we can build. But I think it is very important we \nmake it clear what has happened.\n  We had the majority of the Senate that supported something that would \nhave gone further, something that would have been better, in my \njudgment, and it was stopped by a filibuster and our inability to get \none vote--one Republican vote--to join with us to stop the filibuster. \nSo what does that mean? It means millions of unemployed middle-class \nAmericans are left out. Unemployment benefits--one of the top two areas \nthat economists have agreed upon to stimulate the economy--were left \nout because of one vote from our Republican colleagues. We just needed \none more vote to include that.\n  Jobs from alternative energy production--we literally have businesses \nsaying they will bring jobs back from overseas to this country--we lost \nthat by one vote. Those jobs will stay away. Plants, we are told, will \nnot improve and may, in fact, close certain projects because of the \nlack of one Republican vote. Help for homebuilders and homeowners--at \nthe heart of this crisis--help for other employers struggling to invest \nand keep Americans employed, we lost this by one vote. That is what is \nso unfortunate here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 17 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, under the agreement, I have 5 minutes. I \nwill just take 4 minutes, and if the Chair will notify me when I have \nused that time so the Senator from Arkansas can have her 2 minutes-\nplus.\n  It is interesting here that the American economy is suffering from \nsome ailment that leads us to believe it is headed to recession. So how \nare we going to treat this ailment, this fever? Well, we are trying to \ncome up with some medicine in a hurry before it gets worse.\n  The Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates, and then we \nunderstood we could do our part in Congress on a bipartisan basis: \nLet's try to do something now before something worse happens. We know \nhow bad it is: all of the people who are unemployed, the stock market \nin trouble, housing in shambles across America, the housing industry \nflat on its back. So we tried to come up with something quick, \ntemporary, and targeted to get this economy back on its feet.\n  I give credit to both the House Republicans and Democrats for \nreaching agreement and sending us a bill. Then we sat down in the \nSenate and said: Can we improve it? Is there a way to put a little more \nmedicine in this package so it will work?\n  Senator Max Baucus and Senator Chuck Grassley--Democrat and \nRepublican--on a bipartisan basis came up with a really good package. \nWe tried to pass that last night. We missed it by one vote. We needed \none more Republican vote. We had all the Democrats and eight \nRepublicans. We needed one more. We could not get it done. So today we \ndecided we had to take the best parts of it that we could on a \nbipartisan basis and pass it. I am glad we are going to do that.\n  As I go around this country, people say the same thing over and over: \nWill you stop squabbling on Capitol Hill and get down to work? Will you \ntry to work together? Today, we will. What the Senate Finance Committee \ndid was improve the House bill and give us a chance to help this ailing \neconomy get back on its feet.\n  What if this is not enough medicine? What if it is the wrong \nmedicine? I think we are going to go back to some of the things that \nwere rejected last night.\n  Unemployment insurance--boy, read the list. Madam President, 1.2 \nmillion Americans are going to see their unemployment insurance \nbenefits end this month. We want to extend their protection. There are \nsome who came to the floor on the other side who argued against that. \nOh, they say if somebody is unemployed, you have to punish them, you \nhave to pressure them to go back to work. Ever try to live on an \nunemployment check? I have run into people who do it, and it is not a \nrosy life. I think people are looking for jobs and finding them very \ndifficult to locate.\n  I think we are going to return, and many of the things rejected last \nnight by the Republican side will be part of the second dose of \nmedicine for this economy. This economy needs to get well. We need to \ngive the right medicine in the right amounts for it to happen. This is \na good start. With one more Republican vote last night, I think we \ncould have given that full spectrum of medicine to put this economy on \nthe right track.\n  If our efforts fail now with this stimulus package, we need to come \nback and put back into the law the things that were defeated last night \nby the Republicans, and more. We need an economic recovery package for \nAmerica. I am sick and tired of sending billions of dollars to Iraq to \nrebuild hospitals and schools and highways and not do the same thing in \nAmerica.\n\n  We have to focus on putting Americans to work with good-paying jobs, \nwith decent benefits, so they will be spending again and this economy \nstarts chugging forward again. For too long, we have ignored working \nfamilies, and any economic recovery plan has to focus on those working \nfamilies first. That is why I hope we pass this soon, monitor it \ncarefully, and if we do more, let us respond as quickly as we can.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time for the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I say to those who have discussed this \nbefore me that we received a package, the Pelosi-Bush package that \nstarted in the House, and it was done very quickly. They bypassed their \ncommittees and they bypassed the consideration of the Senate until we \ngot the package. So what we tried to do was to do our very best to \nimprove upon that package in ways that we felt would not only stimulate \nthe economy but do justice to the American people.\n  To the conversation that happened before me from the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from New York, I don't think what we are \ntalking about here is whether we are going to take up whatever we can \ndo; we owe it to the American people to do our very best, to do the \nvery best we can to stimulate the economy and make sure we are \nincluding every American in a part of that stimulus package.\n  I think that is what we tried to do in the Senate Finance Committee \nunder the tremendous and thoughtful leadership of Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley. We came up with a plan that, yes, not only looked at \nwhat we could do with those rebate checks and making sure we equitably \ndistributed\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nthose dollars--not only to those included in the Pelosi-Bush plan, but \nalso to include seniors. The chairman and ranking member found a way to \ninclude seniors, qualifying their Social Security income for the rebate \nincome threshold, but they also looked at the crisis epicenter: the \nhome mortgage issue. They looked at the unemployed who are getting \nready to fall off the rolls and who are working families trying to take \ncare of their kids and their aging parents. They looked at new job \ncreation, the renewable energy sources. What an incredible way for us \nto begin to reinvigorate the economy, to make a quick hit on jobs that \nwere already in existence that were probably going to leave if we \ndidn't do something about it.\n  I joined my colleague Senator Snowe, and I was very proud to join \nSenator Snowe, as I regularly am, to offer an amendment to add \nveterans' disability income as well. We wanted to add veterans' \ndisability income to make sure our disabled veterans would also get a \nrebate check, because I know, looking out there, they need it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time remains on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad to yield 1 minute of our time \nto the Senator from Arkansas if she wishes to finish her remarks.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator would be so gracious, that \nwould be very much appreciated on our side, so that the Senator could \nfinish her remarks. We thank the Senator from Tennessee for that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course. Is 2 minutes enough?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. That is unbelievably gracious from my neighbor in \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as always, my neighbor from Tennessee is \ngracious and a gentleman.\n  Here in Washington, we often get into the business of debating \nspecific policies and we lose sight of what it is all about. Before we \nfinish this debate, I want to remind people what it is about.\n  There is a gentleman named James Free who lives in West Memphis, \nright across the border from the Senator from Tennessee. He served in \nthe U.S. Army from 1972 to 1977. His service led him around the world \ntwo or three times, he said. But James' disability makes it hard for \nhim to work and to get by day to day. He gets $314 in a disability \ncheck that he receives from the VA each month, which is his primary \nsource of income. Now, because of the modifications we have made here \nin the Senate, James and other folks like him will qualify for the \nrebate. How could any of us argue that James Free, who has served our \nNation very courageously and proudly, should not be included in this \npackage today, that he would not appreciate the opportunity to receive \na stimulus check, and that he would not put it back, right back, into \nthe economy.\n  This is a good package. We had hoped we would do our very best, but \nit is a good package, and we want to make sure that as we take this \nstep to stimulate the economy in this great Nation, we will prepare \nourselves for the next piece of recovery we can offer, a recovery piece \nthat will be more long term, more substantial in making sure that we \ndeal with job creation and some of the other crises that exist. It is \ngoing to be good for our economy now. It is going to be good for our \nworking families and good for seniors, good for our veterans, and due \nto some additions I think from the other side, also good for the widows \nof veterans. I appreciate the fact we are moving forward on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  I want to say thanks to my colleague from Tennessee for yielding time \nso I could finish my comments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe all the Democratic time is \nused and most of ours is used and the vote is scheduled for 4:10, if I \nam not mistaken.\n  Let's start from the beginning, once again. The first order of \nbusiness when Congress convened and the President made his State of the \nUnion Address was to say to the American people: We see that the \neconomy is slowing down, and we want to do whatever we can from \nWashington. Even though we realize this is a huge economy--15 trillion \nor so dollars a year--we want to see if there is something we can do \nquickly that will stimulate the economy.\n  The President, the Democratic Speaker of the House, and the \nRepublican leader of the House, with the agreement of the majority and \nminority leader of the Senate, took the first stab at it. In very short \norder, they reported, and the House passed with only 35 or so \ndissenting votes, provisions that would give about $150 billion--two-\nthirds of it straight to individual taxpayers, middle and low income, \nso they could keep more of their own money, spend it, and stimulate the \neconomy; and about a third of it to small businesses in America so they \ncould keep more of their own money and create new jobs. That package \nwas sent to us. The Senate Finance Committee worked hard on that and \ncame up with some additional recommendations. One of those \nrecommendations was to add seniors. Another was to add disabled \nveterans. That recommendation was an idea that Senator Stevens of \nAlaska and Senator McConnell of Kentucky thought was a good idea, and \nin their own amendment offered that on the floor.\n  We then had a vote yesterday which represented a philosophical \ndifference of opinion. Most on the other side wanted to spend another \n$40 billion. Most on this side thought that was an excuse to spend, so \nwe resolved that, as the Senate always does: Unless you can get 60 \nvotes or a consensus, we can't go ahead. So the ones who wanted to \nspend more didn't win for now, and we kept the package at about the \nsame spending level that it was, adding, as virtually all wanted to do, \nseniors and disabled veterans and their widows. So in a very short \norder, we have a result.\n  I wish to end my remarks as we come toward the vote about where I \nstarted earlier, which is that this is a conclusion that deserves--and \nI hope will earn--the respect of the people of the United States. It \nwas fashioned in the House, and the Senate has largely respected the \nwork they have done. We believe we have improved it. We are sending it \nback. We are doing this with a provision that is timely and targeted in \na temporary way, and then we will move on, both sides will, to offer \nour long-term solutions for how we can continue to make this economy \nstronger.\n  There will be differences of opinion. There may be more spending \nthere and there may be more tax cuts here. There may be more \nreservation of runaway lawsuits here and less there. But we can have \nthose arguments. They will be principled arguments. Hopefully, it will \nshow that the Senate and the House, when they set their minds to it, \ncan work with the President on big issues and get results.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe all time has expired on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, unless there are other Republican \nSenators who wish to speak, we yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4010.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, my mind was on FISA. What we have done is, \nthe staffs are working out a consent agreement where we are going to \nhave three recorded votes. We are going to be able to dispose of two \nother votes by voice. Then we are working toward--and it is not done \nyet--we are working toward where that may be all the votes we will have \ntonight.\n  Then what we will try to do--not try, it is the only way we can get \nfrom here to there to get it done--is tomorrow we still have a lot of \ndebate left in this matter because of the time we have spent dealing on \nthe stimulus package. So today we will do all the votes we can. We are \ngoing to have, as I have indicated, at least five amendments we will \nget rid of. I think that will leave about five. We will then have \ndebate--there are a number of amendments where I think there is still \nlike 6 hours of debate left on those, and they would complete that \ndebate, hopefully get rid of a lot tomorrow, and what we can't, on \nMonday, and Tuesday morning we will start final votes.\n  We will have a cloture vote involved in this also, but I think we can \nwork out the time factor on the cloture vote and have final passage on \nthis sometime on Tuesday. I have asked Senator Rockefeller to have a \npretty good idea of what will be in the final package as it comes out \nhere. So I think it would be to everyone's benefit that he and Senator \nLeahy, Senator Bond, and Senator Specter work with their House \ncounterparts to see if they can work on a package to bring back to us.\n  What we are facing with this, because of the constraint of time, is \nthat the House has to work with the Senate to come up with something. \nIf that doesn't work out, then the legislation expires. There will be \nno law on the 15th, and I don't think there is anyone who wants that. \nNo one, with all that has gone on, even though I have complained a few \ntimes--well, I think there is no need to point fingers now. We are \nwhere we are, and we have to move as quickly as we can and try to \nfinish this bill, including the conference report, next week. We have \nto do that.\n  The unanimous consent is not ready yet, so I ask unanimous consent \nthat my friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, be allowed to speak for \n10 minutes as in morning business; and if one of my colleagues on the \nother side wants to speak before the vote starts, that is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I can say so, it sounds like a good \ngame plan to me. My understanding is we are going to get started voting \nhere very shortly. Is my understanding correct?\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Well, now, Mr. President, we lost one of them, so we are \nnow down to two rollcall votes and two that can be accepted by voice. \nSo we are two steps forward and one back. So the answer is: Yes, we \nwill have two votes that will be recorded. We should be able to start \nthose in a few minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think most Senators will feel good about \nthe significant progress on FISA, and hopefully we will get that \ncompleted.\n  Senator Thune and I were speaking a moment ago about the other piece \nof legislation we hope we might finish, when FISA is completed next \nTuesday or Wednesday, and that is the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct, which we started on the floor of the Senate.\n  I would ask the Senator: Might we expect to be able to bring that up \nfor a day? We believe we can finish that in a day next week.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend: Is there anything that can be done on \nthat tomorrow or Monday? Has the debate on all the amendments been \ncompleted?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe we have worked through most all \nareas of controversy, where we are waiting on some amendments that I \nbelieve Senator Coburn wishes some votes on. But I think we have made a \nlot of progress on both sides of the aisle to resolve items of \ncontroversy. I think if we could get it on the floor for 1 day, we can \nfinish it. And, frankly, there is some urgency to Indian health care \nissues. As I said, Senators Murkowski, Thune, and others join me in \nhoping we can include that next week to be completed on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, the Senator from North Dakota: Is there a \nway we could have a consent agreement that would give us specific time \nfor any amendments and votes on amendments, and after they are all \ndone, final passage?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been working with Senator Kyl and \nothers to try to see if we can reach an agreement on any amendments. I \nbelieve there will be very few votes required. I think Senator Coburn \nhas some that may require a couple of votes, but by and large I think \nwe have worked through most of the issues. Senator Kyl and Senator \nThune, on that side of the aisle, have been working with me.\n  But I would very much like to get whatever list or whatever time \nagreements we need so that we can bring that up. We really do need to \nfinish that next week, following the disposition of FISA, if it is \npossible.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my good friend, during those two votes we are going \nto have in a short time, if we can go to work to see if we could have a \nspecific numbers of amendments, how much time is left on them, we will \ncomplete it to final passage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have been working with the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. While we have not surveyed all of the Members on this \nside, I believe the issues are well known to us; they have surfaced. \nThe three key issues have mostly been worked through, as I understand, \nand I believe Senator Coburn is willing to put a time agreement on the \namendments he has. All of which is to say that I believe, unless there \nare some votes on our side that have not come forward--and we will \ncertainly inquire--it should be possible to get a time agreement with \nspecific amendments that is not very long and that would result in the \nbill being concluded in a relatively short time. But we do need to \nsurvey the rest of our Members.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would just echo what my colleague from \nNorth Dakota said and would agree that now we will have dealt with FISA \nand the economic stimulus bill, which I know are matters of great \nimportance and urgency--this is a matter of great urgency to the people \nwe represent. It is long overdue that we get this done. So I will do \neverything I can on our side to make it possible for us to limit any \nfurther amendments or anything that might further delay moving to a \nfinal vote.\n  I appreciate the leader's indulgence, along with my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, and would simply ask that when we complete action on \nthis, we move to this bill.\n  Mr. REID. If I can respond to my three colleagues, originally we \nthought this bill would take 1 day, and we know it has been bifurcated \nbecause of other issues. But I would really think that before we spend \nanother few days on this, we have to do everything we can to see if we \ncan come up with a time agreement to give us a way to get to the end so \nwe can have final passage.\n  We do not need to speak, as I have, about the drastic needs in Indian \nterritory. We need to do this. So I hope that--my friends, this is \ncertainly a bipartisan piece of legislation--we can work out some time \nagreements, and part of that will be final passage.\n  Mr. KYL. I do not know of any reason that cannot be done. There is \ncertainly no intention on our side to take a long time or slow it down. \nI think the Senator from North Dakota would verify that I have worked \nto try to resolve issues that are outstanding. It is my belief that \nthis can be done within a time period that is acceptable to the \nmajority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor.) The majority leader has a \nunanimous consent request pending. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S774-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S774-S775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DOJ STAFF MEMO ON THE FUTURES MARKETS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for requesting \n10 minutes for me in morning business.\n  The State of Illinois is home to some of the most dynamic and \ninnovative financial services firms in the world. For the futures \nmarkets, Chicago is a global leader. I pay particularly close attention \nto the vitality of these markets. It is an important part not only of \nthe economy of my home State but of the economy of our Nation. The work \nin the futures markets has a direct impact on everything from pork \nbellies to currencies to the price of oil.\n  I am deeply disturbed with what has taken place this week within the \nDepartment of Justice relative to those futures markets. As we have \nbeen told, the staff at the Justice Department recently wrote a memo to \nthe Department of Treasury questioning the structure of clearing and \nsettlement services in the U.S. futures industry. The staff has \nreferred to concerns about restraint on competition and other issues.\n  What is troubling about this disclosure is that the Department of \nJustice staffers apparently are claiming that they were simply \ncommenting on a Treasury proposal regarding the overall competitiveness \nof America's financial markets. But the comment period on the Treasury \nproposal ended 2 months ago, 2 months before the Department of Justice \nreleased this memo, and it is been more than 6 months since that same \nDepartment of Justice approved the merger of the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.\n  Well, people say: So what? Bureaucrats release memos. Who pays any \nattention to those? Well, let me tell you what happened yesterday. When \nthis memo became public, the price of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange \nstock declined by over $100 in 1 day. That reduced shareholders' market \ncapitalization by almost $6 billion. A memo from the Department of \nJustice to the Department of Treasury leaked to the Dow Jones Press \nService, which became public, cost the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in \n1 day, market capitalization of almost $6 billion. There was no \njustification for this memo. The comment period was closed, the \nDepartment of Justice had acted on the merger, and there was no reason \nto release it.\n  I have joined with my colleague, Congressman Rahm Emanuel, in sending \na letter to Attorney General Mukasey and Secretary Paulson calling on \nthem to not only look at the substance of this memo but also the \ncircumstances. By what right was this staff memo issued in the first \nplace or released to the press?\n  I want to quote one of the Commissioners of the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. That is the Government agency responsible for \nregulating these markets. This is what the Commissioner said:\n\n       The Department of Justice staffer letter has unfortunately \n     roiled the markets, and this is precisely the kind of \n     behavior that Government regulators are supposed to take \n     ordinary care and attention to avoid.\n\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\n\n  He is right. I think that letter was entirely inappropriate, and the \nfact that it was the leaked to the press--and I do not know whether it \nwas leaked at Justice or at Treasury--is something that should be \ninvestigated. I do not want to read too much into this, but someone who \nunderstood the impact of the market and decided to short the stock \ncould have made a lot of money yesterday. I am not saying that \noccurred, but that is how serious it is, that the stock would go down \n$100 in 1 day because of this action. Today, the stock has started to \nrecover. I am glad. But still we have to answer, at the Federal level, \nwhy this ever occurred.\n\n  These markets are ready to be regulated and examined, and they should \nbe. We want transparency and public trust at every single level. And we \nknow that competition in this market goes far beyond the United States. \nThese are now international and global markets, and the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange is the one of the leaders in these markets. They \nshould be closely regulated, closely watched, and should be subject to \nall of the laws and regulations concerning transparency. But when some \nstaffer at the Department of Justice can take a potshot at this global \nmarket and cost them almost $6 billion in market capitalization in 1 \nday, I think we have a right to demand accountability.\n  I am joining with my colleagues in the Senate and in the House in \ncalling on this administration to look into this matter as quickly as \npossible. I hope to find out why this comment letter was filed 2 months \nafter the Treasury Department deadline if the memo was meant to be \nrelated to that effort. I hope to find out if the Department of Justice \nconsidered its influence on the markets prior to drafting this letter \nor leaking this letter, whatever was done.\n  I hope there is not more to this story than the Justice Department \nstaffers are claiming, but I wonder. That is the reason I have written \nto these two leaders in the administration asking for a timely \nresponse.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand that the bill is to be called \nback up, the FISA bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the regular order.\n  Mr. BOND. If the proponent of the amendment is ready, I would suggest \nthat we begin the final lap on these amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S775-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S775-S778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3915\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is the amendment we call Use Limits \nAmendment, amendment No. 3915.\n  This amendment gives the FISA Court the option of preventing the \nGovernment from using information on U.S. persons that it has collected \nusing targeting or minimization procedures that are later found to be \nillegal.\n  As the legislation now stands, if the Government uses procedures that \nare later declared unlawful, there is nothing to stop it from using the \ninformation it collected illegally. This does not make any sense, and \nit takes away any incentive for the Government to develop lawful \nprocedures the first time around. It is also not consistent with the \napproach FISA takes with other illegally collected information.\n  If the Government conducts emergency surveillance that is later found \nto be improper, FISA already prohibits the Government from using that \ninformation. Importantly, under my amendment, information about \nforeigners or information that indicates a threat of death or bodily \nharm could always be used by the Government, even if it were collected \nunder illegal procedures. The FISA Court also has the discretion to \nallow the Government to use illegally collected information about U.S. \npersons.\n  So it is an extremely modest safeguard, a very reasonable amendment. \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to defeat \namendment 3915. It creates a superexclusionary rule on the intelligence \ncommunity. The Attorney General and the DNI have advised they will \nrecommend a veto.\n  It says: By requiring analysts to go back through relevant databases \nand exact certain information as well as to determine what other \ninformation is derived, this requirement places a tremendous burden, an \nunsurmountable operational burden on the intelligence community. I \nagree and yield the remainder of my time to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would say to the Presiding Officer \nthat this amendment would prevent disclosure or dissemination of any \ncollected information by U.S. persons if the FISA Court finds there are \ndeficiencies in the Government's targeting or minimization procedures \nunder the new authority.\n  There is no need to add another \npenalty to ensure compliance with the requirement of the statute. The \namendment gives the court very little discretion to determine whether \nnondisclosure is the appropriate remedy. Nondisclosure could be \nrequired even if the information is particularly significant foreign \nintelligence information, or if there is only a minor deficiency in the \nprocedure that cannot be corrected within 30 days.\n  It is a very short way of saying that I oppose this amendment \nstrongly.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume \nconsideration of the following Feingold amendments, Nos. 3915 and 3913, \nand that the time until 5:25 p.m. be for debate with respect to these \namendments en bloc;\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the amendments in the order listed above; that there be \n2 minutes of debate prior to the second vote, with all time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form, and the second vote 10 \nminutes in duration; that when the Senate resumes S. 2248 on Friday, \nFebruary 8, and on Monday, February 11, all remaining amendments be \ndebated and all time used; that on Tuesday, February 12, at a time to \nbe determined, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the \namendments in an order specified later, with 2 minutes of debate prior \nto the votes, equally divided and controlled in the usual form, and any \nsucceeding votes in the sequence be limited to 10 minutes; that no \nfurther amendments be in order Tuesday; and that upon disposition of \nall amendments, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on S. \n2248; and that if cloture is invoked on the bill, Senator Dodd be \nrecognized to speak for up to 4 hours, Senator Feingold for up to 15 \nminutes; that upon the conclusion of these remarks and the recognition \nof the managers for up to 10 minutes each, the Senate then proceed to \nvote on passage of the bill, and any other provisions of the previous \norder remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, if I could ask the majority \nleader, I had talked with Senator Feingold and suggested we have 4 \nminutes equally divided on the next vote so he can have 2 minutes and \nthe chairman and I may each have a minute.\n  Mr. REID. I accept the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as so \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3915\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to respond to the argument of the \nSenator from West Virginia that this amendment would somehow impose a \nburden because it would require the Government to identify information \nabout U.S. persons. I wish to be clear, these use limits kick in only \nif the Government proposes to disseminate and use the information, in \nwhich case the bill's minimization procedures already require the \nGovernment to identify information about U.S. persons. So I can't for \nthe life of me figure out what the Senator is referring to when he \nrefers to new burdens. My amendment imposes no additional burden at \nall.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have already spoken on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have made our point that it makes no \nsense to exclude the use of information simply because there is a \ndeficiency, any deficiency in the certification and procedures used to \ntarget foreign terrorists overseas.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Leahy \nand Specter, managers on the part of the Judiciary Committee, be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes on Tuesday, February 12, postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There is now 4 minutes equally divided before the next vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3913\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the reverse targeting amendment No. 3913 \nwas approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and is cosponsored by \nseveral of my colleagues. It simply ensures that the new authorities \ncontained in this bill are not used to engage in what is known as \nreverse targeting of Americans here at home. FISA requires the \nGovernment to get a court order when it is wiretapping Americans on \nAmerican soil. Reverse targeting refers to the possibility that the \nGovernment will try to get around this requirement by using these new \nauthorities to wiretap someone overseas, when what the Government is \ntrying to do and is interested in is the American with whom that \nforeign person is communicating.\n  The bill pretends to ban reverse targeting, but this ban is so weak \nas to be meaningless. It would allow reverse targeting as long as the \nGovernment can claim it has some interest, however minor, in the \nforeigner it is wiretapping. The amendment says the Government needs an \nindividualized court order when a significant purpose of the \nsurveillance is to acquire communications of a person inside the United \nStates.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has testified that this \npractice, reverse targeting, is a violation of the fourth amendment. \nThat is what the DNI says. This amendment merely codifies that \nconstitutional principle.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute on our side to the chairman \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this turns the bill on its head. This \nsays if we are targeting folks overseas, that in effect we have to get \na FISA Court approval for each and every time that happens.\n  Let me say the amendment causes enormous operational problems for \nintelligence professionals. They are very serious about it. The DNI and \nthe Attorney General say it will hamper U.S. intelligence \nauthorizations currently authorized because every single person would \nhave to have a court order, and\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\nwhen you are collecting overseas, that becomes kind of a burden.\n  While the technical details concerning such intelligence operations \nare classified, the concern is that the restriction would prevent the \nGovernment from doing intelligence collection against a foreign city, \nor a neighborhood in a foreign city, in advance of a military operation \nor perhaps in pursuit of a terrorist cell.\n  The amendment is unnecessary, and I urge its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is an explicit bright-line prohibition \nagainst reverse targeting in the current bill. As the DNI said, it \nwould be in violation of the fourth amendment. But Senator Feingold \nwants to replace this test with one that would make analysts engage in \nmental gymnastics, trying to figure out if ``a significant purpose'' is \nto target someone inside the United States. This significant purpose \nthrows in an additional concern: The analysts who gather and examine \nintelligence need clear rules, not an ambiguous significant purpose \nstandard.\n  The adoption of this amendment is seriously detrimental to the \noperation of our analysts and the DNI and the Attorney General would \nrecommend a veto if it is adopted.\n  We worked hard, and we have a good bipartisan bill that significantly \nadds to the protections of civil liberties. We need to pass this bill. \nI join with my colleague from West Virginia, the chairman of the \ncommittee, in urging our colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have made progress on FISA. We have more \nprogress to make. It appears to me that this will be the last recorded \nvote. We have a number of other measures we are going to try to dispose \nof on this bill. I know we have at least one of Senator Bond's \namendments that will be disposed of by voice vote. We have an agreement \nthat we will move this bill forward for passage on Tuesday.\n  On Tuesday, everyone, there will be no morning business. We will come \nin at 10 o'clock on Tuesday and start right on FISA, and hope by that \ntime to have all of the debate completed on this legislation.\n  Again, this will be the last vote today. I appreciate everyone's \ngood, hard work this week and look forward to next week.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3941, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3941, as modified, \nthe Rockefeller-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment modifies a provision of the \nProtect America Act. I think, along with my colleague, the chairman of \nthe committee, it makes a lot of sense. It lays out a process for the \nFISA Court to conduct a review of a petition from an electronic \ncommunication service provider challenging a directive from the \nGovernment in review of a petition by the Government to enforce \ncompliance with its directive. Having the court conduct expedited \nreviews of these petitions, whether from the provider or from the \nGovernment, is in everyone's best interest.\n  These questions are essential to be resolved one way or the other for \nthe protection of the private partners, as well as the protection of \nour national security. As long as challenges of enforcement proceedings \nremain pending before the court, the intelligence community cannot \nintercept terrorist communications through that provider. Those are not \nunreasonable requirements. Rather, it reflects the judgment of this \nbody and the other in the area of national security that important \ndecisions that go to the heart of our intelligence production should be \nmade on an expedited basis.\n  The DNI and the Attorney General advised us they strongly support \nthis amendment because it would ``ensure challenges to directives and \npetitions to compel compliance with directives are adjudicated in a \nmanner that avoids undue delays in critical intelligence collection.'' \nWe could not agree more.\n  I hope we will be able to accept this amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my remarks are only to indicate \nstrong support for this amendment. It is a wise modification. As far as \nI know, there are none who are in dissent. I hope it will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3941, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3941), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have made some progress today. We have \nlaid out, through the good work of the leadership of this body, with \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell, a means of going forward on \nTuesday. We have now had over 2 weeks of debate on FISA. I think not \nonly the fact that everything that could be said pro and con of all the \namendments has been said, but I believe we have given everybody a \nchance to say it.\n  The good news is that when Tuesday comes around, we will have short \ntime agreements and proceed to vote on these critically important \namendments, and then we hope cloture and, if cloture is invoked, final \npassage, with everybody having an opportunity to express themselves.\n  Again, I personally express my thanks to the leadership, to the \nmembers of the committee who stood with\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\nus and our staff, and I thank our colleagues for letting us come to \nthis position where we see the end in sight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in every respect, I second the words \nof the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Speaking for \nthis Senator, in the course of last year, this Senator has spent 6 \nmonths working on the children's health insurance bill with staff who \ndo so much work that they sleep 2 or 3 hours a night, including the \nweekends, and achieved nothing. We have had, in a sense, the same \nprocess on the FISA bill. It is very complicated because it is a very \ndelicate subject and requires this very difficult balance between \nintelligence collection for the security of the Nation and civil \nliberties of the people.\n  I am extremely proud of the way the vice chairman and others, \nparticularly the majority leader and the minority leader, have \nconducted this affair. It took quite some time to get it going. I do \nbelieve I also see light at the end of the tunnel. I think if we do our \nwork on Tuesday, we will have time to conference this bill with the \nHouse and send a bill to the President. In any event, I am grateful, \nparticularly to the staff whose work is never mentioned enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business for the next 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S778-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATIONS TO SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this afternoon, I and a number of others \nwho have been supporting Gov. Mitt Romney for the Presidency of the \nUnited States met with the Governor and his good wife Ann to have a \npostmortem following his announcement that he was suspending his \ncampaign.\n  I was perhaps the first Member of this Chamber to announce my public \nendorsement of Governor Romney, so I wish to be among the first to \nextend my congratulations to Senator McCain, who has now, by virtue of \nGovernor Romney's suspension of his campaign, locked up the Republican \nnomination.\n  We all have our understanding of Senator McCain's persistence and his \ndetermination to go forward in what he considers to be a good cause. \nThere has never been a demonstration of the importance of that \npersistence quite as dramatic as his comeback from this campaign.\n  We can remember the time when all of the pundits and, frankly, all \nthe rest of us, myself very much included, wrote off the McCain \ncampaign, assuming that Senator McCain was lying dead in the gutter by \nthe side of the road. I remember talking with some of his supporters in \nthis Chamber at that time who said the McCain campaign is reeling and \nwe don't know whether it is going to ever come back. I remember the \nrumors that flowed around this town, where people said: We cannot raise \nany money for the McCain campaign. No one wants to contribute to a lost \ncause.\n  John McCain, perhaps alone--maybe he had the support of his wife; I \nassume he did--said: No, I am going to go forward. He picked himself \noff, took himself off to New Hampshire, and did the same kind of thing \nhe did 8 years ago when he ran against President Bush. In this case, he \nnot only won New Hampshire, but he was able to expand that to wins \nelsewhere, to the point where we have the result today. So he deserves \nour congratulations as we recognize this truly extraordinary political \naccomplishment on his part.\n  I share with my colleagues this comment from Governor Romney. As \nthose of us were supporting him from both the House and the Senate were \ngathered around him and talking about this, he shared with us this \nparticular insight. He looked at what has happened. He sat down with \nhis supporters. He looked for all the reasons why he should feel good. \nThey pointed out he had won 4 million votes in the various primaries \nand caucuses and Senator McCain had won 4.7 million. So in terms of the \nvoters who supported him, he was not that far behind. He had won 11 \nStates. Senator McCain had won 13. So on that basis, he was not that \nfar behind.\n  But the cold calculating reality of it was he was very far behind as \nfar as the delegates were concerned. So he said to his advisers and his \npolitical consultants: What would it take for me to win the nomination? \nAnd they said to him very bluntly: You must destroy John McCain. That \nwas not his word. I don't remember his exact word, but you must go \nnegative, to use the vocabulary of the political consultant, in such a \nway as to make it impossible for John McCain to proceed with the \nconfidence of the American people. Governor Romney said: I am not going \nto try that. Even if it might work, I don't want to try that. I don't \nwant to do that. And he made the decision that was announced today.\n  Along with my congratulations to Senator McCain on his extraordinary \nachievement and his assuming the position now as the obvious Republican \nnominee, I also congratulate my friend, Mitt Romney, on the \ngraciousness with which he recognized what was happening and his \nwillingness to withdraw now rather than drag the party on into a \nprotracted fight that would make it very difficult for Senator McCain \nto take control of the levers of power in the party and organize \nhimself for the fight in the fall.\n  These are two good men, each one of different views, each one of very \ndifferent background, each one of which would bring a different set of \ntalents to the Presidency, each one of which has now exposed himself to \nthe fire of the primary process. One has emerged victorious; the other \nhas recognized that and stepped aside. I think it is a demonstration \nthat the American political system, however messy, works.\n  Again, I extend my congratulations to Senator McCain.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate Page Program has been an \nintregral part of the functioning of the Senate since its inception in \n1829. Senate pages are always on the Senate floor when the Senate is in \nsession, helping to ensure that the proceedings in the Chamber run \nsmoothly and efficiently. Pages also are asked to complete a variety of \nother tasks when the Senate is not in session. We ask a lot of our \nSenate pages, and they always respond. A page is not only expected to \nserve the needs of the Senate, which is an important and time-consuming \ntask, but also is expected to attend school and complete the necessary \nrequirements of a high school junior.\n  Senator Daniel Webster selected the first Senate page. In those days, \nas is the case today, a page was chosen and sponsored by a Senator. \nThere is a long and fine tradition of pages chosen by Michigan \nSenators, and I am proud to have sponsored many pages that have ably \nand responsibly served the Senate.\n  Sam Wohns, Michigan's most recent Senate page, completed his service \nas a Senate page last month with dedication and enthusiasm. Sam is a \npart of a fine tradition and a select group that has had the privilege \nto serve as a Senate page. He has proven through his hard work in the \nSenate and through his many successes in the past that he, like many of \nhis peers, are some of our ation's best and brightest. This experience \nhas prepared him well to meet future challenges, as it has for the many \nthat have preceded him.\n  Each semester the Senate Page School conducts an essay competition. \nEvery page is given the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nsubmit an essay that reflects their thoughts about their experience as \na page. The winner earns the right to deliver that essay at the closing \nceremony for his or her page class. Sam Wohn's essay was selected as \nthe winning essay last month, and it is clear from his essay that this \npast semester has had a positive and inspirational impact on him and \nhis fellow pages.\n  It is a distinct honor to be chosen as a Senate page, and the work \nthat this page class has done is valued by all of us in the Senate. I \nknow my colleagues join me in thanking each Senate page for a job well \ndone. I look forward to hearing about their many successes in the \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of Sam Wohn's speech at the \nclosing ceremony of his page class last month printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Good morning. It's hard for me to believe that today is our \n     last day of Paging. Part of me feels like I just arrived. I \n     still have so much to learn about our political process and \n     there is still so much more that I want to do in DC. On the \n     other hand, part of me feels like I've been here for years. \n     I'm fully adjusted to dorm life, shortened class periods, and \n     the demands of working at the Senate.\n       While I had dreamt of nearly every aspect of being a Page \n     before I first stepped foot in Webster Hall, I hadn't \n     imagined having to leave. Knowing that I'll never again have \n     the opportunity to bring a senator a glass of water or to \n     rush back early from dinner to open doors during a rollcall \n     vote is disheartening, but knowing that I'll have the \n     friendship of my fellow Pages for years to come is \n     encouraging.\n       The other Pages from all around the country have enriched \n     my experience more than anything else. And while I did learn \n     the particulars of parliamentary procedure, the proper way to \n     set up an easel, and how to operate on five hours of sleep a \n     night, the most important lesson of this semester has been \n     the value of teamwork. The bond between all of the Pages made \n     no challenge insurmountable and made no hardship unbearable. \n     Without that support network, I think my experience as a Page \n     would have been very different.\n       As I was preparing this speech, I came across an email that \n     I sent to my parents in the summer after my freshman year. I \n     described the Page Program as a ``flawless utopia'' in that \n     email. After taking Advanced Composition this semester I know \n     that my word choice, ``flawless utopia,'' was a little \n     redundant, but I think you get the idea--I had high \n     expectations. I expected nothing short of an amazing \n     experience, and my experience was nothing short of amazing.\n       Yet, it wouldn't have been as rewarding if it wasn't as \n     challenging as it was. The weeks when I didn't get done with \n     work until ten o'clock at night were the most memorable. I'll \n     never forget the last night of rollcall votes when the senate \n     was in session until after midnight or the last day of \n     legislative business when Senator Levin showed all of the \n     Pages his favorite signatures inside the desks on the floor. \n     I worked long hours, but it certainly didn't seem like work.\n       I consider this semester a gift. I feel so fortunate to \n     have been a student in each of my teacher's classrooms, to \n     have made so many great friends, and to have played a role in \n     the functioning of the world's most powerful legislative \n     body. This semester has been a gift of knowledge from my \n     teachers, a gift of friendship from all of the other pages, \n     and a gift of new awareness and perspective that I gained \n     from the many responsibilities all of us Pages shared at the \n     Senate and at Webster Hall.\n       Like most gifts in Washington, this one has strings \n     attached. As former Pages, we'll have obligations that we \n     didn't have before. Our firsthand knowledge of the \n     legislative process obligates us to stay informed of current \n     events, our new awareness of some of the deep injustices in \n     the world obligates us to do what we can to address them, and \n     our work experiences obligate us to share our many stories \n     with friends and family.\n       Many people have told me that a semester of Paging is \n     similar to the first semester of college. I can only hope \n     that my college experience is as memorable as the last four \n     and a half months. It has been an honor and privilege to \n     serve with you all. I will miss you and yet I know that we \n     are inexorably connected for a lifetime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S779-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S779-S780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT BALL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us who knew Robert Ball are \nsaddened by his death last week. For many of us in Congress and for \ntens of millions of Americans in recent decades, Bob Ball was Mr. \nSocial Security. He deserves immense credit not only for his \nindispensable leadership in making it the most successful and most \nbeloved social program in the nation's history, but also for doing so \nmuch over the years to keep it that way when some in high places sought \nto undermine it.\n  President Kennedy named Bob as Commissioner of Social Security in \n1962, the same year I came to the Senate, and I know my brother would \nregard him as one of his finest appointments. Bob's leadership was \nindispensable in maintaining the strength of Social Security in the \n1960s and dramatically expanding it to include Medicare and disability \nbenefits. Countless times over the years, I have benefited from Bob's \nextraordinary wisdom, experience and friendship.\n  Bob stepped down as Commissioner in 1973, but he never really \nretired. He was a key member of the Greenspan Commission on Social \nSecurity reform in the early 1980s, and in 1986 he founded the National \nAcademy of Social Insurance, whose studies and publications have been \nan invaluable policy resource for all of us in Congress on Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and other important social programs such as \nworkers' compensation and unemployment insurance. Through its awards \nand internships, the Academy has inspired many young people in \ngovernment, the private sector and universities to devote themselves to \nthese issues as he did.\n  As recently as last fall, at the age of 93, Bob was sending out to \nhis extensive mailing list his ideas for protecting and financing \nSocial Security, backed up, as they always were, by sound cost \nestimates provided by loyal Social Security employees who are still \ndeeply inspired by Bob.\n  I will miss Bob very much, and I extend my deepest condolences to his \nwife Doris and all his children, grandchildren, and great-\ngrandchildren. Bob Ball was one of a kind. Few if any in the long \nhistory of our country have done so much for so many for so long.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that last Friday's obituary in \nthe New York Times on Bob Ball be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 1, 2008]\n\n           Robert M. Ball Is Dead at 93; Led Social Security\n\n                           (By Dennis Hevesi)\n\n       Robert M. Ball, the commissioner of Social Security in the \n     Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon administrations, an architect of \n     Medicare and an influential opponent of privatizing Social \n     Security, died Wednesday at his home in Bowie, Md. He was 93.\n       The cause was congestive heart failure, his son, Jonathan, \n     said.\n       ``Bob Ball left an indelible mark on the Social Security \n     program and the agency in that he played a critical role in \n     the establishment of Medicare,'' the current commissioner, \n     Michael J. Astrue, said Wednesday in a statement. ``His \n     commitment to Social Security was unequaled.''\n       Mr. Ball was commissioner from 1962 to 1973, but his \n     advocacy for preserving the program went well beyond his \n     retirement from public service.\n       In 1981, he represented the speaker of the House, Thomas P. \n     O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, on the National \n     Commission on Social Security Reform.\n       Called the Greenspan Commission, for its chairman, Alan \n     Greenspan, who later became chairman of the Federal Reserve, \n     it was created by President Ronald Reagan at a time when \n     Social Security faced financial problems. High inflation and \n     high unemployment were significantly decreasing revenues.\n       Mr. Reagan wanted a report by the end of 1982, but the \n     commission was deadlocked along partisan lines. Behind the \n     scenes, Mr. Ball negotiated with James A. Baker III, Mr. \n     Reagan's chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, a deputy \n     Treasury secretary.\n       Weeks before the deadline, they came up with a compromise, \n     a complex balance of tax increases and benefit cuts that was \n     acceptable to the president and to Mr. O'Neill. Those 1983 \n     amendments remain the most recent substantial changes to the \n     system.\n       In 1996, Mr. Ball was a member of a Social Security \n     advisory council that was considering partial privatization \n     of the system, a precursor to the broader plan that President \n     Bush would propose eight years later. The council chairman, \n     Edward M. Gramlich, a Federal Reserve board member, \n     favored the plan. But Mr. Ball managed to place so many \n     other issues before the council that privatization was \n     kept off the table.\n       Still, privatization became a centerpiece of Mr. Bush's re-\n     election campaign in 2004. The president wanted to allow \n     workers to divert part of their Social Security payroll taxes \n     into private accounts. Opponents, including Mr. Ball, said \n     the Plan would leave the system under-financed.\n       ``Bob Ball essentially set up a war room in his living \n     room; a phone, a fax machine and his big Rolodex,'' Thomas N. \n     Bethell, the editor of Mr. Ball's 2000 book, ``Insuring the \n     Essentials: Bob Ball on Social Security'' (Century Foundation \n     Press), said on Thursday. ``He wrote position papers, \n     broadsides and papered Capitol Hill with them.''\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\n       Mr. Ball said the system was not facing financial disaster, \n     as the president contended, and could be strengthened by, \n     among other measures, raising the level of wages that could \n     be taxed for Social Security, which is currently capped at \n     $102,000. With Democrats in the majority since the elections \n     of 2006, Congress has not addressed privatization.\n       Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office, said Mr. Ball's influence was \n     potent. ``For years he has been one of the strongest \n     defenders of the existing structure,'' Mr. Reischauer said \n     Thursday. ``He provided the intellectual firepower to those \n     who want to preserve it.''\n       Robert Myers Ball was born in Manhattan on March 28, 1914, \n     the son of Archey and Laura Crump Ball. His father was a \n     Methodist minister. Mr. Ball graduated from Wesleyan \n     University with a degree in English in 1935, and a An \n     official for three presidents and an architect of Medicare. \n     year later earned a master's degree there in economics.\n       Besides his son, Jonathan, of Cazenovia, N.Y., Mr. Ball is \n     survived by his wife of 71 years, the former Doris McCord; a \n     daughter, Jacqueline Ball Smith of Meredith, N.H.; three \n     grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n       Mr. Ball first worked as a Social Security field assistant \n     in New Jersey in 1939. In 1947 and 1948, he was staff \n     director of the Senate Finance Committee's advisory council \n     on Social Security, playing a crucial role in shaping \n     legislation that significantly expanded coverage and \n     benefits. in 1949, he rejoined the Social Security \n     Administration and began rising through the ranks. President \n     John F. Kennedy appointed him commissioner in 1962.\n       As commissioner, he played significant roles in creating \n     and winning enactment of Medicare, which provides health \n     insurance to people 65 and over, and the Social Security \n     disability program.\n       Recently, Mr. Ball had called on all presidential \n     candidates to vow not to cut Social Security benefits. Last \n     October, in an op-ed article in The Washington Post, he \n     wrote: ``Social Security is the nation's most effective \n     antipoverty program, But it's much more than that. For every \n     worker it provides a solid base on which to try to build an \n     adequate level of retirement income. To weaken that \n     foundation would be grossly irresponsible.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S780-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the importance \nof the National Defense University, NDU, and its contribution to our \nnational security. Since 1976, the NDU has been the premier center for \nJoint Professional Military Education. Under the direction and \nleadership of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, NDU provides \nan educational and research environment to prepare future leaders of \nthe armed services, the Department of State, other civilian agencies, \nand allied countries for high-level policy, command, and staff \nresponsibilities. In addition, a limited number of students from \nprivate industry attend the university. Members of both Houses of \nCongress have benefitted from interactions with students and experts on \nthe NDU campus. Students are selected for their leadership potential \nand many NDU alumni have gone on to senior leadership positions in \ntheir service, agency, or country.\n  NDU is a center for joint, multinational, and interagency education. \nIt is comprised of the National War College, NWC; Industrial College of \nthe Armed Forces, ICAF; Joint Forces Staff College, JFSC; Information \nResources Management College, IRMC; School for National Security \nExecutive Education, SNSEE; Institute for National Strategic Studies, \nINSS; Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction, CSWMD; \nCenter for Technology and National Security Policy, CTNSP; Institute \nfor National Security Ethics and Leadership; and five special programs: \nCapstone/Pinnacle/Keystone, Joint Reserve Affairs Center, JRAC; \nInternational Student Management Office, ISMO; Secretary of Defense \nCorporate Fellows Program, SDCFP; and the NATO Staff Officer \nOrientation Course, NSOOC.\n  With facilities located in Washington, DC, and Norfolk, VA, more than \n1,000 people attend university courses and programs on any given day. \nNDU is an accredited graduate-level university awarding approximately \n600 masters degrees each year. Through agreements with a number of \nuniversities, IRMC students can earn 15 graduate credits for work \ncompleted at NDU.\n  At NDU, students are taught how to think--not what to think. The \ncurriculum combines information technology, classroom experience, and \nexperiential learning. Through lecture programs, students gain \nimportant insights from top military, government, industry, and \ninternational leaders to include the President of the United States, \nCabinet-level officials, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, commanders from \nmajor military commands, Members of Congress, civilian leaders, and \nforeign ministers of defense. Speakers talk frankly with students under \nthe University's nonattribution policy allowing a free exchange of \nideas.\n  Annually, NDU's outreach efforts include more than 500 conferences, \nsymposia, and workshops; 20,000 visitors; 120 faculty and staff \npublications; and 350 conference presentations by university faculty \nand staff to both national and international audiences.\n  The award-winning NDU Press produces numerous publications, which \naddress national security issues. The NDU Library with a collection of \nmore than 500,000 bound items, audiovisual materials, classified \ndocuments, and on-line services is an extensive source for information \nabout national security policy, military strategy, defense resource \nmanagement, and industry studies.\n  The National Defense University is a significant and valuable \ninstitution for the development of leaders for America's national \nsecurity needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S780-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency on its 50th anniversary. Today, DARPA \ncelebrates 50 years of innovation and dedication to America's security.\n  After the Soviet launch of Sputnik, President Dwight D. Eisenhower \nwas determined to ensure this nation was never again surprised by the \ntechnological accomplishments of an adversary. On this day in 1958, a \ncentral research and development organization, known then as the \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, and unlike any organization \nin the world, was created within the Department of Defense.\n  From the very beginning, its mission has been to ensure that the \nUnited States Armed Forces have access to the most advanced war \nfighting capabilities by developing ideas that many would consider too \nrisky to implement. DARPA's mission is about making smart investments \non high-payoff opportunities, and it has been very successful.\n  Over the past 50 years, DARPA has delivered to our country innovative \ntechnological achievements that have given American Forces never-\nbefore-seen capabilities. I also note that this achievement has not \ncome without tremendous sacrifice by thousands of DARPA employees and \ntheir families as they worked long days to solve challenging scientific \nmatters.\n  DARPA's notable achievements include early ballistic missile defense, \nstealth aircraft technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous \nnavigation. The benefits of DARPA's efforts have evolved in many ways, \nfrom the rocket engines that powered the first manned space flight to \nthe smallest microelectronics in our cell phones today. DARPA also \nhelped develop the Internet, and built the small receivers that made \nthe global positioning system data easily accessible--both have changed \nthe ways our forces operate, and have also changed the lives of all \nAmericans for the better. Entire industries have developed from early \nDARPA-funded research in core technologies such as material sciences, \nmicroelectronics, photonics, and information technology.\n  I congratulate DARPA for its service to our Nation. The Agency's \ncommitment and contributions over the past 50 years have made DARPA the \ncrown jewel in our nation's national security and we look forward to \nthe achievements they will continue to make for future generations.\n  As DARPA begins its work for the next 50 years, it is important that \nwe do everything possible to help DARPA continue its tradition of \nexcellence, and thus keep our Nation strong.\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printe din the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S780-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S780-S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nViorel G. ``Vi'' Stoia, who dedicated his life to enhance the lives of \nthe citizens of Aberdeen and the surrounding area. He will be sadly \nmissed, but many of us will continue to benefit for decades from his \nlegacy.\n  Vi's leadership qualities showcased themselves early in his life. Vi \ngraduated from Aberdeen Central High School in 1942 as president of his \nsenior class. He then served honorably in the U.S. Navy in both the \nNorth and South Pacific. He returned to the United States to attend the \nUniversity of Minnesota and upon graduation headed for his hometown of \nAberdeen, SD. Thus began his long role of public service, which several \nhave described as unparalleled.\n  Vi began his career in Aberdeen as an agent and broker for \nNorthwestern Mutual Life and continued to work tirelessly for over 50 \nyears to improve the northeast South Dakota region. Some of the \nnumerous projects he was instrumental in developing include Student \nLoan Finance Corporation, Education Assistance Corporation, \nNortheastern Mental Health, the Aberdeen Development Corporation, \nNortheast Regional Health and Fitness Center, the Northwest Highway 281 \nbypass, and the four-lane highway from Aberdeen to I-29. Vi was also a \ndevoted family man, an active member of St. Mary's Catholic Church, and \ncommitted to furthering the work of the Presentation Sisters.\n  For his efforts over these many years, Vi was awarded the Medal of \nDistinguished Excellence, and the Community Volunteer, Excellence in \nEconomic Development award. Vi was the all-around resource center for \nanything going on in Aberdeen. Many benefited from the newspaper \nclippings he sent or handed to people he thought could use them. I \nremember some he sent to me. Vi was a pioneer in regional development \nand he saw that as the future of Aberdeen.\n  Vi is survived by his wife Donna, four children, and five \ngrandchildren. I would like to offer my condolences to the family, \nfriends, and fellow advocates whom Vi touched with his efforts on \nbehalf of the people of northeast South Dakota. They have much to be \nproud of, and it is my hope that their memories will be rich with the \nmany great accomplishments and the lives that Vi touched during his \nlife. Although we will all miss him, his memory will serve as a beacon \nto our young people to better the lives of others and their communities \nthrough the examples he has set.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S781-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING BILL STEWART\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I recognize the \nachievements of someone who has inspired me personally, who has made \nWest Virginians laugh when there is little to laugh about, and whose \ncontribution to my home State cannot be underscored enough.\n  When New Martinsville native Bill Stewart led the West Virginia \nMountaineers into the Fiesta Bowl, he did more than just defeat the \nOklahoma Sooners 48-28. ``Coach Stew,'' as his fans reverently call \nhim, lifted the spirits of our entire State.\n  Since that time, Bill's West Virginia charm has been infectious, his \npress conferences legendary, and his impact on our State's culture \nprofound. Anyone who has played or worked with him loves him. His \narrival on the scene was exactly what the State needed: a good-natured \nunderdog with which people could identify.\n  For West Virginians, December 2007 had been abysmal. Not only did we \nlose a chance at the National Championship, but we lost our coach, \nendured endless ridicule in the media, were constantly told that \nOklahoma would embarrass us--the negativity never seemed to stop.\n  But then Coach Stew stood up, stood proud, and said, with his \ntrademark smile, ``When it gets too tough for everyone else--it's just \nabout right for Billy Stewart.''\n  And he was absolutely right.\n  Now, every time I go home, West Virginians cannot emphasize enough \nthe amount of pride they felt when this coach guided their team into \nthe Fiesta Bowl. West Virginians will never forget Bill's optimism, \nwhen he promised to give the Sooners a good fight; his emotion, when he \nmet quarterback Patrick White at the sideline, grabbed him by the \nhelmet and seemed to say, ``I love you, kid''; his satisfaction, as he \nwatched his team storm the field, victorious; or his own surprise, when \nWVU rewarded Bill with the Mountaineers' head coaching job--a position \nfor which he was too humble to politic, but more than qualified to \naccept.\n  These were iconic moments in West Virginia history--and they pulled \nright on the heart strings.\n  The degree of humility in this coach was absolutely awe-inspiring; \nhis faith jaw-dropping; and his devotion to his players and colleagues \nnothing short of extraordinary. Since those memorable days in Arizona, \nCoach Stew has assembled a top-notch staff, maintained an impressive \nrecruiting class, and recaptured the heart--not just the attention--of \nMountaineer Nation.\n  To me, Bill Stewart embodies all that is good about West Virginia. An \nunlikely but deserving hero, he is a man whose cheerful optimism, \ncharacter and Appalachian charm have given us a reason to cheer again.\n  For that, I express my deepest gratitude and deepest admiration to \nNew Martinsville's favorite son. I am glad that he is a fellow West \nVirginian, I am glad that he is a part of our culture, and I wish him \nthe absolute best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S781-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE DESORMEAUX FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. VITTER.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Jersey urging Congress to enact the ``Clean Railroads Act \n     of 2007''; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n        Whereas, the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination \n     Act of 1995 (``ICCTA''), which established the Surface \n     Transportation Board (``STB'') to assume regulatory \n     jurisdiction over the operation of interstate rail service, \n     is a broad federal railroad law that has been interpreted as \n     forbidding state and local environmental regulatory agencies \n     from overseeing the safe handling of trash or solid waste at \n     solid waste management facilities that are located on \n     railroad property; and\n        Whereas, Congress has eliminated state and local \n     regulation of rail and rail-related operations so that \n     railroads may operate across states and not have to comply \n     with many sets of state and local regulations; yet some solid \n     waste management companies have abused this federal \n     preemption protection by building facilities on railroad \n     property in order to avoid state and local regulations; and\n       Whereas, solid waste management facilities that operate on \n     railroad property are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction \n     of the STB, and therefore are exempt from state and local \n     solid waste permits and regulations designed to promote \n     public health, increase safety, and preserve the environment; \n     yet due to uncertainty in the federal law that grants the STB \n     such jurisdiction, the STB only passively regulates these \n     facilities, so that these facilities are able to escape the \n     regulations that apply to similar facilities located anywhere \n     except railroad property; and\n        Whereas, companies that have taken advantage of this \n     exemption from state and local laws by building solid waste \n     management facilities next to railroad tracks have been able \n     to ignore environmental concerns and the safety and welfare \n     of nearby communities; and\n        Whereas, in 2004, New Jersey implemented regulations that \n     governed operations at rail-hard solid waste management \n     facilities, yet when the State attempted to fine the New York \n     Susquehanna and Western (``NYS'') Railway Corporation for \n     violating these regulations, the railroad immediately filed \n     suit against the State, and the district court of New Jersey \n     ruled that the ICCTA's exemption of railroads and their \n     facilities from state and local oversight preempted New \n     Jersey's regulations; and\n        Whereas, due to limited available disposal options, \n     combined stringent state and local regulations, there has \n     been a recent surge within the construction and operation of \n     these unregulated solid waste management facilities along \n     rail lines in New Jersey and throughout the Northeast; and\n        Whereas, in order to protect its residents from the \n     environmental, safety, and health hazards associated with \n     solid waste management facilities, the State needs the \n     authority to regulate all of these sites, including those \n     located on railroad property; and\n        Whereas, trade associations representing conventional \n     solid waste processors, such as the National Solid Wastes \n     Management Association (``NSWMA'') and the Solid Waste \n     Association of North America (``SWANA''), do not support \n     federal preemption of state and local regulation of rail-\n     based processors and are working to stop allowing rail-based \n     solid waste facilities to sidestep important regulations; and\n        Whereas, Senator Lautenberg and Congressman Pallone have \n     introduced S. 719 and H.R. 1248, respectively, which are \n     identical pieces of legislation that, if passed, would amend \n     federal law to clarify that solid waste management facilities \n     located on railroad property do not fall under the \n     jurisdiction of the STB; and\n        Whereas, S. 719 and H.R. 1248, also known as the ``Clean \n     Railroads Act of 2007,'' would close the federal loophole \n     currently being exploited by solid waste management companies \n     and provide New Jersey and every other state with the clear \n     authority to regulate solid waste management facilities \n     located on railroad property: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       1. This Senate Resolution memorializes Congress to enact S. \n     719 or H.R. 1248, otherwise known as the ``Clean Railroads \n     Act of 2007,'' which would remove the authority to regulate \n     solid waste management facilities located on railroad \n     property from the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation \n     Board, thus allowing state and local authorities to regulate \n     such facilities.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the President of the Senate and attested by the Secretary \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the President and Vice \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the majority and minority \n     leaders of United States Senate and the United States House \n     of Representatives, and each member of the New Jersey \n     congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S784-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. MARTINEZ (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Coleman, \n             Mr. Alexander, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. DeMint):\n       S. 2603.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Baltimore National Heritage \n     Area Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The City of Baltimore contains 24 National Historic \n     Landmarks, 53,000 buildings listed in 52 National Register \n     Historic Districts, 8,000 buildings in 30 local historic \n     districts, and 12 Chesapeake Bay Gateways, nestled in an \n     unparalleled system of parks and waterways, and connected by \n     5 Maryland Scenic Byways and an All-American Road.\n       (2) The Battle of Baltimore represented the definitive end \n     of the American Revolution, secured United States \n     sovereignty, and gave the country 2 enduring symbols: the \n     United States flag and the poem by Francis Scott Key that \n     became our national anthem, ``The Star-Spangled Banner''.\n       (3) The proposed Baltimore National Heritage Area will tell \n     2 of the most significant national heritage stories at the \n     locus of black history and the transformative effects of \n     education, which are the following:\n       (A) Frederick Douglass, who while as a slave learned to \n     read in Baltimore and credited his time in the city as the \n     foundation for his accomplishments; and\n       (B) Thurgood Marshall, whose public school education in \n     Baltimore led directly to his unparalleled contributions to \n     civil rights as an attorney in Baltimore and as a United \n     States Supreme Court Justice.\n       (4) Between the early 1800s and the mid 1900s, about \n     2,000,000 immigrants landed in Baltimore, second only to New \n     York, as a major port of entry into the United States.\n       (5) In 1811, the Nation's first federally funded interstate \n     transportation route, the National Road, begun its journey \n     from Baltimore to the west.\n       (6) Baltimore is the farthest inland east coast port, \n     closest to the Nation's interior. The Chesapeake Bay, the \n     continent's largest estuary, is a magnificent, fertile, \n     natural resource. This special mix gave rise to the largest \n     city in the 6 States of the Chesapeake region, with a \n     cultural landscape unique among world port cities.\n       (7) Although Baltimore is a largely urban environment, a \n     number of important natural and recreational resources can be \n     found within the proposed National Heritage Area boundaries. \n     Beginning with the first city park in 1827, Patterson Park, \n     the city's natural and recreational resources enjoy a \n     noteworthy history. Most remarkable is the city's \n     acquisition, beginning in 1860, of 7 large estates that \n     created the base for the current park system, including \n     Leakin Park that is one of the largest urban wilderness parks \n     remaining on the East Coast.\n       (8) The Baltimore City Heritage Area is a State heritage \n     area designated by the State of Maryland in 2001.\n       (9) The ``Feasibility Study for a Baltimore National \n     Heritage Area'', dated December 2006, found that the proposed \n     area met the National Park Service's interim criteria for \n     national heritage area designation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require certain semiautomatic pistols \nmanufactured, imported, or sold by Federal firearms licensees to be \ncapable of microstamping ammunition; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Crime \nGun Identification Act as an important step to reduce gun violence and \nsupport law enforcement. The bill requires semiautomatic handguns \nmanufactured, imported or sold by federal firearms licensees to be \nequipped with microstamping technology. Congressman Xavier Becerra is \nintroducing a companion measure in the House this week.\n  Nearly 70 percent of homicides in 2006 involved a firearm, and \nhandguns were the weapons of choice for most offenders. Handguns are \nalso the weapons most often used in murders of law enforcement \nofficers. There is an urgent need for effective, high-tech gun-tracing \ncapabilities such as microstamping, which can provide law enforcement \nwith a much-needed investigation resource in solving gun crimes.\n  Microstamping uses lasers to make precise, microscopic engravings on \nthe firing pin and chamber of a weapon, and this information is \ntransferred onto the cartridge casing when the weapon is fired. The \ninformation includes the gun's make, model and serial number, and can \nyield important evidence to law enforcement officers investigating \ncrimes. California has already enacted such legislation, and the \ntechnology has the support of many individuals and organizations, \nincluding Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, the Boston Police Department, \nSeattle Mayor Gregory Nickles, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nCoalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence. Additionally, the National Black Caucus of State Legislators \npassed a resolution supporting the use of microstamping technology.\n  Microstamping is a significant new technology for ballistics \nidentification. Congress should obviously support emerging technologies \nthat enable law enforcement to make more effective use of evidence at \ncrime scenes. Current ballistic analyses, conducted through the \nNational Integrated Ballistic Information Network, depend on the \ntransfer of accidental markings from a gun barrel to bullets and \ncartridge cases, which are then compared to a limited database with \nevidence from other crime scenes.\n  The current Ballistic Information Network has already been an \ninvaluable resource for law enforcement. A remarkable number of crimes \nhave been solved by using it, and it makes sense to invest in the next \ngeneration of ballistic technology. Microstamping in no way replaces \nany of the methods currently used by police to conduct ballistics \ntests, but it would clearly enhance the work currently done by law \nenforcement agencies.\n  FBI data indicate that handguns are used in most homicides, \naccounting for nearly 7,800 murders in 2006. In Massachusetts, violent \ncrime rates are on the rise--growing 11 percent in Boston in 2006. In \n2005, Boston police made a total of 754 gun arrests and 797 illegal \nfirearm seizures. Nevertheless, from 1997 to 2005, shooting incidents \nhave jumped a drastic 153 percent. We can help law enforcement solve \nmore handgun crimes and reduce gun trafficking through the use of \nmicrostamping technology.\n  Bullet casings are often the only evidence left behind at crime \nscenes, particularly in gang crimes such as drive-by shootings. In \nBoston during 2006, bullet casings were recovered from nearly half of \ncrime scenes involving shootings. In those cases, investigators could \nobviously have benefited from knowing the make, model and serial number \nof the guns involved in those crimes. Microstamp information can also \nbe used to identify straw buyers and gun traffickers who supply the \nillegal flow of weapons to violent teens, gang members and other \nprohibited purchasers.\n  Critics of microstamping technology claim that perpetrators engaged \nin crime will be able to subvert the technology by filing the \nmicrostamped information off the weapons. In fact, however, \nmicrostamping is virtually tamperproof. The microstamped information is \ninvisible to the naked eye, and most criminals would be unable to \ndetect it. The microstamp is placed on the firing pin and in the \nchamber of the gun, so even if a perpetrator replaced the firing pin, \nthe information would still be transferred to the casing from the \nchamber.\n  Others argue that criminals will plant cartridges at crime scenes to \ndisrupt investigations. Realistically, however, we know that offenders \nrarely take even the simplest precautions, such as wearing gloves \nduring a burglary, when engaging in criminal behavior.\n  Opponents also contend that microstamping will result in the creation \nof a new national database of gun owners. In fact, it will not result \nin any new database, because it will use information already available \nto law enforcement officers investigating gun crimes. In addition, \nmicrostamped information on bullet casings can be viewed with imaging \nequipment generally found at Federal, State and local forensics \nlaboratories, making it unnecessary to create and maintain special \nequipment or facilities.\n  Finally, critics claim that the cost of adding microstamping \ntechnology is prohibitive. In fact, the technology will be available to \nmanufacturers through a free licensing agreement from its inventor. \nBased on independent estimates, adding the technology to new \nsemiautomatic handguns will cost only 50 cents to a dollar for each \nfirearm produced by large volume manufacturers.\n  Handgun owners and prospective handgun purchasers will not be \nburdened by this legislation. There will be no changes in the \nprocedures or requirements for purchasing handguns. Existing handguns \nand handgun owners will not be affected by this legislation since it \napplies only to new handguns.\n  The technology has been thoroughly tested. Independent examiners have \nfired thousands of rounds from guns with microstamping, and have \nconsistently obtained readable marks on the casings.\n  Microstamping technology is urgently needed by law enforcement and \ncan make a major difference in solving gun crimes. It is cost effective \nand will not impinge on the rights of any gun owners. I urge my \ncolleagues to support law enforcement and reduce gun crimes by enacting \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \n        McCain):\n  S. 2606. A bill to reauthorize the United States Fire Administration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague, Senator Collins, \nalong with Senators Biden and McCain, to introduce legislation that \nreauthorizes the U.S. Fire Administration, USFA.\n  Established in 1974, the USFA provides critical support to 30,300 \nfire departments across our Nation through training, emergency incident \ndata collection, fire awareness and prevention education, and research \nand development activities. Each year, the USFA trains approximately \none million fire and emergency personnel both at the USFA campus in \nEmmitsburg, Maryland, and through distance learning programs. The USFA \nalso offers vital assistance to Federal Emergency Management Agency and \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the development of Federal \npreparedness and response policies.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with my colleagues seeks to \nprovide the USFA with proper resources so\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nthe agency may effectively meet the growing responsibilities of the \nfire service in the 21st century. It contains the following provisions. \nThe USFA Reauthorization Act of 2008 provides $70 million in fiscal \nyear 2009 with 1.3 percent annual increases through fiscal year 2012. \nThe bill expands National Fire Academy training curricula to include \nissues relevant to urban-wildland interface fires, fires involving \nhazardous materials, and fire-based emergency medical services. The \nbill also encourages the expansion of onsite fire training, authorizes \nup to $5,000,000 annually for necessary technology upgrades to the \nNational Fire Incident Reporting System, authorizes the USFA to expand \nresearch activities in relevant topics to urban-wildland interface \nfires, encourages the USFA to adopt national voluntary consensus \nstandards relevant to firefighter health and safety, and requires the \nUSFA to provide greater coordination with other Federal, State and \nlocal agencies on fire prevention and fire-based emergency medical \nservices programs. Finally, the legislation establishes a rotating \nposition at the DHS National Operations Center for State or local fire \nservice officials. This new position will bring the expertise of the \nfire service to the incident management and information sharing \nactivities of the Center.\n  I am pleased to say this bipartisan legislation is supported by the \nCongressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of \nFire Fighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council.\n  The U.S. Fire Administration performs a critical array of duties that \nensure the safety of Americans each day. It is important that we \ncontinue to pledge our support to the agency and our Nation's brave \nfirefighters. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n\n                                S. 2606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Fire \n     Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has \n     dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United \n     States. However, the United States still has one of the \n     highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. In \n     2005, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,675 \n     civilian fire deaths, 17,925 civilian fire injuries, and \n     $10,672,000,000 in direct losses due to fire.\n       (2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line \n     of duty. The United States Fire Administration should \n     continue its leadership to help local fire agencies \n     dramatically reduce these fatalities.\n       (3) Members of the fire service community should continue \n     to work together to further the promotion of national \n     voluntary consensus standards that increase firefighter \n     safety.\n       (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial \n     support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States \n     through training, emergency incident data collection, fire \n     awareness and education, and support of research and \n     development activities for fire prevention, control, and \n     suppression technologies.\n       (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency \n     incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and \n     emergency responders to identify and develop responses to \n     emerging hazards. Improving the data collection capabilities \n     of the United States Fire Administration is essential for \n     accurately tracking and responding to the magnitude and \n     nature of the fire problems of the United States.\n       (6) The research and development performed by the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire \n     Administration, other government agencies, and non-\n     governmental organizations on fire technologies, techniques, \n     and tools advance the capabilities of the fire service of the \n     United States to suppress and prevent fires.\n       (7) The United States Fire Administration is one of the \n     strongest voices representing the fire service of the United \n     States within the Federal Government, and, as such, it should \n     have a prominent place within the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President. I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in \nintroducing legislation to reauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration. \nThe bill would provide additional resources to help the agency meet its \ngrowing responsibilities. We are pleased to be joined by our fellow \ncochairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus--Senators McCain and \nBiden.\n  Since its creation in 1974, the Fire Administration and its Fire \nAcademy have helped prevent fires, protect property, and save lives \namong firefighters and the public. Today, the Fire Administration is \nalso integrated into our national, all-hazards preparations against \nnatural disasters and terrorist attacks.\n  Last month marked the fifth anniversary of the Fire Administration's \nreorganization as part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security. As both Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Committee on Homeland Security and as a cochair of the \nCongressional Fire Services Caucus, I am pleased that the bill being \nintroduced today does much more than reauthorize the Fire \nAdministration.\n  For example, the bill designates $5 million annually to support \nnecessary technology upgrades to the National Fire Incident Reporting \nSystem. This important system helps State and local governments report \nand analyze fires, and allows nationwide sharing of data in standard \nformats. This database--the world's largest collection of fire-incident \ninformation--helps all levels of government to probe the nature and \ncauses of injuries, deaths, and property loss resulting from fires.\n\n  Another vital component of this bill establishes a rotating position \nat the DHS National Operations Center to be filled by a State or local \nfire-service official. In our comprehensive, all-hazards approach to \nmajor disasters, it is just as important to have the fire services \nrepresented at operations center as it is military liaisons.\n  The bill has other important provisions, including provision for a \n1.3 percent annual increase in the initial $70 million authorization \nthrough fiscal year 2012. In addition, the bill expands National Fire \nAcademy training programs to include topics like hazardous-material \nfires and fire-based emergency medical services. It authorizes expanded \nresearch on fires in the urban-wildland interface and in rural areas. \nIt encourages the Fire Administration to adopt national voluntary \nstandards on firefighter health and safety--an important topic, \nconsidering that about 100 brave firefighters lose their lives in the \nline of duty each year, with many more suffering serious injuries.\n  My home state of Maine is keenly aware of the dangers of fire and the \nimportance of effective fire services. Maine is one of the most rural \nstates in the nation and most of its housing stock is wood framed. Some \nhouseholds rely on woodstoves for primary or supplemental heat.\n  According to the Maine Department of Public Safety, nearly 50 Mainers \ndied in fires every year through the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. The average \nso far for this decade is 18, and 2007 produced only 12 fire-related \ndeaths, still too many but a considerable improvement.\n  Maine public-safety officials attribute the decline to factors like \nwider use of smoke detectors and improved building codes--and fire-\nprevention efforts. As our national resource and clearing house for \nfire research, education, and training, the U.S. Fire Administration \ncertainly deserves a share of the credit for my state's progress in \nreducing the pain, devastation, and death wrought by fires.\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\n  I have no doubt the Fire Administration's beneficial effects will \ngrow. Its new campaign for preventing smoking-related home fires is a \nworthy effort. Its growing curriculum of online courses on topics like \nincident command for nursing-home fires, emergency medical service at \nmulti-casualty incidents, and emergency response to terrorism is a \nvaluable resource for firefighters.\n  The U.S. Fire Administration is a fine example of the good that can \ncome of federal, state, and local collaboration to counter an ancient \nthreat and to address new ones. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the reauthorization and improvement of this valuable agency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2607. A bill to make a technical correction to section 3009 of the \nDeficit Reduction Act of 2005; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould better facilitate the DTV transition for rural Americans by \nmaking funds for digital upgrades available sooner to low-power \ntelevision stations and translators. The reason this is imperative is \nthat we don't want to create another ``digital divide'' where rural and \nlow-income areas are not able to reap the benefits of digital TV as \nquickly as their urban counterparts.\n  Under the current statute, the Assistant Secretary for Communications \nand Information at the Department of Commerce must make payments for \nthe low-power TV and translator upgrade program during fiscal year \n2009--October 1, 2008 to September 30, 2009--but may not actually \ndisburse reimbursement payments until after October 1, 2010, which is \n20 months past the DTV transition deadline of February 2009.\n  By having such a long delay for reimbursements, it will inevitably \nhold up the analog to digital upgrades of low-power TV stations and \ntranslators. This would adversely affect viewers since they will not be \nable to receive the benefits that digital signals offer and hence \ncreate this additional ``digital divide'' to these mostly rural and \nlow-income areas where low-power TV and translators typically are \nsituated.\n  This bill would correct this oversight and change the language to \nhave the Assistant Secretary make payments during the fiscal years 2009 \nto 2012, and start providing reimbursements for the upgrade program on \nFebruary 18, 2009, and in doing so will move up the date 20 months to \nbring the upgrade program more in line with the main deadline of the \nDTV transition. This will allow LPTV and translators to be reimbursed \nmore quickly for analog to digital equipment upgrades, which can run in \nthe tens of thousands of dollars.\n  As we all know, in less than 380 days, on February 17, 2009, \ntelevision broadcasts will transition from analog TV signals to an all-\ndigital system and in doing so begin a new chapter of innovation and \nviewing experience. The transition will free up scarce broadcast \nspectrum so that first responders and public safety services have much \nneeded spectrum capacity. It will also provide space for advanced \nwireless technologies, which will bring us improved broadband and \ncommunications services. In addition, the new digital TV signals will \nprovide higher quality video and sound, as well as the opportunity for \nbroadcasters to offer new services such as interactive TV and \nmulticasting, which allows the transmission of several program streams \non one broadcast channel.\n  Consumer awareness of the DTV transition is improving and the \nCommerce Department announced earlier this month that it had already \nreceived requests from more than 2 million households for nearly 4 \nmillion converter box coupons--so demand is strong. More and more \nconsumers are realizing the importance and benefits of the DTV \ntransition. We must not unduly prohibit any American from not reaping \nthe tremendous advantages of digital TV and other services that will \nquickly follow due to the transition. If we don't correct this critical \noversight in the current law, we will do just that, once again \ndisadvantaging the areas and people that have the most to gain from \nthis new technology. That is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues \njoin me in supporting the critical legislation.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                                S. 2607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make improvements to the Small Business Act; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Dole, to \nintroduce the Small Business Women's Procurement Improvement Act, a \nmeasure that would enhance the Small Business Administration's women's \nprocurement program, which was created back in 2000, to provide \ncontracting opportunities to women-owned small businesses in Maine and \nacross the Nation. As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, one of my top priorities is to champion \nour nation's women-owned small businesses and to promote their \ninterests. In these uncertain economic times it is our financial \nstrengths that we must rely upon most. Women-owned small businesses are \none such strength. In recent years, the percent growth in the number of \nwomen-owned firms was nearly twice that of all U.S. firms. Thus, we \nneed to create programs that will continue to grow this vital and \ncrucial resource.\n  Regrettably, the Small Business Administration, SBA, has failed to \nimplement the women's procurement program that was enacted into law \nback in 2000. In December, the SBA finally proposed a rule to implement \nthe program. The SBA had the opportunity to hit a home run, but instead \npublished a rule that is highly deficient and unlikely to have any \npractical effect in helping the Federal Government satisfy its 5 \npercent women's contracting goal. So far, there has been one law--\nenacted back in December 2000--three reports, numerous hearings, and \ntwo proposed rules, and, tragically, it appears that we are no closer \ntoday then we were 7 years ago to helping our nation's small women-\nowned businesses stimulate our economy. What an inconceivable missed \nopportunity for the SBA to help boost our economy by promoting women-\nowned businesses.\n  The SBA's proposed rule has two fundamental flaws which hinder it \nfrom functioning as Congress originally intended. First, the proposed \nrule identifies just four industries, out of more than one hundred, in \nwhich women-owned small businesses are under-represented and eligible \nfor set-asides. According to the Central Contractor Registration, this \ngross disparity means a mere 1,238 businesses across the entire \nNation--or 2 percent of all women-owned small business contractors--\nwould be subject to the proposed rule. Regrettably, only two of these \ncontractors are located in my home State of Maine.\n  Second, for SBA's proposed rule to go into effect, individual Federal \nagencies must first publicly admit to a history of gender \ndiscrimination. I find it difficult, if not impossible, to envision a \nscenario where a Federal agency would make such an admission. \nFurthermore, such an unworkable admission isn't required anywhere in \nthe Small Business Act.\n  To help remedy this appalling circumstance, today we introduce \nlegislation to amend the Small Business Act so that the women-owned \nsmall businesses can finally have a procurement program that makes a \nreal difference, not a 2 percent difference. For example, our bill \nwould substantially broaden the range of applicable business industries \nfor women across this Nation and take down the unnecessary barriers it \nhas recently proposed. Women-owned small businesses deserve more than 2 \npercent of available business industries. These four industries will do \nlittle to nothing to help Federal agencies reach its statutory \ngovernment-wide goal. Sadly enough, one of the industries the SBA has \nselected does not\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\nallow for any private business participation, let alone women business \nparticipation.\n  Our bill also would preclude the SBA from promulgating a final rule \nthat requires individual agencies to admit to past discrimination as a \nprerequisite for participation in the set-aside program. We find it \ndifficult to envision a circumstance in which any agency would make \nsuch an admission. Furthermore, this requirement is not mandated \nanywhere in the Small Business Act.\n  Our bill has gained the support of women-owned small businesses \nacross the Nation including major women's organizations like the U.S. \nWomen's Chamber of Commerce, Women Impacting Public Policy, the \nNational Women Business Owners Corporation, the Women Presidents' \nOrganization, the Women Presidents' Educational Organization, and the \nWomen's Business Development Center.\n  It has been nearly 14 years since the women's 5 percent government-\nwide contracting goal was established in 1994, but since its enactment, \nthe women's contracting goal has never been met. Shockingly, at the \nhistorical percentage rate of increase, it would take until 2019 for \nthis goal to be met--25 years after enactment of the original statutory \nrequirement.\n  According to recent figures, women-owned firms in the U.S. generate \n$1.1 trillion in annual sales and employ 7.2 million people nationwide. \nI take great pride that my own state of Maine is a forerunner for \nwomen-owned businesses with more than 63,000 women-owned firms, \ncreating 75,000 jobs, and spurring more than $9 billion in sales.\n  The SBA must develop a functioning procurement program that will \ncultivate women business so that they in turn can help grow our \nNation's economy. This is why women businesses need a workable \nprocurement program that does not create impenetrable barriers and \nprovide so few business opportunities. Our bill eliminates these \nbarriers and gives women-owned small business a tool they can use that \nwill help them continue to grow our suffering economy. If ever there \nwere a time to secure new avenues to generate revenue and spur the \neconomy, wouldn't that time be now?\n  I urge my colleagues in Congress to support this vital legislation, \nso that we in Congress can make sure that the SBA publishes a \nmeaningful final rule that will assist the Federal Government to \nsatisfy--if not exceed--its government-wide contracting goal, and to \nhelp women-owned small businesses to stimulate our Nation's economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Global Service Fellowship Program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to reintroduce the \nGlobal Service Fellowship Program Act. This important bipartisan bill \nwould provide more Americans the opportunity to volunteer overseas and \nstrengthen our existing Federal international education and exchange \nsystem. The U.S. Government needs to be taking a greater role in \nproviding opportunities for U.S. citizens to volunteer overseas, and my \nbill will enhance U.S. efforts to be a global leader in people-to-\npeople engagement.\n  People-to-people engagement is one of the United States' most \neffective public diplomacy tools and, today more than ever, we need to \nbe investing in every opportunity to improve the perception of the U.S. \noverseas.\n  I often hear from constituents about their experiences volunteering \noverseas and how those experiences impacted their lives and the lives \nof those who they were helping. For example, I received an email from \nEric Englund, from my hometown of Middleton, who wrote, ``[My wife Jane \nand I] have been privileged to participate in international \nvolunteering experiences in 2006 and 2007. In 2006 we spent 4 weeks in \nChina teaching English to Chinese primary and secondary English \nteachers in Xingping, China. * * * In 2007 we spent two weeks in \nTanzania with Habitat for Humanity. . . . We return[ed] from both \nexperiences humbled in the understanding of how lucky we have been and \nhungry to continue to share with others a cultural exchange that is \nhopefully symbiotic in helping us grow/learn/appreciate while at the \nsame time sharing our knowledge, compassion and abilities with \nothers.'' This email captures the life-changing effects that \ninternational volunteering often has on those who choose to commit \ntheir time and resources to volunteering across the globe.\n  Unfortunately, not enough of my constituents are able to volunteer \noverseas because of financial or time-related barriers. In an effort to \nreduce these barriers, I initially introduced, along with my colleague \nSenator Coleman, the Global Service Fellowship bill. Today, I am \nreintroducing a new and improved version of the bill.\n  This new bill builds on the original legislation but now ensures \nfellowships are not taxed, addresses the importance of geographical \ndiversity in the selection process, and increases collaborative \nopportunities for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the \nDepartment of State in establishing and administering the program.\n  Additionally, congressional involvement has been changed from the \noriginal bill. The new version calls on participants to engage with \nMembers of Congress prior to their departure and again upon their \nreturn by providing Members with a brief report of their experiences \nand impact abroad. The changes are intended to ensure that fellows are \nselected based on the merits while preserving for Members of Congress \nthe opportunity, if they so wish, to engage directly with constituents \nwho have volunteered for significant overseas work, whether by a \npersonal exchange, a public event or correspondence that recognizes the \nvalue of their volunteer efforts.\n  Studies have shown that in areas where U.S. citizens have volunteered \ntheir time, money, and services, opinions of the U.S. have improved. \nGreater investment in volunteer opportunities has significant potential \nto improve the image of the U.S. overseas and while we have important \nprograms already in place--the Peace Corps, programs administered \nthrough the Department of State's Bureau of Education and Cultural \nAffairs, and\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\nUSAID's Volunteers for Prosperity--we can and should be doing more.\n  My bill would cost $150 million, which is more than offset by a \nprovision that would require the IRS to deposit all of its fee receipts \nin the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. CBO has estimated that this \noffset will save $559 million over 5 years for net deficit reduction of \njust over $400 million.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues, Senators Coleman, Casey, Cochran, \nKerry, Voinovich, and Whitehouse have joined me in re-introducing this \nbill. This program will be a valuable addition to our public diplomacy \nand our private humanitarian efforts overseas and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 2611. A bill to make bills implementing trade agreements subject \nto a point of order unless certain conditions are met, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a piece of \nlegislation aimed at changing the course of our international trade \npolicy.\n  Part of the problem with our current trade agenda is that there is no \nmechanism to gauge whether the trade agreements we enter into are \nsuccessful--and there is no mechanism to withdraw from agreements that \nhave not been successful.\n  So I am joining with Senators Brown and Casey in introducing the \nTrade Agreement Benchmarks and Accountability Act, which aims to fix \nthat.\n  This is how the bill would work.\n  The legislation would create a point of order in the Senate against \nany future bill implementing a new trade agreement unless it included \nbenchmarks to gauge the success or failure of the agreement.\n  The benchmarks would include, at a minimum, the trade agreement's \nimpact in four respects.\n  First, the number of U.S. jobs created and lost.\n  Second, the impact on U.S. wages.\n  Third, the extent to which U.S. exports gain foreign market access in \nkey sectors.\n  Fourth, the extent to which labor and environmental laws are followed \nand enforced.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative's office could include additional \nbenchmarks in the implementing legislation, at their discretion.\n  Every 5 years, the U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC, would \nassess whether the benchmarks in the implementing legislation had been \nmet.\n  If the ITC determined that any of the benchmarks were not met, there \nwould be an expedited process under which the House and the Senate \nwould consider a privileged resolution to pull the United States out of \nthe trade agreement.\n  The resolution would be considered under expedited rules. The \nresolution would first be referred to the Ways and Means and Finance \ncommittees. If those committees failed to report out the resolution \nwithin a set period of time, either favorably or unfavorably, the \nresolution would be automatically discharged to the full House and \nSenate.\n  The resolution would not be amendable, and a floor vote in the House \nand the Senate on whether to approve the resolution would be mandatory.\n  Let me explain why something like this is necessary.\n  When NAFTA was sent to Congress for a vote in 1993, its advocates \nsaid that there would be 200,000 new jobs created annually as a result.\n  The proponents relied on a study by economists Gary Clyde Hufbauer \nand Jeffrey Schott. Hufbauer and Schott actually predicted that NAFTA \nwould create 170,000 new jobs by 1995. But proponents of the deal in \nthe administration and the Senate rounded this number up to 200,000 \njobs.\n  Well, we now know that NAFTA has resulted in hundreds of thousands of \njob losses. About 412,000 U.S. jobs have been certified as lost to \nNAFTA, under just one program at the U.S. Labor Department.\n  In 2003, 10 years after NAFTA had been approved, I commissioned a \nstudy from the Congressional Research Service, which identified the top \n100 companies that laid off U.S. workers as a result of NAFTA, between \n1994 and 2002.\n  To come up with its data, CRS turned to the Department of Labor, \nwhich has a ``Trade Adjustment Assistance'' program that gives \ntemporary benefits to workers laid off due to NAFTA.\n  This program requires companies to certify that they intended to \neliminate U.S. jobs specifically because of NAFTA. This means that we \ncan directly attribute these job losses to NAFTA.\n  These 100 companies accounted for 201,414 U.S. jobs lost specifically \ndue to NAFTA. In every instance, the companies doing the layoffs \ncertified that the jobs were being cut directly because of NAFTA.\n  If you look at all U.S. companies that participated in the Department \nof Labor program, the total number of U.S. jobs lost due to NAFTA is \n412,177--and that is just under this one program alone.\n  There are some very familiar products, which many people consider \nall-American, now being produced in Mexico.\n  Levi Strauss laid off 15,676 U.S. workers due to NAFTA, and now makes \nits jeans in Mexico.\n  In March 2003, Kraft Foods closed the Nabisco plant in Fair Lawn, NJ, \nthat made Fig Newtons. About 240 jobs were lost right there. Those jobs \nare now in Monterrey, Mexico. Kraft Foods has cut about 955 jobs due to \nNAFTA.\n  Fruit of the Loom laid off 5,352 U.S. workers in Texas alone, and \nthousands more in Louisiana. I have often said that it is one thing to \nlose your shirt, quite another to lose your shorts.\n  In March 2001, Mattel closed its last factory in the U.S.--a western \nKentucky plant that produced toys such as Barbie playhouses and \nbattery-powered pickups for nearly 30 years. The company shifted \nproduction at the 980-employee Kentucky plant to factories in Mexico.\n  John Deere has laid off about 1,150 workers, who made lawn mowers and \nchainsaws, and moved the jobs to Mexico.\n  By the way, in addition to this CRS study, a separate study by the \nEconomic Policy Institute found that the overall net effect of NAFTA \nhad been the loss of nearly 800,000 American jobs.\n  Today, the administration and the U.S. Trade Representative are \ncareful to avoid promising that new trade agreements will create more \nU.S. jobs than the agreements will destroy.\n  But the administration has no problem figuring out how great trade \ndeals will be for other countries.\n  One month before the administration signed a trade agreement with \nKorea last year, our principal negotiator in Korea, Assistant U.S. \nTrade Representative Wendy Cutler, was already touting the benefits \nthat the agreement would offer Korea:\n\n       An FTA with the United States is predicted to produce \n     significant economic benefits for the Korean economy, \n     increasing Korea's real GDP by as much as 2%, establishing a \n     foundation for Korea to achieve per capita income to as high \n     as $30,000, boosting exports to the United States by 15%, and \n     creating 100,000 new jobs.\n\n  Remarkably, Ms. Cutler had no difficulty predicting a specific level \nof job creation in Korea. But she made no similar projection with \nrespect to the United States.\n  Well, we need accountability in trade agreements. And the best way to \ndo that is with benchmarks.\n  This is a forward-looking strategy for a successful trade policy that \nis in America's national interest.\n  Our bill would apply only to future trade agreements. It would not \napply retroactively to NAFTA.\n  I should say, however, that I think it is important that we gauge the \nimpact of NAFTA on U.S. jobs. And I was able to include language in the \nomnibus conference report that will require the Department of Labor, by \nthe end of 2008, to calculate the net impact of NAFTA on U.S. jobs, \nindustry by industry.\n  In any event, we think that this piece of legislation should be \nembraced by the U.S. Congress, because the American people are \nbeginning to demand accountability in trade.\n  On October 4, the Wall Street Journal provided fresh evidence that \nthe American people don't believe that free trade deals are creating \njobs.\n  The Wall Street Journal ran a story with the headline ``Republicans \nGrow Skeptical on Free Trade.''\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\n  The story described a poll, which found that by a two-to-one margin, \nRepublican voters believe free trade deals have been bad for the U.S. \neconomy.\n  It turns out that dissatisfaction with our current trade policy is a \nbipartisan sentiment.\n  The poll found that 59 percent of polled Republican voters agreed \nwith the following statement:\n\n       Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy, because \n     imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made \n     goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced potentially \n     unsafe products.\n\n  Only 32 percent of polled Republican voters agreed with the following \nstatement:\n\n       Foreign trade has been good for the US. economy, because \n     demand for U.S. products abroad has resulted in economic \n     growth and jobs for Americans here at home and provided more \n     choices for consumers.\n\n  This poll suggests a dramatic change in the way Americans view free \ntrade agreements.\n  In December 1999, the Wall Street Journal did a poll that found that \nonly 31 percent of Republican voters thought free trade agreements had \nhurt our country.\n  But in this month's poll, the Wall Street Journal found that the \nnumber of Republican voters opposing free trade agreements had risen \nfrom 31 percent to 59 percent.\n  Clearly, the American people have seen the results of free trade \ndeals, and they don't like what they see. They demand accountability. \nAnd the Trade Agreement Benchmarks and Accountability Act would give \nthem precisely that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide economic stimulus for small business \nconcerns; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, data from the Federal Reserve Bank and the\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nSmall Business Administration show that the home mortgage crisis is \nspreading, making it harder and more expensive for small businesses to \nget loans. Specifically, according to the Federal Reserve's survey, \nmore than 30 percent of domestic banks indicated that they have \ntightened their credit standards for commercial and industrial loans to \nsmall businesses over the past three months. That same survey also \nfound that 80 percent of the domestic banks reported tighter lending \nstandards for commercial real estate loans--the highest percentage \nrecorded since the Fed began posing the question 18 years ago.\n  While that information is troubling, it is not a surprise. So far \nthis fiscal year, the number of loans made through the SBA's largest \nlending program, the 7(a) loan guaranty program, dropped 14 percent \ncompared with the same period last year, and dollar volume fell six \npercent. Lending in SBA's 504 loan program, after growing steadily over \nthe last few years, and being up even three months ago, has gone flat. \nThese figures are alarming because, historically, SBA loan activity has \nincreased when the conventional credit market has tightened and their \nabsence or smaller role in financing is a problem. Why? These two loan \nprograms--the 7(a) Loan Guaranty program and the 504 Loan Guaranty \nprogram--are the largest source of long-term capital to small \nbusinesses in this country. They play an essential role in the \ncontinuum of financing to our small businesses.\n  As we talked to lenders and SBA to try and understand what was \ncausing this trend, we identified several changes we could make to \nSBA's lending programs to try and stimulate the economy. What could we \ndo to get lenders to start lending again, and how could we make it more \naffordable for small businesses? The bill I am introducing today--the \nSmall Business Lending Stimulus Act of 2008--incorporates those \nfindings. We made the changes temporary, targeted, and timely. We have \nevidence that these changes work, because we did something similar, in \na bipartisan way, after the terrorist attacks of 9-11, and it \nstimulated the economy and mitigated job loss and business closures by \npumping almost $3 billion into our local economies.\n  Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet to right the economy, but we \nneed to use every tool at our disposal to mitigate further problems for \nour economy. The SBA's programs are one effective tool. I hope that my \ncolleagues can get behind this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S794-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S794-S796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 445--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \nASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF PAKISTAN BENAZIR BHUTTO, AND \n                    THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 445\n\n       Whereas, on October 18, 2007, former Prime Minister of \n     Pakistan Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan after more than \n     8 years in exile, and was welcomed by supporters numbering in \n     the hundreds of thousands;\n       Whereas hours after her return, a suicide bomb attack on \n     her convoy in Karachi killed 145 people and narrowly missed \n     killing Benazir Bhutto herself, in one of the most violent \n     terrorist attacks in Pakistan's history;\n       Whereas Members of Congress and other friends of Pakistan \n     wrote to President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf weeks prior \n     to the October 18, 2007, attack on Benazir Bhutto, urging \n     support for the democratic process and the provision of \n     adequate security for democratic leaders such as Benazir \n     Bhutto;\n       Whereas Members of Congress and other friends of Pakistan \n     wrote to President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf immediately \n     after the October 18, 2007, attack, urging that a specific \n     set of security measures be taken to protect Benazir Bhutto, \n     and that a full investigation into the October 18 attack be \n     undertaken;\n       Whereas, on November 3, 2007, President Musharraf, in his \n     role as Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan, declared a state of \n     emergency, suspended the Constitution of Pakistan, dismissed \n     Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and other \n     justices of the Supreme Court and provincial High Courts, \n     replacing them with candidates willing to take an oath to \n     uphold his actions during the suspension of the Constitution, \n     and initiated a nation-wide crackdown on political \n     opposition, the media, and the courts of Pakistan that \n     resulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 political \n     opponents;\n       Whereas, on December 15, 2007, President Musharraf lifted \n     the State of Emergency, but did not reinstate the dismissed \n     Supreme Court and High Court justices, allow full freedom of \n     the press, or release all political prisoners arrested during \n     the crackdown;\n       Whereas President Musharraf justified his actions in \n     November 2007 on the grounds of more effective \n     counterterrorism efforts, beginning his November 3 \n     proclamation with the statement, ``Whereas there is visible \n     ascendancy in the activities of extremists and incidents of \n     terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings, IED \n     explosions, rocket firing and bomb explosions and the banding \n     together of some militant groups have taken such activities \n     to an unprecedented level of violent intensity posing a grave \n     threat to the life and property of the citizens of \n     Pakistan'';\n       Whereas, on December 27, 2007, Benazir Bhutto was killed in \n     the garrison town of Rawalpindi;\n       Whereas video footage, backed up by eyewitness testimony, \n     shows at least 1 gunman firing shots at Benazir Bhutto \n     instants before her death, and a second terrorist detonating \n     a bomb near her vehicle shortly after the firing of the \n     gunshots;\n       Whereas the precise circumstances surrounding both the \n     October 18, 2007, attack and the December 27, 2007, \n     assassination remain unclear, and those responsible for both \n     terrorist attacks remain at large;\n       Whereas President Musharraf has accepted the assistance of \n     Scotland Yard in his government's investigation of the \n     assassination of Benazir Bhutto, but has rejected calls for \n     an independent investigation under the auspices of the United \n     Nations;\n       Whereas President Musharraf has used the turmoil following \n     the assassination of Benazir Bhutto to delay elections from \n     their scheduled date of January 8, 2008, to February 18, \n     2008;\n       Whereas Benazir Bhutto's political party and the other \n     major opposition parties had opposed this delay, and have \n     expressed concern that it was motivated by an intention to \n     shape the outcome of the election through poll-rigging or \n     other improper means;\n       Whereas the current political crisis in Pakistan has a \n     grave impact on the national security of the United States, \n     in that it seriously undermines the ability of the Government \n     of Pakistan to devote adequate resources and attention to the \n     fight against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist \n     forces;\n       Whereas the political crisis in Pakistan cannot be resolved \n     without a speedy return to the democratic path, including \n     free and fair elections and restoration of an independent \n     judiciary in accordance with the express wishes of the vast \n     majority of the people of Pakistan;\n       Whereas the United States has provided Pakistan with \n     approximately $10,000,000,000 in assistance over the past 6 \n     years; and\n       Whereas, on December 26, 2007, President Bush signed H.R. \n     2764, an omnibus spending bill which limited United States \n     military aid to Pakistan to counterterrorism and law \n     enforcement activities directed against al Qaeda and the \n     Taliban, and which withheld $50,000,000 in military aid until \n     such time as the Secretary of State reports that Pakistan has \n     restored democratic rights and an independent judiciary, and \n     is making concerted efforts to fight al Qaeda and the \n     Taliban: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) conveys the deep condolences of the people of the \n     United States to the people of Pakistan on the tragic loss of \n     former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and conveys special \n     condolences to the families of Benazir Bhutto and the other \n     victims of this terrorist attack;\n       (2) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the murder \n     of Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007, and the slaughter of \n     at least 165 other Pakistani citizens in this attack and the \n     prior attempt on Benazir Bhutto's life in Karachi on October \n     18, 2007;\n       (3) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to do everything \n     in its power to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to \n     justice, and to permit investigators to follow their \n     inquiries in whatever direction they may lead;\n       (4) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to support and \n     facilitate an independent inquiry into the assassination of \n     Benazir Bhutto;\n       (5) strongly urges the Government of Pakistan to ensure \n     that free and fair elections are held on February 18, 2008, \n     as scheduled, and that independent election monitors are \n     allowed to monitor the elections;\n       (6) calls upon the Election Commission of Pakistan to \n     remove all of the restrictions it\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\n     recently placed on election observation activities, which \n     included efforts to restrict observer movement and the \n     conduct of exit polling on Election Day;\n       (7) urges President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to replace \n     the partisan caretaker governments at the federal, \n     provincial, and district levels with neutral administrations \n     acceptable to all major political parties, and to \n     reconstitute the Election Commission as a genuinely \n     nonpartisan body;\n       (8) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to provide \n     adequate security, including the provision of adequately \n     armored vehicles and properly functioning jamming equipment \n     to help prevent the detonation of explosive devices, to all \n     senior opposition political leaders;\n       (9) calls upon the Government of Pakistan to release those \n     individuals still being detained without charges and to end \n     the ongoing harassment of judges, opposition party activists, \n     and lawyers;\n       (10) calls for the restoration of Pakistan's independent \n     judiciary and an end to all restrictions on the media and \n     freedom of speech;\n       (11) calls upon the President to review all existing United \n     States aid to Pakistan, to ensure that all assistance \n     furthers the common goals shared by the people of Pakistan \n     and the United States, with specific reference to combating \n     violent radicalism and promoting a free and democratic \n     Pakistan; and\n       (12) if the President's review concludes that the \n     conditions described in paragraph (11) are not met, calls \n     upon the President to suspend (until such time as such \n     conditions can be met) the transfer to Pakistan of weapons \n     systems primarily designed and manufactured for combat \n     against a rival state rather than counterterrorism or \n     counterinsurgency.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it has been a month--almost to the day--\nthat former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated.\n  She was murdered barely a mile from the site where her own father, \nalso a prime minister, had been executed by a military strongman nearly \ntwo decades earlier.\n  She was killed by a terrorist attack in the very same park where, \nover half a century ago, Pakistan's very first prime minister was \ngunned down under circumstances that to this day remain clouded in \nmystery.\n  The death of Ms. Bhutto was not the first time a Pakistani leader met \na violent end. But never has the loss been greater--for Pakistan, and \nfor friends of democracy the world over.\n  Never has the danger posed by such a loss been more serious--for \nPakistan, and for the U.S. as well.\n  For many Members of this body, the loss of Ms. Bhutto comes as a \npersonal shock. Some of us knew Benazir during her tenure in office, \nothers had met her during her years of exile.\n  Anyone who encountered the prime minister can understand the sadness \nexperienced by Pakistanis of all political outlooks.\n  The murder of Ms. Bhutto was a human tragedy, but one with \npotentially dire political and national security repercussions. In the \nwake of this shocking act of terrorism, Pakistani democracy remains \nseriously threatened.\n  This is not merely a matter of concern to Pakistan, but to the U.S. \nas well. Until the political crisis in Pakistan is resolved, no \ngovernment in Islamabad will have the focus, the will, or the military \nand intelligence resources necessary to combat the threat of al-Qaeda \nterrorism and Taliban insurgency effectively.\n  The resolution I offer expresses condolences on the murder of Ms. \nBhutto and condemns the cowardly terrorists who cut short the life of a \nbrave and brilliant woman.\n  It calls for a genuinely independent inquiry, to clear up the \nmysteries surrounding this crime--an attack not only on one leader, but \non Pakistani democracy itself.\n  It calls upon the government of Pakistan to return to the democratic \npath by insuring free and fair elections without further delays; by \nreleasing all political detainees; by revoking restrictions on the \npress and free speech; and by restoring a genuinely independent \njudiciary.\n  It also calls on the President of the review all U.S. aid to \nPakistan--as he promised to do immediately after Pakistan's current \nleader suspended the constitution and declared a State of Emergency in \nNovember.\n  The White House review found--to nobody's surprise--that no \nsignificant change in policy was required. The resolution I offer calls \nfor a more targeted and more open-eyed approach.\n  It calls on the President to ensure that all assistance furthers the \ncommon goals shared by the people of Pakistan and the U.S., with \nspecific reference to combating violent radicalism and promoting a free \nand democratic Pakistan; and\n  It calls on the President, if he cannot make such a declaration, to \nsuspend the transfer of weapons systems primarily designed and \nmanufactured for combat against a rival state rather than \ncounterterrorism or counterinsurgency.\n  What does this mean?\n  In simple language, it calls upon President Bush to match his words \nwith deeds. For the good of the Pakistani people, and for the national \nsecurity interests of the United States.\n  The President has often said that a democratic Pakistan will be our \nbest partner in the battle against radical theocrats and bloodthirsty \nterrorists.\n  I wholeheartedly agree--and urge the President to demonstrate that \nhis words are something more than empty rhetoric.\n  Specifically, I urge the President to let the Pakistani military \nestablishment know that the $10 billion we have provided in assistance \nover the past 6 years--the vast bulk of it security assistance--is not \na blank check.\n  The American people and the Pakistani people, have a right to insist \nthat their money is being well spent.\n  At a time when Pakistani soldiers and paramilitary troop are sent to \nfight the Taliban without bulletproof vests, without sufficient \nammunition, sometimes marching through the snow in sandals rather than \ncombat boots.\n  At such a time, does it make sense to spend $500 million on high-\ntech, highcost, nuclear-capable fighter aircraft?\n  Does it make sense to spend hundreds of millions on P-3 naval \nsurveillance aircraft specifically designed to hunt submarines?\n  So far as I know, al-Qaeda has not yet developed a submarine navy.\n  The White House claims that weapons systems like these are indeed \ncounterterrorism tools, but such a claim is an insult to common sense.\n  Yes, it is possible to drop a bomb on a terrorist from a supersonic \njet--and our pilots sometimes do so.\n  Yes, it is possible to use P-3s to track fishing boats rather than \nsubmarines--and our pilots may do that too. But let us get real here.\n  The primary use of these weapons has nothing to do with \ncounterterrorism--using them for this purpose is like swatting flies \nwith a sledgehammer.\n  Moreover, this resolution doesn't even mandate that such weapons \ntransfers be terminated. It merely urges that they be suspended: \ntemporarily put on hold, until the current political crisis has passed.\n  Why is this necessary? For starters, because the administration has \nconsistently failed to apply a common-sense approach to its Pakistan \npolicy--and shows no sign of starting to do so now. I'll give just one \nexample, but I could select from dozens.\n  A few days after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, just as \nPakistani President Musharraf was deliberating over whether or not to \npostpone elections in which Bhutto's party was nearly certain to \nprevail, the Pentagon awarded a contract for fighter jets worth $498 \nmillion.\n  Despite a direct Congressional inquiry several weeks earlier, no \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee--or any other committee, so \nfar as I know--was alerted to this sale.\n  The administration claims this was merely a coincidence, that the \ndeal had been in the works for a long time, that no policy-maker had \nany say in the timing of the announcement.\n  Perhaps that is true. If so, all the more reason for Congress to lay \ndown a marker.\n  I first suggested putting noncounterterrorism security aid on the \ntable on November 4--the morning after President Musharraf effectively \ndeclared a coup d'etat against his own government.\n  I did so moments after speaking by phone with Benazir Bhutto, who had \njust returned to Pakistan from 8 years in exile, and who had narrowly \nescaped a bomb blast on her convoy that left 140 of her supporters \ndead.\n  I urged President Musharraf to step back from the brink of disaster, \nto revoke an order that could destroy his country's democracy.\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\n  I urged President Bush to use U.S. military aid as a carefully \ncalibrated lever, in order to make sure our arms and our money helped \nmake Pakistan more free, and the U.S more safe.\n  Later that week, I unveiled a comprehensive plan for long-term \nengagement with pakistan--or moving our strategy from a ``Musharraf \npolicy'' to a ``Pakistan policy.'' In broad strokes, the basic elements \nof this plan are:\n  Triple non-security aid, to $1.5 billion annually. For at least a \ndecade. This aid would be unconditional: it is our pledge to the \nPakistani people.\n  Instead of funding military hardware, it would build schools, \nclinics, and roads.\n  Condition security aid on performance. We should base our security \naid on clear results.\n  We are now spending well over $1 billion annually, and it is not \nclear we are getting our money's worth.\n  We should be willing to spend more if we get better returns--and less \nif we don't.\n  Help Pakistan enjoy a ``democracy dividend.'' The first year of \ngenuine democratic rule should bring an additional $1 billion, above \nthe $1.5 billion non-security aid baseline, with future non-security \naid calibrated, again, above the guaranteed baseline, to Pakistan's \ninstitutionalization of democratic and good-governance norms.\n  We have got to help moderate, secular political leaders show the \nPakistani people that they can deliver the goods.\n  Engage the Pakistani people, not just their rulers. We need a broad-\nbased engagement, not just government to government.\n  This will involve everything from improved public diplomacy to \nreviewing visa procedures and textile quotas to reversing this \nadministration's shameful torture policies and shutting the prison at \nGitmo.\n  Today is not the day to delve into the specifics of long-term \nstrategy; I will come to the floor at a later date and sketch out this \ncomprehensive plan in greater detail.\n  Today is a time for all of us to come together in support of a \nresolution which, I would hope, expresses the sentiments of every \nMember here.\n  All of us, surely, send our condolences on the death of Benazir \nBhutto, and condemn her bloodthirsty assassins.\n  All of us, surely, want to see her murderers--and those who arranged \nher murder--brought to justice.\n  All of us, surely, want to see Pakistan set firmly back on the \ndemocratic path.\n  All of us, surely, want to make certain that the billions of dollars \nwe send to Pakistan in aid genuinely serve the purposes for which it is \nintended--that it bolsters a stable, moderate, democratic state, and \nthat it supports the battle against the violent terrorist groups who \nhave declared war on the U.S. and Pakistan alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S796-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S796-S797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 66--COMMEMORATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF \nTHE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES \n                      AND THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND\n\n  Mr. WEBB (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Warner, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Hagel, Mrs. Boxer, and Ms. Murkowski) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S.

Madam President, today I wish to introduce a resolution to \ncommemorate the 175th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the \nUnited States and Thailand and the 80th birthday anniversary of His \nMajesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, and also to express our \nrecognition for the success of the recent parliamentary election in \nthat country.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by Senator Biden and Senator Lugar, \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, together with Senators Warner, Dodd, Hagel, Boxer, and \nMurkowski as cosponsors of this resolution.\n  Next month will mark 175 years of a special friendship between the \nUnited States and Thailand, which began with the signing of the Treaty \nof Amity and Commerce in 1833 during the administration of President \nAndrew Jackson, making Thailand our first treaty ally in Asia.\n  Throughout the years, Thailand has often been a close friend and \nstrategic partner of the United States and has proven to be a \ndependable key ally in Southeast Asia, helpful to the United States' \ninterests in that region.\n  Sharing our values of freedom and liberty, Thailand has partnered \nwith the United States in fighting numerous military engagements \nthroughout our history, including its current support in the global war \non terror.\n  In 2003, President Bush declared Thailand a major non-NATO ally, a \ndesignation which represents a close and extensive relationship between \nour two countries.\n  The United States has enjoyed dynamic, vast, and varied cooperation \nand partnership with Thailand, which have not only strengthened our \nbilateral relations, but in many ways have also benefitted the Asian \nregion as a whole.\n  For more than a quarter century, Thailand has been the host country \nof Cobra Gold--the United States annual multinational military training \nexercise--to promote regional stability and security cooperation. As \nanother case in point, the United States and Thailand's joint relief \noperations in the wake of the tragic 2004 tsunami promoted the overall \ncapacity of the international humanitarian forces in providing relief, \nsetting a model for effective humanitarian operations in the region.\n  Madam President, I have visited Thailand many times over the past 25 \nyears and have many friends in that country. I had the privilege of \nvisiting\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\nThailand last year for the first time as a sitting Senator and was very \npleased to see so much cooperation with the United States, particularly \nwith our military. During our meetings, I was also gratified to see \nthat so many Thai military leaders and Government leaders had been \neducated and trained in the United States--leading to the sense of \nlasting friendship and goodwill between our two countries toward our \nmutual interests.\n  On another important point, as was promised at the time of the \npolitical coup, which occurred in 2006, I am very pleased to be able to \nremind and reassure my colleagues that Thailand held democratic, free, \nand fair parliamentary elections in December of last year, marking a \nsuccessful return to full-fledged democracy.\n  So I congratulate the new Thai Government. I look forward to the \ncontinuation of the long tradition of friendship and close cooperation \nbetween Thailand and the United States.\n  I urge quick passage of this resolution, which I now send to the \ndesk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/07/senate-section/article/S797-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4009.
