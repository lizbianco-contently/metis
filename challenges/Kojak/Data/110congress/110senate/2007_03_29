We \nall acknowledge, in the first several days--this is a big bill, and \nstaff will do a lot of work, as it has always done. The managers of the \nbill, both in the House and Senate, majority and minority, will be \nheavily involved in this conference, and other members of the \nsubcommittees--the chairs and ranking members--as necessary will be \ninvolved.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. No matter the time of year \nwe do these supplemental appropriations bills, they are important. It \nis an emergency. That is why we are here.

Mr. President, I understand under the order that there \nwill be 4 minutes equally divided before each amendment.

I see the Senator from Nevada is on the floor, so I \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 752, as modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I understand a modification of my \namendment is at the desk. I call it up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct. The clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 752, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 13 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n\n             salaries and expenses, united states attorneys\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses, \n     United States Attorneys'', $12,500,000, to remain available \n     until September 30, 2008.\n\n                     United States Marshals Service\n\n         salaries and expenses, united states marshals service\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Salaries and Expenses, \n     United States Marshals Service'', $32,500,000, to remain \n     available until September 30, 2008: Provided, That of the \n     amounts made available in this Act for ``Educational and \n     Cultural Exchange Programs'', $15,000,000 is rescinded.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very simply, this amendment reduces \nspending for the Educational and Cultural Exchange Program fund in \norder to provide spending for implementation of the Adam Walsh Act. My \namendment provides funding for the United States Attorneys to prosecute \nsexual predators who target children and also for the United States \nMarshals to track down the nearly 100,000 sex offenders in the United \nStates who have failed to register as a sex offender as required by \nlaw.\n  The bill before the Senate is an emergency spending bill. I strongly \nbelieve that funding the critical programs contained in the Adam Walsh \nAct is an emergency: 100,000 predators on our streets who are \nunregistered as sex offenders. They need to be registered. So that \nparents know where they are so that they can protect their children. \nThat is an emergency.\n  I know some people hold the sincere belief that the Educational and \nCultural Exchange program is very worthwhile. I don't question their \nopinion, but I question whether funding it is truly an emergency. I \nwant to give a few examples of the kind of projects that the \nEducational and Cultural Exchange program funds. Last year, according \nto the State Department Web site, this program funded the following: We \nsent a bluegrass band to China. We taught weaving and dyeing techniques \nwith Uzbek women. We sent jazz musicians to Madagascar. We paid for \nbreakdancers to tour Denmark, Argentina, Croatia, and Kiev. Those may \nbe worthy cross-cultural activities to pursue, but I cannot stand here \nand suggest they are emergencies that are of greater need to fund than \nproviding law enforcement with the resources need to protect our \nchildren, especially at a time of war.\n  Let's use emergency funding for real emergencies in this country. If \nyou are a parent today and you have children out there, knowing where \nthose sex offenders are so you can keep your children safe I would say \ndoes constitute an emergency. I recommend and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a former prosecutor I am a strong \nsupporter of the Marshals Service.\n  We have the Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill to fund \nthe U.S. Marshals Service, and there is already $25 million in this \nbill to support their important work, which is $11 million more than \nwas requested by the President.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada has a lot of appeal. \nWho would not want to support additional funding for the U.S. Marshals \nService, or for a whole lot of other programs, for that matter. Police, \nfire departments, hospitals, schools--the list is limitless.\n  It is unfortunate that the Senator's amendment would be paid for by \ncutting $15 million in this supplemental bill, requested by the \nPresident, to fund international educational and cultural exchange \nprograms. In other words, he reaches across subcommittees to a \ncompletely different budget from that which funds the Marshals Service. \nThat is a mistake. It is a road we should not go down.\n  Should we also take money to train teachers in Afghanistan and use it \ninstead to refurbish public schools in the United States? What about \ncutting funding for reconstruction in Lebanon to pay for new vehicles \nand equipment for our police and fire departments? Or we could cut the \nfunding in this bill to combat the spread of avian flu and use it \ninstead for victims of crime programs or drug treatment programs here \nat home.\n  Any of those amendments would pass overwhelmingly in the Senate.\n  But is that really how we want to do our business? The reputation of \nthe United States today has taken a beating unparalleled in our \nhistory. We are reviled in the Muslim world. Even our traditional \nallies have lost faith in our leadership. During his recent trip to \nLatin America, President Bush encountered this hostility at every stop.\n  Our image has been tarnished, our influence badly eroded. This is an \nemergency bill to combat terrorism, and\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\nthese educational exchange programs, which provide Muslim students and \nprofessionals the opportunity to come to the United States for \neducation and training, are among the most effective ways we have of \ncombating extremism.\n  Exchanges have been shown to reverse negative perceptions and the \nspread of hatred. There are far too few tools at our fingertips that \nare this effective.\n  These funds would support, for example, a first-ever Islamic dialogue \ntwo-way exchange program to foster interfaith dialogue, sports \nexchanges to engage youth and provide the opportunity to visit the \nUnited States and summer programs for Muslim students to learn English. \nThis amendment would cut $15 million in this bill for these programs, \nleaving only $10 million for educational and cultural exchanges for the \nwhole world.\n  I share the Senator's concerns about the Adam Walsh Child Safety and \nProtection Act. We should increase funding for the Marshals Service. \nBut this bill is not the place to do that. This bill is about combating \nterrorism and responding to humanitarian emergencies overseas. It would \nbe a serious mistake to reduce funding for exchange programs that have \nstrong bipartisan support. The President requested these funds, and he \nwas right to do so. We cannot only look inward. We must look outward as \nwell. No programs are more effective in countering the negative \nattitudes about America than the exchanges that bring people here from \ncountries such as Egypt, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Pakistan to meet \nAmericans and experience what life is like in the world's oldest \ndemocracy.\n  I support the intent of the amendment of the Senator from Nevada and \nwill reluctantly vote for it, but if he had been willing, I would have \nbeen happy to have worked with him to obtain additional funds for the \nMarshals Service in the appropriate funding bill. Unfortunately he was \nnot.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I supported that Ensign amendment today \nbecause it is vitally important that we protect our children against \nsexual predators. I did so despite my serious concern about the offset \nused to pay for the program. We should not be cutting funding from the \nState Department's Bureau of Education and Cultural Exchange, ECA. I \nstrongly believe that people-to-people exchange is one of the most \neffective public diplomacy tools we have, and I hope that funding for \nthe ECA will be restored in conference.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Ensign amendment, as modified, is an \namendment that is acceptable to this side. I ask my colleague from \nNevada if he is willing to take a voice vote.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand the Senator wants a rollcall \nvote on this amendment. We will move to that vote. We support the \namendment on this side and yield back our time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mrs. Clinton) and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) would \neach vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT.

SPINACH.\n\n       No funds made available under this Act shall be used to \n     make payments to growers and first handlers, as defined by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of fresh spinach \n     that were unable to market spinach crops as a result of the \n     Food and Drug Administration Public Health Advisory issued on \n     September 14, 2006.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, my amendment simply states that no funds \nin this act shall be used to make payments to spinach producers.\n  The House version of this bill includes $25 million for spinach \ngrowers, which all of us know has no place in this bill. Last week, the \nSenate spoke unanimously and we voted to block this spending from our \nbudget process last year. I am asking all my colleagues to support the \nremoval of this wasteful spending in this emergency war supplemental \nbill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment by the Senator from South \nCarolina is a solution looking for a problem. I sit on the \nAppropriations Committee. I was there throughout the entire committee \nmarkup. There was never any money for spinach in the Senate version of \nthis bill. There is not now any money for spinach in the Senate version \nof this bill, so adoption of this amendment will not change the \nsubstance of this bill one iota. But if the Senator insists, we will go \nahead and move forward on his amendment. We are happy to take it by a \nvoice vote if the Senator would consider that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I think it is important this body be on record. This will \nbe a matter of conference, and I think we all need to be on record \nshowing we do not want it in the final bill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute 14 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I tell my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, there is no money in the Senate bill for spinach. We do know \nthere are issues out there affecting our agricultural communities \nacross the Nation. The bill that is before us addresses many of those \ncritical issues. This is a supplemental emergency bill, and when there \nare emergencies, we are responsible for taking care of them. But the \namendment of the Senator from South Carolina will make no difference in \nthis bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I will use leader time. Mr. President, we are trying to get \na lot of things done today to finish this bill. There are important \ncommittees wanting to meet. Everyone should understand every Democrat \nis going to vote for this amendment. This is a waste of time. Everyone \nwho is going to be on conference knows the Senate is voting for this \namendment. I think it is an effort to slow things down today. I think \nit is unnecessary. We are all going to vote for this, but if we want to \nwaste 15 minutes of the people's time, we can do that. The Senator has \nthat right.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the next amendment in order is the \nSanders amendment, No. 737. This amendment has also been agreed to on \nboth sides. If the Senator from Vermont wishes to, he may speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Pursuant to the agreement reached last night, I call up an amendment \nI have at the desk, Sanders amendment No. 737, as modified by No. 808.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Reed, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 737.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide funds for the weatherization assistance program)\n\n       On page 99, line 4, strike ``ties'' and insert ``ties: \n     Provided further, That $229,500,000 of the amount provided \n     shall be used for the weatherization assistance program of \n     the Department of Energy''.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is a bipartisan amendment \ncosponsored by Senators Sununu, Bingaman, Menendez, Kerry, Harkin, \nDodd, Wyden, and Clinton. It is also strongly supported by the AARP.\n  This modification, which has the bipartisan support of the \nAppropriations Committee, would partially restore funding for \nweatherization programs. The amendment does not use new money. It \nsimply instructs the Department of Energy to use its fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations to increase the amount it will spend on weatherization \nby $25 million over its current plan.\n  I think all of my colleagues know the weatherization program is \nimportant for a number of reasons. First, when people have a limited \namount of money, it is absurd that their scarce resources simply go up \ninto the air because they do not have the money to adequately insulate \ntheir walls or their roofs.\n  Secondly, if we are serious about global warming, we had better move \ntoward energy efficiency. We are wasting huge amounts of energy by \nseeing people living in homes with inadequate weatherization.\n  I would ask strong support from my colleagues for this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides. I believe we can do it on a voice vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, all time is \nyielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 737) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are moving rapidly to a finish. We \nhave one final amendment that needs to be voted on. Then we will have a \nmanager's package and final passage shortly. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 739\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 739.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 739.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To appropriate an additional $1,500,000,000 for Procurement, \nMarine Corps, to accelerate the procurement of an additional 2,500 Mine \n       Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles for the Armed Forces)\n\n       At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1316. ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR PROCUREMENT, MARINE CORPS, \n                   FOR ACCELERATION OF PROCUREMENT OF ADDITIONAL \n                   2,500 MINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED VEHICLES \n                   FOR THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Additional Amount.--The amount appropriated by this \n     chapter under the heading ``Procurement, Marine Corps'' is \n     hereby increased by $1,500,000,000, with the amount of the \n     increase to be available to the Marine Corps for the \n     procurement of an additional 2,500 Mine Resistant Ambush \n     Protected (MRAP) vehicles for the regular and reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces by not later than December 31, \n     2007.\n       (b) Supplement Not Supplant.--The amount available under \n     subsection (a) for the procurement of vehicles described in \n     that subsection is in addition to any other amounts available \n     under this chapter for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. This amendment is very straightforward. This amendment \nmoves up $1.5 billion into the supplemental from the 2008 budget. The \neffect will be, it will add an additional 2,500 MRAP vehicles into the \nfield faster. These are the vehicles with the V-shaped hull. This \nincreases the security of our troops inside these vehicles--who are now \nriding in humvees--three to four times.\n  What it will mean is it is an opportunity to provide 10,000 to 30,000 \nof our troops four times more protection than they now get riding \naround in the humvees when they are attacked by IEDs. That is tens of \nthousands of Americans who won't be severely injured or killed.\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Staff of the Army \nboth have said they need this money moved up so they can get these \nadditional vehicles into the field earlier. I cannot think of a better \nway to explain this amendment than using the words of the Commandant of \nthe Marine Corps when I spoke to him yesterday.\n  He said: Senator, this is the highest moral imperative I have as a \nCommandant of the Marine Corps.\n  I hope we will move this money up. I hope we will pass this \namendment. It literally, not figuratively, will save lives.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I raise a point of order. Under rule XVI, \nsection 1711 of the bill is legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  Section 1711 of the substitute amendment makes changes to the \nimmigration code's bars on entry to the United States for individuals \ntied to terrorist activity or groups. Although I agree with the stated \npurpose of this provision--to allow the Hmong and other groups that do \nnot pose a threat to the United States to enter this country--I object \nto the language of this provision and have introduced two amendments to \ncorrect that language.\n  Everyone agrees that groups such as the Hmong and the Montagnards, \nwho fought bravely alongside U.S. forces during the Vietnam war, should \nnot be barred from entering this country. If section 1711 were tailored \nto aid the Hmong and other groups that do not pose a threat to the \nUnited States, I would have no objection to such a legislative \nproposal.\n  Unfortunately, the text of section 1711 does much more than simply \nallow the Hmong to remain in this country. The provision in this bill \nwould extend the waiver authority in current law to groups that are \ndefinitely not friends of the United States--including to members of \ngroups that the Secretary of State has designated as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations.\n  Current law bars, without exception, anyone who is a member or a \nrepresentative of a terrorist organization from gaining admission to \nthe United States. Section 1711 would remove this categorical bar and \nallow members of even Tier I terrorist organizations to seek a waiver \nand admission to this country.\n  Tier I terrorist organizations include groups such as the Al-Aqsa \nMartyrs Brigade, the group that has been responsible for the majority \nof suicide bombings in Israel in recent years. Section 1711 would \nextend waiver authority to the Armed Islamic Group and to the Salafist \nGroup for Call and Combat, the two principal terrorist groups that have \ncarried out a bloodthirsty campaign massacres, abductions, and rapes in \nAlgeria over the last 15 years. The provision in the Senate substitute \nwould extend waiver authority to Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian \nIslamic Jihad, and the Senate bill would even extend waiver authority \nto al-Qaida.\n  I do not think that there is a single Member of this body who \nbelieves that any member of al-Qaida, Hamas, or Hezbollah should ever \nbe considered for admission to this country. Yet the Senate bill would \nallow members or representatives of all of these groups to be \nconsidered for entry to the United States.\n  Another problem posed by section 1711 of the Senate bill is that it \nwould also make it very difficult to bar entry to someone who has given \nmaterial support to a terrorist organization. The section would \neffectively require the Department of Homeland Security to prove a \nnegative--to show that an individual did not act under duress--when it \nseeks to bar someone who has given material support to terrorism from \nentering this country.\n  Imagine a situation, for example, where DHS learns that an Iraqi \nseeking admission to this country had helped plant improvised explosive \ndevices in Iraq. Approximately 1,000 U.S. soldiers have been killed by \nIEDs since the beginning of the Iraq war. And suppose\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\nthat this hypothetical individual claimed that he acted under duress--\nthat some unnamed person forced him to plant IEDs. Under the Senate \nbill, DHS would have to prove that this person did not act under duress \nin order to bar him from the United States. This makes no sense. If we \nlearn that someone has provided material support to terrorism, and that \nperson seeks a waiver and entry to this country, at the very least, it \nis that person who should bear the burden of proving that he acted only \nunder duress.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I have filed two amendments that are designed \nto address these problems with section 1711. I have concluded, however, \nthat there is no reason at all to enact this provision on the emergency \nwar supplemental. There is no reason that this measure cannot be \nenacted through regular order. To that end, I will introduce \nlegislation this week that will provide relief from terrorism-related \nimmigration bars to the Hmong and other groups that do not pose a \nthreat to the United States.\n  Everyone agrees that groups such as the Hmong should not be barred \nfrom the United States. Moving such a bill through regular order will \nalso protect the rights of the minority, and allow the full Senate to \nensure that this legislation does not include the excesses that appear \nin section 1711. We all agree that we should help the Hmong. But I \nwould venture that we would also all agree that we should not extend \nimmigration waiver authority to members of Hamas and al-Qaida.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the supplemental contains a provision, \nsection 1711, which was carefully worked out through discussions \nbetween my office, the offices of Senator Specter, Senator Brownback, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Coleman and Senator Feingold, as well as with \nrepresentatives of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department \nof Justice, the Department of State, and the National Security Council.\n  This provision contains six subsections, (a) through (f).\n  Subsections (a) and (d) were written by the administration.\n  Subsections (b) and (f) were written by the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl.\n  Subsection (c) provides an exception for cases involving duress, \nwhich is consistent with the administration's policy except that this \nprovision would codify it into law.\n  Section (e) is a reporting requirement.\n  That is the whole provision. It represents months of discussion and \ncompromise on an issue that has been a focus of concern of faith-based \norganizations and humanitarian organizations, conservative and liberal, \nDemocratic and Republican.\n  Here is the background.\n  Current law, as a result of overbroad amendments in the PATRIOT Act \nand Real ID Act, has been used to bar refugees and asylum seekers who \nwere either members of groups who fought on the side of the United \nStates, such as the Hmong, the Montagnards, and the Northern Alliance \nin Afghanistan, or who were the victims of terrorist groups and forced \nto provide ``material support,'' such as food, shelter, or other \nservices.\n  Administration officials have acknowledged that they have been \ninexcusably slow to deal with this problem. Thousands of refugees and \nhundreds of asylum seekers have been in limbo as a result. We now face \nthe additional problem of Iraqi refugees, 7,000 of whom the President \nsays should be admitted to the United States, being barred from \nadmission unless we fix the law.\n  After considerable prodding, the administration has moved in the \nright direction. Two weeks ago, it took another welcome step, although \nwe have not yet seen the results of this reported change of policy.\n  The number of refugees admitted to the United States would not be \nincreased or decreased by this provision. That is determined by the \nnumerical limit set by the President each year and by the amount we \nappropriate for refugee admissions.\n  Numerous editorials have described the horrific consequences for \nrefugees who have been victimized by current law.\n  Just the titles of these editorials tell the story: ``Shutting Out \nTerrorism's Victims,'' ``Doctors Without Refuge,'' ``Anti-terror laws \nkeeping out old Vietnam allies,'' ``Punishing the Persecuted,'' ``U.S. \ndenies refuge to friends, the abused,'' ``The Refugee Mess,'' \n``Excluding Friends,'' and finally, ``Fix This Law.''\n  I will ask that just three of these editorials be printed in the \nRecord at the close of my remarks.\n  This provision is a compromise that would get our law back in sync \nwith our values, but now the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, has raised \na rule XVI point of order against this provision and had it stricken \nfrom the bill.\n  It is regrettable that one Senator, for whatever reason, has decided \nto torpedo this bipartisan effort. We have worked with the \nadministration. We have worked with refugee organizations that know the \nhardship current law is causing for thousands of innocent people, \nlegitimate refugees and asylum seekers, who have been denied admission. \nWe have worked to find a reasonable middle ground.\n  But that isn't good enough for the Senator from Arizona, so we are \nback to square one. Individuals who fought alongside the United States \nin Vietnam, in Afghanistan, and elsewhere will continue to be barred \nunder current law. Our provision would have fixed this illogical, \nunfair result, but now that provision has been stricken so those former \nallies--the Hmong, the Montagnards and others--will remain excluded.\n  Innocent victims of the material support bar will continue to wait \nfor the Federal bureaucracy to address their cases--a wait that is well \ninto its third year. Victims of terrorist groups like the FARC in \nColombia or the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda get no help from the \nCongress.\n  I regret this action by the Senator from Arizona. By striking this \nprovision he ensures the perpetuation of a policy that is contrary to \nour values, to our morals, and to our national traditions.\n  I wish to thank all Senators who have joined in this effort but \nparticularly Senator Brownback, Senator Specter, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Coleman, and Senator Feingold. I also wish to thank \nrepresentatives of the humanitarian and other groups who have provided \nhelpful information and advice, as well as officials in the \nadministration who have made a sincere effort to work with us.\n  While the Senator from Arizona has singlehandedly prevented us from \nmoving forward at this time, we will continue to work together to fix \nthe law in a manner that reaffirms our commitment to the words that are \ncarved in the Statue of Liberty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \neditorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 2006]\n\n                            The Refugee Mess\n\n       The Bush administration planned to admit 70,000 refugees \n     this past fiscal year; Congress provided funding for 54,000. \n     In the event, the United States admitted fewer than 42,000--a \n     figure significantly lower than in either of the previous two \n     years. The main reason for the shortfall in this crucial \n     humanitarian program, according to recent State Department \n     testimony before Congress, is the irrationally broad \n     definitions in current law regarding terrorism, terrorist \n     groups and material support for terrorism--definitions that \n     end up excluding as terrorists people who should be \n     protected.\n       The law bars as refugees people who have been members or \n     supporters of any group with ``two or more individuals, \n     whether organized or not, [which] engages in, or has a \n     subgroup which engages in'' activities as broad as using an \n     ``explosive, firearm or other weapon or dangerous device.'' \n     The result has kept out the sort of people America's \n     traditionally generous refugee policy was designed to help.\n       The law gives the administration some waiver flexibility, \n     which it rightly has begun using recently on behalf of many \n     ethnic Karen and Chin victims of the Burmese military junta. \n     But that is only a partial fix, for the administration does \n     not have the power to admit refugees who were members of \n     groups that bore arms--even those allied with this country. \n     So the law continues to keep out what Ellen Sauerbrey, \n     assistant secretary of state in charge of refugees, recently \n     described to a Senate subcommittee as ``other meritorious \n     cases, such as Cuban anti-Castro freedom fighters, Vietnamese \n     Montagnards who fought alongside of U.S. forces and Karen who \n     participated in resistance against brutal attacks on their \n     families and friends by the Burmese regime.''\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\n       The administration seems newly open to the idea of fixing \n     the law to give itself flexibility concerning members of \n     groups that meet the absurdly broad definition of terrorist. \n     That would be a breakthrough. A country's willingness to \n     welcome victims of repressive governments and war zones is a \n     measure of its values, and this country has traditionally led \n     the world in refugee resettlement. Not every armed group is a \n     terrorist organization; American policy should not treat \n     victims of the worst sort of violence like perpetrators of \n     it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 2006]\n\n                         Terrorists or Victims?\n\n       In Sierra Leone there is a woman who was kept captive in \n     her house for four days by guerrillas. The rebels raped her \n     and her daughter and cut them with machetes. Under America's \n     program to resettle refugees, she would be eligible to come \n     to safety in the United States. But her application for \n     refuge has been put on indefinite hold--because American law \n     says that she provided ``material support'' to terrorists by \n     giving them shelter.\n       This law is keeping out of the United States several \n     thousand recognized refugees America had agreed in principle \n     to shelter. By any reasonable definition, they are victims, \n     not terrorists.\n       A Liberian woman was kidnapped by a guerrilla group and \n     forced to be a sexual slave for several weeks. She also had \n     to cook and do laundry. These services are now considered \n     material support to terrorists. In Colombia, the United \n     Nations will no longer ask the United States to admit dozens \n     of refugees who are clearly victims, since all their \n     predecessors have been rejected on material support grounds. \n     One is a woman who gave a glass of water to an armed \n     guerrilla who approached her house. Another is a young man \n     who was kidnapped by paramilitary members on a killing spree \n     and forced to dig graves alongside others. The men, many of \n     whom were shot when their work was finished, never knew if \n     one of the graves would become their own.\n       The law makes no exception for duress. It also treats any \n     group of two or more people fighting a government as \n     terrorists no matter how justified the cause, or how long ago \n     the struggle. So the United States has turned away Chin \n     refugees, for supporting an armed group fighting against the \n     Myanmar dictatorship, which has barred them practicing their \n     religion. The United States has acknowledged that the law \n     would also bar Iraqis who helped American marines find \n     Jessica Lynch.\n       The law does not formally reject these applicants but \n     places them on indefinite hold. No one accused of material \n     support has ever had that hold lifted. The Department of \n     Homeland Security can supposedly waive the material support \n     provision but has never done so.\n       Clearly, Congress needs to add an exception for duress, \n     allow the secretary of state to designate armed movements as \n     nonterrorist, and allow supporters of legitimate groups to \n     gain refuge. These changes would pose no risk of admitting \n     terrorists to the United States and would keep America from \n     further victimizing those who have already suffered at the \n     hands of terrorist groups.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Jan. 10, 2007]\n\n               U.S. Denies Refuge to Friends, the Abused\n\n       Franz Kafka, Czech writer of the surreal and absurd, could \n     have imagined this, perhaps: A young Hmong man fights with \n     Americans against the Communist Laotian government. Decades \n     later, he is accepted into the United States as a refugee. \n     But he can't get a green card that will allow him to remain \n     permanently and work in the United States. He's run afoul of \n     an anti-terrorism law prohibiting asylum for people who have \n     provided ``material support'' to terrorists. Incredibly, he's \n     not alone, a situation that requires the remedial action \n     promised by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick \n     Leahy, D-Vt.\n       The issue isn't the law itself but its interpretation by \n     the Department of Homeland Security. The department's \n     definition of ``material support'' for terrorism is so broad \n     it has caught, among others, a refugee nurse from Colombia \n     who was kidnapped and forced to treat a member of a guerrilla \n     group.\n       Even strong Bush administration supporters--the \n     conservative Hudson Institute; Gary Bauer, president of \n     American Values; and the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics \n     and Religious Liberty Commission--are outraged by Homeland \n     Security's inflexibility. In words he probably thought he \n     would never utter, the Hudson Institute's Michael Horowitz \n     says, ``The key to ending these policies is in the hands of \n     the new Democratic majority'' in Congress.\n       Leahy, a persistent critic of the ``material support'' \n     provision, has promised hearings on the issue. He should be \n     pressed to follow through. It's beyond outrageous that a law \n     intended to help protect Americans from terrorists should be \n     used to punish old allies and further terrify victims seeking \n     refuge from the abuse they suffered in their home countries.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I turn now to an issue that should be of concern to us \nall, and that is the safe transport of our civilian contractors into \nand out of Iraq and Afghanistan. On occasion, these U.S. citizens are \nflying on poorly regulated charter aircraft that are ultimately paid \nfor by funds provided by Congress to the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of State.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I believe that I recently read about this issue in the \npress. I am concerned as well that the lack of regulation and oversight \nof these charter aircraft put our citizens at risk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am also informed that the aircraft, air carriers, and \nair charter providers being used to provide the charters for our \ncontractors in Iraq are, in some cases, using poorly trained crews to \nfly outdated and poorly maintained aircraft. The Senate Armed Services \nCommittee will most likely address this matter during their \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill. We \nshould consider requiring that air charter operates in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, funded either directly or indirectly by congressional \nappropriations, meet safety and maintenance standards equal to those \nrequired by charters in the U.S.and European Union.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree that air transport safety of our citizens in Iraq \nand in Afghanistan is an important issue and I endorse your comments on \nthis matter. We should work to take the steps needed to ensure the \nsafety of our civilian contractors.\n\n\n                   Geothermal Energy Research Funding\n\n  Mr. REID. I rise to enter into a brief colloquy with Senator Dorgan, \nchairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee, regarding section 3201 of title III of Senate amendment \nNo. 641 to H.R. 1591, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2007. I thank the Senator for including in the \ncommittee's substitute amendment the language that I requested to \nensure that important geothermal energy research can continue in fiscal \nyear 2007, instead of being closed down pursuant to the \nadministration's ill-advised spending plan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the leader for his support and continuing \ninterest in geothermal and renewable energy. The committee's substitute \namendment provides $22,762,000 for geothermal energy research at the \nDepartment of Energy in fiscal year 2007. This is the same level of \nfunding as provided in fiscal year 2006. After the administration \nproposed terminating the geothermal research program in its fiscal year \n2007 budget request, the Senate Appropriations Committee rejected that \nproposal last year in its report accompanying the fiscal year 2007 \nenergy and water appropriations bill, S. Rept. 109-274. Section 3201 \nwill ensure continuation of this vital program.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his support for \nthe geothermal energy program and his leadership on national energy \npolicy. As the Senator knows, geothermal energy is a very important \nresource for Nevada and all Western States to develop to help address \nour national energy and environmental security problems. There have \nbeen several new reports in the past few months from the Geothermal \nEnergy Association, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology that show the tremendous untapped \npotential of this renewable resource. Geothermal energy is clearly an \nimportant resource that can provide very valuable clean, baseload \npower. Its advantages are many and obvious, and the Department of \nEnergy should be expanding its efforts in this area not reducing them.\n  Given the hostility of the Department of Energy, DOE, and the \nadministration toward expanding our Nation's massive geothermal energy \npotential through research and deployment, can the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee convey any specific intent about how the \nappropriated funds in this amendment should be used?\n  Mr. DORGAN. First of all, the department should continue critical \nefforts to support new technology and deployment, including funding of \nexisting contracts and awards under previous solicitations, but the \ndepartment should be rapidly implementing and supporting the geothermal \nprovisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Based upon the studies and reports the Senator from Nevada has \nmentioned, it should also be a priority for the department to support \nresource development and exploration technology, including continued \nboth existing and new Geothermal Resource Exploration and Development, \nGRED, efforts that are underway at the DOE.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comprehensive \nanswer. I hope that as we consider the fiscal year 2008 energy and \nwater appropriations bill, Congress will provide expanded support for \nthe geothermal energy program, along with more specific guidance as \nneeded by the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's views on the importance of \nthis program and share the Senator's commitment to ensuring an \neffective DOE geothermal program that works to expand our Nation's use \nof this important, renewable energy resource.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss a matter of \nthe utmost importance, a pay raise for judges and justices of the \nUnited States.\n  The salaries of article III judges are inadequate for the stature and \nduties that are attendant to the job. The low salaries threaten the \nindependence and excellence of the judiciary.\n  The Framers sought to ensure that the Federal judges would be \nindependent--free from persuasion--to impartially apply the law. \nAlexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist No. 79: ``Next to permanency \nin office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the \njudges than a fixed provision for their support. . . . In the general \ncourse of human nature, a\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\npower over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will.''\n  For this reason, though Congress was charged with providing for the \njudiciary's support, judges were given salary protection in the \ncompensation clause in article III, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. \nThis clause provides that ``the Judges, both of the supreme and \ninferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good Behavior, and \nshall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which \nshall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.'' The \nFramers gave judges salary protection so that they could be \nindependent, free from the threat of salary diminution by Congress. \nThey recognized that independence was key to the ability of judges to \nimplement the rule of law without fear or favor. Judicial independence \nis the cornerstone of our legal system, which has been the model for \njudiciaries throughout the world.\n  This constitutional protection against salary diminution, so central \nto judicial independence, is undermined when judicial salaries are \nallowed to steadily decline through neglect. And the independent \njudiciary our forefathers envisioned is undermined when Congress fails \nto attend to the needs of its principals and insists on tying of their \nsalaries to those of elected leaders.\n  The last time Congress significantly raised the pay of Federal judges \nwas in 1989, when the Ethics Reform Act raised their salaries by 25 \npercent. At the same time, however, the act curtailed judges' ability \nto earn outside income. Although the act provided for annual cost-of-\nliving adjustments, these annual increases have not been realized due \nto congressional inaction in 5 of the last 13 years. Thus, the real pay \nof judges has continued to decline--12 percent since the Ethics Reform \nAct was enacted. The decline of judicial salaries since 1969 is even \nstarker--the real pay of district judges has decreased by nearly 25 \npercent since 1969. During the same time period, the salary for the \naverage American worker increased by about 19 percent.\n  Obviously, we cannot equate the judges' pay with that of ordinary \nworking Americans. No one would argue that Federal judges' salaries are \nworse than those of the vast majority of American taxpayers. However, \nFederal judges' pay has not kept pace with the salary increases of \ntheir peers within the legal profession. In 1969, Federal judges' \nsalaries exceeded those of top law school deans by 21 percent. Today, \nin contrast, Federal district judges earn about half as much as deans \nat these law schools. In fact, the salary of a district judge today--\n$165,200--is a mere $20,000 more than what a first year associate at a \nNew York law firm earns. Partners in law firms often earn an excess of \n$1 million per year.\n  Nor have judicial salaries kept up with the salaries of other \ngovernment servants. The Chief Justice of the United States earns \n$212,100, while the Chief Learning Officer at the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation earns up to $257,134. Many other government \nemployees can receive in excess of $200,000 per year in compensation, \nwhile judges for the courts of appeal earn $175,100 and district court \njudges earn $165,200.\n  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy have both recently \naddressed the toll that these comparatively low judicial salaries are \ntaking on his fellow justices and judges. On February 14, 2007, Justice \nKennedy addressed the Judiciary Committee and related that in more than \n30 years as a judge, he has never seen his ``colleagues so dispirited \nas at the present time.'' He testified that ``if there is a continued \nneglect of compensation needs,'' he is concerned that low morale will \nlead to a judiciary that ``will be diminished in its stature and its \ncapacity.'' Chief Justice Roberts also addressed this problem, devoting \nhis entire 2006 Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary to the topic. \nHe raised concerns that the low salaries of judges threaten the ability \nof the judiciary to draw the best and the brightest legal minds into \nservice. The Chief Justice raised the alarm that ``without fair \njudicial compensation we cannot preserve the quality and independence \nof our judiciary, which is the model for the world.'' Further, he fears \nthat the relative inadequacy of judicial compensation is cause for \njudges to leave the bench for more lucrative careers elsewhere. He \nwrote that ``[i]f judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a \ndistinguished career and instead becomes a stepping stone to a \nlucrative position in private practice, the Framers' goal of a truly \nindependent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy.''\n  On a related note, I would like to address the notion that judicial \nsalaries should be linked to salaries for Senators and Members of the \nHouse. Judges should not be held hostage because political winds make \nit difficult for elected leaders to raise their own salaries. It is \nhigh time to dispense with the idea that the two ought to be linked. \nThe judicial branch is separate but equal to the legislative branch, \neach with its own needs, each of equivalent stature. We cannot continue \nto humble the judiciary, neglecting our constitutional mandate to \nprovide for its support, ignoring its independence, by tying judges' \ncompensation to our own.\n  The problems of inadequate judicial compensation and the linking of \njudicial salaries to those of elected leaders are not new. Chief \nJustice Rehnquist raised the inadequacy of judicial compensation for \nnearly 20 years, and the National Commission on the Public Service--the \n``Volcker Commission''--addressed judicial pay increases and linkage in \nits 2003 report on revitalizing the Federal Government. The Commission \nrecommended a substantial pay raise for judges, calling the judicial \ncompensation ``the most egregious example of the failure of federal \ncompensation policies.'' The Commission also recommended breaking the \nlink between salaries for Members of Congress and those for judges. The \nCommission admonished Congress that ``judicial salaries must be \ndetermined by procedures that tie them to the needs of the government, \nnot the career related political exigencies of members of Congress.'' \nThe American Bar Association and the Federal Bar Association have also \nendorsed increasing judicial salaries and delinking judicial salaries \nfrom those of elected leaders.\n  It is imperative that Congress address a judicial salary increase \nsoon and decouple the salaries of judges with those of Members of \nCongress. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to ensure that \nthe salaries for our judicial brethren are commensurate with the duties \nand stature of their positions and that salary policy respects the \nindependence of this coequal branch of government. Our failure to act \nprevents us from showing proper respect to a coordinate branch of our \nconstitutional government.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill contains $121.7 billion in funding, approximately $19 billion \nabove the President's request, and is replete with earmarks and other \nnonemergency spending. Additionally, this bill would establish a \ntimeline for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, regardless of \nthe conditions there. Such a mandate would have grave consequences for \nthe future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East and the security \nof Americans at home and abroad. For these reasons, I do not support \nthis bill.\n  I support full funding for our troops in this time of war, and I \nbelieve that Congress, which authorized the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, is obligated to give American troops everything they need \nto prevail in their missions. Unfortunately, the must-pass nature of \nthis bill has proven all too tempting for Senators who could not \nrestrain their profligate impulses to pile on spending unrelated to \nfighting the global war on terror.\n  This bill exhibits little evidence that Congress respects the solemn \nresponsibility to be custodians of the taxpayers' dollars. In a time of \nwar, with large Federal budget deficits, at a time when Americans \ndeserve to keep more of their earnings at home, any rational observer \nwould counsel restraint. Yet this emergency supplemental bill is \nstuffed with scarce dollars for the special interests, just as the \nmeasure approved by the House last week.\n  The Dallas Morning News editorial board wrote last week with respect \nto the House-passed bill that ``turning the President's $100 billion \nsupplemental war spending request into a $124.6 billion, pork-laden \nmess'' is no way to show support for the troops, adding\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nthat ``support for the troops takes the odd form of $25 million for \nspinach growers . . . $1.48 billion for livestock farmers . . . and $74 \nmillion `to ensure the proper storage of peanuts.' ''\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has chosen to follow the House's misguided \nlead by adding a host of nonemergency and unrequested provisions to the \nmeasure pending before us--a measure that is desperately needed to fund \nthe ongoing military missions.\n  Let me mention some of the unrequested items contained in this bill:\n  There is $3 million for sugar cane growers, of which the entire \namount will go to one Hawaiian cooperative. Just last year Congress \nprovided up to $40 million for Florida sugar cane growers in an \nemergency supplemental bill. I suppose no ``emergency supplemental'' \nbill is complete without a sweetener for sugar cane growers.\n  There is $165.9 million for fisheries disasters. Just last year \nCongress provided $95 million in another emergency supplemental bill to \nassist fishermen in recovering from fisheries disasters and to aid \noyster bed and shrimp ground rehabilitation. This year, Congress's \ngenerous aid moved from the eastern seaboard to the west coast with \nover $60 million alone to assist salmon fishermen in Oregon and \nCalifornia.\n  There is $3,500,000 for the Capitol Guide Service and Special \nServices Office, to be available until September 2008. I was unaware \nthat we had emergency tour guide needs in addition to our emergency \ntroops' funding needs.\n  There is $13 million for research to develop mine safety technology. \nCongress provided $35 million in last year's emergency supplemental \nbill to hire an additional 217 mine safety inspectors, and $10 million \nfor mine safety research, so I must question why this latest funding \ncannot wait for the regular appropriations process.\n  There is $22.76 million for geothermal energy research. While I \nsupport renewable energy research to reduce our dependency on oil, this \nfunding was not part of the administration's budget request. Does \ngeothermal energy research qualify as an emergency spending need? No, \nit does not.\n  There is $7 million for water quality research at pig farms in \nMissouri. Specifically, the bill directs the EPA to provide a $7 \nmillion grant to Water Environment Research Foundation in Alexandria, \nVA, to research water quality issues related to pig farms in Missouri. \nAs many of us have stated, there is true ``pork'' in this bill as this \nearmark illustrates.\n  There is $2 million for the University of Vermont's Educational \nExcellence Program. This project is essentially identical to an earmark \nthat was proposed last year. It was rejected in last year's final bill, \nand should not be included again this year.\n  There is $40 million for a ``Tree Assistance Program,'' to aid \n``fruit and nut tree producers'' and other producers of a ``Christmas \ntree'' or ``potted shrub'' or ``ornamental tree.'' This bill is not \nonly a big Christmas gift to special interests, but it also comes with \na Christmas tree.\n  There is $95 million to dairy producers.\n  There is $20 million for reimbursements to Nevada, Idaho and Utah for \n``insect damage'' from grasshoppers, crickets, and others. These pesky \ninsects are now richer than most residents in those States.\n  There is $24 million to sugar beet producers as compensation for \nproduction losses. These producers should be ``beet red'' over this \nhandout.\n  There is $13 million for the Ewe Lamb Replacement and Retention \nProgram. Under this program, eligible livestock owners receive $18 for \neach qualifying ewe lamb. That means this provision would cover up to \n722,222 sheep. Perhaps my colleagues think increasing our Nation's \nsheep stocks is somehow a viable alternative to the President's troop \nincrease in Iraq? I doubt the troops appreciate the priority that we \nhave placed on ewe lambs breeding in this bill. It is a ``baad'' \nearmark.\n\n  There is $6 million for crops damaged by floods in North Dakota. Yet \nanother repeated attempt for funding that was rejected in last year's \nemergency supplemental.\n  There is $5 million for irrigation repairs in Montana. Of the $35 \nmillion provided to the USDA Emergency Conservation Programs, which was \nnot requested by the administration, the bill earmarks $5 million for \nrepairs to damaged irrigation ditches and pipelines in the State of \nMontana.\n  There is $30 million for the Farm Service Agency. On top of all the \naforementioned programs, the bill provides $30 million for \nadministration costs at the Farm Service Agency to ensure the Federal \nGovernment has enough employees to actually carry out all the new \nprograms and new spending under this agriculture title. Here we see the \nunderreported runaway effect of porkbarrel politics: more pork \ntranslates into bigger government, bigger government means larger \nadministrative overhead, and large administrative overhead means \ngreater costs to American taxpayers.\n  There is $388.9 million for funding a backlog of old Department of \nTransportation highway projects. The taxpayers just provided over $24 \nbillion in unauthorized highway projects in 2005, but Congress in its \ninfinite wisdom has seen fit to provide another $388 million in this \nbill.\n  This appropriations bill also includes numerous authorizing \nprovisions, such as section 3001, which uses the emergency supplemental \nto authorize certain outdoor signs that were damaged, abandoned, or \ndiscontinued as a result of a hurricane in certain regions to be \nrepaired, replaced, or reconstructed within 24 months of enactment. The \nbill also restricts authorization to the Department of Transportation \nto implement a provision authorized by Congress in the North American \nFree Trade Agreement that would allow Mexican and U.S. trucks to \noperate across the border, thereby facilitating free trade and \nbenefiting the economy.\n  Once again, the appropriators have included a massive agriculture \ndisaster assistance package in the emergency supplemental. The language \nbefore us today is strikingly similar to language that appeared in the \n2006 emergency supplemental and to an amendment that was rejected just \nlast December. As my colleagues surely remember, the 2006 Senate-passed \nemergency supplemental faced a veto threat because of the unrequested \nagricultural disaster package it contained. It faces the same threat \ntoday.\n  Most shockingly still, the bill actually underfunds the Army, Navy, \nAir Force, Marine Corps and Defense-Wide Operation and Maintenance \naccounts by nearly $1.4 billion, withholding funds from accounts \ndirectly related to fulfilling the wartime needs of the military. This \nis disgraceful.\n  This spending would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. We are at \nwar--a war that has cost us a great deal in blood and treasure and \nwhich inevitably will cost us more still. Our troops, who fight so \nbravely on our behalf and who so love their country that they are \nwilling to sacrifice everything--everything--in order to defend it, \nshow incredible courage in carrying out their duties in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. And so it is only right that we, the elected leaders \nentrusted to preserve the common welfare, show just a modicum of the \nsacrifice, courage, and restraint that these warriors exhibit every \nday.\n  The Baltimore Sun editorialized last Sunday:\n\n       President Bush requested that Congress quickly fund the \n     troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and debate the war \n     strategy separately. Yet Congress chose to hold troop funding \n     hostage to pork-barrel spending and to provide terrorists \n     with a countdown clock to America's exit from Iraq. Lawmakers \n     must show that [past] promises of fiscal restraint were not \n     meaningless by providing a clean bill for President Bush to \n     sign. The troops deserve no less.\n\n  I agree it is time to exercise the fiscal discipline commensurate \nwith the responsibilities entrusted to us by the American people and to \nprovide our troops with the support necessary to win the war in Iraq. \nThis bill, which provides insufficient funding for our Armed Forces and \na damaging withdrawal deadline, sends the wrong message to our troops, \nour enemies, and the American taxpayer. The Dallas Morning News \ncontinued in its editorial:\n\n       [S]etting an arbitrary date for withdrawal only handcuffs \n     the troops trying to carry out their mission--and gives hope \n     to their ene-\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n     mies . . . We hope--the supplemental war-spending bill does \n     not prove to be a reminder to Americans why the Constitution \n     invested commander-in-chief responsibilities in one \n     president, instead of 435 members of Congress.\n\n  This bill will be vetoed, and I will strongly support sustaining that \nveto. This bill is a perfect example of why I have long supported a \nPresident having line-item veto authority. There is some necessary \nfunding in this bill that is urgently needed to support our troops in \nIraq, but, unfortunately, the bill is saddled with too much wasteful \nspending and a regrettable war strategy to allow me to support it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Tennessee arguing \nabout a provision in the disaster recovery portion of the supplemental \nrelating to the private property rights of billboard owners. First let \nme note that the bill we voted on was not simply the Iraq supplemental. \nFrom the start, it has always been a supplemental that also included \nprovisions for hurricane and natural disaster recovery efforts. \nObviously, the Iraq portion of the supplemental is the most important \npart of the bill, but the supplemental has always also had a disaster \nrecovery title, which is why we saw a majority of members of both \nChambers supporting these disaster-related provisions.\n  I respect the Senator from Tennessee and appreciate his sincerity on \nthe important issue he spoke on. I was disappointed, though, that there \nwas much in what the Senator said that was just plain wrong.\n  The Senator claimed that the provision at issue was ``amnesty for \nillegal billboards.'' I don't know what it is these days with the use \nof the term ``amnesty,'' but some people don't seem to understand what \nthe word means in any context.\n  All of the billboards affected by the provision are legal. Some of \nthem have been standing legally for decades. But we are not talking \nabout creaky old billboards; many of the billboards at issue are only a \nfew years old, and in more recent years the state they are in happened \nto changed density or zoning requirements, but sensibly grandfathered \nin the existing structures.\n  Many of the billboards at issue provide advertising for small \nbusinesses, important information for U.S. drivers, public service \nannouncements, and fuel local tourism industries throughout America. In \nshort, the types of billboards at issue are very common, are a source \nof information and revenue for States, and are regulated by states.\n  Saying they are illegal or that we are providing amnesty is a nice \nrhetorical flourish but is just plain wrong.\n  The reality is that for decades, the Federal Government, in \ncompliance with law and regulation, deferred to the States in \ndetermining whether billboards could be rebuilt or not after a \nhurricane or other natural disaster. For decades, this issue was not an \nissue. Then, in recent years, the Federal Government did an about-face \nand began dictating terms to the States, threatening to withhold \nFederal highway funds if the States did not trample on private property \nrights.\n  Ironically, Tennessee was one of the States that felt the heavy hand \nof the Federal Government's purse strings. ``Tennessee had a decades-\nlong history-of allowing billboards to be rebuilt after natural \ndisasters. There are probably hundreds of letters from Tennessee \ngranting permission to rebuild after natural disasters, including many \nfrom within the past year. Recently, however, the Federal Government \ntold Tennessee it needed to change its policies or it would lose \nmillions of dollars in Federal funding. Tennessee felt that it had no \nchoice, so it changed its policy.\n  The provision at issue is very simple, it returns us to where we were \nbefore the Federal Government changed its policy. It respects States \nrights and private property rights--principles that people in the West \nunderstand well. I am surprised that a small group of Members on the \nother side of the aisle are opposed to States rights and private \nproperty rights. This is especially so, since other Members on the \nother side of the aisle have traditionally supported this provision, \nincluding Members from Louisiana and Mississippi, two of the States hit \nhardest by the new Federal Government stance on this issue.\n  The proposal ensures that states that want to allow these billboards \nto be rebuilt will have that option. If the State does not want to \nallow the billboards, it does not have to. That was the way things \nworked for decades.\n  But, under the new approach by the Federal Government, even if a \nState thinks the billboards provide a valuable source of revenue or \npublic service and wants to allow them to be rebuilt, the Federal \nGovernment stands in the way and prohibits the State from allowing the \nbillboard to go back up. It is about states rights.\n  So the gentlemen from Tennessee, Florida, and Alabama, are all \nbasically taking a position that the Federal Government knows better \nthan their own States.\n  Further, the proposal is about private property rights. It ensures \nthat companies and small businesses whose billboards have been \ndestroyed by the hurricane will not lose all of the value of their \nproperty.\n  This is just a matter of basic fairness. The Katrina portion of the \nsupplemental included billions of dollars to help people rebuild their \nhouses, to help private schools rebuild their facilities and programs, \nand to help small businessowners rebuild their businesses. The Katrina \nportion of the supplemental was all about rebuilding.\n  But, a small group of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nseems to think that this group of private property owners should be the \nexception--they should not be able to rebuild and reclaim their \nproperty just because their property is disfavored by some. I don't \nknow why these folks are opposed to private property rights and States \nrights.\n  Finally, let me note the wide support for this proposal. The \nGovernors of Mississippi and Louisiana support the proposal. The \nAmerican Hotel Lodging Association supports it. The National Restaurant \nAssociation supports it. The Association of National Advertisers \nsupports it. The ``America's Most Wanted'' TV show endorses the \nproposal because billboards have been helpful in catching criminals. A \nvariety of America's best known brandnames support the proposal, as \nwell--Accor, Best Western, Bob Evans, Cracker Barrel, Dairy Queen, Ford \nMotor Company, Wendy's, and White Castle.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the way forward for \na recapitalization effort critical to our national security and the \nsafety of America's seafarers. I speak of the effort to modernize the \nfleet of the U.S. Coast Guard known as the Integrated Deepwater \nProgram. There is no question that the Coast Guard desperately requires \nnew assets with which to carry out its missions, and it is our duty to \nensure that they receive those tools at the best value to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  For over two centuries, the Coast Guard has protected our shores, and \nthe service has come a long way from its beginnings under the auspices \nof the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service. \nFollowing the events of September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard was \ntransferred from the Department of Transportation to the Department of \nHomeland Security, a change that brought with it an increase in \nmissions. Today, its roles include search-and-rescue missions and \nmarine safety enforcement; securing our Nation's ports, waterways, and \ncoasts; carrying out drug and illegal immigrant interdiction \noperations; protecting our marine environment; and ensuring safety and \nease of navigation.\n  President Bush has called the Coast Guard ``the world's premiere \nlifesaving service,'' and given the new tasks assigned to the service \nunder the Department of Homeland Security, that label now extends far \nbeyond rescuing mariners in duress or stranded hurricane victims. The \nCoast Guard is also our first line of defense against waterborne \nterrorist attacks, from suicide bombers such as those who attacked the \nUSS Cole in Yemen, to potential weapons of mass destruction that could \nbe brought to our ports on board container ships.\n  However, the assets we have provided the world's premiere lifesaving \nservice to carry out their critical missions are anything but the \nworld's premiere equipment. The valiant men and women who protect our \nshores serve aboard vessels that collectively comprise the third oldest \nnaval fleet in the\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\nworld. These are the same individuals who rescued over thirty thousand \npeople from the rooftops of the gulf coast after Hurricane Katrina, and \nwho, in a single action just last week, prevented over 4,200 pounds of \ncocaine from reaching America's streets, and schoolyards--the biggest \nsingle drug bust ever recorded. Our service men and women deserve \nbetter, and the American people deserve better.\n  Which is why the Coast Guard has chosen to modernize its fleet using \na program of unprecedented scope. This recapitalization effort, called \nDeepwater, is a single acquisition program designed to completely \noverhaul the Coast Guard's entire fleet of ships and aircraft, as well \nas its communications system and interoperability components. In \neffect, rather than attempting to manage each asset individually, we \nchose to manage the new system of assets as a whole, allowing the Coast \nGuard and the taxpayer to reap the benefits of economies of scale and \nlack of duplicative effort. When the call for proposals was announced, \nthe group Citizens Against Government Waste called Deepwater ``an \ninnovative answer to the federal acquisition process' systematic \nwaste.''\n  In June of 2002, the Coast Guard awarded a contract to a joint \nventure comprised of executives from Lockheed Martin and Northup \nGrumman and representatives from the Coast Guard itself. This entity is \ncalled Integrated Cost Guard Systems, or ICGS. And now, not 5 years \nlater, we have arrived at a crossroads with the Deepwater program that \nhas has found itself in rough seas. High-profile failures of \nacquisitions, such as the 123-foot patrol boats, and questions about \nthe suitability of the new fleet's flagship, the national security \ncutter, have led Congress to re-examine the acquisition process. An \ninnovative design for one ship, the fast response cutter, has proven to \nbe a failure, and the Coast Guard, to its credit, has removed that ship \nfrom ICGS's control, will soon put forth a request for design \nproposals, and plans to manage that acquisition independently.\n  Many of these problems stem from the manner in which the Coast Guard \nstructured its Deepwater contract. Too much control was given to ICGS \nin the contract's first term, including the authority to override Coast \nGuard engineering decisions, and the ability to ``self-certify'' its \nown designs and work as meeting the Coast Guard's requirements. To make \nmatters worse, these contracts were structured in such a way that if \nthe assets in development failed to meet the required standards, the \ncontractor would be paid an additional fee to fix the very problem it \nhad created in the first place. I am convinced that it is this \ncontract--and not the concept of a system of systems approach to major \nacquisitions--that has brought us to where we are today with the \nDeepwater program.\n  Now the Coast Guard is in negotiations with ICGS for extension of the \ncontract, and there is no question that oversight of the program must \nchange. Several legislative solutions have been proposed, including \nprovisions in both S. 965 and H.R. 1571. While I am pleased to know \nthat the appropriators in both Houses of Congress recognize the \nimportance of Deepwater to the Coast Guard and to the Nation, I \nstrongly disagree with the way in which they have chosen to handle its \nrevision.\n  Ultimately, oversight of Deepwater falls not to the appropriators, \nbut to the service's authorizing committee the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation's Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, \nFisheries, and the Coast Guard, on which I serve as the ranking member. \nThe Chair of that Subcommittee, Senator Cantwell, and I have worked \ntogether on innumerable Coast Guard issues for years, and we have a \ndetailed understanding of the intricate issues involved both in \nmanagement of the Coast Guard as a whole and this program in \nparticular. The language in neither the House nor the Senate \nAppropriations bill provides the best way forward for Deepwater or the \nCoast Guard. If passed, either version would lead to delays in \nproduction and affiliated increases both in the final delivery cost of \nthe assets, and in the size of any patrol gaps the Coast Guard may \nexperience. In simple terms, the appropriators' language will cost the \ntaxpayers money and weaken the security of our maritime domain.\n  Senator Cantwell and I have offered an alternative. Last week, we \nintroduced the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, S. 924. This \nbill places restrictions on the structure of any agreements between the \nCoast Guard and its contractors; mandates full and open competition for \nall Deepwater assets not yet under contract; requires the Coast Guard \nto conduct an analysis of alternatives to ensure that its Deepwater \nplan remains the best way to recapitalize the service at the lowest \npossible cost; and increases reporting requirements to Congress so we \ncan be kept abreast of the program's progress as well as any stumbling \nblocks that may arise. But most importantly, while this analysis is \nongoing, our bill will allow work to continue on assets that have been \nproven capable of meeting the demands of the Coast Guard's mission \nportfolio, thereby avoiding costly delays and dangerous patrol gaps.\n  Despite the mistakes of Deepwater's past, I believe we must move \nforward with this critical modernization of The Coast Guard's fleet. \nThe simple fact is this: The Coast Guard needs new vessels, and a \nprogram run as a system of systems, rather than on an asset-by-asset \nbasis will lead to a more efficient and more cost-effective \nrecapitalization.\n  I respectfully ask that the members of the Appropriations Committees \nin both the House and the Senate remove the clauses in their bills that \ncontain authorization language for the Deepwater program and allow the \nauthorizing committee to do its job through passage of S. 924. We have \nthe best interests of the American people at heart, and we have the \nnecessary expertise to ensure that the Coast Guard and our maritime \nsecurity do not suffer unintended consequences of even the best-\nintentioned efforts.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote in favor of the \nfiscal year 2007 supplemental because it contains binding language that \neffectively ends the current misguided military mission in Iraq and \nrequires the President to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. \nWhile this action is long overdue, it is a big step in the right \ndirection and it brings us closer to ending our involvement in this \ndisastrous war.\n  I am also pleased that the supplemental includes necessary funding to \naddress conflicts throughout the world, especially in Sudan, Somalia, \nand the Democratic Republic of Congo, to assist Iraqi refugees and \ninternally displaced persons fleeing their homes, and to help pay for \nU.S. arrears to the U.N.\n  The supplemental also contains a 1-month extension of the Milk Income \nLoss Contract, MILC, program, which fixes a quirk that could have put \nfamily dairy farmers on unequal footing during the upcoming farm bill \ndebate. I was glad this provision was included in the supplemental and \nwill work with my colleagues to retain it during conference.\n  I am extremely disappointed at the removal of a provision in the \nsupplemental spending bill that would have fixed a glaring problem in \nimmigration law that effectively labeled the Hmong as terrorists. We \nwill forever be indebted to the Hmong who fought alongside and \nsupported the United States during the Vietnam war. I will continue \nworking to make sure that Hmong and other legitimate refugees who are \nnot threats to our national security do not face lengthy and \nunnecessary delays as the Federal agencies involved determine whether \nthey are eligible for a waiver that would permit them to resettle in \nthe United States or adjust their immigration status.\n  I remain concerned at the continued practice of funding the war in \nIraq through emergency spending bills. We should not be using such \nbills to bypass the regular appropriations process. That is why I \nsupported efforts to remove certain spending provisions that do not \nappear to address true emergencies, including an amendment offered by \nSenator Coburn to remove funding for next year's political conventions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Independent Assessment of Capabilities of the \n     Iraqi Security Forces. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the \n     following findings:\n       (1) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq, relying on the Iraqi Security Forces \n     (ISF).\n       (2) In quarterly reports to Congress, and in testimony \n     before a number of congressional committees, the Department \n     of Defense reported progress towards training and equipping \n     Iraqi Security Forces; however, the subsequent performance of \n     the Iraqi Security Forces has been uneven and occasionally \n     appeared inconsistent with those reports.\n       (3) On November 15, 2005, President Bush said, ``The plan \n     [is] that we will train Iraqi troops to be able to take the \n     fight to the enemy. And as I have consistently said, as the \n     Iraqis stand up, we will stand down''.\n       (4) On January 10, 2007, the President announced a new \n     strategy, which consists of three basic elements: diplomatic, \n     economic, and military; the central component of the military \n     element being an augmentation of the present level of the \n     U.S. military forces with more than 20,000 additional U.S. \n     military troops to Iraq to ``work alongside Iraqi units and \n     be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-\n     defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure \n     neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and \n     to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable \n     of providing the security that Baghdad needs''.\n       (5) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists.\n       (6) The latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on \n     Iraq, entitled ``Prospects for Iraq's Stability: A \n     Challenging Road Ahead,'' released in January 2007, found: \n     ``If strengthened Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), more loyal to \n     the government and supported by Coalition forces, are able to \n     reduce levels of violence and establish more effective \n     security for Iraq's population, Iraqi leaders could have an \n     opportunity to begin the process of political compromise \n     necessary for longer term stability, political progress, and \n     economic recovery''.\n       (7) The NIE also stated that ``[d]espite real improvements, \n     the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF)--particularly the Iraqi \n     police--will be hard pressed in the next 12-18 months to \n     execute significantly increased security responsibilities''.\n       (8) The current and prospective readiness of the ISF is \n     critical to (A) the long term stability of Iraq, (B) the \n     force protection of U.S. forces conducting combined \n     operations with the ISF; and (C) the scale of U.S. forces \n     deployed to Iraq.\n       (b) Independent Assessment of Capabilities of Iraqi \n     Security Forces.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the amount appropriated or otherwise \n     made available for the Department of Defense, $750,000 is \n     provided to commission an independent, private-sector entity, \n     which operates as a 501(c)(3) with recognized credentials and \n     expertise in military affairs, to prepare an independent \n     report assessing the following:\n       (A) The readiness of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to \n     assume responsibility for maintaining the territorial \n     integrity of Iraq, denying international terrorists a safe \n     haven, and bringing greater security to Iraq's 18 provinces \n     in the next 12-18 months, and bringing an end to sectarian \n     violence to achieve national reconciliation.\n       (B) The training; equipping; command, control and \n     intelligence capabilities; and logistics capacity of the ISF.\n       (C) The likelihood that, given the ISF's record of \n     preparedness to date, following years of training and \n     equipping by US forces, the continued support of US troops \n     will contribute to the readiness of the ISF to fulfill the \n     missions outlined in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 120 days after passage of this \n     Act, the designated private sector entity shall provide an \n     unclassified report, with a classified annex, containing its \n     findings, to the House and Senate Committees on Armed \n     Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and \n     Intelligence.\n       Sec. 1317. (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Secretary'') may convey to the State of \n     Texas, without consideration, all right, title, and interest \n     of the United States in and to the parcel of real property \n     comprising the location of the Marlin, Texas, Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n       (2) The property conveyed under paragraph (1) shall be used \n     by the State of Texas for the purposes of a prison.\n       (b) In carrying out the conveyance under subsection (a), \n     the Secretary--\n       (1) shall not be required to comply with, and shall not be \n     held liable under, any Federal law (including a regulation) \n     relating to the environment or historic preservation; but\n       (2) may, at the discretion of the Secretary, conduct \n     environmental cleanup on the parcel to be conveyed, at a cost \n     not to exceed $500,000, using amounts made available for \n     environmental cleanup of sites under the jurisdiction of the \n     Secretary.\n       Sec. 1318. Redevelopment of Industrial Sector in Iraq.

Mr. President, today, just a few minutes ago, we voted on \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I voted against the \nbill.\n  From the beginning, I have tried to support our troops both morally \nand materially. It has always been my goal to ensure that our Armed \nForces have a clearly defined mission, realistic military objectives, \nand the best equipment available. Yet, today, I believe we have reached \na point where political infighting has led to bartering for bullets. We \nhave tied vital military funding for our troops to an arbitrary date of \nwithdrawal.\n  The Senate, with this vote today--passing this supplemental spending \nbill with a date of withdrawal--has named the date for defeat in Iraq, \nif it were to stand. We have taken a step backward. We have put an \narbitrary deadline on our military. It is the wrong message at the \nwrong time. Surely, this will embolden the enemy and will not help our \ntroops in any way. It is a big mistake.\n  I hope the President will veto this bill as soon as he gets it to his \ndesk. I\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\ndid not support this supplemental because I remain committed to our \ntroops, first and foremost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate has just made a tremendous \neffort in moving forward to make sure we support our troops in every \nsense of the word. I thank all of my colleagues who voted ``aye'' in \nmoving this forward.\n  It is important to remember that this is an emergency supplemental \nbill. I have heard others on the other side call it a war supplemental. \nIt is true, indeed, that over the last several years, the President has \ninsisted that we pay for the war in Iraq on an emergency supplemental. \nBut I remind everyone that there are countless emergencies across this \ncountry, and we, as Democrats, believe it is critical that we address \nthose concerns--whether it is our agricultural industry, which has \nfaced drought, severe weather, family farms which have been inundated \nand unable to continue to provide the crops all of us rely on to feed \nour families; whether it is our veterans who, as the occupant of the \nchair well knows as a member of the Veterans' Committee, have been left \nbehind time and time again.\n  We all know of the Walter Reed issue that hit the papers several \nweeks ago. But this is not a new issue for many of us who have been \nfollowing this issue for some time. We have men and women serving in \nIraq and Afghanistan who are coming home and have severe traumatic \nbrain injuries. They have been lost in the system. We are now starting \nthe fifth year of this war, and to date this President has not planned \nand supported funding to make sure those men and women--whether it is \ntraumatic brain injury or whether they lost a limb or whether they have \npost-traumatic stress syndrome or whether it is just coming home and \nbeing able to find another job--have been paid attention to.\n  In this supplemental, we say we are going to pay for all costs of the \nwar and certainly pay for those men and women who paid the ultimate \nprice, along with their families, and taking care of them is part of \nthat cost of war. In this critical bill which the Democrats voted for, \nwe make sure they are a part of this.\n  So we provide funding to repair the facilities at Walter Reed and \nalso to make sure that across the country the Walter Reed syndrome is \npaid attention to. Those veterans facilities we have gotten the reports \nfrom--the 1,100 sightings of mold on the walls, of bats that have not \nbeen gotten rid of in the Oregon VA facility, of peeling paint on the \nwalls--these kinds of conditions are not ones we as Americans should \nallow to continue.\n  In the supplemental bill, we say we are going to take care of those \nissues, and we require specifically that the VA come back to us in 60 \ndays and identify every one of those 1,100 sightings and say whether \nthey have fixed those facilities. If they have not, we want to know the \nexact cost, because we are not going to let those men and women sit in \nthose deplorable conditions.\n  Under this bill, we address the issue that has faced many of our \nsoldiers who have returned home with traumatic brain injury. Many of us \nsaw the Bob Woodruff special several weeks ago, a reporter who was in \nIraq and who suffered a traumatic brain injury. We saw how he struggled \nwith his recovery and now has presented an amazing news story to let \nall of us know what is happening not just with him but to men and women \nacross this country as they come home. It is true when a soldier is in \na vehicle that is immediately affected by a blast, they often know they \nhave traumatic brain injury. It is also true soldiers who may be 100 or \n150 yards away from that blast may also receive an injury but may not \nknow it.\n  We have all talked to these men and women when we go home, and their \nwives normally say to us, my husband can't remember where he put a \npiece of paper I just handed to him, not realizing he had been a victim \nof a blast and that his injury had caused brain damage. We need to make \nsure those soldiers are treated and are treated well, and that we have \nthe research and the capability to make sure they are not lost when \nthey come home from service to this country. That funding is in this \nbill, and that funding was voted on by a majority of Senators in this \nbody. We are going to keep working to make sure it is there.\n  We also have in this bill money for Katrina. It seems a long time ago \nnow that our country was stunned by the impact of Katrina and other \nhurricanes in the gulf coast. Americans across the country said, what \nare we going to do? We know since that time there have been major \nstumbles. As Democrats, we are not stepping back. We believe that is as \nmuch an emergency as what the President has asked for in this emergency \nsupplemental focusing only on Iraq, the war, and the reconstruction \nefforts there.\n  We have a reconstruction effort that is absolutely critical here in \nthis country. Democrats are standing up and saying we are going to take \nresponsibility and pay for it. There is $6.7 billion in here for the \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. I believe that is as \nmuch a critical emergency spending item as the reconstruction dollars \nthe President has asked for in the supplemental, and that is why we are \nsupporting this bill.\n  This bill also addresses the issue of homeland security. We have \nheard a lot of rhetoric about homeland security and protecting our own. \nThat is an emergency because that funding has not been there. Rhetoric \nprotects no one here at home. We provide $2 billion, critical \ninfrastructure dollars, for port security, mass transit security, and \nexplosive detection equipment at our airports. We are putting it into \nthis bill because it has not yet been funded, and across this country \nAmericans are at risk without that funding.\n  We have heard a lot of talk on this floor over the last several days \nabout extra porkbarrel spending. Well, I would say to all of my \ncolleagues there is $4.2 billion that is provided for Americans here at \nhome--not for reconstruction efforts out in the world but for right \nhere at home, $4.2 billion.\n  Senator Boxer from California was out here yesterday showing \ntremendous pictures of the agricultural disasters that have occurred in \nCalifornia. These are farmers whom we rely on as Americans when we go \nto our grocery stores to be able to buy food to feed our families. If \ntheir farms are lost because they do not have the support after a \ndisaster that has affected them, every one of us suffers. As Democrats, \nwe say that is as much an emergency as what we are putting into this \nbill for reconstruction in Iraq. We need to reconstruct here at home.\n  On this side we are playing catchup. For a number of years now we \nhave seen emergency supplementals that were just war supplementals. We \nare saying that, as Democrats, we know we have to invest in ourselves \nacross the country. We have to invest in our future. We will only be as \nstrong abroad as we are at home. If we abandon our farmers, if we \nabandon our children because they do not have health care--and there is \nSCHIP funding in this bill--if we abandon our gulf coast residents, who \nhave not yet been able to rebuild their homes and their infrastructure, \nif we abandon our veterans when they come home and don't take care of \nthem, if we abandon our military personnel without the proper equipment \nand supplies, then we are not doing the job we have been sent here to \ndo.\n  We are proud of this supplemental we are putting forward because, in \naddition to everything else, we are taking a major step forward and \nsaying we are no longer going to idly stand by without any debate, \nwithout any consequences, and move continuously to increase the war in \nIraq. We have said it is time for us as a nation to tell the Iraqi \npeople they need to stand up for themselves. That language is critical \nin this bill.\n  We have worked with colleagues on all sides to put together what I \nthink is a very important, very critical bill for us here in America--\nhere at home. We are going to work very hard now in conference with our \nHouse colleagues to come together with a bill to bring back to the \nSenate and then to send to the President. I understand the President is \nsaying he is going to veto the\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nbill, but I ask the President to listen to us, to sit down in the way \nwe are supposed to here in Congress, and work with us to find agreement \nso we can move this bill forward. That is my hope for us here, and it \nis my hope for Americans across this country.\n  I am proud of the bill we have put forward in addressing the critical \ninfrastructure investments here at home, and I hope as we move forward \nin this process in a few weeks we will be able to have a conference \ncommittee bill that will be sent to the President and that he will \nagree to so we can then move on to the other issues facing this Nation.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank a number of people who worked \non this bill, but particularly Chairman Byrd, who led us throughout \nthis debate. I thank Senator Cochran, my ranking member, who has been \nout here on the floor late nights working with us to help keep an \norderly process.\n\n  I also thank all of our full committee staff, Terry Sauvain and Bruce \nEvans, all of their staff, who have worked countless hours. I am not \nsure they even went home last night before they came in this morning to \nhelp us get to the point we are today, and I thank all the staff of all \nthe Appropriations subcommittees, who have worked very hard on this \nbill.\n  I also thank our floor staff, because without their work and their \nsupport, none of us would be able to complete the work we do. They are \nthe silent workers who sit in front of us and who have done such a \ntremendous job to help us get through this process.\n  At the end of the day, I want my colleagues and I want America to \nknow we in the majority here in the Senate believe an emergency \nspending bill should be just that. There are numerous emergencies \nacross this country, investing in Americans who have suffered \ntremendously, and we are working hard to make sure their issues are \nfinally addressed. Importantly, we are telling the President that our \nveterans and those who serve us in Iraq and Afghanistan, when they come \nhome, their issues are going to be addressed as part of the cost of the \nwar and as part of this emergency supplemental.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the emergency supplemental appropriations \nlegislation which passed the Senate today, the U.S. Troop Readiness, \nVeterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act of 2007, provides $625 \nmillion in security funding to better protect the millions of Americans \nwho ride public transportation. I thank Senator Shelby, who as both the \nranking member on the Banking Committee and a member of the \nAppropriations Committee has been a tireless advocate on behalf of mass \ntransit and specifically on the issue of transit security. I commend \nSenators Byrd and Cochran who serve, respectively, as both chairman and \nranking member of the full Appropriations Committee and the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee. They were instrumental in deciding to increase \nour investment in securing our public transportation systems. The issue \nof transit security requires coordination between both homeland \nsecurity agencies and committees and those transportation agencies and \ncommittees. Thus, I also commend Senators Murray and Bond who serve as \nchair and ranking member on the Appropriations Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.\n  Our Nation's public transit systems are inadequately prepared to \nminimize the threat and impact of potential terrorist attacks. Since \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Government has \ninvested nearly $24 billion in aviation security--protecting the 1.8 \nmillion people who fly on an average day. At the same time, our \nNational Government has invested only $386 million, before the 110th \nCongress began, in transit security to protect the 14 million people \nwho ride transit on an average workday. Put another way, since 2001, \nour Nation has spent over $7.50 per passenger on aviation security, but \nless than one penny per transit rider on transit security. I am not \nsuggesting that we ought to be investing equally, but clearly this is \nnot the appropriate balance.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, I have made improving our national security a top priority. \nThe very first hearing that I held as chairman focused on increasing \nthe security of our Nation's 14 million daily transit passengers. The \nvery first legislation that the committee considered during my \nChairmanship was the Public Transit Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007, \nwhich was passed by the Banking Committee unanimously on February 8. \nThe legislation authorizes the distribution of $3.5 billion in security \nfunds, over the next 3 fiscal years, on the basis of risk directly to \ntransit agencies.\n  The Public Transit Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 was included as \ntitle XV of the 9/11 bill, which the Senate passed on March 13. Senator \nShelby and I worked with Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran to include \nlanguage in the legislation to allow for such sums as necessary to be \nappropriated in this fiscal year to address the critical needs of our \nNation's transit systems. The $625 million included in this \nappropriations act is a significant investment towards our goal of \nbetter securing our Nation's rail and transit systems. This investment \nbuilds on the $175 million that was included in the fiscal year 2007 \ncontinuing resolution. Combined, these investments are greater than all \nof the investments that were made between the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 and the beginning of this new Congress.\n  We must make sure that we use these funds wisely. It is my desire \nthat the Congress quickly reconcile both the transit security \nlegislation and the supplemental funding that has passed each Chamber \nso that this supplemental funding will be distributed in accordance \nwith the new authorization. I once again thank all of the members of \nthe Banking and Appropriations Committees who have worked so hard to \nadvance us to where we are today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, I rise today to delineate exactly why I \nvoted against this supplemental. We are in some very difficult and \ncomplex times in the world today, and certainly the situation in Iraq \nis right at the forefront.\n  Americans have always stood tall when someone tries to interrupt our \nability to exercise our rights of freedom, and right now we are \nfighting a global war on terrorism, with Iraq being at the center of \nit. For individuals in this body to think we can micromanage a military \nconflict from the floor of the Senate or the House of Representatives \nis simply wrong.\n  We have military leadership on the ground in Iraq. That leadership is \nrecommending against imposing timelines. We have civilian leaders who \nhave significant military experience, both from the State Department \nlevel as well as the Pentagon level. These leaders have testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, and every single one of \nthose individuals, whether they were Republican or Democrat, has said \nimposing timelines is not the way to go. Every military officer who has \ncome to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee has said \nimposing timelines for withdrawal from Iraq will simply embolden the \nenemy. The enemy will lay in wait until we remove ourselves from Iraq \nand then all genocide will break loose in Iraq.\n  The Baker-Hamilton commission--which so many people have relied \nupon--clearly stated that imposing timelines for withdrawal in Iraq is \nnot the way to go. This vote today is simply the wrong signal to send \nto an enemy. The message needs to be that we are going to take you out; \nthat we are not going to let you impose yourself on freedom and \ndemocracy. This vote today simply does not do that.\n  I very strongly disagree with the provisions in this supplemental \nrelative to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, and that is the reason \nI did vote against this supplemental we so desperately need to fund our \ntroops, to fund the operation in Iraq, as well as to take care of some \nother measures. One of those other measures included in this \nsupplemental is critically important to my State, and it has to do with \nthe SCHIP program, the State Children's Health\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nInsurance Program, which was designed to help uninsured children across \nAmerica.\n  Unfortunately, it has gotten into the arena now of not only providing \ncoverage for children but also coverage for some adults. Frankly, I \ndon't agree with that, but I don't have a problem with it in this \nsupplemental. We will deal with that issue in the reauthorization of \nthis program. We do have a provision in the supplemental that would \ncover the shortfall for the SCHIP program, which in Georgia we refer to \nas PeachCare. It would have provided the money to fund a shortfall in \nSCHIP between now and the end of the fiscal year for States such as \nmine that are going to experience this shortfall. Georgia happens to be \nthe first of 14 States that is going to have this shortfall, and we \nhave had to take measures--and our legislature, thank goodness, has \ndone that--to make up this shortfall. In the interim, between now and \nthe time this bill is going to come back to this body for \nreconsideration after being vetoed by the President, Georgia's \ntaxpayers are going to have to fund a greater portion of the SCHIP \nprogram than they should have to. So I have filed a bill today that is \ngoing to take care of that. It is going to provide immediate funding \nfor the shortfall in Georgia, as well as all of the other shortfall \nStates in the country today that, while they may not experience a \nshortfall as we speak, it is coming within the next 30 to 60 to 90 days \nto 13 other States.\n  On behalf of Senator Isakson and myself, I would ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. \n1022, introduced earlier today; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, unfortunately, I must object to the \nSenator's request. We passed money for the shortfall in the \nsupplemental and we should not extend the program at the expense of the \ncurrent coverage.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Georgia on \nreauthorization that preserves the program and the coverage that is \nneeded, and toward that end, I ask unanimous consent that my bill \ndealing with SCHIP, introduced earlier today, S. 1023, be considered, \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. First, the Chair notes the objection of the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Is there objection to the motion of the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection of the Senator from South Carolina \nis heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 123\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, earlier this year the Senate worked \ntogether to change the way we appropriate money in Congress. One of the \nbig showdowns that we had earlier in the year with the new majority was \nthe discussion of earmarks and how we would disclose them and be more \ntransparent to the American people. We worked hard. I introduced an \namendment that would provide disclosure at the committee level and \nasked that the committee put any earmarks on the Internet and tell who \noffered the earmark and what it would go for, to make sure there is no \nconflict of interest.\n  Originally, the majority tried to table that motion, but once we \nworked together on language and worked out every detail, that amendment \nwas agreed to 98 to 0. It was unanimous that we should stop earmarking \nthe way we are today and use commonsense disclosure rules for America \nto know how we are spending its money.\n  Unfortunately, that amendment is part of the lobbying reform, ethics \nreform bill that has gone to conference with the House that apparently \nis not going to act on it at all. My proposal has been that we take \nwhat we passed in the Senate. We are beginning the appropriations \nprocess again. Unless we impose these rules on ourselves, rules that we \nall agreed on, we are going to go through the same thing we did last \nyear where we put all these bills together, with thousands of earmarks, \nand at the end of the year some of us are going to be forced to try to \nstop the whole process, which, hopefully, we will not do.\n  What I would like to do today to fix this problem is take the \namendment we have passed unanimously before and bring it up and pass it \nin the Senate as a Senate rule so we would operate under the rules that \nwe have all agreed to during this appropriations season. The resolution \nnumber is 123, so fixing the current appropriations problem and earmark \nproblem is as easy as 1, 2, 3.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Rules Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration, and the Senate now proceed to S. \nRes. 123; further, that the resolution be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New \nJersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I believe there is an appropriate process to consider \nthe Senator's request, but at this time I object.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I am certainly disappointed. This is \nsomething to which we have agreed. We worked out the language with the \nmajority. Certainly, we should be operating under the rules that we \nhave agreed to during this appropriations season.\n  It is very unfortunate. I am very disappointed. I guess I have no \nchoice, if the majority is going to object.\n  I yield and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, the fiscal year 2007 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill, just approved by the Senate, includes over $96 \nbillion for the troops. It includes increases above the President's \nrequest for the Department of Defense, including increases of $1.3 \nbillion for defense health, $1 billion for equipping the National Guard \nand Reserve, and $1.1 billion for military housing.\n  The bill includes $6.7 billion for rebuilding the gulf coast region \nfollowing Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. It includes $4.2 billion \nfor agricultural disaster relief. It includes nearly $1.8 billion for \nthe VA to make sure that we meet our moral obligation to provide first-\nclass health care to our wounded veterans.\n  Most importantly, with passage of this bill, the Senate sends a clear \nmessage to the President that we must take the war in Iraq in a new \ndirection. Setting a goal for getting most of our troops out of Iraq is \nnot cutting and running. The new direction provides incentives to the \nIraqi people to settle their differences, to end their civil war, and \nto pursue reconciliation. One fact is plainly clear: The President \nwants to run his war his way, without anyone asking any questions or \nrequiring any standards of progress.\n  That is the kind of attitude that has resulted in the chaos we see in \nIraq each day. President Bush does not want anyone to hold him \naccountable for the failures in Iraq. He does not want anyone to hold \nhim responsible for our troops remaining caught in the escalating Iraqi \ncivil war. The President has his eyes closed to the truth in Iraq.\n  Let me read excerpts from a letter I recently received from soldiers \nserving in and around Baghdad:\n\n       We write you this letter. . . , Senator Byrd, because of \n     your prominent role as Chairman of the Appropriations \n     Committee, and because of your documented observation of the \n     alarming lack of debate within the Senate over the Iraq War.\n       So much of the controversy surrounding the proposed surge \n     strategy has hinged on ``support for our troops.'' Yet, the \n     voice of the individual trooper is not heard. As volunteer \n     members of the military, we waive certain civil rights. We \n     cannot quit. We have a legal and moral responsibility to \n     carry out\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n     the orders given. We offer our bodies and minds, but \n     sacrifice our voices. Our voice is in our vote. Last \n     November, we voted for a Congress that would halt the \n     disastrous Iraq War. . . .\n       Some of us are on our first tour, some our second or third, \n     and for one of us, fifth. We have done our duty, and will \n     continue to do so until our obligation is complete. Upon \n     completion of our obligation, we hope to close this unhappy \n     chapter in our lives and move forward. . . .\n       Listening to the ongoing debate in the news, and the \n     conflicting views of our lawmakers, we hear again and again \n     accusations by one side of the other side's desire to \n     undercut the troops. We see these accusations as moral \n     blackmail. For it is overwhelmingly clear from all of our \n     experiences that despite the unpopularity of this war, the \n     American people have provided unfaltering moral support to \n     the men and women of the military. We implore lawmakers \n     to abandon these hollow accusations, and to focus on the \n     national interest as a whole. We earnestly hope for the \n     enactment of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, \n     particularly those concerning the de-escalation of the war \n     and direct diplomatic engagement of Syria and Iran. We \n     encourage Congress to obstruct the escalation of this war \n     by any means possible.\n\n  Continuing to read from the letter, these solders said:\n\n       Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, we have \n     become painfully aware of our own vulnerability. We have \n     spent vast resources preparing for unknown disaster, fighting \n     an enemy that is ubiquitous, but not clearly defined. We are \n     fighting the specter of fear. This is an internal struggle \n     that we must reconcile. Our vision of the future has grown \n     clouded and ominous. We face a situation in Iraq that leaves \n     us with little hope for a satisfying outcome. As a nation, we \n     must recover from the trauma of 9/11 and abandon the \n     misguided policies we have pursued in its wake. Using the \n     military as our primary foreign policy tool has isolated us \n     and fueled worldwide resentment of us, and has not increased \n     our sense of security. Halting the Iraq war is America's \n     opportunity to change direction, to reengage the world, and \n     discourage terrorism and extremism by showing the world the \n     ingenuity of our people and our commitment to freedom and \n     democracy.\n\n  These are the written words of soldiers now serving in Iraq.\n  The American people want our troops out of Iraq. The Congress has \nsaid very clearly that we want our military to refocus on Osama bin \nLaden and his terrorist bases in Afghanistan. The President has said he \nwill veto this bill. His administration has asserted that adding funds \nfor caring for our wounded veterans, for rebuilding the gulf coast, for \nsecuring the homeland, and for agricultural disaster assistance is \nplaying politics. What nonsense. With approval of this bill, Congress \nwill have appropriated $448 billion for the war in Iraq, including $38 \nbillion for rebuilding Iraq. Certainly if we can spend $38 billion on \nrebuilding Baghdad, we can spend money on rebuilding the gulf coast, \ntaking care of our veterans and protecting our agricultural economy.\n  I hope that the President will drop his rhetoric and instead work \nwith Congress to craft a responsible plan to transition our forces from \nIraq and refocus on bin Laden and his base of operations.\n  Instead of demonizing the Congress and engaging in rhetorical finger-\npointing, the President ought to work with Congress on legislation that \nis in the best interests of the country. I want to thank Senator \nCochran, Senator Murray, Senator Reid, and Senator McConnell for their \nefforts this week in moving this bill through the Senate. I also want \nto thank the Appropriations Committee staff, including Terry Sauvain, \nCharles Kieffer, Peter Rogoff, B.G. Wright, Kate Fitzpatrick, Bruce \nEvans, Blake Thompson, and all of the Subcommittee staffs for their \nhard work on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about an issue that is \nvery dear to me and my home State of Minnesota: the reintegration of \nour returning soldiers into their families and their communities.\n  I begin my remarks by citing a letter to the editor published in the \nSt. Paul Pioneer Press last Saturday by Army National Guard Chaplain \nMAJ John Morris. The letter is titled, ``It Takes Communities To Bring \nSoldiers All The Way Home.'' I ask unanimous consent to have the letter \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        It Takes Communities To Bring Soldiers All the Way Home\n\n                            (By John Morris)\n\n         [From the TwinCities.com-Pioneer Press, Mar. 17, 2007]\n\n       I am watching the growing furor over the shortcomings in \n     the Veterans Administration system and the fallout from \n     Walter Reed Army Hospital with growing alarm. I am concerned \n     that we are going to fix the crisis and forget the problem.\n       The problem is how to help warriors, and their families, \n     successfully reintegrate back into our communities, and their \n     homes, after combat. A portion of that problem is health care \n     related. For a majority of combat vets, however, only a small \n     part of their reintegration challenge has to do with health \n     care for physical injuries. Behavioral and mental health are \n     bigger issues. And for most, the biggest challenge is \n     relational: rebuilding marriages, reconnecting with children, \n     rejoining friends, rejoining the global economy, getting back \n     to the communities of faith we left, etc.\n       The problem with focusing on the VA is we may well fix the \n     VA only to convince ourselves that the reintegration of our \n     combat veterans is a government program, not a community \n     process. If we expect the government to take care of \n     everything, we will have failed our combat veterans and their \n     families as well as ourselves.\n       We have sent our precious men and women to war. The VA \n     can't bring them home. Only we can. We have a moral \n     obligation to insure that all of our combat veterans come all \n     the way home to their families, their jobs, their schools and \n     their communities.\n       A government program can't do that. A community can.\n       That means each of us needs to roll up our sleeves and do \n     more than castigate the VA. It means the following:\n       If you are a health care provider in Minnesota, do the \n     right thing: Become a Tricare provider. Tricare is the \n     insurance the government issues to mobilized reservists and \n     guardsmen.\n       Two-thirds of Minnesota health care providers are not \n     Tricare providers. The result: We do not have an in-patient \n     chemical dependency treatment center in Minnesota that is a \n     Tricare provider. We have a dire shortage of behavioral \n     mental health providers who are Tricare providers. The VA \n     can't fix this we can.\n       If you are an educator, sign up for an Operation Military \n     Kids workshop and learn about the daunting challenges our \n     7,000 Minnesota military kids face when their parent marches \n     off to war, and when they return. Help our children while we \n     are at war. Parent educators, we need you to offer classes in \n     every school district in Minnesota, for military families. We \n     need your help in learning how to parent our children again.\n       If you are a member of the clergy, learn all you can about \n     the toll combat takes on marriages, families, mothers and \n     fathers of military personnel. You don't have to support the \n     foreign policy to pray for us while we are in harm's way and \n     to visit our parents, our spouses and our children while we \n     are gone. When we come home, we need your help in putting our \n     marriages, families and lives back together.\n       If you are an employer, please give my spouse some grace. \n     She or he is juggling a job, a family, a home and a huge \n     heartache. There are no laws to protect them while we are at \n     war, as there are to protect my job when I come back. They \n     struggle mightily and may need some special attention and \n     some extra time off. Do the right thing--help them.\n       If you are a social service provider, learn all you can \n     about combat operational stress,\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\n     the challenges of reintegration for combat veterans and the \n     impact of war on the family system. You are our ``first call \n     for help;'' don't fail us because you choose not to invest in \n     your professional development.\n       If you are a politician, don't politicize the shortfalls in \n     the VA or the military medical system. We aren't pawns in an \n     election cycle; we are your constituents, and we are counting \n     on you to fix the problems. Energize the community on our \n     behalf to do right by us. We're not asking for showy \n     programs. We are asking for tangible signs of support in \n     terms of services offered.\n       If you are our neighbors, and you are, don't ``victimize'' \n     us. Most combat veterans come home without PTSD, mental \n     disorders, physical wounds or destroyed lives. We generally \n     readjust well and go on to live productive lives. Expect \n     great contributions to society from us. We won't disappoint \n     you. Challenge us to greatness; we know how to serve.\n       Watch over our families while we are gone. Extend a warm \n     welcome home when we return. Walk with us through the months \n     of readjustment, and make a place for us in the community.\n       If we are among the tragic few who come home physically or \n     mentally wounded, help us by connecting us to local, county, \n     state and federal resources.\n       Certainly, address the problems with the VA, the military \n     medical system and other systemic issues that face us.\n       But, above all bring us all the way home.\n       A program can't do that. You can.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Major Morris is a member of the Minnesota Army National \nGuard. There are currently 2,600 members of the Minnesota National \nGuard serving in Iraq as members of the 134th Brigade Combat Team. They \nwere deployed to Iraq last March after spending 6 months at Camp \nShelby, MN. When I visited them in December in Fallujah, Taqqadum, and \nTallil, Iraq they were all very excited to return home this month to \nsee their families--some of them returning home for the first time \nsince September of 2005.\n  But they didn't get to come home this month. On January 10 of this \nyear it was announced the 134th would be extended 125 days, hopefully \nreturning home sometime later this summer. With this additional \ndeployment time, the deployment of the 134th in Iraq will be 35 days \nlonger than that of any other unit that has served in Iraq. That is a \nlong time.\n  It is interesting to talk to our National Guard folks. They are not \ncomplaining. They are doing their duty. But I know it weighs heavily on \nmy fellow Minnesotans, on their families, and those of us who get to \nrepresent them in the Congress.\n  When the extension was announced, I shared the great frustration over \nthe fact that our young men and women would not be coming home as \nscheduled, and we had deep concerns about the way it was noticed. I \nthink the families heard about it before the folks in Iraq heard about \nit, and heard about it watching a press conference. The Army \napologized. Certainly we have to do better when issues such as this \ncome up. I struggled to find the best way forward as the troops I had \nvisited weeks earlier would not be coming home until much later than \nthey had planned. I struggled to find ways to ease the hurt.\n  But now the initial shock and frustration of the extension has \nsubsided, and it is time to address the challenges they and their \nfamilies have faced since their deployment and the challenges they will \nface when they return home.\n  In the last few weeks, many of my colleagues have taken to the floor \nand to the airwaves to speak about the commitment we must make to our \nreturning heroes. There aren't many things we can agree on here in this \nbody, but I think all 100 of us agree we need to support our troops \nwhen they come home just as much as we support them when they are \ndefending our Nation and our freedom abroad. We need to support our \ntroops and their families before, during, and after their deployments.\n  So the question is not if we should maintain this strong commitment \nto our returning warriors but, rather, how. How do we provide the \nhighest level of medical care to our soldiers, our veterans? How do we \nassist military families that are readjusting to their loved one \nreturning home--a difficult readjustment. How do we streamline the \nbureaucratic challenges our soldiers face? How do we sustain our \nsupport over the long haul? As these young men and women are returning \nhome, some of them are badly wounded. How do we sustain our support \nover the long haul? As Chaplain Morris states in his letter:\n\n       If you are a politician, don't politicize the shortfalls in \n     the VA or the military medical system. We aren't pawns in an \n     election cycle; we are your constituents and we are counting \n     on you to fix the problems. Energize the community on our \n     behalf to do right by us. We're not asking for showy \n     programs. We are asking for tangible signs of support in \n     terms of services offered.\n\n  The challenges our returning heroes face are not going to be solved \nsimply by throwing more money at the problem. They aren't going to be \nsolved by finger pointing and playing the blame game. They are going to \nbe solved with thoughtful and concentrated efforts aimed at fixing the \nproblems we face one at a time.\n  I have been seeking answers to these challenges and others by \nreaching out to leaders in my State on this issue and the leadership of \nthose involved in the VA health care system. I have had long \nconversations with directors of VA hospitals in Minneapolis, St. Cloud, \nand Fargo, ND to see if there is anything we can do to help deliver the \nhighest level of care. One of the good things that came out of the \nhorrible stories we heard about what was happening in one of the \noutpatient buildings at Walter Reed is in my State and the Chair's \nState, folks went back and they did a room-by-room review to find the \nfailings and the things that needed to be fixed. How can we improve the \nquality of our care? I can tell you in Minnesota, folks have a high \ndegree of confidence in the care at our VA facilities in Minneapolis \nand in St. Cloud, and we count Fargo as ours because it services so \nmany Minnesotans.\n  I met with veterans organizations, including the VFW, the Minnesota \nAmerican Legion, and the Minnesota Paralyzed Veterans, to hear their \nquestions and concerns. Most importantly, I spent some time over the \nlast few weeks touring my State to meet with military families, to talk \nto active-duty soldiers, National Guard members, and veterans. Many of \nthem have a loved one stationed overseas, while others have a loved one \nwho has just returned. There are tremendous support groups in our State \nfor those who have a lot of pressures. Many families didn't know each \nother beforehand and they have united now with a special bond. A lot of \nthem were saying they and their husbands didn't know each other before \nthe deployment, but now we are friends. So they have now a new kind of \nalmost extended family. I wish to say that the good Lord gave us all \ntwo ears and one mouth and it is amazing what can happen when we use \nthem in that fashion.\n\n  I wish to take some time to talk about some of the many concerns I \nhear from folks across my State and how we can better address them. \nMore than anything else, one thing has been made clear by our military \nfamilies: Education benefits for our soldiers continue to be of \nparamount importance.\n  Unfortunately, the National Guard and Army Reserve are still \noperating under an antiquated system of education benefits that does \nnot reflect the additional and critical role they are playing in the \nglobal war on terror. Under current policy, our National Guard and \nReserve soldiers have to use their education benefits while they are \nactually in the National Guard and Reserve. I had the mother of a \nNational Guard soldier visit my office in Washington and tell my staff \nabout her son's particular situation. Her son had been in the National \nGuard for almost 6 years. His 6-year investment ends in September of \nthis year. In 6 years he has been deployed to Bosnia and now Iraq with \nsubstantial ``uptraining'' time spent away from home within the United \nStates.\n  Because of his extension, he will not be able to finish school before \nhis enlistment ends, and because National Guard troops cannot use their \neducation benefits after separating from the service, we will leave him \non his own to find a way to pay for the remainder of his studies and \nhis graduate school, should he choose that path; all this after serving \nextended time on active duty defending our country.\n  There is a bill in the Senate to correct this discrepancy. It is my \nhonor to join Senator Lincoln on her Total Force Education Assistance \nEnhancement and Integration Act. That is a mouthful, but it is \nimportant. This bill would allow National Guard and Reserve troops to \nuse their education benefits up to 10 years from the time they separate \nfrom their service. It also increases their benefits commensurate with \ntheir time on active duty. This is\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\na good start to adjusting education benefits in a changing environment.\n  Another concern I heard during this listening session was about the \ndifficulty our troops are having applying for college when they are \noverseas. Many of our troops want to begin their education, but going \nthrough the college application process is hard enough if you are \nworking on your home computer in your living room. It is even harder if \nyou are stationed 7,000 miles away from home with limited access to \nphone, e-mail, or free time for that matter.\n  We need to find a way to help our deployed soldiers utilize their \neducation benefits by helping them through the difficult application \nprocess. Not only will this improve participation in the program, it \nwill improve our soldiers' morale and their ability to reintegrate when \nreturning home. One of the good things I heard is that some of the \ncolleges are getting this. Some in the State system and now even the \nprivate college system in Minnesota are understanding these challenges \nand are becoming more flexible on the public side, and I applaud this \nkind of public-private partnership.\n  A final note on education is the lack of benefit structure or program \nfor spouses--for spouses of those who are now in the Armed Forces.\n  With over 2,600 Minnesotans currently stationed in Iraq, we have \nhundreds of military spouses working to keep their families together \nwhile their loved one is overseas. Many of them, by the way, were going \nto school, but now their husband or wife is overseas and they have to \ntake a job and give up their education. They have less income, but they \nhave to take care of their families. One spouse told me at one of our \nlistening sessions she had been both a single mom and a military wife \nwhile trying to go to school, and being a single mom was much easier.\n  We need to look at ways to extend benefits to military spouses who \nare working at home to keep their families together while they try to \ncontinue their education. We all know the importance of investment in \neducation. Why should we deny benefits to military spouses who have \nsacrificed so much?\n  Another critical issue I continue to hear about is health care for \nour returning soldiers and veterans. Again, we were all shocked to see \nthe conditions revealed at Walter Reed Hospital at the end of February, \nand I am pleased those who are responsible are being held to account. \nWhile the conditions at the outpatient facility at Walter Reed are \nbeing fixed, it is a good time to revisit the overall structure of \nhealth care for our troops and our veterans. I share the concern \nChaplain Morris states in his letter to the Pioneer Press that we will: \n``Fix the crisis and forget the problems'' in regard to health care and \nwhat I hope can be done to fix them.\n  I continue to hear about the difficulties associated with Tricare. On \nmy visits around the State, I learned that only 40 percent of \nhealthcare providers in Minnesota are Tricare providers. Though this is \nan improvement from the past, it is still unacceptable. From our \nhealthcare providers, we hear that the program is painful and \ncumbersome to work with, and it costs them significant amounts in staff \ntime and energy to navigate the paperwork. For our military families, \nespecially those in rural areas, traveling to a provider that will take \nTricare is often a lengthy process that is simply not possible.\n  We need to look at ways to streamline the Tricare system, and, if \nnecessary, further incentivize providers to accept Trice.\n  Another problem I heard from my visits around the State is the \ninability of returning troops to have marriage counseling covered by \ntheir benefit plans. Under current regulations, Tricare does not cover \nthe counseling that is often necessary when our warriors return to \ntheir homes and families. Many of our troops have been deployed for \nextended periods of time, and when they return home, it is difficult to \nreadjust into life with their families.\n  If a returning soldier wanted to receive marriage counseling, for \ninstance, they must go to their family doctor and get a referral for \nmental health issues caused by marriage. Then, after substantial effort \nand delay, it becomes possible for a soldier to act on the referral for \nstress and mental health concerns and see a marriage and family \ntherapist. We have to do better than this for our returning warriors.\n  Another major issue we confront with Tricare is the lack of Tricare-\ncertified Chemical Dependency Treatment Centers. Because of the \nburdensome certification process for these centers, we have 257 \nChemical Dependency Treatment Centers that are certified by the State \nof Minnesota but not a single one of them is certified by Tricare. So \nif any of our returning heroes comes home and develops a problem with \nsubstance abuse, there is not a single place in Minnesota they can go \nfor help. This is a critical oversight which needs to be corrected.\n  Another issue we need to be prepared to handle is post traumatic \nstress disorder, PTSD. We all know PTSD is going to be an issue we will \nface for years to come as more of our soldiers return from abroad. And \nif we are committed to dealing with it, we need to be committed to the \nfacilities and the people who will be working to cure the disorder on a \ndaily basis.\n  One way we can do this is to incentivize mental health care \nprofessionals to join our veterans and military hospital system. I have \nlearned in my outreach across the State that it is difficult to recruit \nthese professionals, especially qualified psychiatrists, to VA and \nmilitary hospitals in rural areas. I have always said that the quality \nof your healthcare should not depend on your ZIP Code, and this is \nespecially true for our veterans and military families.\n  We also need to make sure we have adequate facilities for the influx \nof participation in veterans' programs for the next few years. While \nmost of the veterans I have spoken with over the past months have told \nme that the care they receive at the facilities in Minnesota is nothing \nshort of excellent, we need to plan for the strain an increasing number \nof veterans will have on our facilities that are operating near \ncapacity .\n  Finally, I would like to address the importance of a comprehensive \nstrategy for reintegrating our returning heroes into society. Quite \nfrankly, this is bigger than any one single issue confronting our \nveterans and military families, but it encompasses everything I have \ntalked about so far today.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the National Guard has developed an \ninnovative program known as Beyond the Yellow Ribbon to conduct \nreintegration academies for the families and their loved ones who are \nreturning from Iraq. We have watched with great pleasure as this \nprogram has helped countless families deal with the everyday challenges \nthat are not touched by Washington rhetoric. Through this program, we \nhave been able to engage our families, our communities, and most \nimportantly, our returning heroes, to ensure that they are comfortably \nshifting back to life out of the combat zone.\n  I will continue to work with our Minnesota National Guard and the \nfamilies, communities, and veterans across our State so that we can \ncontinue this program and use the experience we gain from it to benefit \nour Nation as a whole.\n  Inscribed on the base of the Korean War Memorial is the following: \n``Our nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to \ndefend a country they never knew and a people they never met.'' These \nwords ring true today as so many of our service men and women are \nfighting overseas in the war on terror.\n  We need to make sure the sacrifice they make is met by a commitment \nhere to do all we can to ease their reentry and take care of their \nconcerns as they return.\n  We need to provide support for these soldiers. We need to provide \nsupport for their families. And we need to do it before, during, and \nafter they return from abroad. It is not about rhetoric, and it is not \nabout politics. It is about a commitment to listen and a commitment to \nget things done. I look forward to working with my colleagues to this \nend during the coming months and years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4137-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4137-S4139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, last month, at a Senate Agriculture \nCommittee hearing, Rhonda Stewart, a single mother from Hamilton, OH, \nButler\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\nCounty, testified that despite working full time, caring for her 9-\nyear-old son Wyatt--even serving as president of the PTA--she and her \nson must rely on food stamps to survive.\n  At the end of each month, she told us, she must forgo dinner so her \nson can eat because the food stamps, which is about $6 a day, don't go \nfar enough. She told us that at the beginning of the month, he gets \npork chops. He knows he eats better in the beginning of the month than \nat the end of the month when she is running out of money. At the end of \nthe month, she sits and tells him she is not really hungry, as her son \neats, because she wants him to have enough, even when she doesn't.\n  On the same day that Ms. Steward testified, U.S. Treasury Secretary \nPaulson told the Senate Banking Committee that the economy was doing \nwell. He said over and over that the GDP was up 3 percent for the \nquarter. He kept insisting: Senator, you don't understand, things are \ngoing very well in this country. GDP is up 3 percent. People are making \nmoney and companies are profitable.\n  When you think about all of that, here is the story: Profits are up. \nThe stock market is doing well. Millionaires are enjoying exorbitant \ntax breaks. Worker productivity is up, but the workers are not sharing \nin the increasing profits most corporations are making. Workers across \nthe country too often are losing their jobs, and a single mother \nworking full time cannot afford to eat dinner--even with the $6 a day \nin food stamps.\n  A Wall Street Journal article reported this week that since 2001, the \neconomy has grown by 16 percent--16 percent since 2001--while worker \npay, after inflation, has grown less than 1 percent--16 percent growth \nin the economy, profits up, workers gaining less than 1 percent.\n  Wrongheaded economic policies and job-killing trade agreements have \nfueled income disparity at home and abroad.\n  A few years ago, after the North American Free Trade Agreement \npassed, Congress was considering another one of these job-killing trade \nagreements. I traveled to McAllen, TX, where I crossed the border into \nReynosa, Mexico. I rented a car with some friends and went to visit \nsome families in Mexico just a couple of miles on the other side of the \nAmerican border. There I met a husband and wife who worked for General \nElectric, Mexico. They lived in a shack that was about 20-by-20 feet, \nwith no running water, no electricity, dirt floors. When it rained \nhard, the floors turned to mud. They worked 10 hours a day, 6 days a \nweek, and each made less than a dollar an hour. Behind their shack was \na ditch that was about 3 feet wide, perhaps, which was full of who-\nknows-what--perhaps human and industrial waste. The children played in \nthis ditch. The American Medical Association has said that along that \nborder is one of the most toxic places in the entire Western \nHemisphere.\n  We visited an auto plant nearby, a modern, high-tech auto plant. The \nplant in Mexico looked just like an auto plant in Lordstown, OH, or \nAvon Lake or Cincinnati. The workers were working hard, the floors were \nclean, the technology was up-to-date, and the productivity was very \ngood. But there was one difference between the Mexican auto plant and \nthe one you would see in Ohio. That difference was the Mexican auto \nplant didn't have a parking lot. The Mexican workers were not making \nenough to buy the cars they made.\n  You can go halfway around the world to Malaysia to a Motorola plant, \nwhere the workers are not making enough to buy the cell phones they \nmake, or you can go to Costa Rica, where workers at a Disney plant \ndon't make enough to buy the toys they make. In China, workers at a \nNike plant are not making enough to buy those shoes they make. These \nworkers are not sharing in the wealth they create for their employers.\n  That is why these job-killing trade agreements don't work. Only when \nworkers share in the wealth they create will we know our trade policy \nis working. In fact, when the poor in the developing world--those \npeople who are working hard, working 50 to 60 hours a week, with their \nhands--only when the poor in those countries are able to buy the \nproducts they are making for us will we know our trade policy in the \nUnited States is actually working.\n  During the fight against the Central American Free Trade Agreement 2 \nyears ago, the largest ever bipartisan fair-trade group was formed. \nDemocrats and Republicans, environmental groups, religious groups, \nlabor organizations, and business groups united and we changed forever \nthe debate on trade. That coalition is alive and well, not just in the \nHouse of Representatives but also for the first time in the Senate. \nThey are already working to revamp our Nation's trade policy and \nworking to establish a manufacturing policy.\n\n  Senators Byron Dorgan, Lindsey Graham, and I have introduced \nlegislation that would ban imports from sweatshops. We have called for \ntougher World Trade Organization action to be taken against China, a \ncountry where, at least in 2005, 5,000 political prisoners were \nexecuted. The human rights violations continue in China. The oppression \nof workers continues in China. The kinds of values we hold dear in this \ncountry are violated every day by that Government and every day by \nthese companies doing business in China, a country that manipulates its \ncurrency and continues to exploit its workers.\n  Our Government must renegotiate these trade agreements so that they \nlift up workers here and abroad, reward U.S. businesses that stay here, \nreward U.S. businesses that produce here, and reward U.S. businesses \nthat create jobs here. That means doing away with current fast-track \nauthority. That means doing away with the fundamentally flawed North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA model trade agreements. Make no \nmistake, we want trade. We want more of it, but we want fair trade. It \nis not a matter of if we revamp U.S. trade policy; it is when and who \nbenefits from that.\n  America is a nation of innovation. The future of our manufacturing \npolicy is firmly planted in the research and development of alternative \nenergy. Today, I spoke with several people from Ohio--business owners \nand plant managers--who are part of a group called the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership. It is a relatively small government program that \nhelps small manufacturers, small businesses in Ohio and across the \ncountry, learn to compete better, helps them learn to cut their health \ncare costs, helps them to be more energy efficient, and helps them \nlearn how to export some of their products. We have a long way to go.\n  Oberlin College, not far from where I live, is home to the largest \nbuilding in the United States on a college campus that is completely \npowered by solar energy. However, when that college built this \nbuilding, they had to buy the components of the solar panels from Japan \nand Germany because we don't make enough of them in this country.\n  The same is true when you talk about wind turbines. In Ashtabula, OH, \nthey make components for wind-turbine manufacturing. So do some other \nplaces around the country. But they do not make enough. More and more \nwind turbines are being built in this country, and it is a great \nopportunity, as all of alternative energy production is, for us as a \nnation to use that, in part, to help rebuild our manufacturing \ncapabilities, to cut energy prices, and to do the right thing for the \nenvironment. It works in every way.\n  That is why as we, in the next couple of months, move toward votes on \ntrade promotion authority, as we move forward, perhaps, on votes on \nbilateral trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Korea, Panama, and \nother countries, perhaps, it is time that we pass trade agreements in \nthis country that lift up workers, help our small manufacturers, that \nhelp us continue to preserve and expand our manufacturing base.\n  It is an American value to reward hard work. This Congress has a real \nopportunity not just to talk about a different trade regimen but to go \nin a different direction, to replace trade promotion authority with a \ntrade promotion authority legislation model that will help to lift our \nworkers up, create jobs in this country, help the developing world lift \nup their living standards so that we can continue to reward work and \ncontinue to fight for our values as a nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ncompletion of my remarks, Senator Alexander of Tennessee be recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the emergency appropriations bill passed \nby the Senate this morning is urgently needed for our troops in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, for our wounded veterans, and for scores of Americans \nfacing natural disasters on the homefront.\n  I commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for their hard work and \nclose collaboration. As the acting chairman of the Military \nConstruction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I \nalso wish to thank Senator Hutchison and her able staff, along with my \ncommittee staff, for the help they gave in crafting the portions of the \nsupplemental which dealt with military construction and veterans \naffairs.\n  The total for military construction and veterans affairs in this \nsupplemental is $6.548 billion. It includes in title I $1.644 billion \nfor military construction. Also contained in this section is a proviso \nrestricting the obligation of $280 million until the Secretary of \nDefense certifies that none of the funds will be used for the purpose \nof establishing permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq. I think that is \nan important point to clarify.\n  Title II of the recommendation includes a total of $4.9 billion for \nmilitary construction and also for activities at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. This includes $3.137 billion to restore funding for \nBRAC, which is very important to reset our forces as they are returned \nfrom overseas and to help reconfigure all of the services. This fully \nfunds the request of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2007 for \nthis account and will keep the BRAC process on track.\n  Because the costs of the war are not associated strictly with \nactivities on the battlefield, the recommendation includes $1.767 \nbillion for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  In crafting the VA portion of this bill, we targeted the funding \nspecifically for purposes of building capacity to deal with the influx \nof OEF and OIF veterans, hiring claims adjudicators and leveraging \ntechnology to expedite benefit claims, and upgrading existing VA \nfacilities.\n  The VA health care system is one of the best in the world. It has \nspecialties in a number of areas, including spinal cord injury and \nblind rehabilitation. Because of these specialties, the VA has become a \ngreat resource for the treatment of troops wounded in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. However, due to the nature of combat in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, coupled with the advances in battlefield medicine, both \nthe DOD health care system and the VA health care system are treating \nmore military personnel with complex and multiple wounds and \nparticularly traumatic brain injuries.\n  In response to this, in 2005, the Congress provided funding to the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to establish polytrauma centers. The \nfunding contained in this bill builds on the success of these centers \nby providing a total of over $163 million in polytrauma care for \nservices ranging from establishing more level 1 comprehensive \npolytrauma centers to creating polytrauma residential transition \nrehabilitation programs, to upgrading the entire polytrauma network \nsystem.\n  The bill also adds $150 million for enhancements to readjustment \ncounseling, substance abuse programs, and mental health treatment \ncapacity. These are specialty areas that the VA will need to continue \nto expand to deal with readjustment issues facing veterans returning \nfrom the war zone. In order to begin making progress toward \ndeficiencies identified by the VA's facilities condition assessment and \nto prevent a possible Walter Reed Building 18 situation, the \nrecommendation includes $550 million in nonrecurring maintenance and \n$356 million in minor construction.\n  In addition to funding provided to the Department, the supplemental \nalso includes a general provision directing the National Academy of \nPublic Administration to conduct an independent analysis of the \nmanagement, structure, and processes that are in place at the VA with \nregard to providing health care to active duty and veterans of the wars \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as providing benefits to veterans of \nthese conflicts. This study will assist the VA and Congress in \nidentifying the cumbersome bureaucratic redtape that far too many of \nour soldiers go through in their transition to the VA.\n  The bill also includes a provision requiring the Congressional Budget \nOffice to conduct a budget study of the current and future long-term \nbudget impacts of OEF and OIF on the Department of Veterans Affairs. We \nknow with a number of these young men and women who have been severely \ninjured--many with brain injuries and likely lifespans of 50 or 60 more \nyears--that we will have to provide long-term, consistent, robust \nfunding. We should identify that number now and provide that continuing \nsupport for the next several decades.\n  This supplemental marks the continuing high priority the Senate \nplaces on ensuring that yesterday's, today's, and tomorrow's soldiers \nare cared for in the highest manner once they have done their duty and \nonce they have come home to America.\n  Let me make one other point. I was somewhat disappointed in this bill \nbecause I was attempting to include an amendment to rehabilitate a \nlevee system in Woonsocket, RI, to ensure it is up to Federal \nstandards.\n  This amendment would have provided $3.25 million for the city of \nWoonsocket to rehabilitate the levee, including replacing important \ngate cables. The present cables are about 40 years old. According to \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, failure of a cable during operation could \nresult in an uncontrolled discharge downstream of the dam. Woonsocket \nis an old industrial city, densely populated, and these levees protect \nthat city.\n\n  The Woonsocket project was built between December 1963 and April 1967 \nby the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps estimates that cumulative \nflood control benefits for the Blackstone Valley project are more than \n$82 million. This project in place protects at least $82 million worth \nof property.\n  Given the importance of this flood protection to Woonsocket and \ncommunities on the Blackstone River, I believe Federal assistance is \nwarranted to protect life and property.\n  These deficiencies were discovered as a direct result of Katrina. We \nlearned in Katrina there were projects, levees that were \nunsatisfactory. They failed and they caused billions of dollars of \ndamages. Being forewarned--I hope we are forewarned--that having \nstudied these problems, I hope we can now come together in Congress to \nprovide the resources and help these local communities, many of which \ndo not have the resources to sustain this kind of immediate and rapid \nexpenditure.\n  A recent assessment by the Corps found that the Woonsocket levee and \ndam is in need of repairs. The Corps has given the city until February \n2008 to make these repairs, otherwise the project will no longer be \neligible for Federal construction funding through the Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  In addition, if these repairs are not made, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency could, and likely will, determine the levee no longer \noffers adequate flood protection and could require residents to buy \nflood insurance, which is a very expensive proposition. The city of \nWoonsocket is economically distressed. It needs Federal assistance. \nThere are other communities around the country that might be in a \nsimilar situation.\n  The devastation wrought by Katrina in New Orleans shows us what could \nhappen. Now we have the knowledge--the foreknowledge--and now we have \nto act. I am disappointed we did not act in this situation to protect \nthis complex of levees.\n  I will continue to bring this issue to the attention of my colleagues \nagain and again because I believe that with this knowledge, action is \nrequired--prompt, appropriate action--to ensure this community is \nprotected.\n  I wish to make a final point because my colleague has been very \npatient and very considerate in allowing me to go ahead.\n  We have included in this supplemental language with respect to our\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\npolicy in Iraq which I think is important, indeed, perhaps historical. \nIt recognizes that we should begin a phased redeployment of our forces. \nIt recognizes that we also must maintain certain missions in Iraq--\ncounterterrorism operations, training Iraqi security forces, and \nprotecting our forces. But it does emphasize we should begin on a date \ncertain going forward to take out our forces at a pace and a level \ndecided by operational commanders. There is a goal--not a fixed \ndeadline--but a goal that our combat forces--those not performing these \nresidual missions--should be out of Iraq by March 31, 2008.\n  This is a solution proposed essentially by the Iraq Study Group. It \nhas been recommended, endorsed by the public sentiment of the American \npeople by a wide margin. It allows us to continue missions that are \ncritical to the safety and security of not only ourselves but of the \nregion, but it does, we hope, disengage us from a potential and \nsometimes very real civil war in Iraq.\n  I hope that in the deliberations with the House, we can come up with \na measure that combines the best elements of both versions of the \nspending bill. I hope we can bring this to the President and discuss it \nwith him. It does represent, I think, the sentiment of the American \npeople. It does represent not only the sentiment that we change course \nin Iraq, but, as this budget does, we fully fund our forces in Iraq.\n  I am hopeful we can make progress and that we can send to the \nPresident a bill, after discussing it with him, that could be signed \nrather than vetoed. That is my hope at this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe I am to be recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to make remarks about three \nmatters of importance to the great American outdoors, all of which have \nbeen happening this week and which are important for our country.\n  First, I wish to comment on a provision the Senate struck from the \nIraq supplemental appropriations bill this morning when we were \nconsidering it. We struck it in a procedural move based upon a point of \norder I raised. The provision was a billboard amnesty proposal that was \ninserted into the middle of legislation that was supposed to be in \nsupport of our troops.\n  I called it a billboard amnesty proposal because it suddenly would \nhave treated as legal billboard sites that have been illegal for 40 \nyears and effectively would have gutted the Highway Beautification Act \nof 1965, which is one of the legacies of a former First Lady, Lady Bird \nJohnson.\n  I think this deserves a little attention and a little explanation \nbefore we leave it because it was a full-scale assault on one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that helps keep our country \nbeautiful at a time when we are growing and struggling to preserve open \nspaces.\n  There are three problems with this billboard amnesty proposal, as I \nsaw it. First, the proposal would have done for the billboard industry \nsomething the law doesn't allow for churches, doesn't allow for \nschools, doesn't allow for businesses, doesn't allow for any other \nstructures that since 1965 have been on illegal or nonconforming sites.\n  This is what was happening. In 1965, at the urging of President \nJohnson and Mrs. Johnson, the Nation decided it would restrict \nbillboards, both in terms of their location and their size. As we often \ndo with legislation, we looked ahead and said the billboards could not \nbe located in some places and had to be within a certain size. As the \ninterstate system grew across the country, much of it is relatively \nfree of large billboards or has a limited number of billboards.\n  The question then arose about what do we do about the billboards and \nsigns that were already up prior to 1965. The decision was made by the \nCongress at that time to say we will leave those signs up, we will \ngrandfather them in. As long as they stay up, they are fine, but when \nthey fall down, they will be gone. In other words, we have been waiting \nfor 40 years for those sites to die a natural death. That was the \ncompromise in 1965. Many of these billboards are large billboards and \nare in places we don't want--rural areas, scenic areas across the \ncountry--but that was the decision we made.\n  The problem with this legislation, as it came into the supplemental \nappropriations bill for troops, is it said suddenly all the billboards \nin 13 States that are on sites where it would be illegal to put a new \nbillboard were suddenly legal. In other words, it was instant amnesty, \novernight amnesty for illegal billboards.\n  There are a lot of billboards like this. For example, in the State of \nTennessee, there are nearly 3,000 billboards on sites where they would \nnot be permitted under current law, but when those billboards fall \ndown, they can't ever put them back up. We have known that for 40 \nyears. In North Carolina, there are probably 2,600 illegal sites, in \nthe sense that when the billboards wear out, fall down, act of God \nknocks them out, they can't be put back up. In South Carolina, there \nare 2,200; in Florida, 6,000; in Oklahoma, 1,400; and in Alabama, 912. \nIn a moment, I will put in the list of those in each State.\n  What the provision that we struck from the bill said was, because \nthere were some hurricanes down South, in all these places where \nbillboards on illegal sites were knocked down by a hurricane, they \ncould be put back up. That raises a lot of questions. What is the \ndifference between a billboard being destroyed by a hurricane and being \ndestroyed by lightning, or it becoming water damaged, or it falling \ndown because it is rotting, or some other act of God?\n  The whole idea in 1965 was when the billboards wore out, or an act of \nGod destroyed them, they were gone. They were gone. We have been \nwaiting for 40 years for that to happen. So in comes the billboard \nlobby and, suddenly, we have first a proposal to exempt all these \nbillboards across the country--instant billboard amnesty for all the \nbillboards in every State--even though the hurricanes were in the \nSouth.\n  Finally, that original proposal from the billboard industry got \nnarrowed down to 13 States, which included Tennessee--we don't have a \nlot of hurricanes in Tennessee--and Kentucky. Hurricanes in Kentucky?\n  I think what is happening here is the billboard lobby is doing its \nbest to reclaim all those billboards that have been illegal for 40 \nyears by saying because of this hurricane or that drought or that \nlightning strike, suddenly we want them rebuilt in every State. That is \na pretty good thing for all the billboard companies, because by and \nlarge they have bought them up from all the small farmers. They weren't \nworth very much because the owners knew when they fell down, the \nbillboards could never be replaced. So what could be better for the big \nbillboard lobby than to suddenly get instant amnesty for all these \nsites and instant riches overnight for those companies?\n  I don't blame them for trying, but I think the Senate was exactly \nright to say, wait a minute, we can't do this. Not only is it an \naffront to the troops to be cavalierly talking about a wet kiss to the \nbillboard lobby in the middle a debate when we are supposed to be \nhelping the troops in Iraq, I think it is an affront to Lady Bird \nJohnson and all those across America who, for 40 years, have tried to \nkeep our country, about which we sing, beautiful. One of our greatest \nvalues is we sing and believe in America the beautiful.\n  This motion was put into the legislation by the Democratic leader. I \nwant to make very clear I don't question his motives, and I respect \nwhat he does. I appreciate the courteous way in which he treated the \ndiscussion he and I had on this. I told him if there were some \ninjustices that have to do with States in the South that have been \nsomehow unevenly treated by the law or impacted by the hurricanes in a \nway nobody anticipated, I would be glad to work with him and other \nmembers of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I \nserve, to correct those injustices. But the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nMartinez, was a cosponsor of my amendment to get rid of this provision. \nThe Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, was a cosponsor of my amendment \nto stop this billboard amnesty. So who is the billboard lobby trying to \nprotect here, when the Senators from those States--Tennessee,\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nAlabama, and Florida--say we don't need that sort of protection? But I \nam happy and willing to work on that legislation.\n  I also wish to make it clear to my colleagues this is not a new \nsubject for me. In the 1980s, when I was Governor of Tennessee, the \nlegislature and I--and the legislature was Democratic at the time--made \n10,000 of our State roads scenic highways. We put little mockingbirds \nup, and we said no new billboards and no new junkyards. Tennessee is a \nbeautiful State, and we wanted people to enjoy it as they drove across \nthe country. The only regret I have is we didn't think of cell towers \nbeing invented. We all use them, for our cell phones and our \nBlackBerries. In Tennessee, they seem to be having a contest to see who \ncan invent the biggest and the ugliest cell tower and stick it in the \nmost scenic place. But we created those scenic highways in a bipartisan \nway.\n  In the mid-1980s, I was chairman of the President's Commission on \nAmericans Outdoors, with Gilbert Grosvenor, the head of National \nGeographic, and Pat Noonan, president of The Conservation Fund, and one \nof our major recommendations was a system of scenic byways, which the \nCongress has now created across our country.\n  Our people want to see our beautiful country and they want reasonable \nlimits on what we are doing. They certainly don't want to see us, in \nthe middle of legislation to support our troops, to have suddenly \nattached to the appropriations bill an instant billboard amnesty \nproposal. I am glad that is out of the bill, and I congratulate the \nSenate for doing what we did this morning. It will come up through the \nregular committee, if we ever need to do that. The proposal was a big \nwet kiss to the billboard lobby, and a kissing line in which I don't \ncare to stand, and I appreciate the Senate action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from several organizations--Scenic America, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the American \nPlanning Association, and other groups--expressing their deep concern \nabout the provision we knocked out of the supplemental appropriations \nbill that would have gutted the Highway Beautification Act.\n  Following that, I wish to include a chart from Scenic America that \nhas a list of the number of nonconforming billboards in every State. \nThere are 63,000 of those sites where it would be illegal to put up new \nbillboards. The whole thrust of this billboard amnesty proposal would \nhave been to turn those illegal sites into legal sites overnight, \nbeginning with these 13 States and perhaps expanding to other States in \nthe future.\n  Also, I wish to include two newspaper articles, one from the \nWashington Post and one from USA Today, which alerted the Senate this \nweek to this provision in the appropriations bill, which slipped in \nvery quietly under the heading of ``highway signs.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 27, 2007.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: We are writing to express our deep \n     concern about a provision related to the Highway \n     Beautification Act's rules governing the destruction of \n     nonconforming signs by hurricanes that was added to the \n     Senate's supplemental appropriation bill. We strongly believe \n     this legislation would do significant harm to the core \n     principles underlying this 42-year-old law and will impair \n     the ability of state and local governments to remove \n     nonconforming billboards from their communities. Moreover, it \n     will also undermine local governments' ability to regulate \n     nonconforming land uses in general by carving out an \n     exception to long-standing legal and regulatory practices not \n     available to any other business entity. Because this is a \n     substantive measure that properly belongs within the \n     jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \n     and because it would be extraordinarily damaging to \n     communities in 13 states, we urge you to seek the removal of \n     this provision from the final bill.\n       As you know, this is the third attempt within the past year \n     to weaken this important provision of the HBA and, once \n     again, the offending legislation avoided the formal scrutiny \n     of the authorizing committees with jurisdiction. Policy \n     matters of this importance deserve to be dealt with directly \n     through appropriate legislative channels, not through \n     nongermane appropriations measures.\n       But this legislation is wrong not just procedurally, it is \n     wrong on its merits. This measure permits state legislatures \n     in FEMA Regions IV and VI to opt-out of one of the last \n     remaining effective provisions of the Highway Beautification \n     Act, which is already heavily weighted to the advantage of \n     the outdoor advertising industry. One of the principal \n     compromises made at the time of the HBA's passage was that \n     nonconforming signs would be removed by attrition over time. \n     These signs, often many decades old, are located in places \n     that no longer permit them and are, by definition, \n     undesirable. Like all nonconforming land uses they are \n     subject to permanent removal when they are destroyed by acts \n     of God. They cannot be replaced or rebuilt for the simple \n     reason that it is now illegal to build a new sign at that \n     location.\n       Each state currently defines what constitutes ``destroyed'' \n     in its agreement with the federal government implementing the \n     law. Usually, ``destruction'' is defined as some percentage \n     of the structure or the value of the sign. When a \n     nonconforming sign is harmed in a storm, and crosses the \n     threshold from merely damaged to destroyed, its permit is \n     revoked and it must be permanently removed, just as any \n     nonconforming structure would be under similar circumstances. \n     Case law and common practice have long held that the owner of \n     a nonconforming destroyed structure is not entitled to \n     compensation and certainly cannot rebuild it. Billboards \n     are--and should be--no exception. Congress should not treat \n     billboard companies differently from any other business that \n     owns nonconforming structures destroyed in hurricanes.\n       We are deeply concerned that the continued weakening of the \n     enforcement provisions of the HBA will render the \n     nonconforming designation meaningless, in effect converting \n     these signs into permanent structures. Incidentally the \n     legislative language permits these signs to be rebuilt with \n     modern materials that will make them virtually \n     indestructible, a notion completely at odds with the original \n     intention of the law. The crippling of the storm-destruction \n     provision effectively removes any hope that the thousands of \n     old, nonconforming billboards littering our highways will \n     ever be removed. Many of these signs are over 30 years old; \n     some, much older. They were purchased with full knowledge \n     that they were subject to destruction by natural causes and \n     ultimate removal, and should not be granted special \n     protection, particularly given their notoriously adverse \n     impact on the quality of community life.\n       The provision requires state legislative action in order to \n     take effect, and in virtually every instance in recent years \n     state legislation dealing with billboards overrides local \n     authority. Ultimately, local prerogatives will almost \n     certainly be trampled, and, in fact, will need to be in order \n     for the bill to have its intended effect of protecting the \n     interests of billboard companies. This is an instance where a \n     federal standard protects local governments better than a \n     policy crafted in state legislatures.\n       In addition, you should be aware that the outdoor \n     advertising industry has been embroiled in significant legal \n     and administrative disputes involving the potentially \n     improper rebuilding of nonconforming signs destroyed in \n     recent hurricane seasons. This measure is a transparent \n     effort to short-circuit ongoing court cases as well as \n     administrative disputes between FHWA and state departments of \n     transportation and between state DOT's and the industry. \n     Further, Congress should not be swayed by spurious claims of \n     hardships faced by sign companies or advertisers in the wake \n     of recent storms. Most of the destroyed signs are owned by \n     very large media corporations which purchased the signs from \n     the original owners with full knowledge of their \n     nonconforming status, and affected local businesses face no \n     shortage of alternative signs for their advertising messages.\n       This provision is an affront to the core principles of \n     well-established federal law and threatens local authority, \n     and represents a violation of congressional procedures and \n     basic democratic principles. A supplemental appropriation \n     bill should not be used to make substantive changes to a \n     policy that is completely nongermane to its purpose. Citizens \n     and stakeholders should not be frozen out of the legislative \n     process in an effort to promote the interests of a powerful \n     industry. We strongly urge you to protect American \n     communities, the prerogatives of local governments, and the \n     long-standing federal interest in the beautification of our \n     national highway system by seeking the removal of this \n     provision from the supplemental appropriations bill.\n       If you would like further information about this issue and \n     its implications, please don't hesitate to contact Kevin Fry, \n     the president of Scenic America.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.\n       Sincerely,\n         Scenic America, The United States Conference of Mayors, \n           National League of Cities, The American Planning \n           Association, The American Society of Landscape \n           Architects, The American Institute of Architects, The \n           Surface Transportation Policy Partnership, The National \n           Association of Towns and Townships.\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\n           [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS29MR07.001\n           \n\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\n               [From washingtonpost.com, March 27, 2007]\n\n Billboard King Reid Looks To Leave Mark on Senate War Funding Measure\n\n                       (By Elizabeth Williamson)\n\n       In a (quite) large sign that protecting U.S. troops isn't \n     the only thing on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's mind \n     these days, the Nevada Democrat inserted an item into the \n     Senate's Iraq war funding bill--safeguarding billboards.\n       Senate debate began yesterday on the bill, which provides \n     $122 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; sets a \n     goal of March 31, 2008, for withdrawing U.S. troops from \n     Iraq; and--if Reid has his way--allows thousands of \n     billboards destroyed by bad weather to be rebuilt.\n       For the senator, who has referred to himself as the King of \n     Billboards, ``it's a constituent issue, but it's a value that \n     he believes in,'' said Reid spokesman Jon Summers.\n       The battle over billboards began in 1965, when the Highway \n     Beautification Act set a policy that ``nonconforming'' \n     billboards--defined by states but usually meaning those \n     packed closely together, or in scenic areas--would be allowed \n     to die of natural causes. As storms and other acts of God \n     destroyed them, their owners would not be permitted to \n     replace them. Recent hurricanes have fueled a fight between \n     the powerful Outdoor Advertising Association of America \n     (OAAA), which wants to roll back the federal law, and \n     opponents led by Washington-based Scenic America, which decry \n     billboards as ``visual pollution.''\n       On March 15, Reid wrote Senate Appropriations Committee \n     Chairman Robert Byrd (D-W.Va) asking for a provision that \n     ``clarifies'' the rules governing rebuilding of ``outdoor \n     structures'' after natural disasters.\n       ``This is a matter of personal importance to me,'' the \n     majority leader wrote, a comment that ``goes back to the \n     values,'' Summers said. Meaning that out west, ``there's a \n     big sense of independence, and your property is your \n     property,'' Summers said.\n       About 40 billboard companies operate in Nevada. Over the \n     past two years, Reid's Searchlight Leadership Fund has \n     received $6,000 in contributions from the OAAA's political \n     action committee.\n       The OAAA represents a booming industry that earned $7 \n     billion nationwide in revenue last year, but it emphasizes \n     the role of billboards in advertising local businesses. \n     Association spokesman Ken Klein said Reid's amendment aims to \n     reverse ``a pattern of overreaching'' by the federal \n     government, which threatened to withhold highway funds to \n     Florida when companies rebuilt nonconforming billboards hit \n     by hurricanes in 2004. Reid's bill would have prevented such \n     actions.\n       Kevin Fry, president of Scenic America, said: ``The bill \n     carves out an exception to local land-use rules for a single \n     industry that is not available to any other . . . One might \n     reasonably ask why legislation affecting the South and \n     Southeast was introduced by a senator from Nevada.''\n       Reid's request went to the Appropriations subcommittee on \n     transportation, which pared it back to apply to 13 mostly \n     hurricane-prone states, instead of all 50. The law would come \n     up for renewal in 24 months.\n       Scenic America is fighting the amendment, which ``sets a \n     destructive precedent that will certainly be revisited \n     anytime natural disasters take their toll on nonconforming \n     billboards,'' Fry said. ``The two-year time frame is a \n     joke.''\n       The OAAA sees the measure as a ``positive step,'' Klein \n     said. ``Senator Reid is a longtime supporter of mobility, \n     tourism and property rights. We appreciate those \n     principles.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA TODAY, March 27, 2007]\n\n                Bill Would Shelter Unsightly Billboards\n\n                            (By Kathy Kiely)\n\n       Washington.--A bill the Senate takes up today to provide \n     emergency funds for military operations and Katrina victims \n     also would help billboard advertisers that donated tens of \n     thousands of dollars to Democrats and Republicans for the \n     2006 election.\n       A provision tucked into the $122 billion measure at the \n     request of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., would \n     exempt older billboards in 13 Southern states, stretching \n     from Florida to New Mexico, from regulation under the 1965 \n     Highway Beautification Act.\n       The provision would let billboard companies rebuild signs \n     damaged by hurricanes even if the new ones violate laws \n     regulating the size and placement of outdoor advertising. \n     Reid says he's trying to protect the rights of businesses \n     hurt by the storms: ``Why shouldn't they be able to replace \n     their property like anybody else?''\n       Kevin Fry of Scenic America, a non-profit group that \n     opposes Reid's move, says there's a good reason: The \n     billboards are eyesores that would be barred today.\n       Fry says Reid's efforts would be ``a grotesque weakening'' \n     of the Highway Beautification Act, a legacy of President \n     Lyndon Johnson's wife, Lady Bird. It lets states regulate \n     billboards along federal highways.\n       Fry says states often prohibit signs that are too large, \n     too close together or located along rural and scenic routes. \n     About 75,000 signs built before the regulations remain, Fry \n     says: ``It's the worst kind of blight.''\n       Hurricanes destroyed some in Florida and Gulf Coast states \n     in 2004 and 2005. Hal Kilshaw, vice president of Lamar \n     Advertising of Baton Rouge, one of the advertising firms \n     pushing to rebuild, says, ``States should be able to \n     decide,'' not Washington.\n       For the 2006 election, the Outdoor Advertising \n     Association's political action committee (PAC) gave $143,000 \n     to Republican and Democratic candidates for Congress, \n     according to PoliticalMoneyLine, a non-partisan group that \n     tracks contributions. Lamar gave $70,000 to congressional \n     candidates, the group says.\n       Reid's PAC received $16,000 from outdoor advertisers, \n     according to PoliticalMoneyLine. In a letter to senators last \n     week, Reid said the exemption ``is a matter of personal \n     importance to me.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to, in the remaining time, \nmention two other proposals that have to do with the great American \noutdoors.\n  Yesterday, a group of 17 Senators and Congressmen from North Carolina \nand Tennessee took a historic step by writing a letter to Secretary of \nthe Interior Dirk Kempthorne about the so-called ``Road to Nowhere'' \nthrough the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n  The point of the letter was to suggest to the Secretary three things:\n  No. 1, Mr. Secretary, bring to a conclusion within 30 days the \nenvironmental impact statement that has been going on for several years \nabout whether to build this road--the $600 million ``road to nowhere'' \nthrough the park--and recommend, Mr. Secretary, that no road should be \nbuilt. That is the first step.\n  The second step is one we can take ourselves in the Congress once the \nDepartment of the Interior has said that no proposal for road \nconstruction would be appropriate environmentally. The 17 of us believe \nwe should reprogram the remaining money from the environmental impact \nstatement, which we judge to be $5 million, $6 million or $7 million, \nand give it to the citizens of Swain County, NC, who have waited since \n1943 for just compensation for the promise the Government made to them \nat that time to compensate them for the road that was flooded when \nFontana Dam was built.\n  The third thing we asked the Secretary to do was in the next \nadministration budget for fiscal year 2009, recommend to us what the \nrest of the cash settlement should be to Swain County, and include the \nnext installment of that settlement in the budget, but without taking \nthe money from the National Park budget.\n  What is historic about this is it was not just the number of Senators \nand Congressmen, it was the fact it was Senator Dole from North \nCarolina as well as Senator Corker from Tennessee. It was Congressman \nShuler, a Democrat from North Carolina, as well as David Davis, a \nRepublican from Tennessee. We also have support from the Governors of \nboth Tennessee and North Carolina for the proposed cash settlement to \nSwain County in lieu of the road.\n  The road is a bad idea. It has been a bad idea for a long time. The \nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park is the largest, most visited \nnational park in the United States by a factor of three, with 10 \nmillion visitors a year. It is managed as if it were a wilderness area. \nThis road, costing more than $600 million, would go straight through \nthe most pristine part of the largest wilderness area in the eastern \nUnited States. And $600 million I believe is an understatement of what \nit might cost. There would be very difficult places to go through. It \nis hard to think it could be built without spending a lot more money.\n  I congratulate the Congressman from North Carolina, Mr. Shuler. He \ngrew up on one side of the Great Smoky Mountains in Swain County, and I \ngrew up on the other side in Blount County. Fifteen years ago, I was \npresident of the University of Tennessee and he was its quarterback. \nToday, he is now the Democratic Congressman from Swain County and that \narea, and I am the Republican Senator from east Tennessee. We agree on \nwhat to do, and we believe it is time for the Secretary of the Interior \nto accept our suggestion, say there will be no road, and let us get \nbusy giving the people of Swain County $6 million or $7 million this \nyear, and in future years compensate them properly.\n  Also Congressman Shuler and I and others say that in this process we \nmust do a better job of helping the descendants of those who once lived \nin what is today the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to be able to \nget across Fontana Lake to the gravesites. That may seem a small matter \nto those who have not heard of this before, but that\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\npark was taken, by land condemnation oftentimes, from those people and \ntheir families and their ancestors. It was then given to the Federal \nGovernment. There is a great sense of ownership of that park by the \npeople of North Carolina and Tennessee, and it is only right that as a \npart of this settlement we make it easier for Swain County to help \ndescendants of those who once lived within the park to get to their \nhistoric gravesites.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point \nin my remarks a copy of the letter from the 17 Members of Congress from \nNorth Carolina and Tennessee to the Secretary of the Interior.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Secretary, Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: Considering the significant \n     environmental and economic costs associated with building the \n     North Shore Road--or the so-called ``Road to Nowhere'' \n     through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park--we ask that \n     you begin immediately to work with us to provide a cash \n     settlement to the citizens of Swain County, North Carolina, \n     rather than further constructing the road.\n       We recommend these three steps:\n       First, within the next 90 days, the National Park Service's \n     Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) should endorse a cash \n     settlement to Swain County instead of any further \n     construction on the North Shore Road.\n       Second, upon completion of the EIS, the Administration \n     should support legislation that will be introduced in \n     Congress to reprogram the funds remaining from those \n     originally appropriated for the EIS, currently about $6 \n     million, and give those funds to Swain County as the first \n     installment of the settlement.\n       Third, in January 2008, as a part of its fiscal year 2009 \n     budget request to Congress, the Administration should include \n     in its budget the next installment of the full cash \n     settlement to Swain County. This funding should come from \n     outside the National Park Service budget in the form of a \n     special request.\n       The United States made a commitment to Swain County in \n     1943, when it flooded a highway in connection with the \n     creation of the Fontana Dam, to build a new road through what \n     had become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The U.S. \n     Supreme Court, however, held in 1946 that there is no legal \n     obligation to satisfy that commitment by building another \n     road. A cash settlement instead of a road is precisely the \n     kind of ``common sense adjustment'' that the Supreme Court \n     envisioned.\n       A road through the Park would damage the largest and most \n     pristine wilderness area in the eastern United States. Such a \n     road would cost at least $600 million, more than 75 times the \n     annual roads budget of the Great Smoky Mountains National \n     Park. In addition, a good highway now exists outside the Park \n     between Bryson City and Fontana.\n       This sort of settlement has been recommended by the elected \n     Swain County Commission and the governors of North Carolina \n     and Tennessee, and is supported by the undersigned members of \n     the North Carolina and Tennessee congressional delegations.\n       After over 60 years of controversy, it is time to bring \n     this matter to a close. The solution we are endorsing will \n     protect America's most visited national park, save taxpayers \n     hundreds of millions of dollars, and fulfill a promise to the \n     citizens of Swain County, North Carolina.\n           Sincerely,\n         Lamar Alexander, Elizabeth Dole, Bob Corker, U.S. \n           Senators; Heath Shuler, David Davis, G.K. Butterfield, \n           Zach Wamp, Bob Etheridge, Lincoln Davis, Walter Jones, \n           Bart Gordon, Mike McIntyre, Jim Cooper, Brad Miller, \n           John Tanner, David Price, Steve Cohen, Members of \n           Congress.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last night I attended the annual \nmeeting of the National Parks Conservation Association, and I spoke to \nthem, and I wish to repeat a suggestion and a proposal I made there.\n  I said to these leading conservationists from across the country that \n22 years ago, in 1985, President Reagan asked me to head up what we \ncalled the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors. It was to be a \nsuccessor to Laurance Rockefeller's Commission on Outdoors a generation \nearlier. The Rockefeller Commission was one that was remembered for \nadvocating a lot of Federal action, such as the Land and Water \nConservation Act and the Wild and Scenic Rivers legislation.\n  Our commission in the mid-1980s looked around the country and called \nfor a prairie fire of concern and investment community by community to \nkeep our outdoors great. We identified threats to the outdoors at that \ntime: exotic pollutants, loss of space through urban growth, and the \ndisappearance of wetlands. We recommended some strategies for dealing \nwith the future, which have become fixtures in the outdoor movement, \nsuch as conservation easements, scenic byways and greenways, and we \nrecommended $1 billion a year from the sale of renewable assets, such \nas oil, to succeed the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Mr. President, since I see no one here, may I ask unanimous consent \nfor an additional 5 minutes to complete my remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, another generation has passed. There \nare new challenges and new opportunities. My proposal to the \nconservationists last night was it is now time for a third President's \nCommission on Americans Outdoors to follow the Rockefeller Commission \nin the 1960s and our commission in the 1980s. It would be an \nopportunity to look ahead for another generation and tell our country \nwhat we need to do to create places for us to enjoy the outdoors in \nappropriate ways, an opportunity to create a new conservation agenda.\n  There is some unfinished business that is obvious. Special Federal \nsupport for conservation easements expires this year. The conservation \nroyalty, which we enacted in the last Congress, giving one-eighth of \nthe money we acquire from drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, is only a beginning to fully funding land \nand water conservation. We need to codify the Environmental Protection \nAgency's new clean air rules about sulfur and nitrogen, which are so \nimportant to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as an example. \nUrban growth is still swallowing up open space.\n  There are new challenges and opportunities that were barely on the \nagenda 25 years ago: Climate change, the 100th birthday of the National \nPark System in 2016, invasive species, and new technology which offers \nboth promise and challenge.\n\n  For example, in terms of promise, carbon recapture from electricity \nplants fueled by coal--that could help make us energy independent, \nclean the air, and deal with global warming all at once; or at the John \nSmith National Water Trail in Virginia, Verizon has a wireless system \nso you can learn about 400 years of history as you go along the water \ntrail, using your cell phone.\n  On the other hand, technology threatens America's landscape, the \nlandscape of which we sing. I mentioned earlier that 25 years ago the \nTennessee Legislature and I created 10,000 miles of scenic parkways \nwith no new junkyards or billboards, and I didn't think of cell towers \nat the time. We now have 190,000 cell tower sites nationwide, many of \nthem in scenic places, many of them ugly. That is unnecessary. If we \nhad thought about it, cell towers could be camouflaged, colocated on a \nsingle structure, or located below the ridge tops. We should have \nthought about it and made more of a policy about it.\n  At the same time, while it gives many in the conservation movement a \nstomach ache to think about it, we are about to add to the American \nlandscape tens of thousands of giant wind turbines that are twice as \ntall as the Neyland Football Stadium at the University of Tennessee, \nwith turbines that stretch from 10-yard line to 10-yard line. \nObviously, there is a place for wind power in our energy future, but \nisn't it right that we should stop and say: Do we want them on our \nseashores and the foothills of the Great Smokies and along the rim of \nthe Grand Canyon? I don't think we would. It would be a chance for us \nto have a consensus about the blessings of technology and a consensus \nabout view sheds and landscape conservation; in short, a new strategy \nand consensus for America, the beautiful.\n  I think this is our greatest opportunity to get around the table and \ntake advantage of different ideas, put them together, and go ahead. We \ndid that 20 years ago. We had private property advocates and open space \nenthusiasts and conservationists and outdoor recreation people. We were \nall around the\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\nsame table. We had a pretty good rapport. I think we made a difference \nover the last two decades.\n  The other day, Tennessee's unusually Democratic newspaper, the \nTennessean, in Nashville, praised President Bush's centennial \ninitiative for national parks--$100 million a year, $3 billion over 10 \nyears--to help celebrate the 100th birthday of our park system, which \nsome have called the best idea America ever had. The Tennessean said in \nits editorial, and cautioned its readers:\n\n       Just because George Bush said it, doesn't mean it's wrong.\n\n  Sometimes I think I need to say the same thing to my Republican \nfriends about climate change. Just because Al Gore said it, doesn't \nmean it is wrong. I think we ought to work together to celebrate the \n100th anniversary of the parks, to figure out what we want to do about \nclimate change, scenic byways, open space, protecting private property \nrights, and providing more outdoor recreation opportunities. We can do \nthat and now is a good time to do it. Why not have a Third President's \nCommission on Americans Outdoors? I believe the next President should \nappoint that commission and that we who care about those issues should \ntake time to help him or her be ready with an agenda.\n  For me, the great American outdoors is not about policy and politics. \nI grew up hiking on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains, camping \nthere on a regular basis. I still live there. I breathe the air I try \nto keep clean and hike in the park I want to maintain. I want to \nprotect the views of the foothills because I look at them when I am \nhome, where I am going tomorrow morning. I enjoy riding on the scenic \nparkways and walking on the greenways, and every summer for 25 years, \nour family has gone to the Boundary Waters canoe area in Minnesota \nbecause it is quiet and clean and we like to catch and eat walleyes.\n  I believe there is a huge conservation majority in our country, and I \nbelieve the next President can capture that majority and help us create \na new conservation agenda. It is time to create a Third President's \nCommission on Americans Outdoors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address a very serious subject. \nA lot of times when we come down here to speak, we are given speeches \nto make, and a lot of times on topics we don't know very much about.\n  In my professional career, in my life before I got into politics, I \nspent 33 years selling houses. I had a company that sold thousands of \nhouses every year in Atlanta, GA. I understand the joy of home \nownership, the responsibility of home ownership, and the huge benefit \nof home ownership, I guess, as well as anybody.\n  I have always said that the thing which separates the United States \nof America from every other country in the world is the fact that we \nare a nation of homeowners, and the rest of the world, substantially, \nis nations of renters. We all know that when you have an investment in \nsomething and you own it versus you are just leasing it, you take a lot \nbetter care of it.\n  The single-family housing industry, the principle of our Constitution \nfor the wide diversity in private ownership of land, is the single most \nimportant asset that binds our country together. It is the common \ninterest that every citizen has, and it has become known, as we all \nknow, as the American dream.\n  Today, the Washington Times, Washington Post, New York Times, all \nhave carried articles regarding predatory lending, subprime mortgage \nmarkets. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, has made a \nstatement that they will be looking at regulations to deal with the \nsubprime market. I think that is appropriate, but it is very important \nwe understand what the problem really is.\n  There are a lot of people who will tell you the problem is predatory \nlending. Well, predatory lending is a horrible thing, but it is like \nthe term ``obscenity'' was referred to in the Supreme Court, something \nthat is in the eyes of the beholder--you cannot necessarily define it \nbut you know it when you see it.\n  The subprime market has in some cases been referred to as ``predatory \nlending,'' and it is not. In fact, it is interesting history, where the \nsubprime market came from.\n  Fannie Mae, which was headed about 10 years ago by Jim Johnson, who \nwrote a book, ``Showing America a New Way Home,'' committed itself to \nwidening the ownership of single-family housing. They recognized that \nin some cases, single-family housing was out of the reach of certain \nparts of society, so they created mortgage-backed securities to buy \nmortgages in the subprime market. The subprime market is subprime \nbecause the borrower is not necessarily a grade-A credit risk. But as \nwe all know, at one time or another in our lives, none of us have \nalways been a grade-A credit risk. It proliferated. That is why home \nownership in the United States of America went from 67 percent of the \npublic live in a home they own to now to 70 percent of the public live \nin a home they own.\n  What has happened in recent months, because of some factors I am \ngoing to address, is the foreclosure rates have skyrocketed and the \nvast proportion of those loans that have been foreclosed on are \nsubprime loans.\n  There are a lot of people rushing to talk about doing away with \nsubprime loans. There are a lot of people talking about calling them \npredatory loans and regulating whether they can exist, and they are, \nwith all due respect, missing the point. The mortgage industry has made \nsome mistakes, but it is not the mistake of trying to show Americans a \nnew way home; it is a mistake in five areas which I want to delineate \nfor one second.\n  During the course of the subprime market's evolution and the wider \ndistribution of home ownership, the underwriting of loans became less \nthan what it should have been. Some examples: no documentation, where \npeople could qualify for the loan and have it underwritten on \ndocumentation that was based basically on what they said they made and \nwhat they said they were worth; no-downpayment loans, where people \ncould make loans with no downpayment, no equity. I want to talk about \nthat subject for just one second.\n  I entered the business in 1967, and the Congress, in its wisdom--to \nwiden the dispersity of home ownership--created the 235 FHA Program. \nThey would loan you up to $18,500, which doesn't sound like a lot, but \nthat would buy a lot of house in 1967. You could borrow it for $200 \ndown, and the rest of it was a loan. If you did not have the $200, they \nallowed sweat equity, which meant you and your wife could go in and \npaint the living room, dining room, and kitchen, and they would give \nyou that credit. The loans proliferated and home ownership expanded, \nbut because they really had no equity in the property, those houses \nstarted going into foreclosure, and the next year was one of the \nroughest--1969--one of the roughest years in the market.\n  Congress held congressional investigations. What had turned out was \nthat an attempt to originally expand home ownership had become an \nopportunity to make less than good loans to a lot of people who were \nnot ready to borrow those funds.\n  There is a third reason--the proliferation of loans like interest-\nonly. Interest-only is a very sophisticated way to borrow. I understand \nreal estate investment, and real estate investment is best when \nleveraged but only when leveraged right. When you loan someone 100 \npercent of the value of what they are buying, you have to be very \ncareful in your underwriting criteria or else they really do not feel \nlike they have equity in the proposition.\n  ARMs and variable-rate mortgages, adjustable and variable rate \nmortgages--they are sophisticated lending\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\ntools and are very effective and very good loans, but they are \ncomplicated because after an initial low rate of interest, on \nalternating years, like every other year or the fifth year or whatever \nit might be, the loans adjust to the marketplace and the interest rate \ncan go up or it can go down, but generally it is going to go up because \nit is generally a lower teaser rate going in than the market exists at \nthat time.\n  Home ownership is a responsibility. Another thing that has happened \nin the marketplace is that a lot of loans have been made to people with \nvery little regard to whether they were prepared for the responsibility \nof home ownership.\n\n  So my suggestion to the Fed and to all of those looking into this \nissue--I know Senator Schumer, Senator Clinton, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Baucus, and many Members of this Chamber are talking about: \nWhat are we going to do about this subprime dilemma? The first thing I \nhope they will look at is underwriting standards. The second thing I \nhope they will look at is a clear understanding through truth and \ndisclosure and Regulation Z of borrower disclosures so that people know \nwhat they are getting into and a true look at whether borrowing 100 \npercent is the ideal thing to do.\n  I do not think we need to have an overreaction to what is obviously a \nproblem. Instead, what we need to do is try to perfect the process so \nthat we can continue to show Americans a new way home but have a loan \nthat responds to those people's needs. Those needs are better \ndocumentation, better appraisals and certifications, making sure there \nis equity in the investment and, most importantly of all, making sure \nthey understand the responsibilities of that home ownership.\n  As I said at the outset of my remarks, the wide diversity of the \nownership of land and home ownership is what separates America from the \nrest of the world. We have the largest diversity of ownership of our \nland, the most homeowners, percentage-wise. In most of the world, all \nof the people who live there rent from someone else. It separates our \ncountry, and it separates us in a very good way.\n  As we deal with the subprime market, we want to make sure we do not \nthrow the baby out with the bathwater. It is important to correct the \ndocumentation and the underwriting but not destroy what has been a tool \nto expand the ownership of homes to people who never thought they could \nlive the American dream.\n  Let's make sure, when we underwrite them, we underwrite them right \nand the people who are borrowing the money understand the \nresponsibility of the mortgage instrument and the value of home \nownership.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Bush \nadministration to look beyond the next 48 hours. Right now, in Seoul, \nKorea, U.S. negotiators are meeting nonstop with South Korean officials \nto finish up the so-called Korean Free Trade Agreement. They are \nrushing because if they don't finish it by Saturday night at midnight, \nthe trade agreement would not be eligible for fast-track authority. My \ncolleagues understand what that means. They would not be eligible to \nmove it through in a way that would not allow us to change the \nagreement in any way but puts it on fast-track authority so that if \nmany of us believe there are concerns with it, we would not have the \nfull range of options that we normally do in the Senate to be able to \ncorrect it or object to it.\n  Mr. President, these negotiators are not discussing some minor trade \ndeal. They are debating what could be the largest U.S. trade agreement \nsince NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I urge the White \nHouse and its negotiators to look beyond the final hours left on the \nfast-track clock. What happens in the next 48 hours could affect the \nAmerican economy, American businesses, the American auto industry, and \nAmerican workers for decades to come. The goal is not to race to the \nfinish line. The goal should be to have the very best possible trade \nagreement--an agreement that raises the standards of living for \neverybody by creating a level playing field, an agreement that ensures \nmarket access for both countries--not just South Korea.\n  This cannot be a one-way deal. It has to be an opening of markets for \nboth American businesses, American agriculture, as well as South Korean \nagriculture and business, and so on, including the industry that has \nbuilt the middle class of this country, which is the U.S. auto \nindustry.\n  There seems to be an agreement that upholds the value of what has \nmade this country successful. Fair competition, competition that \nrewards hard work, deserves our attention, and it is based very simply \non what we happen to think in Michigan is just plain common sense, \nhaving the rules be the same. It is pretty simple, but even though they \nare basic, right now there is a question as to whether they will be \nincluded in this rush to this final trade agreement, to beat the clock.\n  We don't need an agreement that sells out American workers or pits \nAmerican companies against foreign governments that cheat the system. \nIn this rush to the finish line, this administration has failed to \nremember that there is an alternative. This Congress will pass good \ntrade agreements without fast track. We have done it before. I have \nsupported good trade agreements. I want to vote for good trade \nagreements. We want to export our products, not our jobs. That is \nfundamentally what is at stake in this negotiation that is going on \nright this minute.\n  I believe we must be a key player in the global economy. We are a key \nplayer, and trade agreements are part of that role. In fact, the old \nargument of protectionism versus free trade doesn't fit anymore. When \nyou Blackberry your phone, the Internet can jump any wall that could be \nput up. There is a fundamental question for us today: How are we going \nto compete in a global economy and keep the middle class of this \ncountry, keep our way of life in this country? That is what is at stake \nin the negotiations going on right now.\n  Unfortunately, fast-track authority has been used in the past to pass \nbad agreements through Congress. We undermine the integrity of our \ntrade policy if the administration's agreements sell out our workers or \nexport our middle class.\n  Sadly, this administration makes it even worse by not enforcing our \ntrade laws. We all know about what is happening when other countries, \nsuch as China or Japan, manipulate their currency--or, in some cases, \neven South Korea. We all know what happens when there are counterfeit \nproducts brought into this country and our ideas and patents are \nstolen, when other countries don't follow the rules. We need to make \nsure the rules are working and they are being enforced right now as we \nlook to expand any agreements.\n  We are talking about the next 48 hours. Simply put, racing to the \nfinish\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nline right now could very well, and likely will, result in a very bad \ntrade agreement that will not allow our country to continue to have the \nedge, a bad trade agreement that will allow others to continue to cheat \nthe international system, and a bad agreement for the people who are \nworking hard at this moment, counting on us to get it right, counting \non us to fight for a level playing field, so whether they own a \nbusiness or whether they work for a business or whether they grow crops \nin the field, they can count on the rules being fair, the playing field \nlevel, and that we will enforce those rules on their behalf.\n\n  South Korea is really the first test of this administration with the \nnew Congress. Will this administration sell out American workers? Will \nthey ignore the history of bilateral agreements with South Korea? Or \nwill they work with us to get it right? The American people are \ncounting on us to get it right. Eighty-two percent of the trade deficit \nwith South Korea is in the automobile industry. Coming from the great \nState of Michigan, that matters to me. I hope it matters also to all of \nmy colleagues, since this is the industry on which the middle class of \nthis country has been built.\n  Eighty-two percent of the trade deficit with South Korea is in the \nauto industry. That is because we have had two failed agreements with \nSouth Korea which have allowed cars to come into the United States \nwhile South Korea keeps its markets virtually closed. That doesn't make \nany sense. In fact, South Korea is the least open market for autos of \nany industrialized country. Meanwhile, South Korea continues to export \n7 out of 10 of their vehicles. So they make 10 and ship 7 outside of \nthe country.\n  The United States has a 12-year history and two auto-specific \nbilateral agreements with South Korea in an attempt to open their auto \nimport market so we can sell to them. In 1995 and 1998, the United \nStates attempted to level the playing field by instituting two \nmemoranda of understanding that clearly stated the need to increase \n``foreign-made vehicle market access.'' But despite these attempts from \nthe U.S. Government, both Republican and Democratic Presidents, nothing \nhas changed with South Korea as it relates to our automobile industry.\n\n  This chart is pretty clear as to what has happened. In 2006, Korea \nimported to us 749,822 automobiles. That is what came to us. And how \nmany were we allowed to ship to them, built in America? Mr. President, \n4,556 vehicles. I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out \nthat is not a level playing field, that is not fair. Who in their right \nmind would negotiate a continuation of that situation? I can assure my \ncolleagues, if that is what comes back or anything even close to it \nfrom this agreement, this Senator from Michigan will do everything I \ncan possibly do to stop it from being enacted.\n  In addition, South Korea has an 8-percent tariff on U.S. auto \nimports, three times the U.S. tariff, which is 2.5 percent. We have had \ntwo different agreements to fix this situation, and instead, we \ncontinue with tariffs that are so different: 8 percent that we pay, 2.5 \npercent that they pay. Then on top of that, they do things such as make \nsure that our automobiles, foreign imports, have higher insurance rates \nor get audited or have other kinds of barriers on them, while we have \nan open marketplace and they come in unimpeded.\n  I remind our negotiators, we have plenty of time to develop a good \ntrade agreement. If we fix this situation, if we have something that \ntruly is in the interest of Americans, of American workers, businesses, \nand farmers, I will be first on the floor to support it. But this is \nnot fair. Something that maybe inches this up from 4,500 to 5,000 or \n6,000, while Korean imports continue to go up will not be fair.\n  We have to have an open process so we have the same kind of access to \ntheir market that they have to ours. I thought that is what trade \nagreements were supposed to be about.\n  There is no need to rush. There is no need to sell out our auto \nindustry in America or our workers or any other group.\n  I know there are other concerns as well from rice farmers and beef \ninterests and others. Certainly, I don't think we should be in a \nsituation where any of our American interests are put at risk because \nof a trade agreement. All we want is a level playing field. All we want \nis the ability to have the same rules apply no matter where one lives, \nand to have those rules enforced.\n  Right now, as I said before, we have a 48-hour time period. We know \nat this moment there are people negotiating, trying to beat the clock \nin the next 48 hours. It won't work unless this is an agreement that \nworks for America. And from my standpoint, it won't work unless it \nworks for the American auto industry. These kinds of numbers make no \nsense whatsoever.\n  I am very hopeful folks will stop and take a deep breath for a moment \nand look at what needs to be done, and then have faith in us, in \nCongress, that we will work with the administration to put together a \ngood deal. If it is a good deal, if it is a good deal for American \nbusinesses, if it is a good deal for American workers, then it will \nsail through. But if it continues the bad deal we have had now for the \nlast 12 years trying to work with South Korea, there are going to be \nserious objections.\n  As I said so many times before, American workers and American \nbusinesses can compete with anybody, but we have to have a level \nplaying field. We have to require that other countries play by the same \nrules we do and that we negotiate agreements that make sense, where the \ntariffs are the same and the rules are the same and the market access \nis the same. That is all I wish to see happen as a Senator from \nMichigan, and I know that is what we are all hoping will happen for \nthose we represent.\n  The next 48 hours are critically important for our working men and \nwomen in this country and American businesses, doing business here, \nthat want to remain here, that want to remain in the business of \nproviding good work with good pay and good benefits in the United \nStates. That is what this is about.\n  Again, we want to export our products, not our jobs. What happens in \nthe next 48 hours will determine whether we are going to be able to \nwork together with the administration to get this right.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, 2 months ago, GEN David Petraeus came \nto Capitol Hill to explain the situation in Baghdad and to outline his \nplan for improving it. And then we ratified that plan. A Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate sent General Petraeus to Iraq--without dissent.\n  There were no illusions about what the mission would involve: We \nwould demand greater cooperation from the Iraqi Government, and they \nwould get greater security in return. If they gave us room to help \nsecure the capital city, they would have room to build a civil society.\n  Now that mission is underway. Security is improving and political \nreforms have followed.\n  We were told there would be no political reforms in Iraq without \nbasic security first. But if we could secure the capital, then we could \nexpect to see reforms. That is what General Petraeus told us. That is \nthe story he told us we could hope to see unfold, and if it did, we \nwould have reason to hope for success, we would have a chance to win \nthis.\n  Right now we have that chance. The question is, will we fan this \nspark of hope or will we smother it?\n  The Democratic leadership has a different view. They do not seem to \nthink situations can change. They have made no allowance for \nimprovements in Iraq. They call for a change in course, but the only \nchange in course they seem to approve of is retreat.\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\n  The bill they sent the President today says one of two things: It \nsays they are either determined to lose this war or they are convinced \nit is already lost. There is no other way to look at it.\n  Nothing good can come from this bill. It all but guarantees a delay \nin the delivery of supplies and equipment to the troops on the ground. \nIt is loaded with pork that has no relation to our efforts in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. And it includes a deadline for evacuation that amounts to \nsending a ``save the date'' card to al-Qaida--a date that is not tied \nto circumstances on the ground, a date that is completely arbitrary--\npulled out of thin air--a date the terrorists have already marked on \ntheir calendars.\n  This bill is the document of our defeat. That is why the President \nhas said for weeks he would not sign it. Because it has no chance of \nbecoming law, because the Democrats knew it never had a chance of \nbecoming law, it is nothing more than a political statement--a \npolitical statement that says the Democrats have traded in the \npossibility of military victory for the promise of political victory \nhere at home.\n  They have said as much. Earlier this week, one of the Democratic \nleaders said this about the emergency supplemental bill. He said:\n\n       It's not one battle. It's a long-term campaign.\n\n  So what is the aim of this long-term campaign? To pressure the \nPresident to retreat. The Democratic leadership is telling the \nPresident to retreat through a spending bill that is meant to deliver \nemergency equipment and supplies to our troops.\n  But I ask you: If the war is already lost, if it is already time to \ndeclare defeat, then why wait another year to do it? Why not simply \nvote against funding now? Would anyone disagree that it is wrong to ask \nAmerican soldiers to stick it out for another year if you think the \nbattle is already over? If Democrats want to end this war, they should \nvote against funding it. That would clearly end the war. But apparently \nthat is not what is going to happen. They will wait another year. They \nwill supply and equip our soldiers to fight a war they think we have \nalready lost, and they will use the spending bill that funds that extra \nyear of fighting as a vehicle for pork.\n  There is more than $20 billion of spending in this bill that has \nnothing whatsoever to do with the war in Iraq or Afghanistan, and most \nof it simply should not be there.\n  The senior Senator from Nevada has said repeatedly that this spending \nbill is serious.\n  How serious is $2.5 million for tours of the Capitol? Is $3 million \nfor sugarcane serious? Is $22.8 million for geothermal research or $13 \nmillion for ewe replacement and retention? Is all of that serious?\n  This bill was intended to fund and equip American men and women who \nhave left their families to risk their lives overseas. But in some \nways, it has become a bit of a joke. It has ballooned into a gravy \ntrain for Members. It absurdly broadcasts to our enemies a date certain \nfor the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. And it is designed to draw \na veto, risking that the very supplies it means to deliver would not \neven get there in time.\n  The American people are watching this charade. They have reason to be \nconfused. They even have reasons to be angry.\n  I am pleased my colleagues voted against this bill to show it is \nright for the President to veto it and to show we will proudly sustain \nthat veto. Then we can get about our real mission to fund the troops. \nLet's hope the President gets this bill as quickly as possible, so he \ncan do with it what it deserves. No bill has deserved the veto pen more \nthan this one.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4148-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4148-S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GENOCIDE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, with the beginning of this new Congress, \nSenator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, honored my \nrequest to create a new subcommittee, entitled Human Rights and the \nLaw. It is the first time in Senate history we have designated a \nsubcommittee with that jurisdiction. Of course, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has responsibility for foreign policy, but what we are trying \nto focus on in this subcommittee I chair are laws that relate to \nfundamental human rights.\n  The subcommittee's first hearing, seven weeks ago, was on the law \nrelating to genocide and the situation in Darfur. We had spectacular \nwitnesses: Diane Orentlicher, an American University law school \nprofessor; Sigal Mandelker, a representative from the administration; \nDon Cheadle, the star in ``Hotel Rwanda,'' who has become a strong \nadvocate for ending the genocide in Darfur; Romeo Dallaire, a Senator \nin Canada, who in 1994 was the head of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in \nRwanda during the onset of the massacre. Their testimony was \nelectrifying. It pointed not only to the experience in Rwanda but to \nwhat we face today in Darfur.\n  I still recall--and it bears repeating every time I come to the \nfloor--that at the time of the Rwanda genocide, there were very few \nSenators paying attention.\n  One of my mentors and friends, Paul Simon, my predecessor, was the \nchairman of the Africa Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nHe knew what was happening. He turned to his friend, Jim Jeffords, then \na Republican from Vermont, and said: We have to do something. They \ncalled General Dallaire in Kigali, Rwanda, and asked: What can we do? \nThe general said: If you would send me 5,000 armed soldiers, I can stop \nthis massacre right now. So Senators Jeffords and Simon called the \nClinton White House and asked for help. Sadly, there was no response.\n  Later on, President Clinton, after he finished his term in office, \nsaid it was the biggest mistake of his administration not to respond to \nthe Rwandan genocide. It was a reminder to me that we do have the power \nas Senators and Congressmen, and many others, to make a difference, and \nwe should never accept as inevitable things such as the genocide that \noccurred in this faraway country of Rwanda.\n  I was reminded of that during testimony just a few weeks ago. We \ntalked about Darfur and the fact that 4 years ago, President Bush \ndeclared a genocide in Darfur. It is rare that the United States \nacknowledges a genocide. I applauded President Bush and his leadership \nfor making this acknowledgment, but I have said to the President and on \nthis floor many times: It is not enough to just declare a genocide. If \ninnocent people are being killed, if they are being displaced from \ntheir homes and you have the power to do something about it, how can \nyou stand by and do nothing? Sadly, that is what has happened for 4 \nstraight years. We have done nothing--declaring a genocide and doing \nnothing.\n  I am reminded of a personal experience I had many years ago as a \nstudent at Georgetown University. I was in the School of Foreign \nService and had as a professor Dr. Jan Karski from Poland. He was an \ninspiring man. He spoke with an accent. He came to his class with a \nsuit and tie on every day, ramrod, military bearing, and told the story \nof his life in between lessons.\n  His story was that he was a member of the Polish underground fighting \nthe Nazis in World War II. He saw Polish people swept out of the Warsaw \nghetto, taken away. He finally realized that they were taken to \nconcentration camps to be killed.\n  Determined to do something about it, Jan Karski found his way to \nWashington in the 1940s, even found his way to the office of President \nFranklin Roosevelt, and told him about the Holocaust, told him what was \nhappening in the concentration camps.\n  Unfortunately, just as in Rwanda, the President at that time did \nnothing. Jan Karski returned to Poland crestfallen that he had finally \nalerted this great power, the United States of America, and nothing was \ngoing to be done.\n  I sat there as a student at the time and thought: How can that be? \nHow can you hear that thousands of people are\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nbeing killed and do nothing? It happened then. It happened in Rwanda. \nIt shouldn't happen again.\n  The purpose of the hearing on Darfur was to try to finally spark some \naction by this Congress and by this administration to do something. \nAfter 4 years of declaring a genocide, it is about time we rolled up \nour sleeves and did something. And there are things we can do.\n  Certainly, we can look at our own personal responsibility. Divestment \nmeans selling off or not buying investments in a country. In this case, \nthe country of Sudan, with the capital of Khartoum, has a vibrant oil \nindustry. Major companies in Sudan are owned by China, India, and \nMalaysia. Petro China is the Chinese oil company that is the largest \noil company in the Sudan.\n  I have encouraged everyone, including the universities and colleges \nin Illinois, to divest themselves of any known holdings in companies \ndoing business in Sudan. Maybe it is a small thing, maybe it is only \nsymbolic, but for goodness' sake, shouldn't we do something on an \nindividual and personal basis?\n  After I issued a press release, incidentally, calling for divestment, \nan enterprising reporter took a look at the mutual funds my wife and I \nown and said: One of your mutual funds owns stock in Petro China. I \nquickly sold it. It didn't change my net worth much, I can tell you, \nbut it is a symbolic and personal thing. I am glad we did it. Others \nneed to do it as well. Pension funds, governments, major companies--if \nthey divest themselves of these Sudanese investments, maybe those \ncompanies will get the message that there is something wrong with Sudan \nand we shouldn't do business as usual with a country that won't allow \npeacekeeping forces to come in to save and help victims in Darfur.\n  There are other actions we can take as well. This subcommittee on \nhuman rights and law tried to focus on specific legislation we could \nenact. As a result of our hearing, 2 weeks ago we introduced the \nGenocide Accountability Act of 2007. S. 888, the Genocide \nAccountability Act, would close a legal loophole that prevents the U.S. \nJustice Department from prosecuting people in our country who have \ncommitted genocide. While genocide rages in Darfur, we have to make \nclear our commitment to hold accountable those who commit the ultimate \ncrime.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act is the first legislation produced by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and \nthe Law. S. 888 is a bipartisan bill introduced by myself, as chairman \nof the subcommittee; Senator Tom Coburn, the ranking Republican member \non this same subcommittee; Senator Pat Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee; and Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act has been endorsed by numerous \norganizations, and I thank them for their support and encouragement. \nThey include Africa Action, the American Jewish World Service, Amnesty \nInternational USA, the Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian \nNational Committee of America, the Genocide Intervention Network, Human \nRights First, Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees \nInternational, and the Save Darfur Coalition.\n  Why is it necessary to change the law? Because under current law, \ngenocide is only a crime in the eyes of America if it is committed \nwithin the United States or by a U.S. national outside the United \nStates.\n  In contrast, the laws on torture, material support for terrorism, \nterrorism financing, hostage taking, and many other Federal crimes \nallow for extraterritorial jurisdiction for crimes committed outside \nthe United States by non-U.S. nationals.\n\n  This loophole in the law has real-life consequences. The Justice \nDepartment has identified individuals who participated in the Rwandan \nand Bosnian genocides and who live in the United States under false \npretenses. Under current law, these individuals cannot be arrested or \nprosecuted because they are not U.S. nationals and the genocides in \nwhich they were involved didn't take place in the United States.\n  Now let's go to the Sudan and Darfur. Salah Abdallah Gosh, the head \nof security in the Sudanese Government, has reportedly played a key \nrole in that nation's genocidal campaign in Darfur. Just 2 years ago, \nMr. Gosh came to Washington to meet with senior administration \nofficials. Under current law, the FBI could not even interview him \nabout his involvement in the Darfur genocide, much less charge him with \na crime.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act changes that. It would close this \nloophole. It amends 18 U.S.C. 1091, the Genocide Convention \nImplementation Act, to allow prosecution of non-U.S. nationals who are \nin the United States for genocide committed outside the United States.\n  The United States should have this authority and ability to prosecute \ngenocidaires who find safe haven or at least seek safe haven in this \ncountry. The Genocide Accountability Act would end this impunity gap in \ngenocide law.\n  What we are saying to those around the world who are engaged in \nuncivilized and barbaric conduct is do not even consider coming to the \nUnited States as your retirement home. It is never going to be a safe \nhaven. There is no place for you to hide.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act gives our Government the power to \nstop those who seek to do that.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 89, S. 888.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will report the \nbill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 888) to amend section 1091 of title 18, United \n     States Code, to allow the prosecution of genocide in \n     appropriate circumstances.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that today the Senate is \nconsidering the Genocide Accountability Act, which closes a loophole in \ncurrent law which has until now allowed those who commit or incite \ngenocide to seek refuge in our country without fear of prosecution for \ntheir actions. This bill is the first legislation resulting from the \nwork of the Judiciary Committee's new Subcommittee on Human Rights and \nthe Law. I thank Subcommittee Chairman Durbin for introducing the bill, \nand I was pleased to join him, along with subcommittee Ranking Member \nCoburn and Senators Feingold, Cornyn, and Kennedy in cosponsoring the \nbill. I have long called for greater U.S. involvement in resolving the \ncrisis in Darfur and worked for greater accountability for those who \ncommit war crimes. This bill is an important next step in working to do \nall we can to combat genocide throughout the world.\n  Too often, we in this country, the richest and most powerful Nation \non Earth, have done too little to stop human rights atrocities in Sudan \nand elsewhere around the world. Many more lives could have been saved \nif we and other nations had shown stronger leadership. During the last \n5 years, America's reputation has suffered tremendously. Some of our \nability to lead on human rights issues has been needlessly and \ncarelessly squandered. Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have tarnished that \nrole and that tradition. The secret prisons that the President \nconfirmed last year and this administration's role in sending people to \nother countries where they would be tortured have led to condemnation \nby our allies, to legal challenges, and to criminal charges.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Durbin to create the Human Rights \nand the Law Subcommittee, which is helping us to better fulfill our \nrole in a challenging global environment. This subcommittee will \ncontinue to closely examine some of the important and difficult legal \nissues that have increasingly been a focus of the Judiciary Committee \nand will work to reverse and correct the damaging policies established \nby this administration over the last 6 years.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act is a perfect example of the \nbipartisan, consensus legislation that this subcommittee was created to \nproduce. The bill allows for prosecution of those found in the United \nStates who have participated in horrific acts against humanity in \nplaces such as Bosnia, Rwanda, and Darfur, and gives Federal \nprosecutors the tools they need to bring these people to justice. This \nbill\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nwould amend 18 U.S.C. 1091, the Genocide Convention Implementation \nAct--the Proxmire Act--to allow prosecution of non-U.S. nationals who \nare in the United States for genocide committed outside the country. In \nthe past, Federal investigators have identified perpetrators of \ngenocide, including the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides, who have come to \nthe United States under false pretenses and have found safe haven here. \nUnfortunately, the Justice Department has not been able to prosecute \nthese individuals because the Proxmire Act only criminalizes genocide \ncommitted by U.S. nationals or in the United States.\n  The Genocide Accountability Act would close this loophole, allowing \nFederal prosecutors to prosecute those who have committed or incited \ngenocide who are in our country. This change would make the genocide \nstatute conform with numerous existing Federal crimes that allow for \nsimilar extraterritorial jurisdiction if the offender is found in The \nUnited States, including torture, piracy, material support to \nterrorists, terrorism financing, and hostage taking.\n  I commend Senators Durbin and Coburn for holding a hearing on this \nimportant issue and for their diligent work to ensure that that this \nloophole in our law is closed. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation to ensure that the United States takes this significant \nstep in combating genocide worldwide.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 888) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genocide Accountability Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GENOCIDE.\n\n       Section 1091 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Required Circumstance for Offenses.--The circumstance \n     referred to in subsections (a) and (c) is that--\n       ``(1) the offense is committed in whole or in part within \n     the United States;\n       ``(2) the alleged offender is a national of the United \n     States (as that term is defined in section 101 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101));\n       ``(3) the alleged offender is an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence in the United States (as that term is \n     defined in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101));\n       ``(4) the alleged offender is a stateless person whose \n     habitual residence is in the United States; or\n       ``(5) after the conduct required for the offense occurs, \n     the alleged offender is brought into, or found in, the United \n     States, even if that conduct occurred outside the United \n     States.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I intend, in a few minutes, to call up a \nbill for passage, and I think I will be joined on the floor by Senator \nReid at the appropriate time. The bill I am going to speak about in a \nminute is the Catastrophic Disaster Recovery Fairness Act of 2007, \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor with Senator Lott and others. We have \nbeen working on trying to get this bill cleared, and I will come back \nto that in a moment, but before I call this bill up for final passage, \nI would like to speak for a moment about the emergency supplemental \nbill that we passed.\n  The Congress must--and usually does--and is required to take care of \nemergency issues. These are situations that, by the nature of \nemergencies, we cannot plan for. The war we are prosecuting and trying \nto win has extended well beyond the boundaries that many of us believed \ninitially, so there are new costs associated with that war. There have \nbeen emergencies right here in the country that have taken place that \ncould never have been predicted or anticipated.\n  We are still recovering, as you know, from two of those very terrible \nstorms, two of the worst to ever hit the United States of America, \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. The aftermath of those storms was the \nmultiple failure of a levee system that has protected this great \ncommunity for over 300 years. It is not just any city or any region, it \nis a very special historic city and region, the city of New Orleans. It \nis also of great economic significance for the Nation.\n  We could not necessarily predict this in our regular budgets, and so \nit is appropriate that we provide emergency funding for emergencies, \nand that is what the supplemental is. It isn't a war spending bill, it \nis an emergency bill. There are things associated with the ongoing war \nin Iraq and Afghanistan that are emergencies, but there are things \nhappening in the United States also that are emergencies.\n  For Senators to come to this floor and argue over the last 2 weeks \nthat there are no emergencies in the United States that we need to take \ncare of and that all we need to do is to focus on the war in Iraq, I \nwould ask them to go home and talk to their constituents because that \nis not what my constituents are saying, Republicans and Democrats. I \ndon't think that is what anyone is saying, any constituent in anybody's \nState. I think they are saying, whatever their feelings are about the \nwar and how we should prosecute it, there are most certainly \nemergencies right here in the United States that need to be dealt with.\n  I am proud that many of us on the Democratic side, as well as some of \nour Republican friends, decided to put some money in this emergency \nsupplemental bill to take care of real American emergencies right here \non the home soil--right here in America. One of those emergencies is \nthe ongoing attempts to rebuild the gulf coast, primarily in Louisiana \nand Mississippi, but we also have friends in the southern part of Texas \nwho are still hurting and also in the southern part of Alabama and \nthrough some parts of Florida. So I like to always say we are fighting \nhard for the gulf coast and trying to rebuild the gulf coast.\n  This Congress has been generous, has been innovative, and has been \ntrying to think outside of the box to respond to an unprecedented \ndisaster. Again, the scope of this disaster is beyond anything we have \nattempted. You know the long and sorry record: When we went to call on \nFEMA, it showed up but it was weak, anemic, underled, and \nunderresourced. When we called on the Red Cross, as respectable as that \norganization and that name is, and they have done remarkable work, they \ntoo were overwhelmed. This is a job that was beyond the ability of the \ntools that we normally have to rebuild, and so we have been scrambling \nas a Congress to redesign tools. Some we have done a good job on and \nsome we haven't.\n  There is a lot of redtape we unwittingly created, and not with any \nill intent, but that has been the consequences of many of the things we \nhave passed. And so people are caught up in a lot of bureaucracy and a \nlot of redtape. There has been a lot of money thrown at them, which is \nvery frustrating because they hear about it, they think they are going \nto get it, but they can't feel it because the bureaucracy has it \nbasically tied up.\n  So part of what we have done in this supplemental, which is very \ngood, is we have removed some of the redtape and added some additional \nfunding where we thought we were short, so that the hundreds of \nthousands of people on the gulf coast who have lost their homes, who \nhave lost their businesses, who have seen everything they have worked \nfor, some for 50 years or 60 years, literally washed away by \nfloodwaters or collapsed levees, they could have a chance to rebuild.\n  I feel very strongly about this. I have been very generous as an \nappropriator with help to foreign countries. I have helped send money \nto Afghanistan, to countries in Africa, and to South America. I was one \nof the first Senators on the ground when Hurricane\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\nMitch hit Honduras. I believe in helping people when they are in their \nhour of need. But I can tell you people on the gulf coast are starting \nto ask: Does anybody remember that we are here in the United States and \nwe need help as well?\n  So that is what this supplemental bill did. Let me say a couple of \nthings we tried to do in it.\n  We passed in this supplemental emergency spending bill for the United \nStates of America a waiver of a 10-percent match. In every disaster, we \nrequire the locals to put up money. It makes sense, and normally it \nworks, and that is appropriate. But in a case where the disaster is so \ncatastrophic, let's say in St. Bernard Parish, which is the parish I \nrepresent, there were 67,000 people who lived there before the storm. \nIt was a middle-class, working-class community. Every single home was \ndestroyed. Every fire station was destroyed. Every police station was \ndestroyed.\n  The sheriff had to swim out of the second floor with his deputies. He \nis a big, strong sheriff, thank goodness, and a good swimmer. If he \nwasn't, he would have drowned--Jack Stevens, my good friend. He swam \nout, literally saving his deputies. His headquarters was destroyed.\n  Now, I ask you: How is St. Bernard Parish going to come up with a 10-\npercent match? It sounds reasonable, but in this case it is not.\n  No. 2, these 10-percent waivers, or matches, have been waived before. \nIn 32 of the last 38 disasters, they have been waived. I asked the \nadministration and others to waive this one. They said ``no.'' So we \nhave done it now, as a matter of fact, in this bill. Congress said yes, \nit is right that this be waived. It will not only provide several \nhundred million dollars more in emergency disaster money for Louisiana \nand Mississippi, but, most importantly, it will completely eliminate \nthe 10-percent match requirement which is required on each individual \nproject worksheet.\n\n  Now, somebody may ask how many project worksheets we have, which \nmeans how many individual public entities have requested rebuilding, \nwhether it is a library or half a library; a wing of a school or a \nwhole school; a light post or a sewer system. We have 23,000 of those \nproject worksheets pending for Louisiana alone. Because of this 10-\npercent requirement, there is a NEPA review, a FEMA review, a HUD \nreview--we are being reviewed to death. We can't do this in this \nfashion. We have to waive this 10 percent.\n  Not only will $750 million be immediately available, but more than \nthe money, the redtape goes away. Ninety percent of the redtape goes \naway, and we can actually do what we say we are going to do, which is \nrebuilding the gulf coast, one fire station, one police station, one \nlibrary at a time. This is not theory, this is practical. If you want \nto rebuild a city, you have to rebuild the fire stations, you have to \nrebuild the police stations, you have to actually rebuild homes, pave \nstreets, et cetera, et cetera. All of this is at a slow crawl because \nof this 10 percent.\n  So I am proud of my colleagues who voted for this supplemental, \nbecause we waived this big piece of redtape, and I wish to thank them. \nI hope the President does not veto this bill because of that. I hope to \nbe negotiating with the President and the administration in good faith \nto perhaps explain some things he is not quite understanding about the \ndifficulty we are facing in the gulf coast and see if he can work with \nus to keep this waiver in place.\n  In addition, we put in the supplemental $1.3 billion for levees. One \nof the most memorable speeches the President made was in Jackson \nSquare, and I was pleased he came down right after the storms and spoke \nin Jackson Square when there weren't many lights on in the whole \nregion. We put up lights that night for that speech. Generators were \nbrought in to turn the lights on so the President could be seen when he \nmade the speech. The rest of the French Quarter was completely dark. If \nyou were in the city that night he made that speech, you wouldn't have \nbeen able to see your hand in front of your face, but the world saw the \nPresident because we got generators to turn those lights on so he could \nbe seen. When he stood there in the dark, he said he would do whatever \nhis administration needed to do to rebuild the levees in this \nmetropolitan area.\n  I am not talking about little rinky-dink levees, I am talking about \nfederally authorized levees that collapsed because they were not funded \ncorrectly, they were not maintained correctly, and the Corps of \nEngineers has admitted it was their fault and they need to fix it. \nWhere I come from, if you break something, you fix it. The Corps of \nEngineers' levees collapsed, and they need to fix them.\n  So here comes the supplemental request, and lo and behold there is no \nnew money for levees. We get a request from the administration that it \nwanted to move $1.3 billion from one set of projects to another, \nclaiming this set of projects isn't ready to go, and they want to move \nit from the east bank to the west bank. Senator Vitter and I discussed \nthis, and we said ``no.'' The days of moving money from the east bank \nto the west bank, in hopes that next year we would come back and find \nsome new money for the east bank, are over with. We did that for the \nlast 40 years, and then 18 months ago New Orleans and the surrounding \narea went underwater.\n  No more moving the money. No more shell games. This supplemental says \n``no,'' and we put in an additional $1.3 billion. We are not moving \nlevee monies from one of our constituent groups to another constituent \ngroup in hopes we will come back next year and fill in the pot. It is \nakin to musical chairs. You keep moving chairs, and when the music \nstops, somebody is going to be without a chair. I am not doing that \nanymore.\n  Every person in south Louisiana and in Mississippi who deserves a \nfederally protected levee is going to get it. Those levees are going to \nhold, and we are not moving this money around anymore. So that money is \nin the supplemental, and I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Murray and \nSenator Dorgan particularly for their strong support of that principle.\n  Two more things, and then I will call up this bill for discussion.\n  We also got some funding--and I thank Senator Kennedy particularly \nfor his help in this--for recruiting teachers. I can't tell you how \ndifficult it has been for our teachers, our parents, and our students. \nWe did have a happy success story, though, regarding education. Since I \nhave talked about things that didn't work, let me spend a minute \ntalking about something that did work.\n  On Monday morning, when the city of New Orleans was 80 percent \nunderwater, and we looked up and millions of people had fled their \nhomes along the gulf coast, we realized there were about 330,000 \nchildren who had no school to go to on Monday morning. I want that to \nsink in for a minute. There were 330,000 children, from kindergarten to \n12th grade, who had no school to go to on Monday morning. That was a \nproblem, and we had no solution for it.\n  There was no tool in the toolbox. FEMA didn't have a plan. There was \nnothing we could do. So we thought for a minute, and between the work \nof this Congress, the administration, and the good people down in \nLouisiana and Mississippi, we came up with a plan that basically said \nthis: If every parent will show up at a school and get your child \nregistered, the Federal Government will send that school a check. Don't \nworry about it. You don't have to pay for it, we will take care of it.\n  It was a most extraordinary effort because, you know what, it worked. \nFor the most part, after this major disaster, almost all of those \n330,000 children actually attended school somewhere last year and the \nschools were actually reimbursed. So when people tell me Congress can't \ndo anything well, I like to point this out, to say: Yes, sometimes we \nactually manage to do something really well. And that worked.\n  What we failed to realize, though, is it was not just the tuition for \nthe children we had to send--whether they left parochial school and \nwent to public or public school and went to parochial, we covered it, \nno questions asked. But what we didn't think about is what happens to \nthe thousands of teachers whose schools were ruined, whose homes were \nflooded, whose churches were destroyed, and they had to move--but they \nwant to come back now and teach--how do we get them to come back and \nlive in a community that is so destroyed? What incentives can we give \nthem to come back?\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n  Many of these teachers are very dedicated, and many of them have come \nback under harsh conditions. But we think it might be wise, when you \nare trying to rebuild from a nuclear bomb explosion--and we hope that \nnever happens--or a dirty bomb or Tsunami or major terrorist attack or \nperhaps just a terrible storm or tornado or hurricane, if you have to \nrebuild a devastated area, you need to encourage some key people to \ncome back: doctors, nurses, teachers. We have some money in this bill \nto give the appropriate incentives for teachers to come back.\n  We are not just going to build the old school system we had which was \nfailing students and disappointing parents and not really a very \nsuccessful story. We are in the process, with the help of Republicans \nand Democrats here, of building a new kind of public school system.\n  So this money in this supplemental will help us to recruit quality \nteachers, to acknowledge what we are asking of them. Teaching under \nnormal circumstances is difficult. To teach children in a classroom \nthat is a temporary and sometimes wholly inadequate structure, where \nthese children are living in trailers at night, where the teachers \nthemselves have to live in 16-by-8 trailers--the least we could do is \ngive them some financial incentive to just make it through the next \nyear or two until we can stabilize the situation and rebuild the \ninfrastructure of this city. I am excited about that.\n  I am not going to go into any more detail about the historic \npreservation funding. Obviously, people in America know that New \nOrleans and south Louisiana have some of the most historic structures \nin the Nation and that they are at risk. This additional funding helps \nus preserve that.\n  We also have some funding in here for our fisheries. Our fishermen \nare small businesspeople, many of them. They don't work on the land; \nthey work on the water. They don't work in an office; they work on \ntheir boats. Their boats were destroyed. We don't think of them as \nbusinesspeople, but they are. Our disaster assistance has to take care \nof our farmers, our ranchers, our urban and rural--and our fisheries. \nWe have determined we had not done enough for them and for their needs, \nso we have some money to help them.\n  People say: Where do we get this funding? It comes off budget. This \ncountry is a great country. It is one of the great benefits of \nbelonging to a great and powerful nation--if your region gets \ndevastated, the rest of the country's money will be pooled to help you. \nIf something happens--and it did in New York--we all pool our resources \nto help out. Now New York is doing magnificently. There was a question, \nafter 9/11, as to what would happen, but because we all helped and they \ndid a great job, that area is being rebuilt. Even though we still mourn \nthe loss of those 3,000 Americans who lost their lives and it is still \na very sad thing for us to think about, we are proud of helping to \nrebuild that great city.\n  If something were to happen, Mr. President, in your State--and your \nState is a coastal State as well; you have had your share of \ndisasters--even though your State is tiny and you might not be able to \nbail yourself out, you are part of a great nation that will step up and \nhelp you as well.\n  I would like to speak for a minute about the Catastrophic Disaster \nRecovery Fairness Act. I will ask, at the appropriate time, for this \nbill to be called up and to clear it by unanimous consent. This \nparticular bill was not included in the supplemental. It has not been \nincluded in any other major legislation. This bill will eliminate a \ngreat barrier to construction of homes in the gulf coast.\n  People ask me all the time: Senator, how is it possible that we have \nsent over $100 billion and yet we cannot seem to get massive rebuilding \nunderway? This is one of the answers, and I hope I can explain this \nsimply and clearly because it will help people understand.\n  The Small Business Administration, in a disaster, will lend money to \npeople if they qualify for a small business disaster loan, and 81,000 \npeople in my State qualified and have received approval for a loan--\n81,000. That is a huge number of homes. That is not all the homes which \nwere destroyed. We had 250,000 homes destroyed. Of those, 81,000 \nfamilies qualified for a home loan through the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  It was painfully slow. It took months for these applications to get \nout, with us beating them every day and working with them and pushing, \npushing, with Senator Kerry and Senator Snowe, who were, together, \nterrific to push the SBA. Then we got rid of the SBA Director, we got a \nnew SBA Director, and they pushed those loans out the door. The good \nnews is 81,000 people have gotten loans. The bad news is that as soon \nas these same people get their Road Home grants, which they are \nentitled to under another program we created, the SBA is interpreting \ntheir law so as to require these homeowners to immediately pay back \ntheir loan.\n  This bill which I am sponsoring with Senator Lott will release the \nhomeowners, the borrowers, from that obligation. They must repay the \nloan. This is not a loan-forgiveness program. If you borrowed money, \nyou must repay it under the terms you borrowed it. This is not a \ncharity. This is not loan forgiveness. You must repay it under the \nterms of your loan. But you don't have to pay it today. You don't have \nto pay it next week when you get your Road Home money. You can pay it \nunder the terms that it was lent to you, whether it was 5 years or 20 \nyears, whether it was at 2 percent or 4 percent or 6 percent.\n  Mr. President, 81,000 people in Louisiana and 31,000 people in \nMississippi have been told: The good news is you got an SBA loan; the \nbad news is the minute you get your Road Home Program money from the \nFederal Government, you have to pay this loan in full.\n\n  Believe me, this was not our intention when we passed these community \ndevelopment block grants. I do not believe there is a Senator in this \nChamber who would expect that of a homeowner who has lost everything. \nIn some cases, they had insurance. In some cases, they didn't. In most \ncases, neither their insurance nor the money we are giving them is \nmaking them whole. There is no coverage for contents. This is not for \ncontents. Some people might have $100,000 of contents in their home. \nSome people might have $200,000 of contents. Some people might have \nonly $25,000 of contents. We are not even covering contents.\n  We are not covering the expedited or accelerated cost of labor and \nmaterials. So people are already with no coverage for contents. Unless \nthey had insurance, they have lost that. We are not covering the 30-\npercent increase in labor costs or the 30-percent increase in cost of \nsupplies. That is not calculated.\n  This loan is very important for people. It is saving many of them \nfrom bankruptcy. If they manage to get their loan, we most certainly do \nnot want them to have to pay their loan back in full when they get \ntheir Road Home grant. This is for Louisiana and for Mississippi. If \nyou add up 81,000 people in Louisiana and 31,000, this is over 100,000 \nfamilies--110,000 families. That is probably affecting more than a \nquarter of a million people. That is a lot of people.\n  When this bill passes, which it will--it may not pass today, but I \nwish it would. I wish no one would object to it. But when this bill \npasses, 250,000 people are actually going to be able to see the light \nat the end of the tunnel, and they will be able to say: This is hard. I \ndon't know if I can rebuild. I don't know if I want to rebuild. But at \nleast I have a fighting chance to make that decision. If this bill does \nnot pass, these 200,000-plus people who live in my State and \nMississippi--I predict many of them will have to file bankruptcy.\n  I have said this before and I am going to say it again. The people I \nrepresent who lived behind these levees were not sunbathing when these \nlevees broke. They were loading tankers on the river. They were working \nat the docks. They were drilling and exploring for oil and gas in the \ngulf. They were going to work at hospitals and nursing homes and \nteaching and running our libraries. This is not a resort community. \nThese levees were not protecting a beach. These levees were protecting \na port, and the levees failed.\n  In working-class neighborhoods, Black and White, in rich and poor \nneighborhoods, people's homes were destroyed, homes that had never had \nan inch of water. Let me repeat that. People's homes were destroyed, \nhomes that had never had an inch of water. They were not in a flood \nplain.\n  When you lose everything you have--and for most Americans, their \nlargest\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nasset is their home--it is our obligation to think about ways we can \nstrengthen the insurance system; strengthen our levees so they do not \nbreak again and while people are struggling give them a hand.\n  Again, I am not asking for loan forgiveness. They have to pay back \nevery penny. But let's give them a fighting chance to pay it back, over \n10 years or 15 years. Let's not require them to take one grant program \nwe have given them to build their home and the same day take it away \nbecause they have to fully pay their small business loan.\n  I understand Senator Reid is going to call up this bill and try to \nget it passed. I surely hope nobody objects to it. It is a Landrieu-\nLott bill, with Senator Vitter as well. Senator Reid is going to call \nit up in a few minutes, and I hope nobody objects to it. But if they do \nobject, I can promise you I am going to spend every day on the floor \nuntil this bill is passed, sometime before we go home--not this week \nbut before we go home for the next break.\n  I do not think this is unreasonable. We are going to ask for \neverybody's support. Senator Lott will be happy to explain, when he has \nan opportunity, about the 31,000 families in Mississippi. But I am \ngoing to leave this here, and Senator Reid is going to come down and \nask it be passed. I hope we can get it done today. If not, we will ask \nfor it tomorrow. If not, we will continue to ask for it until we get \nit.\n  We are asking for fairness, not charity, and for justice for the \npeople in the gulf coast.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      ANIMAL FIGHTING PROHIBITION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about House \nbill H.R. 137, which has a companion Senate bill, S. 261, the Animal \nFighting Prohibition Enforcement Act. This is legislation that both the \nHouse and Senate have had much discussion on in the last several years, \nand something I hope will make its way to the consent calendar and \nfinal action this evening.\n  I come to the floor tonight as someone who has been a cosponsor of \nthis legislation for several years now, and as someone who has seen the \nimpact of animal fighting in the state of Washington where animal \nfighting organizations have not only been a source of all sorts of \ncruel and inhumane treatment of animals, but also other illegal \nactivity. To me this is legislation that is much needed, and we have \npassed similar legislation in the State of Washington. It is something \nwe should have a strong Federal statute on.\n  During October of 2004, there was a major raid in Vancouver, WA, \nwhere police found 21 pit bulls, as well as training logs and other \nevidence of animal fighting. It got quite a bit of attention as well \nbecause there were very high-profile people involved with the animal \nfighting ring.\n  There is a long list of other incidents that have happened in \nWashington State, other activity in Yakima, WA, where various animal \nfighting organizations were discovered by law enforcement who have done \na terrific job of uprooting these organizations in our State. It is \nimportant we take an aggressive stance and pass this legislation.\n  The House bill we are talking about, H.R. 137, recently passed the \nHouse of Representatives, I believe with over 300 cosponsors. I am sure \nit had quite a few others who actually supported the legislation as it \npassed. We have over 35 cosponsors here with S. 261.\n  When I look at the legislative history of this bill, it has had \nremarkably broad bipartisan support. It was passed by both the House \nand the Senate in the past. It was passed in both Chambers in 2001 and \nthen struck in the conference report. It passed in 2003 in the Senate. \nIt passed in 2005 again in the Senate, a unanimous measure. As I \nmentioned, it passed the House of Representatives. I think it is \nfitting that it should be on our consent calendar and hopefully pass \nthis body this evening.\n  The bottom line is, there are many organizations across the country \nthat have seen the inhumane treatment of animals and have supported \nthis legislation. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports \nthe bill, obviously. The National Sheriffs Association supports this \nlegislation. Police departments have been working in every part of the \ncountry and have endorsed this legislation because they see what kind \nof criminal activity is associated with animal fighting--gambling, \ndrugs, and in one case in Washington State actual murder. The Federal \nantianimal fighting legislation is important. While we already have a \nFederal statute on the books, what we don't have is a Federal statute \nthat effectively helps law enforcement meet this growing challenge. \nThat is, with a simple misdemeanor, which is currently on the Federal \nbooks, sometimes it takes law enforcement as many as 7 to 8 months to \ninvestigate these kinds of crimes. To investigate and put that kind of \nenergy into fighting this kind of criminal activity in our States, and \nthen to have a maximum penalty of only up to 1 year is not adequate.\n  In fact, in Washington State, in response to the activities that \noccurred in Vancouver and other parts of our State, our Governor signed \nan antianimal fighting bill that has been a great model for what we \nshould be doing at the Federal level. As Washington did, this bill \nwould make sure this crime is a felony and that it has adequate \npenalties. In fact, when the current Federal animal fighting law was \nenacted in 1976, only one State made it a felony. Today dogfighting is \na felony in 48 States. We need to make sure that it is also a felony at \nthe Federal level for transporting these animals and products \nassociated with animal fighting across State lines. In fact, we are \nseeing that in many cases.\n  In Washington State and in Oregon, we have seen this activity, \nbecause people in several States are joining together to locate and to \nmake a profit and make investments in these kinds of criminal \nactivities.\n  We want to make sure we are stamping out this activity. With this \nlegislation, we believe we have a very good chance to say that the \nFederal Government views this kind of animal fighting as cruel and \ninhumane, that we consider it a serious criminal activity to drug and \nforce animals to fight and then to enclose them in pits while \nspectators engage in all sorts of gambling, narcotics trafficking, \npublic corruption, and, in some cases, even violence toward people. \nThat is something we ought to take a tough stance against.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I hope we can \nconsider it in tonight's consent calendar, given how the Judiciary \nCommittee has supported this legislation, and how it has passed both \nthe House and Senate in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4153-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4153-S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 EASTER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the poet Alfred Edward Housman, 1859-1936, \nwrote in his poem, ``A Shropshire Lad,'' the following verse:\n\n     Loveliest of trees, the cherry now\n     Is hung with bloom along the bough,\n     And stands about the woodland ride\n     Wearing white for Eastertide.\n\n  The trees are in bloom. In Washington, the annual cherry blossom \nfestival begins this Saturday, March 31, and runs through April 15. It \nis always a beautiful sight, whether viewed under warm and sunny skies \nor as the blossoms fall like rain on a misty morning. It is a lovely \ncelebration of Spring and a welcome complement to Easter.\n  This year Easter falls on April 8, when the Senate will not be in \nsession. Each year, of course, Easter falls on a different day, \nsometimes with many weeks' difference from year to year. Easter is a \nvery moveable feast and has been throughout its long history. The \ncalculation of when to celebrate Easter has varied through the \ncenturies, being settled for just over 1,427 years by the Council of \nNicea in 325 A.D. But even today, Easter remains a moveable feast.\n  The Roman Emperor Constantine convoked the Council of Nicea in 325 \nA.D. to resolve a number of important differences between the religious \npractices across his empire. The council decided that the Easter \nfestival should be celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon \nfollowing the vernal equinox, thus eternally linking the return of \nspring with the resurrection of Christ. If the full moon occurred on a\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nSunday and thereby coincided with the Passover festival, council \nfurther decided that Easter would be commemorated on the following \nSunday. The council also declared that the calendar date of Easter \nwould be calculated at Alexandria, in Egypt, which was the leading \nastronomical center of the fourth century world.\n  This attempt to reconcile Easter celebrations proved difficult, \nhowever, as fourth century astronomy lacked the knowledge to resolve a \ndiscrepancy between the solar and lunar years. As a result, the \ndifferences between the true astronomical year and the Julian calendar \nthen in use continued to grow. By 387 A.D., churches in France and \nEgypt were celebrating Easter on dates 35 days apart. In 465 A.D., the \nchurch adopted a reformed calendar that fixed the date of Easter, but \nchurches in what is now the United Kingdom refused to adopt the \nchanges.\n  In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII reformed the Julian calendar yet again, \nresulting in the calendar in use in much of the West today--the \nGregorian calendar. This new calendar corrected many of the \ndifficulties in fixing the date of Easter and other important \necclesiastical dates. When Great Britain and Ireland adopted the \nGregorian calendar in 1752, Easter was celebrated on the same day in \nthe Western part of the Christian world. However, the Eastern churches \ndid not adopt the Gregorian calendar, and celebrate Easter on different \ndates. Occasionally, the two churches' calculations coincide, and \nEaster is celebrated on the same date throughout the world. The last \ntime that happened was in 1963.\n  All of these details are fascinating, at least to a longtime fan of \nthe study of history. I find it thought-provoking to consider how the \nstudy of astronomy and the development of calendars has affected our \ndaily lives today, as they have the daily life of so many who have come \nbefore us. But does it matter, Mr. President, when we celebrate Easter? \nIn the long run, I think, the celebration of that momentous moment in \nhistory is far more important than precision on the day of the week. \nFew events in history have had a more profound impact on our lives. You \ndo not have to be a Christian or an adherent of any particular church \nor faith, to recognize the impact of Christ's life upon world history, \nregardless of which day of the week or week of the year it took place.\n  Christ's message, brought home by His sacrifice at Easter time and \nHis subsequent resurrection, changed the lives of billions of people \nover the years. In Matthew 28:5-6, we are told, ``The angel said to the \nwomen, `Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, \nwho was crucified. He is not here; He has risen, just as He said.' '' \nThat much change is bound to have an effect on everyone else.\n  The rise of a new religion and the power and passion of its churches \nhas changed empires, international boundaries, customs, and lifestyles. \nThe Christian religion has grown and spread across the globe, sweeping \nold religions away.\n  On this Sunday, Christians observe Palm Sunday, recalling Christ's \ntriumphant entry into Jerusalem with crosses made of palm leaves like \nthose that were laid across Christ's path to welcome Him. Next Friday, \nChristians will commemorate Christ's sacrifice on Good Friday, when He \ntook up His crown of thorns and carried His own cross on that long, \nsad, walk to be crucified. Then on April 8, church bells will ring, and \nsunrise services will celebrate His resurrection from the dead and His \nascension into heaven with the rising sun. It is a deeply moving and \nuplifting period, Mr. President, and it does not matter when it \nhappens--only that it did happen. Beautiful, blessed Easter, giving \nhope to us all.\n  Mr. President, I wish you and yours all the blessings of Easter, with \nall of its promise of everlasting life spent in the love of the Lord.

PARKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated public servant and a true friend to the people of Kentucky, \nMr. Michael A. Parker. After years of exemplary work as the program \nmanager for the Assembled Chemical Weapons Alternatives Program at the \nDepartment of Defense, Mr. Parker is retiring, and I want to express to \nhim my thanks for his service.\n  Mr. Parker has held the post of program manager since December 1996. \nIn that role, he consistently worked hard toward the goal of safely and \nexpeditiously disposing of the dangerous chemical agents stored at the \nBlue Grass Army Depot in Madison County, KY. The people of Madison \nCounty are living right next door to over 500 tons of the deadliest \nmaterial ever conceived by man. Understandably, they would like to see \nthese weapons disposed of as safely and quickly as possible. Mike has \nbeen a key player in working toward that goal.\n  Mike appreciates the unique culture at the Assembled Chemical Weapons \nAlternatives Program and understands the need to work closely with the \nlocal community to reach acceptable solutions. The people of the \nMadison County area are going to miss Mike, as will I.\n  Proof of Mike's drive for excellence in his work lies in his numerous \nhonors and awards. He holds the Presidential Rank Award at both the \nDistinguished and Meritorious levels. He also holds the Defense \nDepartment Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Army Decoration \nfor Exceptional Civilian Service, the Army Research and Development \nAchievement Award, the Army Commander's Medal, and the Army Meritorious \nCivilian Service Award.\n  Mr. President, Kentucky has been lucky to have such a friend in \nMichael A. Parker, and I speak for many in the Commonwealth when I say \nhe will be missed. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in thanking Mike \nfor his years of dedication and service and in wishing him good luck in \nhis future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4154-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

They now have a target on \ntheir backs because of their service to our country, and we need to \nprotect them by granting them safe refuge in the United States.\n  Under the current program, only 50 translators a year from Iraq and \nAfghanistan are eligible for admission to the United States. So far \nthis year, we have already admitted 50, and 450 more are waiting for \nadmission under the program. At the current rate, that is a 9-year \nbacklog.\n  These men and women are in mortal danger every day and they should be \npermitted to come to the United States without delay. They have been \nrecommended by the American military. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity agreed that they are eligible for admission to the United \nStates. To ensure\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nthat these courageous allies are able to come to America this year, the \nLugar-Kennedy bill authorizes 500 visas a year for the current fiscal \nyear 2007 and for the next 2 years so that this critical lifeline will \ncontinue to be available. Under the bill's provisions, persons who \nserved as translators or interpreters either for our military or for \nthe Department of State can qualify.\n  The bill is not intended to address the much broader massive refugee \ncrisis unfolding in Iraq. Already more than 2 million Iraqis have fled \nthe country, and nearly 2 million more have been displaced internally.\n  Each refugee is a personal story of courage, loyalty, heroism, and \ntragedy. We have a special duty to protect all of them and their loved \nones who are being targeted by insurgents and sectarian death squads \neither because of their faith or because of their association with the \nUnited States. Obviously, we cannot take all of these refugees into \nAmerica, but we have an obligation to lead an international effort to \nsolve this dangerous crisis as well.\n  Legislation is essential to address this problem, and I am hopeful we \ncan enact it soon. But it is especially urgent that we act now to \nprotect the lives of the translators who have served us so well in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4155-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OUR CHILDREN PAY THE PRICE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the increase in gun violence that affects \ntowns, cities, and rural areas across this Nation takes a particularly \nheavy toll on our most precious resource, our children and \ngrandchildren. Since 1979, over 101,000 children and teenagers have \nbeen killed by firearms. This staggering figure clearly illustrates the \ninadequacy of Congress's efforts to address the issue of gun violence.\n  On March 7, 2007, in the small city of Midland, MI, a 17-year-old \nmale shot a 17-year-old female student before turning the gun on \nhimself, committing suicide in the young girl's high school parking \nlot. Reports indicate the male drove to the school to talk with the \nfemale student. After arranging to meet her in the school parking lot, \nhe shot her four times, while her mother watched in horror. He then \nturned the gun on himself. The very same day, in Greenville, TX, a city \nof only 26,000 people, a 16-year-old student fatally shot himself \ninside his high school's hallway.\n  These are just two examples of the misery gun violence inflicts. \nAccording to data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, every day, on average, nearly eight children or teens are \nkilled by gun violence in America. In 2004, 58 preschoolers were killed \nby firearms. Furthermore, for every child or teen death caused by a \ngun, there are nearly five nonfatal injuries. According to the Journal \nof the American Medical Association, the average cost per gunshot \nvictim, excluding rehabilitation and long-term care, is $45,000. A \nsingle year's worth of gunshot injuries adds up to approximately $2.3 \nbillion in lifetime medical costs, half of which is paid for by \ntaxpayers.\n  The Children's Defense Fund, in their 2007 report on gun violence, \nmakes a number of recommendations to protect children from gun \nviolence. Among other things, the CDF recommends parents remove guns \nfrom their homes, schools provide nonviolent conflict resolution \ncourses for all students, and communities create positive activities \nfor children and teenagers to reduce the influence of gangs and drugs. \nCongress must also take an active role. We should pass commonsense gun \nsafety legislation, support law enforcement and community programs, and \nhelp focus media and public attention on causes and consequences of gun \nviolence.\n  I am hopeful the 110th Congress will work to break the cycle of gun \nviolence that plagues so many of our communities and our children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4155-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an event \nthat occurred 25 years ago in New Mexico.\n  Most of my colleagues know White Sands Missile Range, WSMR, NM, is a \npremier test, evaluation and research site, but WSMR's role in the 1982 \nlanding of the Space Shuttle Columbia is less well known.\n  WSMR's gypsum landing strips visible from space and the excellent \nweather in New Mexico have made WSMR a potential Space Shuttle launch \nand landing site since the beginning of NASA's Space Shuttle Program. \nHowever, WSMR has never been NASA's first choice for a landing site. \nBut in March of 1982, the preferred landing site at Edwards Air Force \nBase was soaked with heavy rains. Because it was unclear when the \nrunway surface would be dry enough to support Columbia's landing, WSMR \nwas chosen as an alternative landing site.\n  Commander Jack R. Lousma and pilot C. Gordon Fullerton landed the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia on WSMR's Northrup Strip at 9:05 a.m. on \nTuesday, March 30, 1982. About 4,000 individuals witnessed the landing, \nand another 90,000 had the opportunity to see the Space Shuttle \nColumbia at WSMR before its return to Kennedy Space Center. I remember \nthis event as a day of pride for me and my fellow New Mexicans, as our \nhome State played such a visible role in the U.S. space mission.\n  Today I wish to commemorate this important part of White Sands \nMissile Range's history and honor the men and women who were a part of \nthe Space Shuttle Columbia's landing at WSMR. While the Space Shuttle \nColumbia has been the only shuttle to land at WSMR, New Mexico stands \nready to serve NASA again should the need arise. In fact, as recently \nas December 2006 NASA officials considered landing the Space Shuttle \nDiscovery at WSMR because of poor conditions at Kennedy Space Center \nand Edwards Air Force Base. WSMR prepared for that situation, and I \nhave full confidence that they will continue to work to support NASA \nand other Federal entities as needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4155-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4155-S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CYPRUS ENERGY EXPLORATION\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the island of Cyprus has a longstanding \nreputation as a place of natural beauty and rich history. It is now \nemerging as a potential source of energy as well. Developed \nresponsibly, oil and gas deposits under the island's southern \ncontinental shelf could provide an alternative source of hydrocarbons \nat a time when many European countries are struggling to diversify \ntheir energy supplies. If this ambition is realized, Cyprus could play \nan important role in promoting regional energy security.\n  The Government of the Republic of Cyprus, ROC, is working to \nestablish partnerships with foreign companies and countries in an \neffort to bring these energy resources online. This process is being \nneedlessly complicated, however, by individuals in Turkey and the \nTurkish Cypriot community who are discouraging foreign partners from \nworking with the ROC. In view of this behavior, I believe it is \nimportant to affirm the ROC's right to search for and develop resources \nlocated under Cyprus' continental shelf.\n  Under international law, there is no question about the legality of \nthe Cypriot Government's activities. The legal principles at issue are \ncodified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to \nwhich Cyprus is a party. The ROC has entered into agreements \ndelineating its Exclusive Economic Zone, EEZ, with Egypt and Lebanon \nand the areas under consideration for development are well within these \nboundaries. There is simply no juridical basis to dispute Cyprus' \nclaims or actions.\n  I hope that both Ankara and leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community \nwill cease their efforts to obstruct the exploration of Cypriot waters. \nStrong-arm diplomacy aimed at scaring away potential Cypriot business \npartners will only delay the peaceful reunification of Cyprus--and with \nit the day when all Cypriots can benefit from the island's energy \nresources.\n  I want to reiterate my longstanding call for both Cypriot communities \nto push forward with the technical talks and negotiations that I \nbelieve can reunify the island. However, in doing so, I want to caution \nthat attempts to interfere in Cyprus' legitimate energy exploration \nactivities will only complicate negotiations to end the estrangement of \nthe island's peoples.\n  The country of Cyprus has long been a key partner for the United \nStates, and our friendship rests on the bedrock\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\nof shared democratic values. In a global energy market dominated by \nauthoritarian regimes, I believe it is important for Cyprus to push \nforward with plans to survey its energy assets. I sincerely hope that \nother parties will respect Cyprus' right to pursue this undertaking.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in an era of energy insecurity, \ncountries around the world are constantly being challenged to come up \nwith new ways to meet the energy needs of their citizens. The Republic \nof Cyprus is currently working to develop the oil and gas deposits \nunder the island's southern continental shelf in order to expand and \ndiversify its energy supplies. If successful, Cyprus will also be in a \nposition to aid its neighbors in addressing their energy needs.\n  Unfortunately, these plans are being hindered by individuals in \nTurkey and the Turkish Cypriot community who are trying to dissuade \nforeign partners from working with Cyprus. I believe that the Republic \nof Cyprus has the right to explore the natural resources located in \nCypriot waters, and it is my understanding that international law would \nsupport Cyprus's actions. It is my hope that the Turkish government and \nmembers of the Turkish Cypriot community will accept Cyprus's legal \nright to explore these resources and will cease their attempts to \nsabotage future business partnerships. After years of strained \nrelations between the Cypriot communities, I fear that such \nprovocations will only serve to augment divisions and prevent future \nreunification of the island.\n  Cyprus's peaceful energy initiatives will promote economic \ndevelopment for the country and its neighbors, and it is important that \nsuch efforts proceed uninhibited. Additionally, I believe these efforts \nmust be taken in an environmentally responsible manner. I hope that \nthose persons currently working to derail this process will come to \ntheir senses and realize the positive effects that increased energy \nsupplies will have on the stability and prosperity of the entire \nregion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4156-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last week I was pleased to join Senator \nHagel and 66 other Senators in introducing S. Res. 122, commemorating \nthe 25th anniversary of the construction and dedication of the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial. As the unanimous approval of this resolution \nsuggests, showing respect for the memorial and those it honors is a \nunifying action.\n  But I remember that it has not always been so. For a time, it was \ncontroversial to speak in support of the memorial that honors and \nrecognizes the more than 58,000 servicemembers who gave their lives in \nVietnam and the more than 3 million men and women who served there. In \nfact, for some time it was even controversial to support the war's \nveterans themselves. As our troops returned home from Vietnam, far too \nmany returned to face the ridicule and contempt of their fellow \nAmericans. When the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund was organized in \n1979 for the purpose of establishing a memorial for those who served in \nthe war, both living and dead, it faced an uphill battle. We can all be \ngrateful that supporters persevered.\n  In the 25 years since the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated, we \nhave made much progress as a country and can now honor Vietnam veterans \nand the memorial that honors them without dissension. Known to many as \n``the Wall,'' it has become the most popular memorial in our Nation's \nCapital, attracting an estimated 4.4 million visitors each year. Many \nof them leave behind offerings to the men and women lost in Vietnam, \nsuch as letters, medals, birthday cards and roses. These offerings, \nwhich now number more than 100,000, are preserved at the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Collection.\n  People visit the Wall for many reasons: to honor, to heal, and to be \nreminded of the human costs of war. One veteran described the Memorial \nthis way: ``It's a quiet place where I can stand and remember my \nfriends. And that's all I would like to do.''\n  Like so many other Americans, I am grateful for the healing power of \nthe Wall. May it continue to honor, heal, and remind us all of the \nconsequences of war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4156-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SUE GLYNN\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of my \nlongtime friend and staff member, Sue Glynn. After serving on my staff \nin the Michigan State Legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives \nand the U.S. Senate, Sue has decided to join her husband, Dale, in a \nwell-deserved retirement.\n  Before joining my staff, Sue worked for the Michigan Democratic Party \nand other members of the Michigan State Legislature. I consider myself \nvery fortunate that she chose to be a part of my staff and stay with me \nfor over 20 years. She has worn many hats while working for me, \nincluding scheduler, regional manager and office manager. She has \nhandled each one with professionalism and grace.\n  Sue is well known for her incredible organizational skills, and I \nhave relied on her in so many ways. She is leaving very big shoes to \nfill.\n  Both Sue and her husband have dedicated themselves to public \nservice--Sue in government and Dale with the public school system. As a \ncouple and individually, they are well-respected community leaders. I \nknow their commitment will continue into retirement.\n  My staff and I will miss her presence in the office and her \noutstanding work ethic. She is a woman of strong values and integrity. \nShe approaches her work in a serious manner but also is very fun-\nloving. I know that the many people in Michigan, whose lives she has \ntouched through her work, will miss her as well.\n  Upon leaving the Senate, Sue has many exciting plans and will \nprobably be busier than she is now. She enjoys golfing, bowling, \ngardening, spending time with her daughter and son and their families, \ntraveling and being with friends.\n  Mr. President, I am sad because I am losing a trusted and valued \nmember of my staff, but I am happy to see a dear friend move on to new \nlife experiences after a long and distinguished career. She deserves \nthe best of everything and I will always value our friendship in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4156-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4156-S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     DEPUTY SHERIFF MANUEL VILLEGAS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of deputy \nsheriff Manuel Villegas, a dedicated public servant committed to \nprotecting the safety of his community, the State of California, and \nthe Nation. Just 17 months into his tenure with the Riverside County \nSheriff's Department, Deputy Villegas tragically lost his life in an \nautomobile collision while en route to a domestic violence call on \nMarch 19, 2007. It is testament to the heroism and commitment to duty \nof this young deputy sheriff that he died while trying to protect \nsomeone in need.\n  A native of Lindsay, CA, Deputy Villegas served honorably in both the \nU.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army before joining the Riverside County \nSheriff's Department. Deputy Villegas's exceptional work ethic and \nperformance in the Army Airborne School earned him the parachutist \nrating and enabled him to join the selective ranks of the Army's \nparatroopers. For his service in the Army Special Forces Group, 307th \nInfantry Battalion and the Special Forces, 2nd Battalion, Deputy \nVillegas was awarded numerous distinctions including the Bronze Star \nMedal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, and \nthe National Defense Medal. He also earned campaign medals for his \nservice in Afghanistan and Kuwait.\n  Deputy Villegas' decorated service in the U.S. Armed Forces was \nfollowed by an equally distinguished record at the Sheriff's Basic \nAcademy. He proved to be an exemplary recruit upon entering the academy \non November 14, 2005. He graduated first in his class and was awarded \nthe California Academy Directors Association Award for serving as a \nmodel of excellence to fellow students and encouraging others to strive \nfor success. Athletically talented, Deputy Villegas even set the Basic \nAcademy's record for the mile-and-a-half run.\n  Deputy Villegas is described by his colleagues as having been an \nexemplary deputy sheriff who was well respected and highly invested in \nmaking\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\na difference in the lives of others through his career in law \nenforcement. Deputy Villegas demonstrated a commitment to the highest \nstandards of his profession and continually sought to distinguish his \nservice to his community and country through hard work and \nperseverance. He serves as a shining example of the talent, bravery, \nand richness of our Nation's law enforcement officials and military \npersonnel.\n  The impact of Deputy Villegas' loss will have an immeasurable impact \non the lives of his loved ones. His wife Xochitl, four children, Stacie \nLee, Ezequiel, Xavier and Israel, and his colleagues at the Riverside \nCounty Sheriff's Department have lost a beloved husband, devoted \nfather, and cherished friend. I am saddened to lose this exceptional \npublic servant, yet I am grateful for the heroic sacrifice that he made \nto protect his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4157-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa's College of Tropical Agriculture and \nHuman Resources, CTAHR, as they commemorate their upcoming centennial. \nI am pleased to join them in their celebration of a significant \nmilestone that salutes their illustrious achievements in the past, and \nserves as an enduring foundation for many more in their future.\n  CTAHR was established as a land-grant institution in 1907, and at the \ntime, it was known as the College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts. \nThis nascent institution of higher education was dedicated to research, \nacademic instruction, and community outreach. The first students that \nenrolled during the college's inaugural academic year received \ninstruction in agriculture, household economics, science, and \nengineering, all of which are still offered to students by the \nUniversity of Hawaii. Faculty members and students identified the \nnecessity for a curriculum that focused on subtropical climates in \norder to assist Hawaii's farmers. Their initiative and perseverance \nsubsequently led to the development of a tropical agriculture \ncurriculum, a legacy that over the last century lent itself to CTAHR's \nname, and benefited people in Hawaii, the Pacific region, and around \nthe world.\n  CTAHR's successes are numerous, and those in agriculture range from \nlaying the basis of the macadamia nut industry world-wide, to \ncultivating Hawaii's robust anthurium cut-flower crop, and developing a \nseed corn crop export utilizing Hawaii's year-round growing season that \nwas valued at $70 million during the 2005-2006 crop year. In addition, \ntheir accomplishments include researching remedies to the environmental \nproblems caused by invasive species such as fruit flies, termites, and \nthe papaya ringspot virus. Originally, these pests were eliminated \nusing toxic pesticides that inflicted damaged Hawaii's precious and \nbeautiful environment. CTAHR's research and development led to \nnationally honored alternative nontoxic treatments used by farmers and \nresidents.\n  This dedication to the health and well-being of Hawaii's residents \nextends beyond the laboratory and is demonstrated in their community \noutreach. In the 1920's CTAHR's Chair in the Home Economics Department \nwas correct and prescient, when she advocated against the reliance on \nprocessed foods, and was essential in the nutritional assessment of \nreadily available tropical and sub-tropical fruits and vegetables. \nWorld War II starkly highlighted Hawaii's precarious sustainability \nsituation when ships once used to shuttle goods between the islands \nwere serving our country in a wartime capacity. CTAHR stepped in to \nincrease food production, analyze potable water, and help residents \nadapt to shortages and blackout conditions. Their outreach continues \ntoday, and it is exemplified by the 1991 establishment of ``The Center \non the Family.'' This Center bolsters Hawaii's families by gathering \ninformation on everything from child development to elder care using an \ninterdisciplinary approach of research, education, and service. All of \nthe information they compile is available to families, public servants, \nservice providers, educators, and students via the award-winning online \ndatabase maintained by the center.\n  None of these outstanding distinctions could have been reached if \nCTAHR did not promote and sustain their tradition of academic \nexcellence. The element fundamental to all of their accolades since \ntheir beginning in 1907, and that continues to be at the heart of \nCTAHR's success is their commitment to meet the highest standards of \ntheir federally mandated charge to conduct academic instruction. I \nwould like to thank Dean Andrew G. Hashimoto and his predecessors for \ntheir wisdom and leadership over the last 100 years. It is with great \nhope, and my best wishes for CTAHR to carry on their established legacy \nof achievement in all their future endeavors.\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I also wish to honor the centennial \ncelebration of the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical \nAgriculture and Human Resources. The College of Tropical Agriculture \nand Human Resources, CTAHR, is the founding college of the University \nof Hawall system and its flagship campus, the University of Hawaii at \nManoa.\n  In 1907, the Hawaii Territorial Legislature established the College \nof Agriculture and Mechanical Arts under the auspices of the Morrill \nAct as a land-grant college. The first year that classes were offered, \nin 1908, the college provided agriculture, household economics, \nscience, and engineering classes, all of which remain part of CTAHR's \nacademic programs to this day.\n  From its humble beginnings in 1907 to today, CTAHR continues to \nprovide an excellent education and career development opportunities for \nstudents. CTAHR has developed a solid foundation in research and \neducational programs that support tropical agricultural systems and in \nturn foster viable communities, a diversified economy, and a healthy \nenvironment. CTAHR's researchers, instructors, and extension personnel \ncontinue to research and develop new crops that will reduce our \nreliance on imported foods, improve food security, and diversify \nHawaii's agriculture to explore alternative markets. In addition, the \ncollege has played an integral role in further enhancing our \nunderstanding of environmental science and advancing agricultural and \nresource management approaches that conserve and protect Hawaii's \nnatural resources.\n  CTAHR offers a diverse curriculum that continues to prepare an \neducated and experienced workforce to meet the State of Hawaii's \nenvironmental, agricultural, animal science, dietetic, engineering, and \nhuman resource industry needs. CTAHR empowers both students and the \npublic to learn about and proactively engage in better managing the \nlimited resources of our islands. Research conducted by its faculty and \nthrough its undergraduate, master, and doctoral programs contribute not \nonly to our local knowledge but in many cases represent field \nbreakthroughs and establishment of cutting edge technologies. CTAHR \nwill continue to not only enhance the physical landscape of our islands \nand improve the quality of life for all in Hawaii and across the \nNation.\n  Again, I honor the University of Hawaii's College of Tropical \nAgriculture and Human Resources for 100 years of service to the people \nof Hawaii, the Pacific region, and the Nation in its dedication to the \ndevelopment of sustainable agriculture and human resources programs to \nmeet the needs of our changing communities. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4157-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4157-S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WILLIAM O. ``DOC'' FARBER\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \npassing of William O. ``Doc'' Farber of Vermillion, SD. Doc Farber \npassed away this week at the age of 96. He was a selfless educator who \ndedicated his time and energy to encouraging those around him to strive \nfor success. He will be dearly missed by family, friends, and students, \nbut his legacy will live on for generations to come.\n  William O. Farber was born in 1910 in Geneseo, IL, and graduated from \nGeneseo Public High School as valedictorian in 1928. He went on to \nreceive his B.A. and M.A. from Northwestern University in Chicago, \nwhere he graduated with honors, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and was \na Harris Scholar. After earning his Ph.D. from the University of \nWisconsin, Farber came to the University of South Dakota, USD, as an \nassistant professor in 1935. He left USD for a department\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\nchairmanship at North Dakota State in 1937, but returned a year later \nto serve as chair of the Department of Government, a position he held \nfor 38 years. Along with teaching, Farber was heavily involved in state \ngovernment and national service. He helped create USD's Government \nResearch Bureau, served as the first director of the South Dakota \nLegislative Research Council, and was a member of South Dakota's \nConstitutional Revision and Local Government Study Commissions.\n  Throughout his 70 years at the University of South Dakota, Farber \ninfluenced numerous well-known graduates, including many state and \nnational leaders. Six of his former students were Rhodes Scholars and \ntwo of his students, Larry Pressler and Tim Johnson, became U.S. \nSenators. NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, USA Today founder Al Neuharth, and \nmedia personality Pat O'Brien also took classes from the famed \nprofessor. Farber was not just an educator, but served as a friend and \nmentor to many of his students. According to Brokaw, the advice he \nreceived from Farber while in college helped him turn his life around. \nAlways looking out for his students, Doc even drove Brokaw to a job \ninterview in Omaha because the future newsman's car had broken down.\n  Doc Farber was an amazing teacher, a committed public servant, and an \nall-around remarkable person. South Dakota has lost a truly outstanding \nman who inspired countless students to broaden their horizons and to \nmake a difference in the world. While Doc Farber will be greatly missed \nby all who knew him, he will forever be remembered for the life he \nled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4158-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4158-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4158-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1002.

A bill to prevent tobacco smuggling, to ensure the \ncollection of all tobacco taxes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Prevent All \nCigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act with Senators Specter, Leahy, Kyl, and \nSchumer.\n  As the problem of cigarette trafficking continues to worsen, we must \nprovide law enforcement officials with the tools they need to crack \ndown on cigarette trafficking. The PACT Act closes loopholes in current \ntobacco trafficking laws, enhances penalties for violations, and \nprovides law enforcement with new tools to combat the innovative new \nmethods being used by cigarette traffickers to distribute their \nproducts. Each day we delay its passage, terrorists and criminals raise \nmore money, States lose significant amounts of tax revenue, and kids \nhave easy access to tobacco products sold over the internet.\n  The cost to Americans is not merely financial. Tobacco smuggling also \nposes a significant threat to innocent people around the world. It has \ndeveloped into a popular, and highly profitable, means of generating \nrevenue for criminal and terrorist organizations. Hezbollah, for \nexample, earned $1.5 million between 1996 and 2000 by engaging in \ntobacco trafficking in the United States. Al Qaeda and Hamas have also \ngenerated significant revenue from the sale of counterfeit cigarettes. \nThat money is often raised right here in the United States, and it is \nthen funneled back to these international terrorist groups. Cutting off \nfinancial support to terrorist groups is an integral part of protecting \nthis country against future attacks, and it was an important \nrecommendation of the 9/11 Commission. We can no longer continue to let \nterrorist organizations exploit weaknesses in our tobacco laws to \ngenerate significant amounts of money. The cost of doing nothing is too \ngreat.\n  This is not a minor problem. Cigarette smuggling is a multibillion \ndollar a year phenomenon and is getting worse. In 1998, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) had six active \ntobacco smuggling investigations. In 2005, that number swelled to 452.\n  The number of cases alone, however, does not sufficiently put this \nproblem into perspective. The amount of money involved is truly \nastonishing. Cigarette trafficking, including the illegal sale of \ntobacco products over the internet, costs States billions of dollars in \nlost tax revenue each year. It is estimated that $3.8 billion of tax \nrevenue were lost, at the Federal and State level, in 2004 to tobacco \nsmuggling. As lost tobacco tax revenue lines the pockets of criminals \nand terrorist groups, States are being forced to increase college \ntuition and restrict access to other public programs because of lost \nrevenues. Tobacco smuggling may provide some with cheap access to \ncigarettes, but those cheap cigarettes are coming at a significant cost \nto the rest of us.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), cigarette \ntrafficking investigations are growing more and more complex, and take \nlonger to resolve. More people are selling cigarettes illegally, and \nthey are getting better at it. As these cases become more difficult to \ncrack, we owe it to law enforcement officials to do our part to lend a \nhelping hand. The PACT Act does that by enhancing BATFE's authority to \nenter premises to investigate and enforce cigarette trafficking laws. \nIt also increases penalties for cigarette trafficking. Unless these \nexisting laws are strengthened, traffickers will continue to operate \nwith near impunity.\n  Just as important, though, we must enable our country's law \nenforcement officials to combat the cigarette smugglers of the 21st \ncentury. The internet represents a new obstacle to enforcement. Illegal \ntobacco vendors around the world evade detection by conducting \ntransactions over the internet, and then shipping their illegal \nproducts around the country to consumers. Just a few years ago, there \nwere less than 100 vendors selling cigarettes online. Today, \napproximately 500 vendors sell illegal tobacco products over the \ninternet.\n  Without new and innovative enforcement methods, law enforcement will \nnot be able to effectively address the growing challenges facing them \ntoday. The PACT Act sets out to do just that by empowering States to go \nafter out-of-State sellers who are violating their tax laws and by \ncutting off their method of delivery. A significant part of this \nproblem involves the shipment of contraband cigarettes through the \nUnited States Postal Service (USPS). This bill would cut off online \nvendors' access to the USPS. We would treat cigarettes just like we \ntreat alcohol, making it illegal to ship them through the U.S. mails \nand cutting off a large portion of the delivery system.\n  In addition, it would facilitate cooperation between law enforcement \nand private carriers, who are sometimes the unwitting delivery arm of \nthese tobacco traffickers. The bill authorizes the Attorney General to \ncompile a list of sellers who are engaging in illegal cigarette sales, \nand that list would be distributed to private carriers, like UPS and \nFedEx. Providing this information to these companies, who have already \nbegun to cooperate with law enforcement in this area, would then be \nempowered to cut off shipments for those of their customers\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\nwho are engaging in tobacco smuggling.\n  The PACT Act is a comprehensive bill to put these illegal smugglers \nout of business. It enjoys the strong support of tobacco companies, law \nenforcement officials, and the public health community. The bill \ncontains important authorities that will enable our federal, state, and \nlocal law enforcement officials to crack down on cigarette trafficking, \nand thereby close off a very lucrative funding stream for international \nterrorist groups and other criminal enterprises. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1027\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to provide \nincentives to landowners to protect and improve streams and riparian \nhabitat; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill that amends the \nFood Security Act of 1985 to provide incentives for landowners to \nprotect and improve streams and riparian habitat. This legislation \nwould provide cost-share payments to landowners who protect and repair \nstreamside and in-stream habitat, improve water flow and quality and \ninitiate watershed management and planning.\n  The Stream Habitat Improvement Program, funded at $60 million \nannually, would direct resources to important fish habitat projects. \nThe fisheries community has recognized the loss of habitat as a major \nthreat to the health of sport fish populations. Farmers who participate \nin the program will make improvements on streams running through their \nproperty. Improvements could include repairing shoreline, removing \nbarriers to fish passage, and planting trees to shade the water and \nstrengthen stream banks. Further, existing partnerships, such as the \nNational Fish Habitat Action Plan, could provide invaluable input to \nguide the program.\n  Healthy fisheries mean healthy communities. The EPA and the Fish and \nWildlife Service have found that 81 percent of all stream fish \ncommunities in the U.S. have been adversely affected by either \npollution or other disturbances. Rivers and streams provide essential \nhabitat for numerous plant and animal species. Many of these species \nare threatened, endangered, or at risk for extinction. Degraded and \naltered habitats are the most frequently cited factors contributing to \nthe decline among threatened or endangered aquatic species and among \nmany native recreational and non-game fish species.\n  In Wisconsin alone there are almost 950,000 anglers, and almost half \na million more come from out of State to fish in Wisconsin. Together \nthese anglers spend $1 billion on fishing-related expenses in our \nState. This new program would advance efforts to support stream habitat \nrestoration more effectively, which in turn will support a thriving \neconomy and aquatic species populations. Further, healthy stream and \nriver habitats also play an important role in the Nation's economy. \nEach year, about 34 million anglers spend $17 billion directly on \nfishing equipment and another $15 billion on trip-related expenses, \nfood and lodging, and other recreational fishing-related expenses.\n  Successful management of stream and river habitat requires \ncooperative partnerships among producers, landowners, as well as \nFederal and State agencies. Offering producers and private landowners \nincentives and opportunities for restoring stream habitat will prevent \nthe decline and listing of aquatic species. Building strong \nrelationships between farm owners, private landowners and the angler \ncommunity ensures that healthy fisheries will be maintained for future \ngenerations to enjoy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1033. A bill to assist in the conservation of rare felids and rare \ncanids by supporting and providing financial resources for the \nconservation programs of nations within the range of rare felid and \nrare canid populations and projects of persons with demonstrated \nexpertise in the conservation of rare felid and rare canid populations; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, along with my friend Senator Sam \nBrownback, I am introducing the Great Cats and Rare Canids Act, which \nwill protect and foster populations of imperiled great cats and rare \ncanines outside of North America.\n  These species, including the cheetah and the Asiatic wild dog, are \nthreatened by habitat loss, poaching, disease, and pollution. The \nconservation fund established by the bill we are introducing today \nwould sustain current conservation efforts and expand strategic \nmeasures to restore imperiled populations.\n  The struggle of the African wild dog is one example of the plight \nthese large carnivores face. The less than 2,500 adults that remain not \nonly have to combat the widespread misconception that they are \nlivestock killers, but are extremely susceptible to those diseases \ncommon in domesticated animals. They have lost 89 percent of their \nhabitat and are now found in only 14 of the 39 countries that comprise \ntheir historic range.\n  The snow leopard is another example. Like all great cats, the snow \nleopard needs a large tract of uninterrupted land in which to live, but \nthe snow leopard's habitat in China has been fragmented due to human \nencroachment. The cats are also under extreme poaching pressures as \ntheir fur is sold on the black market.\n  The bill we are introducing today would help protect these predators \nat the top of the food chain. Our legislation is modeled after the \nhighly successful Multinational Species Conservation Funds, which \nconserve rhinos, great apes, Asian elephants, African elephants, and \nmarine turtles. Our bill would authorize $5 million in annual spending \nfor the conservation of more than a dozen species of great cats and \nrare canines.\n  I do not think our children and grandchildren will forgive us if we \nstand by and let these magnificent animals drift into extinction. With \na relatively small investment, we can invigorate ongoing conservation \nefforts around the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1035.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \nhuman cloning; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on bipartisan \nlegislation that Senator Landrieu and myself are introducing, the Human \nCloning Prohibition Act. We do this today with 26 other cosponsors. It \nis important to talk about this matter as we set up for the bioethical \ndebate which will be taking place after Easter and discuss some of the \nparameters and issues surrounding this topic. We have a continuum of \ndiscussion points, as this body and the rest of the country and, \nindeed, the world is engaged on the subject.\n  There is an ethical way to move forward on stem cell research that is \nproducing treatments and applications for human maladies, now in over \n70 areas. The science continues to grow, and it is promising. I have \nheld press conferences involving people with spinal cord injuries who \ncould not walk and are walking again with the aid of braces. I have \nhosted people at press conferences who are suffering from congestive \nheart failure yet are now able to go up flights of stairs they couldn't \neven imagine previously with treatments utilizing their own adult stem \ncells. I have visited with cancer patients who have been treated with \ncord blood stem cells who are cancer-free now.\n  We have new discoveries taking place. For example, in the amniotic \nfluid surrounding the child in the womb exists an abundant supply of \nstem cells that are malleable into many different types of cells. We \njust learned about this breakthrough less than 6 months ago, and there \nare no ethical problems with it whatsoever. It is a beautiful science \nthat is developing. In the near future, I believe we are going to see \nthese adult stem cell advances taking root and moving forward in a \nglorious fashion: so that people can literally walk again who were not \nable to walk; so that people can literally be cured of heart conditions \nwho had no cure and were only hoping for the possibility of a \ntransplant; so that people, instead of having a mechanical bladder \ncontrol on their side, are able to have a bladder grown of their own \nadult stem cells around a matrix and a frame that can be inserted back \nin the body that would be functioning again. The science is beautiful.\n  The ethical quagmire is significant as well: if we decide the route \nto pursue is to clone human beings; if we decide the route to pursue is \nto treat some humans as property, as a commodity to be researched and \nto be used. Human cloning and treating some humans as property are not \nthe way to go.\n  What we are seeing from the clear science that has taken place in the \npast and the present is that human embryonic stem cells produce tumors. \nThis has occurred in cloning situations and in noncloning embryonic \nstem cell situations. Embryonic stem cells produce tumors. A tumor in \nthis situation is a growth of tissue that doesn't fit the intended \npurpose. Scientists are experiencing significant problems in this \nembryonic area. While we are developing treatments and applications \nusing adult stem cells, cord blood, and, hopefully in the future, \namniotic fluid, we are not seeing the same success using human \nembryonic cells.\n  The legislation that we put forward today, with 28 sponsors, would \naffirm that the United States places tremendous value on the dignity of \neach and every human life at whatever stage that life is in, from the \nvery earliest moments to the very end of life. It would recognize the \ndignity of human life in this country and around the world. We don't \nwant to see people recruiting women in a foreign country to give eggs \non a massive scale for research purposes for the development of human \nclones. This legislation affirms that we stand for human dignity, from \nthe very young human embryo to vulnerable women who could be coerced \ninto donating eggs at potentially significant health risk to \nthemselves. The legislation would make clear that the cloning of human \npersons is not something that we as a society will accept.\n  The Brownback-Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act is endorsed by \nthe President. It will bring the United States into conformity with the \nUnited Nations, whose General Assembly called on all member states ``to \nprohibit all forms of human cloning'' by a strong 84-to-34 margin. The \nproblem with cloning human beings is that it violates the inherent \ndignity of a human being on so many levels. Cloning transgresses our \nheritage's sacred values about what is good and what is true and what \nis beautiful.\n  Western civilization is built on the tenet that every human life has \nimmeasurable value at every stage. Human beings are ends in themselves. \nIt is wrong to use any human purpose as a means to an end. Upon this \nprinciple are our laws founded. Without this principle, much of our law \nhas little basis. That inherent beauty and dignity of each person at \nevery phase of life, no matter where they are or who they are, no \nmatter what they look like, no matter what their physical condition is, \nthey are beautiful and unique. They are sacred. They are a child of a \nloving God, period.\n  Human cloning for whatever purpose is wrong because it turns humans \ninto commodities or spare parts or even research animals. In recent \ndebate, human cloning has been referred to as therapeutic cloning, \nresearch cloning, or simply SCNT, somatic cell nuclear transfer. These \nare presented as contrasts to reproductive cloning. But it should be \nnoted that ``therapeutic,'' ``research,'' and ``reproductive'' are \nmerely adjectives used to describe what is done with a human clone or \nwith a cloned human. SCNT is just the scientific description of the \ncloning process. It is like calling a butterfly a lepidoptera--it still \nis a butterfly.\n  A CRS report for Congress notes:\n\n       [A] human embryo produced via cloning involves the process \n     called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In SCNT the \n     nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus \n     from a mature body cell, such as a skin cell. In cloning, \n     the embryo is created without sexual reproduction.\n\n  That is the CRS report definition of a human clone.\n  Stem cell pioneer Dr. James Thomson has said:\n\n       If you create an embryo by [SCNT cloning] and give it to \n     somebody who didn't know where it came from, there would be \n     no test you could do to that embryo to say where it came \n     from. It is what it is. . . .If you try to define it away, \n     you're being disingenuous.\n\n  These quotes note that the SCNT process is cloning.\n  With reproductive and therapeutic cloning, human beings are turned \ninto commodities or in some cases spare parts to be dissected in the \nlaboratory, with the claim that some day they may be administered to \nother humans to\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\nprovide a treatment. Treatments are praiseworthy but not at the expense \nof the destruction of other members of the human family. We all want to \ntreat people. I want to find a cure for cancer. However, it is wrong to \nturn humans into a means to an end.\n  It is also wrong to exploit women for their eggs. That is the other \nside of the human cloning story. SCNT cloning, as proposed by \nproponents of the technique, would require millions of human eggs. Poor \nand disadvantaged women in particular would be vulnerable to \nexploitation via financial incentives for donation. This is troubling \nbecause retrieving such eggs violates the dignity of a woman and may \ncause serious harm to her health.\n  The Brownback-Landrieu Human Cloning Prohibition Act is the only \neffective ban on human cloning. Any other so-called human cloning bans \noutside of this one are bans in name only and, in fact, most of them \nprovide for human cloning for research purposes. So, under other bans, \nyou can actually create a clone. They won't call it a clone; they will \ncall it a product of SCNT. They will say you may create and do research \non the clone; we just won't let you implant it. What is the clone, \nthen, at that point in time? Is it in the human species at that point? \nIs it genetic material at that point in time? Indeed, it is. \nBiologically, it is a human.\n  Others would only regulate what could be done with a human clone, \nnormally requiring its destruction, but they do nothing to prevent the \nprocess of human cloning, which inherently violates human dignity. We \nshould take a stand against turning young humans into commodities, \nresearch animals, and spare parts. We should not destroy young human \nlives for research purposes.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to support this human cloning \nprohibition ban.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1038. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nworkplace health incentives by equalizing the tax consequences of \nemployee athletic facility use; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Workforce Health \nImprovement Program Act of 2007, otherwise known as the WHIP Act. This \nbipartisan bill I introduce today is the same legislation I introduced \nin the 109th Congress. I am very pleased to be joined again by my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, who shares my commitment to \nhelping keep America fit.\n  Public health experts unanimously agree that people who maintain \nactive and healthy lifestyles dramatically reduce their risk of \ncontracting chronic diseases. And as the government works to reign in \nthe high cost of health care, it is worth talking about what we all can \ndo to help ourselves. As you know, prevention is key, and exercise is a \nprimary component in the prevention of many adverse health conditions \nthat can arise over one's lifetime. A physically fit population helps \nto decrease health-care costs, reduce governmental spending, reduce \nillnesses, and improve worker productivity.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \nthe economic cost alone to businesses in the form of health insurance \nand absenteeism is more that $15 billion. Additionally, Medicare and \nMedicaid programs currently spend $84 billion annually on five major \nchronic diseases: diabetes, heart disease, depression, cancer, and \narthritis.\n  Reports also show that only about 15 percent of adults perform the \nrecommended amount of physical activity, and 40 percent of adults do \nnot participate in any physical activity. With physical inactivity \nbeing a key contributing factor to overweight and obesity, and \nadversely affecting workforce productivity, we quite simply need to do \nmore to help employers encourage exercise.\n  Given the tremendous benefits exercise provides, I believe Congress \nhas a duty to create as many incentives as possible to get Americans \noff the couch, up, and moving.\n  With this in mind, I am introducing the WHIP Act.\n  Current law already permits businesses to deduct the cost of on-site \nworkout facilities, which are provided for the benefit of employees on \na pre-tax basis. But if a business wants or needs to outsource these \nhealth benefits, they and/or their employees are required to bear the \nfull cost. In other words, employees who receive off-site fitness \ncenter subsidies are required to pay income tax on the benefits, and \ntheir employers bear the associated administrative costs of complying \nwith the IRS rules.\n  The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the tax code to the \nbenefit of many smaller businesses and their employees. Specifically, \nit would provide an employer's right to deduct up to $900 of the cost \nof providing health club benefits off-site for their employees. In \naddition, the employer's contribution to the cost of the health club \nfees would not be taxable income for employees creating an incentive \nfor more employers to contribute to the health and welfare of their \nemployees.\n  The WHIP Act is an important step in reversing the largely \npreventable health crisis that our country is facing, through the \npromotion of physical activity and disease prevention. It is a critical \ncomponent of America's health care policy: prevention. It will improve \nour nation's quality of life by promoting physical activity and \npreventing disease. Additionally, it will help relieve pressure on a \nstrained health care system and correct an inequity in the current tax \ncode.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to \nestablish an efficient system to enable employees to form, join, or \nassist labor organizations, to provide or mandatory injunctions for \nunfair labor practices during organizing efforts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for far too long, we've acquiesced in a \nlop-sided economy that benefits wealthy individuals and corporations, \nbut not America's working families. Tens of millions of our men and \nwomen are working harder than ever, but they aren't receiving their \nfair share of the economy they helped do so much to create and sustain.\n  Since President Bush took office, corporate profits have increased 65 \npercent. Productivity is up 18 percent. But household income has \ndeclined; the wages of working Americans are stagnant. Six million have \nlost their health insurance. Their retirement is uncertain as well--\nonly 1 in 5 workers today has a guaranteed pension. In short, working \nfamilies are finding that the American dream is beyond their reach. \nThis injustice is worsening each year, and it is time for Congress to \ndeal with it.\n  The best way to see that employees receive their fair share of \nAmerica's prosperity is to give them a stronger voice in the workplace. \nUnions were fundamental in building America's middle class, and they \nhave a vital role today in preserving the American dream for working \nfamilies.\n  Unions can make all the difference between an economy that's fair, \nand an economy where working people are left behind. Union wages are 30 \npercent higher than non-union wages. 80 percent of union workers have \nhealth insurance, compared to only 49 percent of non-union workers. \nUnion members are 4 times more likely to have a secure, guaranteed \npension.\n  No wonder most American workers want union representation. The \nquestion is, why don't more of them have it?\n  The reason is clear. In 2005 alone, more than 30,000 workers were \nillegally fired or retaliated against for attempting to exercise their \nright to have a union in their workplace. Every 17 minutes, a worker is \nfired or punished in some illegal way for supporting a union. \nUnscrupulous employers routinely break the law to keep unions out--they \nintimidate employees, harass them, and discriminate against them. They \nshut down whole departments--or even entire plants--to avoid \nnegotiating a union contract. It's illegal and unacceptable, but it \nhappens every day.\n  Clearly, the current system is broken. It can't stop these illegal, \nanti-worker, anti-labor, anti-union tactics that take place every day. \nThe penalties are so minor that employers treat them as just another \ncost of doing business. Even when workers succeed in forming a union, \nthey often can't obtain a first contract because management stonewalls \nthem and refuses to negotiate. Half of all cases alleging that \nemployers refused to bargain are filed during first-contract \nnegotiations--and in most of those cases, the National Labor Relations \nBoard finds an unfair labor practice.\n  Year after year, Congress has refused to act against these union-\nbusting tactics that are now all too familiar in the workplace. It's \ntime to listen to the voice of America's working men and women, and \ngive them what they want and deserve--a fair voice in the workplace and \na fair chance at the American dream.\n  That's why I'm reintroducing the Employee Free Choice Act today. This \nessential legislation will strengthen protections for workers' freedom \nto choose union representation. It will restore their democratic right \nto join together for better wages, better benefits, and better working \nconditions. It will help millions of working men and women to build a \nbetter life for themselves and a better future for their children.\n  I am proud to have 46 of my fellow Senators joining me in sponsoring \nthis important bill, and I hope that all of my colleagues will support \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nsubmit a report to Congress on proposed changes to the use of the West \nLos Angeles Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, California; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto ensure that the land on the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs, West \nLA VA, campus is protected for the use of America's Veterans.\n  The bill would: require the VA Secretary to provide the Congressional \nAppropriations and Veterans Committees a comprehensive report regarding \nthe master plan for the West LA VA facility and connected property.\n  The VA was required under Public Law 105-368 to develop a master plan \nfor the West LA VA property.\n  If the VA has failed to developed the plan, the legislation requires \nit to complete a master plan prior to implementing any action based on \nthe Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) initiative.\n  The VA would be prohibited from issuing any enhanced-use lease \nagreements for the West LA VA property until the master plan is \ncompleted and submitted to Congress.\n  Prevent the VA Secretary from implementing any portion of the master \nplan until 120 days after the submission of the plan to the \nAppropriations and Veterans Committees.\n  In addition, the Secretary would be expressly prohibited from \npursuing development initiatives regarding the West LA VA property not \nrelating to direct Veterans services unless explicitly authorized by \nCongress through legislation.\n  Direct Veterans services are defined in this legislation as any \nservices ``directly related'' to maintaining the health, welfare, and \nsupport of Veterans.\n  Last year, the Senate approved similar language in the FY07 MILCON/VA \nAppropriations bill that required the VA to provide the Appropriations \nCommittees a report on the master plan for the West LA VA Medical \nCenter and connected land.\n  The fiscal year 2007 MILCON/VA Appropriations Act passed the Senate \non November 18, 2006.\n  Unfortunately, all but 2 of the 11 Appropriations bills--including \nMILCON/VA--were ultimately packaged together in a Continuing Resolution \nfor fiscal year 2007, and the language was never considered by the full \nCongress.\n  The bill I am introducing today is absolutely essential in light of a \nnumber of unacceptable actions that have previously been taken by the \nVA that, in my view, violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.\n  Last month, I joined with my colleagues Senator Barbara Boxer and \nCongressman Henry Waxman in writing a letter to VA Secretary James \nNicholson strongly objecting to recent decisions by the VA relating to \nthe West LA VA facility and land.\n  Over the past year alone, the VA has permitted the construction of a \nfacility for the Fox Entertainment Group on the West LA VA property, \nand has approved a lease agreement with Enterprise Car Rental to \noperate on the campus.\n  In addition, the VA has allowed the Westside Shepherd of the Hill \nChurch to rent a building on the property in which to hold its Sunday \nservices and provided additional housing space for the University of \nCalifornia-Los Angeles (UCLA).\n  The VA reportedly has also considered lease projects such as movie \nproductions, a drive-in theather, a circus event, and a golf course.\n  This must be put to a stop and the legislation I introduce today \nwould do just that.\n  For too long, commercial interests have trumped the needs of our \nVeterans.\n  These 400 acres of land were donated to the government in 1888 \nspecifically for Veterans and should remain that way--just as then-VA \nSecretary Anthony Principi promised during a visit to Los Angeles in \nFebruary 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1043\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the medical care of members of the Armed \nForces and veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity today \nto introduce an important piece of legislation to improve the ability \nof the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide medical care for our Nation's Armed Forces and veterans. We are \ncurrently finishing up a debate in the Senate on additional war time \nfunding for Iraq. As in past years, we are trying to mitigate the \ndamage caused by the failure to properly plan for and manage the \naftermath of Saddam Hussein's fall. I have spoken many times about how \ndamaging this lack of planning has been to our efforts in Iraq and to \nour standing in the world.\n  For the past two months, the spotlight has shone on another \nadministration failure in this war: the shameful conditions our wounded \nsoldiers face as outpatients navigating the military health system when \nthey return from Iraq or Afghanistan. This is another example of gross \nmismanagement and a strained system. To alleviate the strain on this \nsystem, I am offering legislation today--the Effective Care for the \nArmed Forces and Veterans Act--to improve the care that members of the \nArmed Forces and veterans receive at Walter Reed and other military \nmedical facilities.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that some of the reasons \nfor concern at Walter Reed do not occur in the future. As the living \nconditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center indicate, \nmoving to private contracts for maintenance at military medical \nfacilities can cause problems. After a private contract was awarded for \nmaintenance and upkeep of buildings on the campus of Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center, a maintenance crew of approximately 300 was whittled \ndown to 50 by the time the contract went in to effect. Many of the \nterrible living conditions in Building 18 that we read about in the \nWashington Post were a direct result of delays in building repair and \nmaintenance because of a shortage in manpower. To prevent this \nsituation from occurring again, this legislation calls for public-\nprivate competitions of maintenance services at military medical \ncomplexes to stop while our country is engaged in military conflicts. \nIt also calls for a General Accountability Office review of \ncontracting-out decisions for basic maintenance work at military \nfacilities.\n  Other problems discovered at Walter Reed are directly attributable to \nshortages resulting from pressures to cut budgets for military medical \nservices. These cuts cannot be tolerated at a time when military \nmedical services are needed to treat servicemembers who have been \nwounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. As such, this legislation would \nrequire medical command budgets to be equal to or exceed the prior year \namount while the nation is involved in a major military conflict or \nwar.\n  Another issue that the conditions at Walter Reed brought up is \nwhether or not the facility should be closed as the Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission recommended. The Commission recommended building \nnew, modern facilities at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda \nand at Fort Belvoir to improve the overall quality of care and access \nto care in this region. Military leaders have indicated that the \nplanned closure has limited their ability to attract needed \nprofessionals to jobs at Walter Reed and there have been concerns \nraised whether adequate housing for the families of the wounded has \nbeen properly planned. To deal with that, this legislation requires the \nDepartment of Defense to submit to Congress within one year a detailed \nplan that includes an evaluation of the following: the desirability of \nbeing able to guarantee professional jobs in the D.C. area for two \nyears or more following the closure in order to foster a stable \nworkforce; detailed construction plans for the new facilities and for \nnew family housing; and the costs and benefits of building all of the \nneeded medical treatment, rehabilitation, and housing before a single \nunit is moved.\n  Another major problem and source of frustration for injured soldiers \nis the length of time it takes to receive a disability determination. \nIn order to hasten the disability determination process, we need to \nensure that the Department of Defense has information systems capable \nof communicating with those in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \nVA has been a leader in implementing electronic medical record keeping, \nbut we have to improve the capability of the Department of Defense to \nsend electronic medical records to the VA to speed up the disability \ndetermination process. Making the disability determination system more \nefficient can reduce the stress on the soldiers and their families \ngoing through the determination process.\n  Caseworkers are also critical. They schedule appointments and make \nsure wounded servicemembers get the rehabilitative and follow-up care \nthey need. As more and more soldiers and marines come home wounded, \nmany military caseworkers are overwhelmed. To improve the care given to \nservicemembers, this legislation requires a minimum ratio of case \nmanagers to patients of 1 to 20, that case managers have contact with \nrecovering servicemembers at least once a week, and that case managers \nbe properly trained on the military's disability and discharge systems \nso they can better assist patients with their paperwork.\n  Currently, many combat veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan \nhave service-related mental health issues like post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Many have labeled TBI \nthe ``signature injury'' of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. It is \nestimated that as many as 10 percent of those serving or who have \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan have brain injuries. That\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nwould mean about 150,000 of the 1.5 million soldiers and marines who \nhave served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom \nhave suffered a brain injury. In many cases, these injuries are not \ndiagnosed because there is not an external wound. Depending on the \nseverity of these injuries, returning soldiers can require immediate \ntreatment or not have symptoms show up until several years later. This \nlegislation calls for every returning soldier to be screened for TBI. \nWhile the VA has announced plans to do this, it needs to happen in \nactive-duty military medical facilities too. In addition, the \nlegislation calls for a study on the advisability of treating TBI as a \npresumptive condition in every service's disability evaluation system, \nas well as the VA disability evaluation system.\n  We often hear about the 25,000 soldiers and marines who have been \nwounded in these wars--but that figure grossly underestimates the \ndemand that the VA health care system faces. Since our country was \nattacked on September 11, 2001, more than 1.5 million soldiers have \nbeen deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other locations. Of these, \n630,000 are now veterans and, according to the Department of Defense, \nmore than 205,000 have already received medical treatment through the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. A recent Harvard study on the long-term \ncosts of treating these new veterans estimates that by 2012 more than \n643,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan will be using the VA system, \nan almost three-fold increase of what the system faces now. With a \nsignificant backlog of claims currently existing, the system is in \ndesperate need of an upgrade. To address this concern, my legislation \ndirects the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a plan \nfor the long-term care needs for veterans for the next 50 years.\n  It is our highest obligation to heal the hundreds of thousands of \nbrave men and women who will bear the physical and emotional scars of \nthese wars for the rest of their lives. Those of us who have the \nprivilege of serving in Congress must act now to improve the medical \ncare we provide to our Armed Forces and veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LIMITATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATION TO \n                   CLOSE WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The final recommendations of the Defense Base Closure \n     and Realignment Commission under the 2005 round of defense \n     base closure and realignment include recommendations to close \n     Walter Reed Army Medical Center and to build new, modern \n     facilities at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda \n     and at Fort Belvoir to improve the overall quality of and \n     access to health care for members of the Armed Forces.\n       (2) These recommendations include the transfer of medical \n     services from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the \n     National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort \n     Belvoir, but they do not adequately provide for housing for \n     the families of wounded members of the Armed Forces who will \n     receive treatment at such new facilities.\n       (3) The recommended closure of the Walter Reed Army Medical \n     Center has impaired the ability of the Secretary of Defense \n     to attract the personnel required to provide proper medical \n     services at such medical center.\n       (b) Limitation on Implementation of Recommendations.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall not take any action to implement \n     the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission under the 2005 round of defense base \n     closure and realignment relating to the transfer of medical \n     services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the National \n     Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir during \n     the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act \n     and ending on the date that is 60 days after the date on \n     which Congress receives the plan required under subsection \n     (c).\n       (c) Plan Required.--Not later than one year after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to Congress a plan that includes an assessment of the \n     following:\n       (1) The feasibility and advisability of providing current \n     or prospective employees at Walter Reed Army Medical Center a \n     guarantee that their employment will continue in the \n     Washington, DC, metropolitan area for more than two years \n     after the date on which Walter Reed Army Medical Center is \n     closed.\n       (2) Detailed construction plans for new medical facilities \n     and family housing at the National Naval Medical Center at \n     Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir to accommodate the transfer of \n     medical services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the \n     National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort \n     Belvoir.\n       (3) The costs, feasibility, and advisability of completing \n     all of the construction planned for the transfer of medical \n     services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the National \n     Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and at Fort Belvoir before \n     any patients are transferred to such new facilities from \n     Walter Reed Army Medical Center as a result of the \n     recommendations of the Defense Base\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\n     Closure and Realignment Commission under the 2005 round of \n     defense base closure and realignment.\n\n     SEC. 5. IMPROVING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Case managers are important for scheduling appointments \n     and making sure recovering servicemembers get the care they \n     need.\n       (2) Many case managers are overwhelmed by the large number \n     of wounded members of the Armed Forces returning from \n     deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (3) Regular contact between health care providers and \n     members of the Armed Forces returning from deployment is \n     important for the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder \n     in such members.\n       (4) It is inappropriate to require a wounded member of the \n     Armed Forces or a family member of such member to provide a \n     photo or a medal from deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan to \n     prove that such member served in and was injured from such \n     deployment.\n       (5) Case managers are well qualified to assist recovering \n     servicemembers and their families with the disability \n     evaluation system and discharge procedures of the Department \n     of Defense.\n       (b) Case Managers.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall assign at \n     least one case manager for every 20 recovering servicemembers \n     to assist in the recovery of such recovering servicemember.\n       (2) Minimum contact.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure \n     that case managers contact each of their assigned recovering \n     servicemembers not less than once per week.\n       (3) Training.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that \n     case managers of the Department of Defense are familiar with \n     the disability and discharge system of the Department of \n     Defense and that such case managers are able to assist \n     recovering servicemembers complete necessary and related \n     forms.\n       (c) Recovering Servicemember.--In this section, the term \n     ``recovering servicemember'' means a member of the Armed \n     Forces, including a member of the National Guard or a \n     Reserve, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, \n     or therapy, or is otherwise in medical hold or holdover \n     status, for an injury, illness, or disease incurred or \n     aggravated while on active duty in the Armed Forces.\n\n     SEC. 6. SCREENING FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Many of the members of the Armed Forces deployed in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan have brain injuries.\n       (2) In many cases, such injuries are not diagnosed because \n     there is no external indication of such injury.\n       (3) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs carries out programs \n     to screen all recent combat veterans for traumatic brain \n     injury; the Secretary of Defense does not do so.\n       (b) Screening Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     screen every member of the Armed Forces returning from \n     deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring \n     Freedom for traumatic brain injury upon the return of each \n     such member.\n       (c) Studies on Treating Traumatic Brain Injury as \n     Presumptive Condition for Disability Compensation.--\n       (1) Study by secretary of defense.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a \n     study on the feasability and advisability of treating \n     traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition for members \n     of the Armed Forces who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or \n     Operation Enduring Freedom for the qualification for \n     disability compensation under laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (B) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the results of the study required by \n     subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Study by secretary of veterans affairs.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     conduct a study on the feasability and advisability of \n     treating traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition \n     for veterans who served as members of the Armed Forces in \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom for the \n     qualification for disability compensation under laws \n     administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n       (B) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the study \n     required by subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Study by director of national institutes of health.--\n       (A) In general.--The Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health shall conduct a study on traumatic brain injury, \n     including the detection of traumatic brain injury and the \n     measurement and classification of the severity of traumatic \n     brain injury.\n       (B) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     results of the study required by subparagraph (A).\n\n     SEC. 7.

A bill to strengthen performance management in the Federal \nGovernment, to make the annual general pay increase for Federal \nemployees contingent on performance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 1046. A bill to modify pay provisions relating to certain senior-\nlevel positions in the Federal Government, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1047. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income amounts paid on behalf of Federal employees and \nmembers of the Armed Forces on active duty under Federal student loan \nrepayment programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three \nimportant pieces of legislation that I believe will improve the ability \nof the Federal Government to recruit and retain a world class \nworkforce: the Federal Workforce Performance Appraisal and Management \nImprovement Act, the Senior Professional Performance Act, and the \nGenerating Opportunity by Forgiving Educational Debt for Service Act.\n  As my colleagues know, my interest in the Federal workforce developed \nafter working with the Federal Government for 18 years, for 10 years as \nmayor of Cleveland and 8 years as Governor of Ohio. Through my work on \nthe Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce and the District of Columbia, I continue to observe that \ninvesting in personnel and workforce management, and management in \ngeneral, struggles to be a priority in the Federal Government. My own \nexperience as county auditor, county commissioner, mayor, and Governor \nhas taught me that, of all the things in which government can invest, \nresources dedicated to human capital bring the greatest return.\n  Effective performance management is fundamental to building a \nresults-oriented culture. In fact, the Merit\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\nSystems Protection Board just published a report entitled, \n``Accomplishing Our Mission: Results of the Merit Principles Survey \n2005.'' In that report, the MSPB found that, ``Nonsupervisory employees \nfeel uninformed about performance evaluation, organizational changes, \nand other issues at times.'' The Federal Workforce Performance \nAppraisal and Management Improvement Act that I am introducing today \nwill help address that problem. By requiring supervisors and employees \nto have regular conversations about expectations and job performance, \nevery employee will understand how their job performance is perceived \nby their boss and, more importantly, how individual work contributes to \nthe agency's mission. In addition, this legislation would prohibit an \nemployee who receives an unacceptable performance evaluation from \nreceiving an annual salary adjustment. Mr. President, I know that \nFederal employees are dedicated and talented individuals. I know some \nmay view this as a critique on the contributions of our civil servants; \nhowever, that could not be further from the truth. This bill recognizes \ntheir daily contributions.\n  As I said last year when I first introduced this legislation, \nemployees should receive annually a rigorous evaluation. Pay should be \ndetermined by an individual's performance. I agree with the observation \nof Comptroller General David Walker that the passage of time should not \nbe the single most important factor in determining an employee's pay. \nInstead, it should be determined by the productivity, effectiveness, \nand the contributions of an employee.\n  Today I also am pleased to introduce the Senior Professional \nPerformance Act. In 2003, Congress enacted legislation to reform the \npay and performance management systems for the Senior Executive \nService. The legislation I introduce today would authorize agencies to \ndevelop and implement similar pay and performance management systems \nfor senior level and scientific and professional personnel in order to \nkeep these talented and capable employees on equal footing.\n  Finally, today I am introducing Generating Opportunity by Forgiving \nEducational Debt for Service Act, or GOFEDS, a bill that will help \nFederal agencies and the Armed Forces recruit talented individuals to \nserve in all areas of the Federal Government and the military. Current \nlaw--authorizes Federal agencies to pay student loans up to $10,000 a \nyear with a cumulative cap of $60,000, but the incentive is taxed. The \nActive-Duty Educational Loan Repayment Program allows the Services to \nrepay certain federally guaranteed educational loans for enlistments in \nmilitary specialties designated by the Service Secretary. GOFEDS would \namend the Federal tax code to allow the Federal Government's student \nloan repayment programs to be offered on a tax-free basis. The \npotential impact of this bill far outweighs its minimal cost.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Kohl, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cardin, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1048. A bill to assist in the conservation of cranes by supporting \nand providing, through projects of persons and organizations with \nexpertise in crane conservation, financial resouces for the \nconservation programs of countries that activities of which directly or \nindirectly affect cranes and the ecosystems of cranes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Crane Conservation \nAct of 2007. I am very pleased that the Senators from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, \nFlorida, Mr. Martinez, Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, Maryland, Mr. Cardin, and \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, have joined me as cosponsors of this bill. I \npropose this legislation in the hope that Congress will do its part to \nprotect the existence of these birds, whose cultural significance and \npopular appeal can be seen worldwide. This legislation is particularly \nimportant to the people of Wisconsin, as our State provides habitat and \nrefuge to several crane species. But this legislation, which authorizes \nthe United States Fish and Wildlife Service to distribute funds and \ngrants to crane conservation efforts both domestically and in \ndeveloping countries, promises to have a larger environmental and \ncultural impact that will go far beyond the boundaries of my home \nstate. This bill is similar to legislation that I introduced in the \n107th, 108th, and 109th Congresses.\n  In October of 1994, Congress passed and the President signed the \nRhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The passage of this act provided \nsupport for multinational rhino and tiger conservation through the \ncreation of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund, or RTCF. \nAdministered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the RTCF \ndistributes up to $10 million in grants every year to conservation \ngroups to support projects in developing countries. Since its \nestablishment in 1994, the RTCF has been expanded by Congress to cover \nother species, such as elephants and great apes.\n  Today, with the legislation I am introducing, I am asking Congress to \nadd cranes to this list. Cranes are the most endangered family of birds \nin the world, with 11 of the world's 15 species at risk of extinction. \nSpecifically, this legislation would authorize up to $5 million of \nfunds per year to be distributed in the form of conservation project \ngrants to protect cranes and their habitat. The financial resources \nauthorized by this bill can be made available to qualifying \nconservation groups operating in Asia, Africa, and North America. The \nprogram is authorized from Fiscal Year 2008 through Fiscal Year 2012.\n  In keeping with my belief that we should balance the budget, this \nbill proposes that the $25 million in authorized spending over 5 years \nfor the Crane Conservation Act established in this legislation should \nbe offset through the Secretary of the Interior's administrative \nbudget. The Secretary of the Interior would be required to transfer any \nfunds it does not expend under the Crane Conservation Act back to the \nTreasury at the end of fiscal year 2012.\n  I am offering this legislation due to the serious and significant \ndecline that can be expected in crane populations worldwide without \nfurther conservation efforts. Those efforts have achieved some success \nin the case of the North American whooping crane, the rarest crane on \nearth. In 1941, only 21 whooping cranes existed in the entire world. \nThis stands in contrast to the over 450 birds in existence today. The \nNorth American whooping crane's resurgence is attributed to the bird's \ntenacity for survival and to the efforts of conservationists in the \nUnited States and Canada. Today, the only wild flock of North American \nwhooping cranes breeds in northwest Canada, and spends its winters in \ncoastal Texas. A new flock of cranes is currently being reintroduced to \nthe wild in an eastern flyway from Wisconsin to Florida.\n  The movement of this flock of birds shows how any effort by Congress \nto regulate crane conservation needs to cross both national and \ninternational lines. As this flock of birds makes its journey from \nWisconsin to Florida, the birds rely on the ecosystems of a multitude \nof states in this country. In its journey from the Necedah National \nWildlife Refuge in Wisconsin to the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife \nRefuge in Florida in the fall and eventual return to my home State in \nthe spring, this flock also faces threats from pollution of traditional \nwatering grounds, collision with utility lines, human disturbance, \ndisease, predation, loss of genetic diversity within the population, \nand vulnerability to catastrophes, both natural and man-made.\n  The birds also rely on private landowners, the vast majority of whom \nhave enthusiastically welcomed the birds to their rest on their land. \nThrough its extensive outreach and education program, the Whooping \nCrane Eastern Partnership has obtained the consistent support of \nfarmers and other private landowners to make this important recovery \nprogram a success. On every front, this partnership is unique.\n  Despite the remarkable conservation efforts taken since 1941, \nhowever, this species is still very much in danger of extinction. While \nover the course of the last half-century, North American whooping \ncranes have begun to make a slow recovery, many species of crane in \nAfrica and Asia have declined, including the sarus crane of Asia and \nthe wattled crane of Africa.\n  The sarus crane stands four feet tall and can be found in the \nwetlands of\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\nnorthern India and south Asia. These birds require large, open, well-\nwatered plains or marshes to breed and survive. Due to agricultural \nexpansion, industrial development, river basin development, pollution, \nwarfare, and heavy use of pesticides prevalent in India and southeast \nAsia, the sarus crane population has been in decline. Furthermore, in \nmany areas, a high human population concentration compounds these \nfactors. On the Mekong River, which runs through Cambodia, Vietnam, \nLaos, Thailand, and China, human population growth and planned \ndevelopment projects threaten the sarus crane. Reports from India, \nCambodia, and Thailand have also cited incidences of the trading of \nadult birds and chicks, as well as hunting and egg stealing in the drop \nin population of the sarus crane.\n  Only three subspecies of the sarus crane exist today. One resides in \nnorthern India and Nepal, one resides in southeast Asia, and one \nresides in northern Australia. Their population is about 8,000 in the \nmain Indian population, with recent numbers showing a rapid decline. In \nSoutheast Asia, only 1,000 birds remain.\n  The situation of the sarus crane in Asia is mirrored by the situation \nof the wattled crane in Africa. In Africa, the wattled crane is found \nin the southern and eastern regions, with an isolated population in the \nmountains of Ethiopia. Current population estimates range between 6,000 \nto 8,000 and are declining rapidly, due to loss and degradation of \nwetland habitats, as well as intensified agriculture, dam construction, \nand industrialization. In other parts of the range, the creation of \ndams has changed the dynamics of the flood plains, thus further \nendangering these cranes and their habitats. Human disturbance at or \nnear breeding sites also continues to be a major threat. Lack of \noversight and education over the actions of people, industry, and \nagriculture is leading to reduced preservation for the lands on which \ncranes live, thereby threatening the ability of cranes to survive in \nthese regions.\n  If we do not act now, not only will cranes face extinction, but the \necosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. With the \ndecline of the crane population, the wetlands and marshes they inhabit \ncan potentially be thrown off balance. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting legislation that can provide funding to the local \nfarming, education, and enforcement projects that can have the greatest \npositive effect on the preservation of both cranes and fragile \nhabitats. This modest investment can secure the future of these \nexemplary birds and the beautiful areas in which they live. Therefore, \nI ask my colleagues to support the Crane Conservation Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Crane Conservation Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) crane populations in many countries have experienced \n     serious decline in recent decades, a trend that, if continued \n     at the current rate, threatens the long-term survival of the \n     species in the wild in Africa, Asia, and Europe;\n       (2) 5 species of Asian crane are listed as endangered \n     species under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1533) and appendix I of the Convention, which \n     species are--\n       (A) the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus);\n       (B) the red crowned crane (Grus japonensis);\n       (C) the white-naped crane (Grus vipio);\n       (D) the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis); and\n       (E) the hooded crane (Grus monacha);\n       (3) the Crane Action Plan of the International Union for \n     the Conservation of Nature considers 4 species of cranes from \n     Africa and 1 additional species of crane from Asia to be \n     seriously threatened, which species are--\n       (A) the wattled crane (Bugeranus carunculatus);\n       (B) the blue crane (Anthropoides paradisea);\n       (C) the grey crowned crane (Balearica regulorum);\n       (D) the black crowned crane (Balearica pavonina); and\n       (E) the sarus crane (Grus antigone);\n       (4)(A) the whooping crane (Grus americana) and the \n     Mississippi sandhill crane (Grus canadensis pulla) are listed \n     as endangered species under section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533); and\n       (B) with approximately 225 whooping cranes in the only \n     self-sustaining flock that migrates between Canada and the \n     United States, and approximately 100 Mississippi sandhill \n     cranes in the wild, both species remain vulnerable to \n     extinction;\n       (5) conservation resources have not been sufficient to cope \n     with the continued diminution of crane populations from \n     causes that include hunting and the continued loss of \n     habitat;\n       (6)(A) cranes are flagship species for the conservation of \n     wetland, grassland, and agricultural landscapes that border \n     wetland and grassland; and\n       (B) the establishment of crane conservation programs would \n     result in the provision of conservation benefits to numerous \n     other species of plants and animals, including many \n     endangered species;\n       (7) other threats to cranes include--\n       (A) the collection of eggs and juveniles;\n       (B) poisoning from pesticides applied to crops;\n       (C) collisions with power lines;\n       (D) disturbance from warfare and human settlement; and\n       (E) the trapping of live birds for sale;\n       (8) to reduce, remove, and otherwise effectively address \n     those threats to cranes in the wild, the joint commitment and \n     effort of countries in Africa, Asia, and North America, other \n     countries, and the private sector, are required;\n       (9) cranes are excellent ambassadors to promote goodwill \n     among countries because they are well known and migrate \n     across continents;\n       (10) because the threats facing cranes and the ecosystems \n     on which cranes depend are similar on all 5 continents on \n     which cranes occur, conservation successes and methods \n     developed in 1 region have wide applicability in other \n     regions; and\n       (11) conservationists in the United States have much to \n     teach and much to learn from colleagues working in other \n     countries in which, as in the United States, government and \n     private agencies cooperate to conserve threatened cranes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes;\n       (2) to assist in the conservation and protection of cranes \n     by supporting--\n       (A) conservation programs in countries in which endangered \n     and threatened cranes occur; and\n       (B) the efforts of private organizations committed to \n     helping cranes; and\n       (3) to provide financial resources for those programs and \n     efforts.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the \nPublic Health Service Act to set standards for medical diagnostic \nequipment and to establish a program for promoting good health, disease \nprevention, and wellness and for the prevention of secondary conditions \nfor individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes; to\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Promoting Wellness \nfor Individuals with Disabilities Act. This important legislation will \nhelp ensure that people with disabilities have the same health and \nwellness opportunities as everyone else--through increasing access to \naccessible medical equipment, creating a health and wellness grant \nprogram, and improving the competency of medical professionals in \nproviding care to patients with disabilities.\n  The health and wellness of America's citizens has long been one of my \ntop priorities. Too often, many Americans don't know about or lack \naccess to health screenings and preventive services. As Ben Franklin \nsaid, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.''\n  However, it is often difficult for many people with disabilities to \naccess this ounce of prevention. Visits to physicians' offices often do \nnot include accessible examination and diagnostic equipment, such as \naccessible examination tables, weight scales, and mammography machines \nfor people with mobility or balance issues. The presence of these \nphysical barriers can reduce the likelihood that persons with \ndisabilities will receive timely and appropriate medical services.\n  For example, one woman--a physician herself--told me that she has not \nhad a complete physical examination since her spinal cord injury more \nthan a decade ago because the tables are too high for her to get onto. \nShe has not had a mammogram or colonoscopy because, as she puts it, it \nseems like such an effort to have to explain to the technicians her \nneeds, to get them to lift her, and so on. These issues, which many of \nus take for granted, represent significant barriers to people with \ndisabilities.\n  Further, health and wellness programs on topics such as smoking \ncessation, weight control, nutrition, or fitness may not focus on the \nunique challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. And it may be \ndifficult for persons with particular disabilities, such as those with \nintellectual disabilities, to find physicians or dentists who are \nwilling to take them on as patients. All of these factors can also \nincrease the incidence of secondary conditions for people with \ndisabilities.\n  I believe that the ``Promoting Wellness for Individuals with \nDisabilities Act'' is a good first step toward addressing these \nproblems. The bill would: authorize the U.S. Access Board to establish \naccessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment--including \nexamination tables, examination chairs, weight scales, and mammography \nequipment, x-ray machines, and other radiological equipment commonly \nused for diagnostic purposes by medical professionals; establish a \nnational wellness grant program that will help fund programs or \nactivities for smoking cessation, weight control, nutrition or fitness \nthat focus on the unique challenges faced by individuals with \ndisabilities; preventive health screening programs for individuals with \ndisabilities to reduce the incidence of secondary conditions; and \nathletic, exercise, or sports programs that provide individuals with \ndisabilities an opportunity to increase their physical activity; and \nimprove education and training of physicians and dentists by requiring \nthat medical schools, dental schools, and their residency programs \nprovide training to improve competency and clinical skills in providing \ncare to patients with disabilities, including those with intellectual \ndisabilities.\n  I invite my fellow Members to join me in support of this legislation. \nTogether, we can make certain that people with disabilities are not \nlimited in their access to quality medical care, or in their \nopportunities for health and wellness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to \nestablish a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia at \nConstitution Gardens previously approved to honor free persons and \nslaves who fought for independence, liberty, and justice for all during \nthe American Revolution; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nLiberty Memorial Act along with my colleagues, Senators Charles E. \nGrassley and Sen. Barack Obama. Representatives Donald M. Payne, \nWilliam Lacy Clay, Steve Cohen, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Henry C. ``Hank'' \nJohnson, Jr., Nita M. Lowey, Albio Sires, and Betty Sutton have \nintroduced companion language in the House.\n  The depth and breadth of patriotic contributions by African Americans \nin the Revolutionary War have gone practically unacknowledged. \nHistorians are now beginning to uncover their forgotten heroism, and \nestimate that 5,000 slaves and free blacks fought in the army, navy, \nand militia during that harrowing time. They served and struggled in \nmajor battles from Lexington and Concord to Yorktown and made \nsignificant contributions to the revolutionary effort. More than 400 \nhailed from my State of Connecticut.\n  More than twenty years ago, Congress authorized a memorial to black \nRevolutionary War soldiers and sailors, those who provided civilian \nassistance, and the many slaves who fled slavery or filed petitions to \ncourts or legislatures for their freedom. A site was selected in \nConstitution Gardens, fittingly near the 56 Signers of the Declaration \nof Independence Memorial and the great war memorials. Unfortunately, \nthe group originally authorized to raise funds for and build the \nmemorial was unable to conclude its task, and the site sits empty \ntoday.\n  A group of committed citizens has formed the National Mall Liberty \nFund DC, ``Liberty Fund D.C.'', to carry out the vision of Congress. \nLast year, the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission concluded \nthat there are no legal impediments that would preclude the Liberty \nFund DC from assuming the prior group's site approvals on the Mall. The \nlegislation that we offer today would amend the 1986 enactment to \nauthorize the Liberty Fund to raise money for and build this valuable \nmemorial.\n  The time has come to recognize the sacrifice and the impact of the \nAfrican Americans who fought for the birth of our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the National Liberty Memorial Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1052. A bill to amend title XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto provide States with the option to provide nurse home visitation \nservices under Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to make the health of \nAmerican children and families a top priority with the Healthy Children \nand Families Act of 2007, which I introduced earlier today with Senator \nSpecter. I am honored that Senator Specter has co-sponsored this \nimportant legislation, and I thank Senator Specter for his leadership \nand commitment to children's health and to empowering families to lead \nhealthy lives.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program has successfully improved the \nhealth of over six million low-income children, allowing them to grow, \nlearn and reach their fullest potential. In the coming months, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nreauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\nso that it continues to fulfill its promise to provide quality health \ncare to all low-income children.\n  The reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nprovides us with an opportunity to strengthen and improve it. The \nHealthy Children and Families Act does just that by allowing states to \noffer nurse home visitation services in their Medicaid and State \nChildren's Health Insurance programs. The Healthy Children and Families \nAct models nurse home visitation services after the Nurse Family \nPartnership program.\n  The Nurse Family Partnership program provides low-income pregnant \nwomen with trained, registered nurses who counsel their clients in \ntheir homes on prenatal care, child health and development, proper \nnutrition, life-coping strategies and skills, healthy family \nrelationships, educational development and opportunities, employment \ntraining, family planning information, family support mechanisms and a \nvariety of other services that children and families need to maintain \nhealthy, economically stable lives.\n  Nurse home visitation programs empower women and children to \ntransform their lives, families and communities. The nurses provide the \neducation and tools for pregnant women and their families to improve \ntheir health by getting early prenatal care, preventative healthcare \nand proper nutrition. In addition, the nurses provide help for pregnant \nwomen and families to change risky behaviors such as substance abuse, \nand also teach pregnant women parenting skills so that they can welcome \ntheir babies into households that are prepared to raise physically and \nmentally healthy children. Nurses in the program also help mothers \ncontinue their own education and obtain employment so that the family \nis able to be economically stable.\n  We all recognize that the most critical time for childhood \ndevelopment begins in infancy. Nurse home visitation programs nurture \nthe cognitive development of children during those critical early years \nso that children are equipped to learn.\n  The success of nurse home visitation services is nothing short of \ninspiring. Statistics from multiple, controlled studies prove that \nmothers and children served by nurse visitation services have a: 79 \npercent reduction in preterm delivery; 48 percent reduction in child \nabuse and neglect; 59 percent reduction in child arrests; 61 percent \nfewer arrests of the mother; 72 percent fewer conviction for the \nmother; 46 percent increase in father presence in household; 32 percent \nfewer subsequent pregnancies; 50 percent reduction in language delays \nof child age 21 months; 67 percent reduction in childhood behavioral \nproblems at age 6.\n  With these amazing, life-altering results, it is no surprise that \nnurse visitation programs have been found to save taxpayer dollars. The \nRand Corporation conducted a cost-benefit analysis and found that for \nevery dollar spent on Nurse Family Partnership services, a savings of \n$5.70 is yielded in diminished health care costs and governmental and \nsocial costs associated with child abuse and neglect, unwanted \npregnancy, childhood developmental delays, and criminal justice costs.\n  The life transforming impact of nurse home visitation programs led \nthe Brookings Institute to recently publish a report in which it \nidentified nurse home visitation services as one of the most cost-\neffective returns on investment for children. The Center for the Study \nand Prevention of Violence has identified nurse home visitation \nservices such as Nurse Family Partnership as a ``blueprint'' for \nviolence prevention. At a time when youth violence is on the rise, \nthese programs hold the key to reducing violent conduct.\n  The Healthy Children and Families Act will allow states to offer \nnurse home visitation services to over half a million pregnant women \nannually. The Act will empower mothers and children to live healthy and \neconomically stable lives that enrich their communities. Moreover, the \nAct will save scarce resources by improving prenatal health, birth \noutcomes, increasing intervals between first and subsequent births, \nreducing early childhood injuries and hospitalizations, reducing child \nabuse and neglect, reducing involvement in the criminal justice system, \nand improving maternal employment and economic self-sufficiency of \nfamilies.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Healthy Children and \nFamilies Act as cost effective, smart legislation that will transform \nthe health and lives of children and families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1053. A bill to provide for a resource study of the area known as \nthe Rim of the Valley Corridor in the State of California to evaluate \nalternatives for protecting resources of the corridor, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday along with Senator Boxer as cosponsor to direct the Secretary of \nthe Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of expanding the \nSanta Monica National Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley \nCorridor.\n  The Rim of the Valley Corridor is an example of a highly threatened \nhabitat area, the Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem. Connecting to the \nadjacent Los Padres and San Bernardino National Forests, the Corridor \nencircles the San Fernando Valley, La Crescenta, Simi, Conejo, and \nSanta Clarita Valleys, consisting of parts of the Santa Monica \nMountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo \nMountains, and San Rafael Hills.\n  There is a great need for expanded parkland in southern California. \nWhile the Los Angeles metropolitan region has the second-largest urban \nconcentration in the United States, the area has one of the lowest \nratios of park-and-recreation-lands per thousand-population of any \nurban area in the country.\n  Since the creation of the Santa Monica Recreation Area in 1978, \nFederal, State, and local authorities have worked successfully together \nto create and maintain the highly successful Santa Monica Mountains \nNational Recreation Area, hemmed in on all sides by development.\n  With the passage of this legislation, Congress will hold true to its \noriginal commitment to preserve the scenic, natural, and historic \nsetting of the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area.\n  With the inclusion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in the Santa \nMonica Mountains Recreation Area, greater ecological health and \ndiversity will be promoted, particularly for larger animals like \nmountain lions, bobcats, and the golden eagle. By creating a single \ncontiguous Rim of the Valley Trail, people will enjoy greater access to \nexisting trails in the Recreational Area.\n  Within a National Recreation Area, the National Park Service is \nprohibited from exercising the powers of eminent domain, and private \nproperty may be purchased from voluntary sellers only.\n  The bill includes a provision directing the Department of the \nInterior to analyze any effects that a proposed expansion of the Santa \nMonica Mountains National Recreation Area will have on private land \nwithin or bordering the area. Any such effects will be thoroughly \nconsidered as the study moves forward.\n  After the study called for in this bill is complete, the Secretary of \nthe Interior and Congress will be in a key position to determine \nwhether all or portions of the Rim of the Valley Corridor warrant \ninclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.\n  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I \nhope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, \nas it did last Congress. Congressman Adam Schiff plans to introduce \ncompanion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his \ncommitment to this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this proposed legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor \n     Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESOURCE STUDY OF RIM OF THE VALLEY CORRIDOR, \n                   CALIFORNIA.\n\n       (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of the Interior shall \n     conduct a resource study of\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\n     the lands, waters, and interests of the area known as the Rim \n     of the Valley Corridor in the State of California to evaluate \n     a range of alternatives for protecting resources of the \n     corridor, including the alternative of establishing all or a \n     portion of the corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica \n     Mountains National Recreation Area. The Rim of the Valley \n     Corridor generally includes the mountains encircling the San \n     Fernando, La Crescenta, Santa Clarita, Simi, and Conejo \n     Valleys in California.\n       (b) Study Topics.--In conducting the study, the Secretary \n     shall seek to achieve the following objectives:\n       (1) Protecting wildlife populations in the Santa Monica \n     Mountains National Recreation Area by preserving habitat \n     linkages and wildlife movement corridors between large blocks \n     of habitat in adjoining regional open space.\n       (2) Establishing connections along the State-designated Rim \n     of the Valley Trail System, with the aim of creating a single \n     contiguous Rim of the Valley Trail and encompassing major \n     feeder trails connecting adjoining communities and regional \n     transit to the trail system.\n       (3) Preserving recreational opportunities and facilitating \n     access to open space for a variety of recreational users.\n       (4) Protecting rare, threatened, or endangered plant and \n     animal species, and rare or unusual plant communities and \n     habitats.\n       (5) Protecting historically significant landscapes, \n     districts, sites, and structures.\n       (6) Respecting the needs of communities within, or in the \n     vicinity of, the Rim of the Valley Corridor.\n       (c) Private Property.--As part of the study, the Secretary \n     shall analyze the potential impact that establishment of all \n     or a portion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor as a unit of \n     the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is likely \n     to have on land within or bordering the area that is \n     privately owned at the time the study is conducted. The \n     report required by subsection (g) shall discuss the concerns \n     of private landowners within the existing boundaries of the \n     Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.\n       (d) Cost Effectiveness.--As part of evaluating each \n     alternative considered under the study, the Secretary shall \n     estimate the impact of implementing the alternative on \n     staffing and other potential costs to Federal, State, and \n     local agencies and other organizations.\n       (e) Consultation.--The Secretary shall conduct the study in \n     consultation with appropriate Federal, State, county, and \n     local government entities.\n       (f) Study Criteria.--In addition to the special \n     considerations specified in this section, the Secretary shall \n     conduct the study using the criteria prescribed for the study \n     of areas for potential inclusion in the National Park System \n     in section 8(c) of Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5(c)).\n       (g) Transmission of Study.--Within three years after funds \n     are first made available for the study, the Secretary shall \n     transmit a report containing the results of the study to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and \n     to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of \n     Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1054. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the Inland Empire regional recycling project and in the \nCucamonga Valley Water District recycling project; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto authorize water recycling and other water supply projects by the \nInland Empire Utilities Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District. \nThese projects will produce approximately 95,000 acre-feet of new water \nannually in one of the most rapidly growing regions in the United \nStates, reducing the need for imported water from the Colorado River \nand northern California through the California Water Project.\n  The federal investment required is limited to approximately 10 \npercent of the projects' cost, or about $30 million.\n  This legislation is intended to be the companion to H.R. 122, \nsponsored by David Dreier, Grace Napolitano, Ken Calvert, Joe Baca, and \nGary Miller.\n  This legislation has broad support and has already passed the House, \nand in fact similar legislation to H.R. 122 also passed the House of \nRepresentatives in each of the previous two Congresses.\n  It is time for this legislation to pass the Senate as well and be \nenacted into law. Environmental groups such as the Mono Lake Committee, \nEnvironmental Defense, Clean Water and Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil strongly support the water recycling and groundwater \nremediation projects in this bill. Business leaders such as Southern \nCal Edison and Building Industry Association also support these \nprojects.\n  The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative would authorize \ntwo project components. The first will be constructed by the Inland \nEmpire Utilities Agency--IEUA--and will produce approximately 90,000 \nacre feet of new water annually. The second of these projects, to be \nconstructed by the Cucamonga Valley Water District--CVWD--will produce \nan additional 5,000 acre feet of new water annually.\n  The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative has the support \nof all member agencies of IEUA, as well as the water agencies \ndownstream in Orange County. IEUA encompasses approximately 242 square \nmiles and serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana--through the \nFontana Water Company--Ontario, Upland, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga--\nthrough the Cucamonga Valley Water District--and the Monte Vista Water \nDistrict.\n  I want to say a few words about the importance of water recycling \nprojects.\n  The development of recycled water can bring significant amounts of \nwater ``on line'' in a relatively short period of time. Recycled water \nprovides our State and region with the ability to ``stretch'' existing \nwater supplies significantly and in so doing, minimize conflict and \naddress the many needs that exist. According to the State of \nCalifornia's Recycled Water Task Force, water recycling is a critical \npart of California's water future with an estimated 1.5 million acre-\nfeet of new supplies being developed over the next 25 years.\n  Water recycling is also a bipartisan initiative in California, as \nwitnessed by the many Republican and Democratic House cosponsors of the \nHouse versions of the bill I introduce today.\n  Water recycling also has significant greenhouse gas reduction \nbenefits. The greenhouse gas emission reductions attributed to local \ndevelopment and use of recycled water within Inland Empire Utilities \nAgency's service area is roughly 100,000 tons of CO2 \nequivalents per year.\n  With only a small percentage of the total recycled water available \nbeing used in Southern California, approximately 10 percent, there is a \nhuge potential for additional energy savings and greenhouse gas \nreductions from aggressive development of recycled water supplies.\n  California is not the only State engaged in water recycling. Today, \nwater recycling is an essential water supply element in Albuquerque, \nPhoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Tucson, EI Paso, San Antonio, \nPortland, and other western metropolitan areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to help meet the West's \nwater supply needs and to reduce our dependence on the Colorado River. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1054\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the future of the American automobile \nindustry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing The American \nAutomobile Industry Promotion Act of 2007 to jump-start next generation \nbattery technology development in the United States and extend \nincentives to American-made highly efficient vehicles.\n  This legislation authorizes $100 million a year for 5 years to \nadvance new battery technology--an amount double the administration's \ncurrent budget request. On a national and international level, we must \ndo whatever it takes to help our domestic auto manufacturers remain \ncompetitive.\n  Right now, the Japanese dominate the market for lithium ion batteries \nbecause they invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing \nthis technology and in supporting their domestic industry. And, the \nKoreans and the Chinese are not far behind. American auto manufacturers \nare playing catch-up and we need to move quickly.\n  Specifically, I am proposing to support the development of advanced \nelectric components, systems and vehicles, by providing funds for \nbattery research to national laboratories, small businesses, and \ninstitutes of higher learning. The bill will also establish, through a \ncompetitive selection process, an Industry Alliance of private, U.S. \nbased, for-profit firms whose primary business is battery development. \nThe Industry Alliance would be an advisory resource on short and long \nterm battery technology development.\n  The new research initiative will have four major areas of focus: (1) \nResearch and Development including battery technology, high-efficiency \ncharging systems, high-powered drive-train systems, control systems and \npower train development, and nanomaterial technology for battery and \nfuel cell systems. (2) Demonstration. The initiative also creates a \ndemonstration program which would devote resources toward \ndemonstration, testing and evaluation of hybrid electric vehicles for \nmany different applications including military, mass market passenger \nand SUV vehicles. (3) Education. The initiative will support curriculum \ndevelopment in secondary, high school, as well as higher education \ninstitutions that focus on electric drive systems and component \nengineering. (4) Testing. Finally, the initiative would work with the \nEPA to develop testing and certification procedures for criteria \npollutants, fuel economy, and petroleum use in vehicles.\n  In addition to research and development for the lithium ion battery, \nthe American Automobile Industry Promotion Act will also set a national \nstandard for biodiesel, a cleaner-burning fuel made from natural and \nrenewable sources; and expand tax credit eligibility for consumers who \npurchase more fuel-efficient diesel vehicles. Today's diesels are \ncleaner than their predecessors, are in compliance with EPA emissions \nstandards, and are 30 percent more fuel efficient than an equivalent \ngasoline engine. Specifically, the bill expands the emissions \nrequirements to qualify for a tax credit for various weight diesel \nvehicles, increasing the number of American-manufactured more fuel \nefficient diesel vehicles that qualify. This provision would expire in \nfour years, at which time all highly efficient vehicles will have to \nmeet higher emissions standards to qualify for the tax credit.\n  Now is the time to act. It's not too late, but we do not have the \nluxury of waiting. If we are ever to be truly competitive in the global \nauto market and free from our dependence on foreign oil, we must move \nforward on all fronts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1055\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a comprehensive Federal effort \nrelating to early detection of, treatments for, and the prevention of \ncancer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise, along with my Senate Cancer \nCoalition cochair, Senator Brownback, to introduce the National Cancer \nAct of 2007, a bipartisan blueprint for winning the war against cancer.\n  It includes: grants for targeted drug development; creating ``cancer \nquarterbacks'' in Medicare; Medicaid coverage for smoking cessation \ntreatments; pilot projects for expanding colorectal cancer screening in \nunderserved populations; continued research into the possible benefits \nof early detection for lung cancer; loan repayment assistance for \ncancer prevention researchers; incentives for research into drugs that\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\nprevent cancer from developing and spreading in the first place; \nprovisions to promote the collection and storage of tissue sample, to \ngive researchers the tools they need to use genomic research to create \nindividualized cures; promoting access to clinical trials, as well as \ninvestigational therapies for those who are terminally ill; addressing \nthe health needs of the growing number of cancer survivors.\n  Just over 35 years ago, President Nixon signed into law the original \nNational Cancer Act, creating the National Cancer Institute and making \ncancer research a priority of the Federal Government. This work has led \nto tremendous breakthroughs against cancer, including innovative drugs, \ntreatments, and a better understanding of the factors that lead to \ncancer in the first place. Last year, death rates decreased for 11 of \nthe 15 cancers most common in men, and 10 of the cancers most common in \nwomen.\n  Sixty-five percent of people diagnosed with cancer can now expect to \nsurvive at least 5 years. This is good news. But it is not enough. The \ncost of cancer, in both human and economic terms, remains staggering.\n  An estimated 1,399,790 Americans were diagnosed with some form of \ncancer last year.\n  Approximately 1 of 3 women will develop cancer at some point in her \nlifetime; for men, the risk is slightly less than 1 in 2.\n  The National Institutes of Health estimated the overall cost of \ncancer in 2005 at $209.9 billion.\n  The price of inaction is too steep. Cancer is, first and foremost, a \ndisease of aging. About 76 percent of cancer cases are diagnosed in \npatients at age 55 or older. If no fundamental changes are made, the \naging of the Baby Boom generation will bring a 20 percent increase in \ncancer diagnoses.\n  In the face of these challenges, the National Cancer Institute, NCI, \nwith broad support in the cancer community, set the ambitious goal of \nending death and suffering from cancer by 2015. This goal has generated \nunprecedented excitement and unity, with over 80 Members of the United \nStates Senate signing a letter in support of the effort.\n  It is time to reexamine and reorient our Nation's cancer policy to \nmeet this ambitious goal. This does not mean that cancer will be \neradicated by 2015. As our population ages, cancer will not go away. \nBut we can change the meaning of a cancer diagnosis, and that is what \nthe 2015 goal is about.\n  Meeting this goal will take a comprehensive approach. It requires \ndetecting cancer earlier, before it spreads and becomes harder to \ntreat. It requires targeted therapies, capable of killing cancer cells \nwhile leaving healthy cells intact. We must provide access to high \nquality cancer care for those who do get sick. We must also understand \nmore about why people get cancer in the first place, and ways it can be \nprevented.\n  Our legislation takes a multifaceted approach to changing the very \nnature of a cancer diagnosis. The National Cancer Act of 2007 will do \nthe following:\n  Authorize grants for the development of targeted drugs.\n  New drug therapies continue to lead us closer to the day in which \ncancer is a treatable, chronic condition controlled with a simple pill \nor injection. It has now been 5 years since the drug company Novartis \nwon approval for Gleevec, a targeted drug that has saved the lives of \ncountless patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, CML.\n  Gleevec demonstrates the promise of this new kind of drug therapy. It \nblocks the enzymes that help cancer cells grow and divide, leaving \nhealthy cells untouched. When this drug was first introduced, CML \npatients who were near death recovered and left the hospital. Yet it \ncould not be determined if their remission would last, or if long-term \nuse of this revolutionary drug would prove safe.\n  We now know that Gleevec is fulfilling this early promise. Before the \nadvent of this drug, CML patients would often suffer a relapse after 2 \nor 3 years. But a recent study of CML patients taking Gleevec has \ndemonstrated a remarkable 89 percent survival rate after 5 years. The \ncancer progressed to a more serious stage in only 7 percent of patients \nduring this time period, and only 5 percent were forced to discontinue \ntreatment because of side effects.\n  These results suggest that patients may be able to stay on Gleevec \nindefinitely, keeping this formerly deadly cancer under control while \nleading full and productive lives.\n  Targeted therapies are now offering hope to patients with many \ndifferent kinds of cancer: Herceptin for some breast cancers, Iressa \nfor those with small cell lung cancer, Avastin for colorectal cancer. \nAvastin can extend survival by interfering with the growth of blood \nvessels that feed the tumor, literally starving it.\n\n  These drugs are the future of cancer research. We need more drugs \nlike Gleevec, which transform cancer from a killer to a controllable \nhealth condition. This legislation would authorize NCI to make grants \nto further develop these treatments.\n  To help with the development of targeted drugs, the bill also calls \nfor the establishment of a task force on surrogate endpoints and \nbiomarkers. They are the mechanisms for measuring the efficacy of \ncancer treatment at the molecular level, allowing doctors to precisely \ngauge how a patient is reacting to a treatment, or if a cancer is \nprogressing.\n  Developing biomarkers for different types of cancer is an essential \nstep, and our bill will establish a program to develop the biomarkers \nwith the most immediate clinical promise.\n  The bill will also create special reimbursements for coordinating \nphysicians, or ``cancer quarterbacks'' in Medicare. Successful cancer \ntreatment is increasingly complex, reaching across the entire spectrum \nof the medical profession. It can involve lab tests, CT-scans, surgery, \nchemotherapy, and a full team of specialists who offer this care. Many \npatients have no single physician who can guide them through the \ncomplicated and sometimes contradictory course of cancer treatment, no \nprofessional to advise them what is best.\n  This bill would require Medicare to pay oncology doctors or nurses to \nbecome the overall managers of patients' care, in effect providing \nevery cancer patient with a ``cancer quarterback'' physician to help \nthem coordinate care and make the necessary decisions.\n  This cancer quarterback can direct care in the manner that best meets \nthe patient's needs, instead of focusing on only a small segment of his \nor her care.\n  This legislation requires that State Medicaid drug programs cover \nsmoking cessation treatments in the same manner as all other approved \ntherapies. I have long believed that we will not truly address the \nburden of cancer until we address tobacco use. I have asked all kinds \nof cancer experts about what we can do to stop death from cancer, and \ntheir answer is always the same: Stop tobacco use.\n  Tobacco causes 30 percent of cancer deaths and 1 in 5 of all deaths \nin the United States. It is the leading cause of preventable death. \nSmoking related costs total $167 billion annually.\n  According to the CDC, more than 70 percent of American smokers would \nlike to quit. Studies indicate that tobacco use treatment, including \nsmoking cessation aids, will double their chances of success.\n  Yet under current law, State Medicaid programs are exempted from \nproviding coverage of smoking cessation agents in the same way as they \nprovide coverage of other drugs. Other exemptions include fertility \ntreatments, drugs to promote hair growth, and drugs for erectile \ndysfunction.\n  Simply put, smoking cessation aids, which are FDA approved and proven \nto be effective, do not belong on this list. Denying people access to \ntreatments to help them break a deadly and expensive addiction is \nflawed policy.\n  Our bill will remove tobacco cessation products from this list of \nexemptions, leveling the playing field with other FDA approved \nproducts.\n  Our bill establishes pilot projects for expanding colorectal cancer \nscreening for low-income, uninsured individuals. The Breast and \nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program has proven very successful in \nproviding low income women with access to potentially life saving \nscreenings. It is now time to provide similar access to colorectal \ncancer screening.\n  The need is great. A 2006 study conducted by Northwestern University \nresearchers found that only 7 percent of minority patients without \nregular\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nhealth care access at risk for developing colon cancer are being \nscreened. A 2005 study of New York City residents found that those \nleast likely to have been recommended colorectal screening are low-\nincome or uninsured.\n  Early detection allows physicians to identify patients with pre-\ncancerous polyps, and treat them before cancer even develops. These \npilot projects identify the best ways to provide access to this \nlifesaving care for those who are not currently receiving recommended \nscreenings.\n  This bill will authorize continued research on the potential of CT \nscans to detect lung cancer early. before it becomes fatal. Despite all \nthe promising advances against many types of cancer, lung cancer \nremains the Nation's leading cause of cancer death in both men and \nwomen. About 20,000 people who have never smoked are diagnosed with \nlung cancer each year, and this number is increasing.\n  We need to learn more about how to screen for lung cancer and detect \nit early, before it has advanced. There is much we need to learn before \nscientists can make a definitive recommendation about screening and its \npotential benefits for both smokers and non-smokers.\n  To help scientists learn more, this bill will authorize funding to \nprovide CT scans to those with a history of heavy smoking. This further \nstudy will help determine whether this promising technology is indeed \nthe method we need to make progress against the leading cancer killer.\n  This legislation expands the existing NIH loan repayment program to \nprovide assistance to researchers who make a commitment to working on \ncancer prevention research. This will encourage the best and brightest \nto pursue work that will help us to better understand what causes \ncancer and how we can stop it from occurring.\n\n  The bill will encourage and support research into new drugs and \ntreatments, called chemopreventatives, which can stop precancerous \ncells from becoming tumors. Decades of research has enabled physicians \nto prescribe medications to prevent serious illness, such as statin \ndrugs to lower cholesterol, and drugs to treat high blood pressure \nbefore it leads to strokes.\n  Progress in drug development to stop cancer has been far more \nlimited. The promise of this field was made clear when, last year, the \nFood and Drug Administration, FDA, licensed Gardasil, a vaccine to stop \nthe spread of cervical cancer. Gardasil protects against the two forms \nof the human papillomavirus, or HPV, which causes approximately 70 \npercent of cervical cancer cases. This vaccine could virtually \neliminate cervical cancer during the lifetime of our daughters and \ngranddaughters.\n  We need more chemoprevention techniques like Guardasil to guard \nagainst other types of cancer. People at high risk for a specific type \nof cancer may one day take a daily pill to stop abnormal cells from \nprogressing to full blown cancer. Though it will take a long time for \nthese promises to become reality, this research is the future of cancer \ncare.\n  In order to encourage this work, our legislation would grant Orphan \nDrug Act protections to treatments designed to treat high-risk \nconditions in individuals who have not yet been diagnosed with cancer, \nbut if left untreated, face a high risk of developing cancer.\n  This research will require new resources in order to have the best \nchance of success. To build the foundations for success, our bill will \nencourage biospecimen collection.\n  Scientists are beginning to understand the significant role that \ngenetics plays in the development of cancer. To encourage further \nstudy, scientists need access to a variety of tissue, blood, and other \nsamples from both cancer patients and those who are healthy. Our bill \ncodifies guidelines for the collection of these samples and requires \nthat the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, draft a report \nexamining potential payment systems for these activities.\n  We are on the cusp of an age of personalized medicine, in which a \ncancer patient's tumor can be analyzed to determine what type of \ntreatment will be most effective. Patients will no longer undergo round \nafter round of chemotherapy or radiation in the hopes of finding a \ntreatment regime that works. Collecting and storing blood and tissue \nsamples will provide our researchers with the materials they need to \nmake these important discoveries.\n  Our bill will promote clinical trial enrollment. Patients willing to \ntry these cutting edge cancer therapies as they emerge face a variety \nof obstacles. They, or their physicians, might not know what clinical \ntrial opportunities exist. They may need to travel to a far away \nfacility to participate. Our legislation requires the Director of the \nNational Cancer Institute to create a clinical trials program, which \nincludes: an outreach program, to assure that all patients, especially \nminorities, participate in trials; and a coordination program, to help \npatients with logistical challenges and the support costs of trial \nparticipation.\n  Our bill creates an oncology compassionate access program. No patient \nshould lose a battle with cancer because bureaucratic hurdles denied \nhim or her access to a potentially lifesaving therapy. Our bill \nprovides for the creation of a new compassionate access program to \nspeed access of investigational therapies for terminally ill patients \nwho have exhausted all other available treatment options.\n  Our bill will address the needs of a growing number of cancer \nsurvivors. As cancer increasingly becomes a manageable, chronic \ncondition, there will be an increasing number of cancer survivors \nconfronting yet-unknown health challenges. Current cancer survivors \nnumber almost 10 million, and this number will only grow. This bill \nwill: expand current cancer surveillance systems to track the health \nstatus of cancer survivors; implement a national cancer survivorship \naction plan, including post treatment health programs; require States \nto consider the needs of cancer survivors, and their families, in \naddition to current patients, when drafting their comprehensive cancer \ncontrol plans.\n  Require the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, to report on their strategies, \nbenchmarks, and progress in meeting the 2015 goal. This will allow \nCongress to adjust policy as necessary to ensure that the promise of \nending death and suffering from cancer is realized.\n  The state of cancer care has changed drastically since 1971, and it \nis time that our Federal policies reflect these changes. The 2015 goal \nis ambitious, and it requires no less than ambitious legislation in \nresponse.\n  I urge you to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I introduce the National Cancer \nAct of 2007, along with my colleague Dianne Feinstein. Thirty-five \nyears ago, President Richard Nixon signed the original National Cancer \nAct, and today, we are moving forward with a new, comprehensive bill \nthat takes us one step closer to ending death and suffering from cancer \nwithin 10 years. This bill addresses impact-oriented issues such as the \ndevelopment of cancer prevention drugs and a screening for the most \nlethal cancer.\n  Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in America. Individuals \nafflicted with lung cancer historically have had only 15 percent \nsurvival rate. Our legislation includes a new demonstration program to \ncontinue research on a screening that uses a spiral CT scan. Screenings \nusing this tool and appropriate follow-up procedures have shown very \nencouraging results in early detection.\n  We also include accountability mechanisms in this bill. We request a \nreport from the Federal Government regarding the manner in which \nFederal cancer research funding is being spent by requiring an estimate \nof the number of individuals who have benefited from such investment \nand the number of new treatments developed.\n  Another issue our legislation addresses is the fact that less than 5 \npercent of adults diagnosed with cancer each year will be treated \nthrough enrollment in a clinical trial; this is often due to lack of \nawareness. Our bill creates an education program about the availability \nof clinical trials.\n  Our legislation also includes efforts to ensure the availability of \ncompassionate access options. Making decisions about treatment options \nfor cancer is a decision best made between the cancer patient and their \ndoctor. Compassionate access offers cancer patients, who have exhausted \nall of their\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\ntreatment options, access to promising investigational treatments that \nhave not yet received full approval by the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Finally, our bill includes measures to accelerate the progress of the \nNational Cancer Institute's initiative of mapping the genome of the \nmost lethal cancers in America, which will lead to earlier cancer \ndiagnosis and the use of personalized medicine.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague Dianne Feinstein and \nothers in moving forward with this legislation in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1058. A bill to expedite review of the Grand River Bands of Ottawa \nIndians of Michigan to secure a timely and just determination of \nwhether the Bands are entitled to recognition as a Federal Indian tribe \nso that the Bands may receive eligible funds before the funds are no \nlonger available; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Grand River Bands of Ottawa Indians, \ncommonly referred to as the Grand River Bands, has been in some form \nindigenous to the State of Michigan for over 200 years. The Grand River \nBands consists of the 19 bands of Indians who occupied the territory \nalong the Grand River in what is now southwest Michigan, including the \ncities of Grand Rapids and Muskegon. The members of the Grand River \nBands are the descendants and political successors to signatories of \nthe 1821 Treaty of Chicago and the 1836 Treaty of Washington. They are \nalso one of six tribes which is an original signatory of the 1855 \nTreaty of Detroit. However, the Grand River Bands is the only one of \nthose tribes which is not recognized by the Federal Government.\n  In the 109th Congress, I introduced a bill, with my colleague, \nSenator Stabenow, which would direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs at \nthe Department of the Interior to make a recognition determination, for \nthe Grand River Bands, in a timely manner. I am pleased to re-introduce \nthat bill now. I would also like to affirm that this bill does not \nfederally recognize the tribe nor does it address the issue of gaming. \nFurthermore, I would like to stress the timely manner in which this \ndetermination must be made.\n  If federally recognized, the Grand River Bands is eligible for funds \nset aside for them from a Federal consent judgment. These funds are \nexpected to be distributed this year. In order for the Grand River \nBands to receive their portion of this fund, they must be federally \nrecognized before this money is distributed. They have completed all of \nthe necessary items for a determination to be made by the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, but the Bureau has failed to act on the petition for \nthe past ten years.\n  I hope that this legislation will help to provide a timely remedy so \nthat the Grand River Bands can receive funds that are currently set \naside for them, and enjoy the full benefits and status of Federal \nrecognition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 1060. A bill to reauthorize the grant program for reentry of \noffenders into the community in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968, to improve reentry planning and implementation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I introduce today with my colleagues \nSenators Specter, Brownback, and Leahy the Recidivism Reduction and \nSecond Chance Act of 2007, which takes direct aim at reducing \nrecidivism rates by improving the transition of offenders from prison \nback into the community. As this bill reflects, preventing recidivism \nis not only the right thing to do, it makes our communities safer and \nit saves us money.\n  Today, we have over two million individuals in our Federal and State \nprisons and millions more in local jails. Our Federal and State prisons \nwill release nearly 650,000 of these offenders back into our \ncommunities this year. A staggering \\2/3\\ of released State prisoners \nwill be rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years \nof release.\n  It's not difficult to see why. These ex-offenders face a number of \ndifficult challenges upon release. The unemployment rate among former \ninmates is as high as 60 percent; 15-27 percent of prisoners expect to \ngo to homeless shelters upon release; and 57 percent of Federal and 70 \npercent of State inmates used drugs regularly before prison. This \naddiction and dependency often continues during incarceration.\n  Unless we address these problems, these individuals will commit \nhundreds of thousands of serious crimes after their release, and our \ncommunities will bear the human and economic cost. If we are going to \nreduce recidivism and crime, we simply have to make concerted, common-\nsense efforts now to help ex-offenders successfully reenter and \nreintegrate into their communities.\n  The Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act of 2007 \nconfronts head-on the dire situation of prisoners reentering our \ncommunities with insufficient monitoring, little or no job skills, \ninadequate drug treatment, insufficient housing, lack of basic physical \nand mental health services, and deficient basic life skills. Through \ncommonsense and cost effective measures, it offers a second chance for \nex-offenders, and the children and families that depend on them, and it \nstrengthens our communities and ensures safe neighborhoods.\n\n  The Second Chance Act provides a competitive grant program to study \ncurrent approaches to reducing recidivism rates. It also provides \ngrants for the development and implementation of comprehensive \nsubstance abuse treatment programs, academic and vocational education \nprograms, housing and job counseling programs, and mentoring for \noffenders who are approaching release and who have been released. To \nensure accountability, the bill requires grantees to establish \nperformance goals and benchmarks and report the results to Congress.\n  The bill authorizes $192 million per year in competitive grant \nfunding. This represents an investment in our future and an \nacknowledgement of the problem we face. We must remember that the \naverage cost of incarcerating each prisoner exceeds $20,000 per year, \nwith expenditures on corrections alone having increased from $9 billion \nin 1982 to $60 billion in 2002. That's more than a six-fold increase, \nand the costs keep going up.\n  A relatively modest investment in offender reentry efforts today is \nfar more cost-effective than the alternative--building more prisons for \nthese ex-offenders to return to if they can't reenter their communities \nand are convicted of further crimes. An ounce of prevention, as the \nsaying goes, is worth a pound of cure.\n  I'm proud today to join with Senator Specter, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Leahy in introducing the Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance \nAct and ask that our colleagues join with us in this vital effort. The \nsafety of our neighbors, our children, and our communities depends on \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2002, over 7,000,000 people were incarcerated in \n     Federal or State prisons or in local jails. Nearly 650,000 \n     people are released from Federal and State incarceration into \n     communities nationwide each year.\n       (2) There are over 3,200 jails throughout the United \n     States, the vast majority of which are operated by county \n     governments. Each year, these jails will release more than \n     10,000,000 people back into the community.\n       (3) Recent studies indicate that over \\2/3\\ of released \n     State prisoners are expected to be rearrested for a felony or \n     serious misdemeanor within 3 years after release.\n       (4) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, \n     expenditures on corrections alone increased from \n     $9,000,000,000 in 1982, to $59,600,000,000 in 2002. These \n     figures do not include the cost of arrest and prosecution, \n     nor do they take into account the cost to victims.\n       (5) The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative \n     provided $139,000,000 in funding for State governments to \n     develop and implement education, job training, mental health \n     treatment, and substance abuse treatment for serious and \n     violent offenders. This Act seeks to build upon the \n     innovative and successful State reentry programs developed \n     under the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative, \n     which terminated after fiscal year 2005.\n       (6) Between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a \n     parent in a Federal or State correctional facility increased \n     by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to \n     approximately 2,000,000. According to the Bureau of Prisons, \n     there is evidence to suggest that inmates who are connected \n     to their children and families are more likely to avoid \n     negative incidents and have reduced sentences.\n       (7) Released prisoners cite family support as the most \n     important factor in helping them stay out of prison. Research \n     suggests that families are an often underutilized resource in \n     the reentry process.\n       (8) Approximately 100,000 juveniles (ages 17 years and \n     under) leave juvenile correctional facilities, State prison, \n     or Federal prison each year. Juveniles released from secure \n     confinement still have their likely prime crime years ahead \n     of them. Juveniles released from secure confinement have a \n     recidivism rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. The chances \n     that young people will successfully transition into society \n     improve with effective reentry and aftercare programs.\n       (9) Studies have shown that between 15 percent and 27 \n     percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon \n     release from prison.\n       (10) Fifty-seven percent of Federal and 70 percent of State \n     inmates used drugs regularly before going to prison, and the \n     Bureau of Justice Statistics report titled ``Trends in State \n     Parole, 1990-2000'' estimates the use of drugs or alcohol \n     around the time of the offense that resulted in the \n     incarceration of the inmate at as high as 84 percent.\n       (11) Family-based treatment programs have proven results \n     for serving the special populations of female offenders and \n     substance abusers with children. An evaluation by the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of \n     family-based treatment for substance-abusing mothers and \n     children found that 6 months after such treatment, 60 percent \n     of the mothers remained alcohol and drug free, and drug-\n     related offenses declined from 28 percent to 7 percent. \n     Additionally, a 2003 evaluation of residential family-based \n     treatment programs revealed that 60 percent of mothers \n     remained clean and sober 6 months after treatment, criminal \n     arrests declined by 43 percent, and 88 percent of the \n     children treated in the program with their mothers remained \n     stabilized.\n       (12) A Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis indicated that \n     only 33 percent of Federal inmates and 36 percent of State \n     inmates had participated in residential in-patient treatment \n     programs for alcohol and drug abuse 12 months before their \n     release. Further, over \\1/3\\ of all jail inmates have some \n     physical or mental disability and 25 percent of jail inmates \n     have been treated at some time for a mental or emotional \n     problem.\n       (13) State Substance Abuse Agency Directors, also known as \n     Single State Authorities (in this paragraph referred to as \n     ``SSAs''), manage the publicly funded substance abuse \n     prevention and treatment system of the Nation. SSAs are \n     responsible for planning and implementing State-wide systems \n     of care that provide clinically appropriate substance abuse \n     services. Given the high rate of substance use disorders \n     among offenders reentering our communities, successful \n     reentry programs require close interaction and collaboration \n     with each SSA as the program is planned, implemented and \n     evaluated.\n       (14) According to the National Institute of Literacy, 70 \n     percent of all prisoners function at the lowest literacy \n     levels.\n       (15) Less than 32 percent of State prison inmates have a \n     high school diploma or a higher level of education, compared \n     to 82 percent of the general population.\n       (16) Approximately 38 percent of inmates who completed 11 \n     years or less of school were not working before entry into \n     prison.\n       (17) The percentage of State prisoners participating in \n     educational programs decreased by more than 8 percent between \n     1991 and 1997, despite growing evidence of how educational \n     programming while incarcerated reduces recidivism.\n       (18) The National Institute of Justice has found that 1 \n     year after release, up to 60 percent of former inmates are \n     not employed.\n       (19) Transitional jobs programs have proven to help people \n     with criminal records to successfully return to the workplace \n     and to the community, and therefore can reduce recidivism.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to establish a congressional commemorative medal for \norgan donors and their families; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be joined today by my \ncolleagues, Senator Grassley from Iowa, and Representative Stark in the \nHouse, to introduce the William H. Frist Gift of Life Congressional \nMedal Act. This important legislation gives long overdue recognition to \nthe courageous act of organ donation and encourages others to become \nnew donors.\n  This bill establishes a congressional medal to recognize organ donors \nand their families for their selfless acts of organ donation. The medal \nis named in honor of Dr. William H. Frist, a former transplant surgeon, \nlater Senate majority leader, who first offered the Gift of Life \nCongressional Medal Act during his time in the Senate.\n  Nearly 100,000 people are currently waiting for an organ transplant. \nOver 2,000 are children under age 18. In my home State of Illinois, \nnearly 5,000 men, women, and children wait for a life-saving donation. \nSadly, the national waiting list continues to grow every year. Since \nthe waiting list began, at least 75,000 donation-eligible Americans \nhave died waiting for an organ to become available; in 2005 alone, over \n6,000 people died for lack of a suitable organ, including some 300 \nIllinois residents. Minorities representing approximately 25 percent of \nthe population comprise over 40 percent of the organ transplant waiting \nlist and half of the patients who die while patiently waiting for their \ngift of life.\n  Every 16 minutes, a new name is added to the growing list, while the \nhope of those who have been waiting for months and years at a time \nbegins to diminish. To narrow the gap between the limited supply and \nthe increasing demand for donated organs, willing donors must make \ntheir desire to donate clear to the only people able to make the \ndecision if the occasion should arise--their immediate family members. \nAlthough there are up to 15,000 potential donors annually, families \nconsent to donation for less than 6,000 donors.\n  Congressional medals are awarded to individuals who perform an \noutstanding deed or act of service to the security, prosperity, and \nnational interest of the United States. Is there a more outstanding \ndeed or act than that of the gift of life? Over 21,000 Americans \nreceive the gift of life each year through transplantation surgery made \npossible by the generosity of organ and tissue donors. The Gift of Life \nCongressional Medal Act would allow us to recognize these donors and \ntheir families and inspire others to become donors.\n  This is noncontroversial, nonpartisan legislation to recognize the \nselfless act of donating one's organ for another's well-being and to \nhopefully increase the rate of organ donation. I ask my colleagues to \nhelp bring an end to transplant waiting lists and give recognition to \nthe faith and courage displayed by organ donors and their families. \nThis bill honors these brave acts, while publicizing the critical need \nfor increased organ donation. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthe William H. Frist Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\n                                S. 1062\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic \nbrain injury in members and former members of the Armed Forces, to \nreview and expand telehealth and telemental health programs of the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Heroes at \nHome Act of 2007, the Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and \nWounded Warriors Act of 2007, and the Protecting Military Family \nFinancial Benefits Act of 2007 to serve our servicemembers and send a \nmessage: you will be treated as heroes before deployment, during \ndeployment, and upon returning home. You didn't offer excuses and do \nnot deserve to be offered excuses by your country.\n  I want to thank Senator Collins for co-sponsoring the Heroes at Home \nAct of 2007 and for partnering with me on numerous pieces of \nlegislation and initiatives related to these and other important health \nissues.\n  This is a moment of profound challenge for our country, for our \nmilitary, and for our men and women in uniform. And while there are \noften strong disagreements here in Washington, I hope we can unite \naround our common values and patriotism when it comes to how we treat \nour servicemembers and veterans.\n  If you serve your country your country should serve you. That is the \npromise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist, who \nfight, and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible \nscars of sacrifice. Sadly, too often in the past several years, that \npromise has been broken: whether it's a lack of up-armored vehicles on \nthe ground in Iraq or a lack of appropriate care in outpatient \nfacilities at Walter Reed.\n  Last year, I authored and passed into law the Heroes at Home \ninitiative to assist returning servicemembers experiencing the complex, \ndiffuse, and life-altering symptoms of traumatic brain injury and other \nmental health difficulties.\n  One out of every 10 returning servicemembers are affected by \ntraumatic brain injury (TBI), which has been widely identified as the \n``signature wound'' of the Global War on Terror. This includes severe \ninjuries as well as invisible wounds that result in trouble remembering \nappointments, holding down a job, and returning to civilian life. \nUnfortunately, troops have an increased risk of sustaining more than \none mild or moderate TBI because of multiple deployments and the \nprevalent use of Improved Explosive Devices by enemy combatants in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. However, mild \nand moderate TBI may go undetected, especially if the servicemember has \nsustained more obvious injuries. Further, it can be difficult to \ndistinguish mild TBI from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since both \nconditions have common symptoms, such as irritability, anxiety and \ndepression. Although many wounded\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nservicemembers receive cognitive evaluations upon returning from \ndeployment, the lack of a baseline test conducted prior to the injury \nleads these servicemembers to question the validity of their post-\ndeployment assessments.\n  When I visited Walter Reed a few weeks ago, I met a young Army \nsoldier who had lost one arm and lost his ring finger because his \nwedding band had melted onto it. I asked him how he was doing, and he \nsaid, ``You know, I'm working hard at my rehabilitation and they're \ntaking great care of me with my prosthetics.''\n  He said, ``but what really bothers me is my memory. I don't have the \nfocus that I used to have. I can't really set out tasks and know that I \ncan accomplish them.'' And he said, ``That's the thing that really \nbothers me I've got to have my brain back.''\n  His story, and the stories of hundreds of other servicemembers like \nhim, demonstrates that we need to do more to help rapid identification \nof traumatic brain injury in order to facilitate the best care once the \nservicemembers return home, and expand support systems for members and \nformer members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and \ntheir families.\n  That's why I, along with Senator Collins, am introducing the Heroes \nat Home Act of 2007 today, to build on last year's Heroes at Home \ninitiative. I am grateful to have developed this proposal with the \nWounded Warrior Project, the National Military Family Association, the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, and the American Academy of \nNeurology.\n  We should provide pre-deployment cognitive screening to better \ndiagnose and treat traumatic brain injury when these men and women \nreturn home. This legislation will improve detection of mild and \nmoderate TBI by implementing an objective, computer-based assessment \nprotocol to measure cognitive functioning both prior to and after \ndeployment. This baseline test will help detect mild and moderate cases \nof TBI and distinguish them from PTSD. My legislation will also require \nthat the same assessment tool be used across all branches of the \n6yArmed Services and for every member of the Armed Forces who will be \ndeployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We should also help families take care of a loved one by providing \nthem with training to become certified caregivers, so that they can \nreceive compensation for care giving they already provide. Family \nmembers of returning soldiers with TBI are often ill-equipped to handle \nthe demands of caring for their loved one, which in some bases can \nbecome a full-time responsibility. My legislation will establish a \nTraumatic Brain Injury Family Caregiver Personal Care Attendant \nTraining and Certification Program, which would train and certify \nfamily caregivers of TBI patients as personal care attendants, enabling \nthem to provide quality care at home and at the same time qualify for \ncompensation from the VA.\n  Finally, we should explore new ways to treat TBI in rural settings \nand outpatient clinics through telemedicine. Servicemembers and \nveterans continue to face problems in accessing needed medical and \nmental health care, especially veterans or Guard and Reserve members \nwho live in rural areas. The Heroes at Home Act of 2007 will help \nincrease the reach of needed care for TBI by creating a demonstration \nproject, administered jointly by the Departments of Defense and \nVeterans Affairs that would use telehealth technology to assess TBI and \nrelated mental health conditions and facilitate rehabilitation and \ndissemination of educational material on techniques, strategies and \nskills for servicemembers with TBI.\n  On March 6, 2007 Chief of Staff of the Army General Peter Schoomaker \nand the then Army Surgeon General Lieutenant General Kevin C. Kiley, \ntestified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that soldiers \nappearing before the Physical Evaluation Board were ``short-changed'' \nand had not received appropriate disability benefits. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, since the enactment of the Traumatic \nServicemembers Group Life Insurance program at least 45 percent of \nclaims have been denied. In March 2006 the Comptroller General issued \nGAO Report 06-362: Military Disability System: Improved Oversight \nNeeded to Ensure Consistent and Timely Outcomes for Reserve and Active \nDuty Service Members--the Department of Defense did not heed the \nrecommendations provided in this report and as a result injured and \nwounded warriors continue to languish in an inefficient and adversarial \ndisability system.\n  I am also introducing legislation to fix the disability benefits \nsystem for our wounded warriors. When I've visited Walter Reed, one \ncommon thread uniting the problems is the disjointed and unfair process \nfor evaluating disabilities. There were only three lawyers and one \nparalegal assigned to Walter Reed's entire evaluation process. Compare \nthat to 4,000 Army JAG lawyers assigned to active duty, the National \nGuard, and the Reserves.\n  The ``Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors \nAct of 2007'' will restore disability benefits for wounded and injured \nmembers of the Armed Forces. The act will direct reviews of disability \nclaims, traumatic injury claims, and the Physical Evaluation Board \nprocess. Additionally, the ``Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured \nand Wounded Warriors Act of 2007'' will increase the availability of \nlegal counsel for members appealing their disability cases, and direct \nthe Comptroller General to provide a follow up report on the efforts \ncurrently being made by the Department of Defense to address certain \ndeficiencies in the Disability Evaluation Systems; the adequacy of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Disability Schedule for Ratings as it \nrelates to the nature of wounds our warriors suffer in combat today; \nand to report on the standards and procedures of Physical Evaluation \nBoards.\n  So I am proposing an up-and-down review of previously-denied cases \nand failed appeals, an independent review of traumatic injury claims \nunder the Traumatic Servicemembers Group Life Insurance program where \nup to 45 percent of claims have been denied, and a fix to ensure \nmembers have the proper liaison and legal assistance when appearing \nbefore the Physical Evaluation Board. We must stop short-changing our \nwounded warriors.\n  Finally, I am introducing the Protecting Military Family Financial \nBenefits Act of 2007 to close gaps in coverage for the Death Gratuity \nand Survivor Benefits beneficiaries and improve pre-deployment \ncounseling and services for all members of the Armed Forces.\n  Every day single-parents deploy to distant battlefields and leave \ntheir minor children in the care of a financially ill-prepared guardian \nor caretaker. Unfortunately, when tragedy strikes and a military \nservicemember makes the ultimate sacrifice, minor dependent children \nand families are excluded from benefits and entitlements. In too many \ncases pre-deployment counseling and help are under-funded or \nunavailable.\n  These provisions will add an option for members of the Armed Forces \nto designate guardians or caretakers as a beneficiary for Death \nGratuity benefits for care of dependent children and to receive \nannuities under the Survivor Benefit Plan for care of dependent \nchildren. These options do not exist under current law.\n  The Department of Defense will be required to commission an \nindependent panel to review and assess military pre-deployment \ncounseling and services, and implement recommended changes and best \npractices within 120 days of receiving the report. This review will \ninclude pre-deployment counseling and services available for unmarried \nmembers of the Armed Forces with dependent children, unmarried single \nmembers without dependent children, and married members with or without \ndependent children.\n  Specifically, what level of counseling or services are available for \nthese members to maximize financial protections for the proper care of \ntheir surviving dependents under the Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance, Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Death \nGratuity, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Survivor Benefits \nPlan, and benefits payable under the Social Security Act.\n  The review will include the preparation and maintenance of Family \nCare Plans for single-parents including elements for such plans \nrelating to death\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\nbenefits, wills, powers of attorney, trusts, safeguarding of the plan \nduring deployment, and the acknowledgement of specific guardian and \ncaretaker duties relating to use of financial benefits for the care of \nminor dependent children.\n  Finally, this review will determine the adequate level of resources \navailable at military pre-deployment centers including: the \navailability of legal and financial counseling, training level of pre-\ndeployment counselors, Family Support Group involvement, availability \nof PTSD screening, and availability of suicide prevention counseling.\n  Let us all join together in accepting our responsibility as a nation \nto those who serve and resolve to improve their care for traumatic \nbrain injuries, reform their disability benefits, and fix their \nsurvivor benefits.\n  I ask unanimous consent letters of support for this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Military Officers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the 362,000 members of \n     the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), I am \n     writing to express our support for your leadership in \n     sponsoring the ``Heroes at Home Act of 2007'' that will \n     improve the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury \n     (TBI) in current and former military members. This is a key \n     step in closing the gap and providing for a more seamless \n     transition between DoD and the VA.\n       We are proud of the sacrifice our military members and \n     their families are willing to make for our country. For those \n     wounded servicemembers, their sacrifices represent an \n     especially unique population that deserves special attention. \n     Like you, we are particularly concerned about those who bear \n     the burden of what has been diagnosed as TBI, the ``signature \n     wound'' for this War on Terrorism.\n       MOAA appreciates your dedication to our military community \n     and for taking the lead in sponsoring this very important \n     measure to help improve the quality of life of our wounded \n     troops and family members. Your legislation will facilitate \n     diagnosing servicemembers with TBI early in the health care \n     and rehabilitation process, it will provide a program that \n     will ensure family caregivers have the resources and training \n     they need to care for their loved ones, and allows for a \n     demonstration project to evaluate existing technology and \n     identify effective telehealth or telemental health resources \n     within the DoD and VA systems.\n       MOAA thanks you for introducing this legislation. We look \n     forward to working closely with you in seeking timely \n     enactment of this legislation in the 110th Congress.\n           Sincerely and Thank You,\n                                                  Norbert R. Ryan,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National Military\n\n\n                                     Family Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 29, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The National Military Family \n     Association (NMFA) is the only national organization whose \n     sole focus is the military family and whose goal is to \n     influence the development and implementation of policies that \n     will improve the lives of the families of the Army, Navy, Air \n     Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and the Commissioned Corps \n     of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration. For more than 35 years, its staff \n     and volunteers, comprised mostly of military members, have \n     built a reputation for being the leading experts on military \n     family issues. On behalf of NMFA and the families it serves, \n     we commend your proposal of the Heroes at Home Act of 2007 \n     that builds on previous legislation.\n       The National Military Family Association supports this \n     legislation addressing several issues affecting military \n     service members, veterans and their families. Traumatic Brain \n     Injury (TBI) has been found to be the signature wound of \n     service members serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom. Establishing a protocol for \n     obtaining a baseline measurement for cognitive functioning of \n     service members would provide a better understanding of TBI. \n     NMFA is concerned with the lack of knowledge regarding mild \n     and moderate TBI incidents, its long term effects on service \n     members and potential long-term impact on the resources \n     required by the DoD and VA health care systems. Also, \n     research on TBI will help to identify better methods for \n     diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Establishing a \n     training and certification program for family caregivers \n     recognizes the important commitment family members make in \n     caring for their loved ones diagnosed with TBI.\n       Access to health care and counseling is a major challenge \n     facing returning service members and veterans living in rural \n     areas. Telehealth and telemental health services would offer \n     an alternative to long travel time and encourage service \n     members and veterans to make greater use of these needed \n     services. Additionally, partnering with existing resources \n     offers an efficient way to deliver these services.\n       Thank you for your support of military service members and \n     veterans diagnosed with TBI, and the families who care for \n     them. If you have any questions you may contact Barbara \n     Cohoon in our Government Relations department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tanna K. Schmidli,\n     Chairman, Board of Governors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Academy of Neurology,\n\n                                     St. Paul, MN, March 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Academy of Neurology \n     (AAN), representing over 20,000 neurologists and neuroscience \n     professionals, believes that our veterans deserve the best \n     possible care and treatment for neurological injuries \n     sustained in their service to our country. The conflicts in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan have created an emerging epidemic of \n     traumatic brain injury (TBI) among combat veterans.\n       For that reason, we are proud to support your Heroes at \n     Home Act of 2007. TBI is associated with cognitive \n     dysfunction, post-traumatic epilepsy, headaches and other \n     motor and sensory neurological complications. It is essential \n     that the federal government provide all veterans with access \n     to the necessary neurological interventions and long-term \n     treatments that their injuries require. The Heroes at Home \n     Act of 2007 makes great steps towards providing that care.\n       Specifically, the AAN strongly supports the Act's \n     provisions to implement fully pre- and post-deployment \n     cognitive and memory screening of all active duty and reserve \n     personnel.\n       The AAN also supports the bill's provision to expand \n     telehealth and telemental health services offered by the VA \n     to improve the surveillance and treatment of veterans with \n     TBI and related seizure disorders. Ongoing outreach to \n     veterans suffering TBI is essential, especially those who are \n     discharged and return to rural communities.\n       Lastly, the AAN supports the Heroes at Home Act's \n     implementation of a national program to train veterans who \n     have experienced a TBI, their family caregivers and personal \n     care attendants in the skills necessary to manage the long-\n     term consequences of TBI.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas R. Swift,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Brain Injury Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       McLean, VA, March 28, 2007.\n     Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Brain Injury Association of \n     America enthusiastically endorses the ``Heroes at Home Act of \n     2007'' as a critical move forward in meeting the \n     rehabilitation and emotional adjustment needs of traumatic \n     brain injury (TBI) survivors of Operation Iraq Freedom (OIF) \n     and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).\n       The Brain Injury Association of America and its nationwide \n     network of state affiliates commend you for recognizing the \n     critical role played by family caregivers in facilitating \n     recovery from brain injury and for addressing the pressing \n     need to increase support for these caregivers by providing \n     access to education, training and financial compensation.\n       The Brain Injury Association of America also applauds the \n     steps this bill takes to establish a protocol for the \n     assessment and documentation of cognitive functioning of each \n     member of the Armed Forces both before and after deployment, \n     including appropriate mechanisms to permit the differential \n     diagnosis of TBI and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in \n     returning service members. It is time to make use of the \n     increased availability of superior technology in detecting \n     and treating TBI among all Armed Services personnel.\n       The Brain Injury Association of America is proud to endorse \n     the ``Heroes at Home Act of 2007,'' and commends your \n     leadership on one of the most important issues related to the \n     War on Terror, the unanticipated high incidence of traumatic \n     brain injuries among America's brave service members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Susan H.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) \n     strongly supports your legislation entitled the ``Heroes At \n     Home\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\n     Act of 2007'' that you will soon be introducing. We are \n     especially grateful that, included in your legislation are \n     provisions brought to your attention by our organization. \n     These provisions require the Department of Defense to perform \n     a pre-deployment cognitive assessment on all servicemembers \n     and will require the Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     establish a Personal Care Attendant (PCA) Training and \n     Certification program for family caregivers of severely brain \n     injured servicemembers.\n       Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has been called the \n     ``signature wound'' of the Global War on Terror. Many wounded \n     servicemembers have received cognitive evaluations upon \n     returning from deployment, but question the value of their \n     assessment as no baseline test was conducted prior to the \n     injury. The adoption of a ``Pre-Deployment Cognitive \n     Assessment'' would assist both the Departments of Defense and \n     Veterans Affairs in the diagnosis and treatment of brain \n     injured servicemembers and, in some cases, help enhance the \n     ability to distinguish between Post Traumatic Stress Disorder \n     (PTSD) and TBI.\n       The second provision, the ``Traumatic Brain Injury Family \n     Caregiver Personal Care Attendant (PCA) Training and \n     Certification program'' would offer family members serving as \n     the primary caregivers for severely traumatically brain \n     injured servicemembers training and certification from the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a personal care \n     attendant. They would also then qualify for VA payment for \n     services rendered to the TBI veteran in their care. In many \n     circumstances, the family caregiver is forced to leave his/\n     her job to provide the necessary care for their loved one, \n     leaving the entire family in an adverse economic situation. \n     In these cases, the family member often develops critical \n     skills to assist in the servicemember's care but have been \n     denied financial compensation for such labor. This program \n     would be offered through the four Tier I VA Polytrauma \n     centers on a rotating and regular basis.\n       These provisions, as well as the Telehealth and TeleMental \n     Health study, contained in the ``Heroes At Home Act'' will go \n     far towards insuring the long term health and well-being of \n     service members incurring Traumatic Brain Injury. Again, WWP \n     thanks you for your leadership on these issues and we stand \n     committed to assisting you in seeing this legislation through \n     to passage and enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Melia,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 1066. A bill to require the Secretary of Education to revise \nregulations regarding student loan repayment deferment with respect to \nborrowers who are in postgraduate medical or dental internship, \nresidency, or fellowship programs; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kerry, Durbin, \nand Feingold to introduce the Medical Education Affordability Act, \nMEAA. The purpose of this bill is to make medical and dental education \nmore affordable.\n  Upon graduation from college, students who can demonstrate economic \nhardship are eligible to extend their student loan deferment for up to \n3 additional years. Using the economic hardship deferment, a formula \nthat takes into account earnings and debt level, the majority of \nmedical and dental residents defer repayment of their student loans \nuntil the end of their residency period. Unfortunately, for those \nspecialties that require a residency of more than 3 years--OB/GYN, \npsychiatry, general surgery, and oral maxillofacial dentistry to name a \nfew--student loan repayment begins before a resident's medical or \ndental education is completed. This situation creates an enormous \nfinancial burden for residents who have, in most cases, incurred \nsignificant debt. In 2006, the average indebtedness for graduating \nmedical students was $130,000, for graduating dental students it was \n$145,465. While lenders are currently required to offer forbearance to \nmedical and dental students, this is an expensive option as interest \ncontinues to accrue and may be capitalized more.often.\n  The Medical Education Affordability Act would solve this problem by \nextending the economic hardship deferment to cover the entire length of \na medical or dental residency. By altering the definition we are \nremoving a significant financial obstacle facing students with \nresidency periods longer than 3 years. I want to stress again, \nresidents will still have to demonstrate economic hardship--MEAA only \nextends the deferment for borrowers that continue to meet the debt-to-\nincome requirements of the economic hardship deferment.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in support of \nmedical education by signing onto this bill. By working together, I \nbelieve that the Senate as a body can act to ensure that more \nindividuals are able to pursue a full range of medical specialties. I \nask unanimous request that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Education \n     Affordability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATION REVISION REQUIRED.\n\n       (a) Action Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education shall \n     revise the regulations of the Department of Education that \n     are promulgated to carry out the provisions relating to \n     student loan repayment deferment under the Federal Family \n     Education Loan Program under part B of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.), the William \n     D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program under part D of title IV \n     of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.), and the Federal \n     Perkins Loan Program under part E of title IV of such Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 1087aa et seq.), which are promulgated under sections \n     682.210, 685.204, and 674.34 of title 34, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (b).\n       (b) Requirements.--The student loan repayment deferment \n     regulations shall be revised to provide, with respect to a \n     borrower who is in a postgraduate medical or dental \n     internship, residency, or fellowship program, that if the \n     borrower qualifies for student loan repayment deferment under \n     the economic hardship provision--\n       (1) the deferment shall be available for the length of the \n     internship, residency, or fellowship program if the program--\n       (A) must be successfully completed by the borrower before \n     the borrower may begin professional practice or service; or\n       (B) leads to a degree or certificate awarded by a health \n     professional school, hospital, or health care facility that \n     offers postgraduate training; and\n       (2) the borrower shall not be required to apply annually \n     for such student loan repayment deferment during the length \n     of the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 1067. A bill to require Federal agencies to support health impact \nassessments and take other actions to improve health and the \nenvironmental quality of communities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1068. A bill to promote healthy communities; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, next week is National Public Health week--a \nweek to raise awareness about the importance of public health all \naround this Nation. I applaud the efforts of the American Public Health \nAssociation in organizing events across the country to assist in this \nawareness building.\n  We all know the alarming statistics demonstrating the worsening \nhealth status in both children and adults in this Nation. Without \nintervention, 1 in 3 children born in 2000 can expect to develop \ndiabetes in their lifetime because of obesity resulting from poor \nnutrition and sedentary lifestyles. In my home State of Illinois, we \nhave the highest number of lead-poisoned children in the Nation because \nof the large amount of older housing in places like Chicago. And asthma \nrates are on the rise in minority populations, reflecting worsening air \nquality in many areas.\n  But what many don't know is how, and the degree to which, changes in \nthe environment are contributing to this health decline. Yet, study \nafter study has shown that environmental factors can be just as \nproblematic as poor genes in causing disease.\n  While working as a community organizer in the mid-1980s on Chicago's \nsouth side, I became intimately aware of the impact of the built \nenvironment on public health. One of the neighborhoods in which I \nworked was bordered by the highly polluted Calumet River on one side \nand railroad tracks on the other side. People didn't just grow up in \nthis neighborhood--generation after generation stayed in a community \nwith pollutants and extremely limited access to physical activity and \nhealthy\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nliving. This image stays with me and is a motivating force to improve \ncommunity design that includes all members of society.\n  The American Public Health Association and countless other expert \norganizations have shown us that if we make a real commitment to, and \ninvestment in, building healthy communities, we can substantially \nimprove the health of children and adults.\n  There are many simple ways we can do this. Whenever we build a new \nhighway or a new condo complex, we could also build a park where kids \ncan play. Whenever we plan new communities, we could put grocery \nstores, restaurants and post offices within easy walking distance. We \ncould take steps to ensure that factories or power plants aren't \nlocated near schools. We could ensure that kids are not exposed to lead \nhazards. And we could encourage the development of ``green'' homes and \nbuildings that decrease energy consumption.\n  And that is why I come to the floor today to reintroduce the Healthy \nPlaces Act, and the Healthy Communities Act. The Healthy Places Act \nwould help State and local governments assess the health impact of new \npolicies or projects, whether it's a new highway or a shopping center. \nAnd once the health impact is determined, the bill gives grant funding \nand technical assistance to help address the potential health problems. \nAnd while we already know a great deal about the relationship between \nthe built environment and the health status of residents, the bill \nsupports additional research so we can look into new environmental \nhealth hazards.\n  The Healthy Communities Act goes hand in hand with the Healthy Places \nAct, calling for the assessment of the impact of federal policies on \nenvironmental health and justice. To make sure our policy decisions are \nnot hurting public health, this legislation requires an Environmental \nHealth Report Card for each state and the Nation at large. Since areas \nwith poor environmental health tend to be disproportionately fiscally \npoor as well, this legislation establishes health action zones that \nqualify for grant assistance to address these problems. And since much \nmore remains to be understood in this arena, the bill calls for \nenvironmental health research and for environmental health workforce \ndevelopment.\n  We as a society are moving in the direction of designing communities \nwith healthy living and public health in mind. For example, in Chicago, \ncity leaders recognized the lack of grocery stores in many lower income \nneighborhoods, forcing families to go without fresh foods. To address \nthis issue, the city's Department of Planning and Development developed \na program called Retail Chicago, which used redevelopment funds to \nattract local developers to build grocery stores in low-income \nneighborhoods.\n  While we celebrate the success of such local efforts, we must call \nupon the Federal Government to provide adequate support. And we must \nensure that all segments of society reap the rewards of building and \nmaintaining healthy communities. I thank you for this time, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Healthy Places Act and the Healthy \nCommunities Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1069. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act regarding \nearly detection, diagnosis, and treatment of hearing loss; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introdnce the Early Hearing \nDetection and Intervention Act of 2007. This bill is a companion bill \nto H.R. 1198, introduced in the House by Representative Lois Capps. I \nam pleased to be joined again this year by my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, who has long been a champion of the hearing impaired. \nTogether we worked to address hearing impairment in children in 1999, \nand today we unite again to achieve even greater progress for children.\n  The number of Americans with a hearing loss has doubled during the \npast 30 years. Most of us associate hearing problems with the aging \nprocess, and it is true that the largest group of Americans suffering \nfrom hearing impairment are those in the 65 to 75 year age range. At \nthe same time, each year more than 12,000 babies in the United States \nare born with permanent hearing loss. With another 2 to 3 of every \n1,000 newborns suffering partial hearing loss, this is the number one \nbirth defect in America. Unfortunately, hearing loss can go undiagnosed \nfor years.\n  In recent years, scientists have stressed how crucial the first years \nof a child's life are to their future development. Specialists in \nspeech and language development tell us that the crucial period for \ndeveloping speech and communication in a child's life can begin as \nearly as 6 months of age. Many babies with hearing loss experience \ndelays in speech, language, and cognitive development which compromises \nthe foundation they need for later schooling and success in society. \nThis makes early detection and intervention of hearing loss a necessity \nif we are to ensure that all our children get the strong start they \ndeserve.\n  The ability to hear is a major element of one's ability to read and \ncommunicate. To the extent that we can help infants and young children \novercome disabilities detected early in life, we will improve their \nability to function in society, receive an education, obtain meaningful \nemployment, and enjoy a better quality of life. Without early diagnosis \nand intervention, these children are behind the learning curve, \nliterally. before they have even started. They should not be denied a \nstrong start in life simply for the lack of a simple screening test.\n  For 50 years, expert commissions and task forces have emphasized the \nneed to detect hearing loss early. In 1989, concerned about the lack of \nprogress in this area, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop set a goal that \nby the year 2000, all infants--at least 90 percent of all births or \nadmissions--would be screened for hearing loss prior to discharge from \nhospital. Subsequent Federal initiatives, combined with improved \ntechnology and concerted action from hospitals and State agencies, have \nsince led to dramatic advances in procedures for early identification. \nBy the beginning of 1993, about a dozen hospitals had instituted \nessentially universal screening--defined as testing at least 90 percent \nof all newborns or infants admitted, prior to discharge. In 1997, an \nexpert panel at the National Institute of Deafness and Other \nCommunication Disorders recommended that the first hearing screening be \ncarried out before an infant is 3 months old in order to ensure that \ntreatment can begin before 6 months of age. The panel also recommended \nthat the most comprehensive and effective way of ensuring screening \nbefore an infant is 6 months old is to have newborns screened before \nthey are sent home from the hospital. Yet a 1998 report by the \nCommission on Education of the Deaf estimated that the average age at \nwhich a child with congenital hearing loss was identified in the United \nStates was a 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years old, with many children not being \nidentified until 5 or 6 years old.\n  Today we have seen substantial progress in screening, 69 percent of \nbabies are now screened for hearing loss before one month of age. This \nis an increase of 47 percent compared to back in 1998. That improvement \nis the result of a bipartisan effort I undertook with Senators Harkin \nand Frist in 1999 when we introduced the Newborn and Infant Hearing \nScreening and Intervention Act of 1999.\n  That act helped states to establish programs to detect and diagnose \nhearing loss in all newborn children and to promote appropriate \ntreatment and intervention for newborns with hearing loss. The \nlegislation funded research by the National Institutes of Health to \ndetermine the best detection, diagnostic, treatment and intervention \ntechniques and technologies.\n  The legislation we are introducing today builds on that success. The \nbill we are introducing today provides the additional assistance \nnecessary to help States in implementing programs to ensure that all \nour newborns are tested and to ensure that those identified with a \nhearing impairment get the help they need. Therefore, this legislation \nassures that reasonable action will be taken to identify hearing loss \nwithin the groups of newborns and infants, so we reach each child as \nearly as possible. Furthermore, the bill supports the recruitment, \nretention, education, and training of qualified personnel and\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\nhealth care providers, which will provide us with the healthcare \nprofessionals we need. And finally the legislation sets targets for a \nlong-term follow-up. It requires the development of models that reduce \nthe loss to follow-up of newborns and infants who are identified with a \nhearing loss through screening.\n  A baby born today will be part of this country's future. Surely we \nowe it to that child to give them a strong start on that future by \nensuring that if they do have a hearing impairment it is diagnosed and \ntreatment started well before their first year of life is completed. I \nurge my colleagues to join with Senator Harkin and myself in supporting \nthe Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2007.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1069\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enhance the \nsocial security of the Nation by ensuring adequate public-private \ninfrastructure and to resolve to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, \nand prosecute elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with my colleagues, Senator Blanche \nLincoln, Senator Gordon Smith and Senator Herb Kohl, I rise to \nintroduce the Elder Justice Act of 2007.\n  Senators Lincoln, Smith, Kohl and I introduced similar legislation \nlast Congress and former Senator John Breaux and I were the lead \nsponsors of the Elder Justice Act in the 107th and 108th Congresses, \nwith the strong support of Senators Lincoln, Smith and Kohl. While the \nlegislation has been reported unanimously by the Finance Committee in \nthe 109th and 108th Congresses, it, unfortunately, has not become law. \nI am here to say that will not be the case this Congress.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the provision of \nthe Elder Justice Act. This legislation establishes an Elder Justice \nCoordinating Council to make recommendations to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services on the coordination of activities of the Federal, \nState, local and private agencies and entities relating to elder abuse, \nneglect and exploitation. It also provides a first time direct funding \nstream separate from the Social Services Block Grant for adult \nprotective services. In addition, the Elder Justice Act creates an \nadvisory board to create a short and long-term multidisciplinary \nstrategic plan for the developing field of elder justice.\n  The legislation creates new forensic centers to promote detection and \nincrease expertise--new programs will train health professionals in \nboth forensic pathology and geriatrics. The bill also authorizes $10 \nmillion for national organizations or States that represent or train \nlong-term care ombudsman representatives to provide training, technical \nassistance, demonstration programs and research to improve ombudsman \neffectiveness in addressing abuse and neglect in nursing homes and \nassisted living facilities.\n  In addition, the Elder Justice Act requires immediate reporting to \nlaw enforcement of crimes in a long-term care facility. It also allows \nthe seven State demonstration projects authorized through the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003 to be completed and directs the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to report the findings to the appropriate \ncongressional committees no later than six months after the completion \nof the demonstration projects. The bill also authorizes $500,000 to \ndetermine the efficacy of establishing and maintaining a national nurse \naide registry. Finally, the legislation authorizes $20 million in \ngrants to enhance long-term care staffing through training and \nrecruitment to establish employee incentives including career and wage \nbenefit ladders and programs to improve management practices.\n  With more than 77 million baby boomers retiring over the next three \ndecades, we cannot wait any longer for this legislation to pass. One of \nmy top priorities of the 110th Congress is having the Elder Justice Act \nsigned into law. Older Americans deserve nothing less.\n  In closing, our legislation has been endorsed by the Elder Justice \nCoalition, a national membership organization dedicated to eliminating \nelder abuse, neglect, and exploitation in America. This coalition, \nwhich has been a strong advocate and supporter of the Elder Justice \nAct, has over 500 members.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can provide \nolder Americans the same protections that we provide to our children \nand victims of domestic violence.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nElder Justice Act of 2007. As in previous Congresses, I am an original \ncosponsor and fully support the bill's goals and passage. I want to \nthank Senators Hatch,\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\nLincoln and Smith for their continued leadership to make sure that our \nNation finally acts in a comprehensive way to prevent elder abuse.\n  Our Nation has for far too long turned its back on the shame of elder \nabuse. Congress has held hearings on the devastating effects of elder \nabuse for a quarter of a century. With this bill, we are finally saying \nenough is enough--elder abuse is unacceptable and we are going to act \nto stop it.\n  This bill takes several important steps to make improvements to what \nis now an inadequate system of protection for our vulnerable elders. \nFirst, it boosts funding for the long-term care ombudsman program, \nwhich serves as an advocate for the elderly and disabled in long-term \ncare. It also establishes an adult protective services grant program \nand forensics centers that are charged with developing expertise on \nelder abuse. In addition, it elevates the importance of elder justice \nissues by creating a coordinating council of Federal agencies that will \nmake policy recommendations and submit reports to Congress every 2 \nyears. And the legislation requires the Departments of Labor and Health \nand Human Services to take a proactive role in funding initiatives \naimed at improving training programs and working conditions for long-\nterm care professionals as a strategy for increasing the number of such \nworkers during the coming years.\n  As much as I support this bill, however, I am disappointed that it \ndoes not include one important policy that can prevent abuse--a common-\nsense background check system that can screen out potential workers \nwith serious criminal convictions that may put fragile seniors in long-\nterm care at risk.\n  Almost every day, we read terrible stories about elderly patients who \nare beaten, sexually assaulted, or robbed by the very people who are \ncharged with their care. Research shows that many instances of elder \nabuse could be avoided by a simple background check. It is time to put \nin place a nationwide system that can detect and prevent elder abuse. \nThe seven-State pilot program that began in 2003 is an excellent start. \nAlready, it is showing that States can successfully implement \ncomprehensive, cost-effective programs that consolidate checks from \nState registries, State criminal records, and FBI records. In the \ncoming weeks, I plan to introduce legislation that will take steps to \nmake these pilot programs a reality for all States. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this effort.\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Hatch, Lincoln, and Smith for their \ncommitment to the cause of elder justice. The legislation we are \nintroducing today will go a long way to focusing more attention on \nsolutions for elder abuse, and developing new approaches to improve the \nquality of long-term care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 1072. A bill to require Federal agencies to conduct their \nenvironmental, transportation, and energy-related activities in support \nof their respective missions in an environmentally, economically, and \nfiscally sound manner, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the bill that I introduce today seeks to \ncodify the initiatives announced by President Bush in January of this \nyear in his Executive order to strengthen Federal environmental, \nenergy, and transportation management. The bill would require the head \nof agencies to improve their agency's energy efficiency and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions through the reduction of energy intensity by 3 \npercent annually through the end of fiscal year 2014 or by 30 percent \nby the end of fiscal year 2014.\n  The bill would require that at least half of an agency's statutorily \nrequired renewable energy consumed in a fiscal year come from a new \nrenewable source and allows agencies, to the extent possible, to \nimplement renewable energy generation projects on agency property. The \nbill would also set energy efficiency goals for water consumption, \nacquisition of goods and services, operation of Government vehicles, \nand the acquisition of electronic products.\n  This bill would put the Federal Government at the forefront of the \nNation's efforts to improve our energy efficiency and ultimately reduce \nour greenhouse gas emissions.\n  A September 2002 report from the U.S. Department of Energy entitled, \nU.S. Lighting Market Characterization. Volume I: National Lighting \nInventory and Energy Consumption Estimate, states that 38 percent of \nall energy consumed in the United States is used to generate \nelectricity and that lighting consumes 22 percent of all the \nelectricity produced in the United States.\n  Lighting consumes a significant percentage of the Nation's energy \nproduction. Because of this consumption, the bill would also require \nthe Federal Government to take the lead in the use of energy efficient \nlight bulbs. The bill does not specify any particular technology, but \nwould define energy efficient light bulbs as those with an efficiency \nrating of not less than 30 lumens per watt. This definition would \nchange from 30 lumens per watt to 45 lumens per watt in the year 2018. \nThe replacement of low energy efficient light bulbs to more energy \nefficient light bulbs on Federal properties would be required to be \ncompleted within the next 5 years.\n  Many of the new energy efficient bulbs, such as compact fluorescent \nlight bulbs, contain mercury. The bill would require that a disposal \nplan be developed to support the use of these bulbs and their proper \ndisposal.\n  As the Nation looks to take advantage of the new energy efficient \nlight bulbs at significant savings to individual households and \nbusinesses, the Federal Government should lead the way. The Government \nshould be setting the standard for energy efficiency. This bill would \nmandate Federal Government leadership in this area with substantial \nsavings in our energy consumption.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these legislative concepts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1073. A bill to amend the Clear Air Act to promote the use of \nfuels with low lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, to establish a \ngreenhouse gas performance standard for motor vehicle fuels, to require \na significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Collins and \nSnowe to introduce legislation that will significantly reduce the \namount of greenhouse gases emitted from our Nation's transportation \nsector.\n  This bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from passenger \nvehicles and motor vehicle fuels by 22 percent below projected levels \nunder business as usual by 2030. This reduction is equivalent to the \nremoval of 662 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the \natmosphere or taking over 108 million cars off the road for a year. \nThis would save 3.6 million barrels of oil per day by 2030.\n  It would achieve these reductions by requiring a: 3 percent reduction \nin emissions from the motor vehicle fuel pool by 2015, with an \nadditional 3 percent reduction every 5 years, and 30 percent reduction \nin vehicle tailpipe emissions by 2016, with additional reductions every \n5 years.\n  Highway vehicles are responsible for 32 percent of annual U.S. \nemissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary global-\nwarming gas. And, motor vehicle emissions will continue to increase as \nmore and more Americans purchase vehicles and the number of miles \ndriven grows.\n  With more than 240 million motor vehicles on the road, producing 2 \nbillion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, increasing \nour use of low carbon fuels is an essential part of a climate-safe \ntransportation strategy.\n  So, the signs could not be clearer: It's time to sound the death-\nknell for the era of gas-guzzling motor vehicles. It is time to utilize \nimproved vehicle technology and to increase access to cleaner, \nrenewable fuels at the pump.\n  First, this bill will achieve this goal by increasing the \navailability of low carbon emitting fuels for motor vehicles.\n  We must start considering fuel emissions not only in terms of \nemissions produced at the tailpipe, but also in terms of the emissions \ngenerated by the production and transportation of fuels. The total \nemissions of a fuel,\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\nfrom production to end-use, are known as the ``lifecycle emissions'' of \na fuel.\n  Not all fuels are created equal in terms of emissions; in fact, not \nall fuels within a give fuel category are created equal.\n  For example, ethanol produced from corn emits only about 10 to 20 \npercent less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy delivered \ncompared to petroleum-based gasoline. In contrast, ethanol produced \nfrom cellulosic biomass achieves an 80 to 90 percent reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy.\n  Electricity would also qualify as an alternative fuel under this \nbill. The lifecycle emissions of electricity produced by traditional \ncoal-fired power plants will be far greater than that produced by wind \nor other zero-carbon electricity generation technologies.\n  By 2009, this bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) to quantify the total lifecycle emissions of all motor vehicle \nfuels. The bill would also require EPA to develop a fuel labeling \nprocess to provide this information to consumers at the pump.\n  Armed with this information about the lifecycle emissions of \ndifferent fuels, oil refiners and importers would be required to reduce \nthe greenhouse gas emissions of their entire fuel pool by 3 percent \nbelow projected levels by 2015. And, every 5 years thereafter, \nemissions would be cut by an additional 3 percent.\n  To help fuel providers meet the mandated emissions reductions in a \ncost-effective manner, the bill would establish a carbon-credit trading \nmarket.\n  This would reduce emissions from motor vehicle fuels by 10 percent \nbelow projected levels by 2030 and would increase the supply of low-\ncarbon fuels such as biodiesel, E-85, hydrogen, electricity, and \nothers.\n  Second, the bill would achieve reductions in transportation sector \nemissions by federalizing California's landmark tailpipe emissions \nstandard. California passed a landmark law in 2002 that required a \nreduction in tailpipe emissions and was the first State in the country \nto do so. This would require automakers to reduce tailpipe emissions, \nsuch as carbon dioxide, by 30 percent by 2016. It will also require EPA \nto tighten the reductions every 5 years.\n  Combined, these provisions would achieve a 22 percent reduction in \ntransportation sector emissions below projected levels by 2030.\n  Additional provisions in the bill mandate: auto manufacturers to \noptimize dual-fueled vehicles to improve their fuel economy when \nrunning on alternative fuels, and alternative fuel vehicles, and only \nalternative fuel vehicles, come with a green fuel cap. This would alert \nconsumers that these vehicles can accept other fuels besides \ntraditional gasoline.\n  Just as it is necessary to reduce emissions in the electricity and \nindustrial sectors, it is equally necessary to reduce emissions from \nthe transportation sector. This bill makes significant, yet feasible, \nstrides to reduce emissions through upgrades in vehicle technology and \nthe incorporation of lower lifecycle emission fuels into the motor \nvehicle fuel pool. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1073\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for direct access to electronic tax return \nfiling, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am delighted to reintroduce the Free \nInternet Filing Act as the tax filing deadline approaches. The bill \nrequires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide universal access \nto individual taxpayers filing their tax returns directly through the \nIRS Web site. I thank Senator Bingaman for cosponsoring this bill and \nworking with me on taxpayer rights issues.\n  It is frustrating that individual taxpayers completing their own \nreturns are still not able to electronically file directly with the \nIRS. Taxpayers are dependent on commercial preparers to electronically \nfile their taxes. If taxpayers take the time necessary to prepare their \nreturns by themselves, they must be given the option of electronically \nfiling directly with the IRS. My legislation would make this direct \nfiling possible.\n  The current system, the Free File Alliance, provides only a select \ngroup of taxpayers with the ability to file electronically for free \nusing third party intermediaries. The current Free File Alliance \nagreement is a failure because it leaves out too many taxpayers. \nTaxpayers that make more than $52,000 are not eligible.\n  Taxpayers should not have the additional worry associated with \nsharing their private financial information with a tax preparation \ncompany. In an era when there have been so many electronic breaches of \nfinancial information, taxpayers should not be forced to hand over \ntheir private information if they want to electronically file their \nreturn with the IRS. Taxpayers should not lose out on the benefits of \nelectronic filing simply because they are worried about sending their \ndata to third parties.\n  IRS Commissioner Mark Everson has stated, ``E-file is the fastest, \nsafest, and most accurate way to file a tax return. People will get \ntheir returns faster through E-file. E-file greatly reduces the chances \nfor making an error compared to filing a paper 1040.'' I simply want to \nprovide every individual taxpayer the ability to electronically file \ntheir taxes at no cost and without having to use a commercial tax \npreparer.\n  My legislation will lead to an increase in the number of \nelectronically filed returns. Approximately 45 million returns prepared \nusing software are mailed in rather than electronically filed. With \nuniversal access to free e-file, this number could be substantially \nreduced. Electronic filing helps taxpayers receive their refunds faster \nthan mailing in paper returns.\n  My legislation would also reduce errors and IRS administrative costs. \nAccording to Mr. Bert Dumars, the Director of the IRS Electronic Tax \nAdministration, it costs 55 to 75 cents to process an electronic return \nwhile it costs\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\nabout two dollars to process a paper return. In addition, the error \nrate for electronic returns is one percent while the error rate for \npaper returns is 20 percent.\n  We have an obligation to make free electronic filing available to all \nindividual taxpayers. Electronic filing benefits both taxpayers and the \nIRS. I have appreciated the attention paid to this issue by Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley. I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto enact the Free Internet Filing Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from the \nHawaii Alliance for Community-Based Economic Development be included in \nthe Record. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support \nfrom the National Consumer Law Center, Consumer Federation of America, \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group, California Reinvestment Coalition, \nCenter for Economic Progress, Consumer Action, and the Neighborhood \nEconomic Development Advocacy Project, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Free Internet Filing Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DIRECT ACCESS TO E-FILE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     provide individual taxpayers with the ability to \n     electronically file their Federal income tax returns through \n     the Internal Revenue Service website without the use of an \n     intermediary or with the use of an intermediary which is \n     contracted by the Internal Revenue Service to provide free \n     universal access for such filing (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``direct e-file program'') for taxable \n     years beginning after the date which is not later than 3 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Development and Operation of Program.--In providing for \n     the development and operation of the direct e-file program, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (1) consult with nonprofit organizations representing the \n     interests of taxpayers as well as other private and nonprofit \n     organizations and Federal, State, and local agencies as \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary,\n       (2) promulgate such regulations as necessary to administer \n     such program, and\n       (3) conduct a public information and consumer education \n     campaign to encourage taxpayers to use the direct e-file \n     program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     the direct e-file program. Any sums so appropriated shall \n     remain available until expended.\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--\n       (1) Report on implementation.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall report to the Committee on Finance of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives every 6 months regarding the status of the \n     implementation of the direct e-file program.\n       (2) Report on usage.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the National Taxpayer Advocate, shall \n     report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     annually on taxpayer usage of the direct e-file program.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 28, 2007.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The National Consumer Law Center (on \n     behalf of its low-income clients), Consumer Federation of \n     America, Consumer Action, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group, California Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Economic \n     Progress, and the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy \n     Project write to support your bill entitled the ``Free \n     Internet Filing Act.'' Consumer groups have long advocated \n     for what the Free Internet Filing Act would provide--the \n     ability of taxpayers to electronically file their returns \n     without the need for a third party intermediary.\n       Enabling taxpayers to file electronically directly with the \n     Internal Revenue Service will benefit taxpayers tremendously. \n     It will save taxpayers the fees charged by some commercial \n     preparers for electronic filing. Unlike the current Free File \n     program established by the IRS, the Free Internet Filing Act \n     will provide taxpayers with free electronic filing without \n     the potential of being subject to cross-marketing pitches for \n     financial products which may not be in their best interests. \n     While the marketing pitches for refund anticipation loans and \n     other ancillary products were dropped this year from the Free \n     File program, such a limitation is not enshrined in law or \n     regulation.\n       The Free Internet Filing Act will also help taxpayers to \n     keep their information private. By allowing free direct \n     electronic filing with the IRS, taxpayers will have the \n     ability to bypass commercial preparers that might exploit or \n     share their personal, confidential tax information for non-\n     tax purposes.\n       We believe the IRS should have been required a long time \n     ago to establish free direct electronic filing. For many \n     years, Americans have been able to apply for federal student \n     financial aid on www.fafsa.ed.gov and Social Security \n     retirement benefits at www.ssa.gov. A free direct electronic \n     filing program at www.irs.gov is long overdue.\n       If you have any questions about this letter, please contact \n     Chi Chi Wu. Thank you again for all your efforts to protect \n     taxpayer rights.\n           Sincerely,\n         Chi Chi Wu, Staff Attorney, National Consumer Law Center; \n           Jean Ann Fox, Director of Consumer Protection, Consumer \n           Federation of America; David Marzahl, Executive \n           Director, Center for Economic Progress; Ed Mierzwinski, \n           Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest \n           Research Group (U.S. PIRG); Linda Sherry, Director, \n           National Priorities, Consumer Action; Rhea L.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Hawai'i Alliance for Community \n     Based Economic Development (HACBED) is writing in support of \n     the ``Free Internet Filing Act.''\n       HACBED is a statewide 501(c)3 organization established in \n     1992 to help maximize the impact of community-based economic \n     development organizations (CBEDOs). We pursue our mission by \n     helping CBEDOs to increase community control of their assets \n     and means of production. We accomplish this in many ways--by \n     providing technical support to help CBEDOs deal with \n     organizational issues; by networking on a local and national \n     basis for funding and financing for community-based efforts; \n     and, by advocating for communities to play a more active role \n     in the political process in order to effect systemic change. \n     To this end, HACBED has been facilitating statewide \n     conversations to develop a comprehensive asset policy agenda. \n     Core to this agenda is the recognition of the importance of \n     creating policies that assist individuals, families and the \n     broader community to build wealth.\n       Tax season is an essential time for low income families to \n     take advantage of their tax related benefits, including the \n     earned income tax credit. Electronic filing of taxes is a \n     quicker, more efficient way to process a tax return. In many \n     cases, working families must pay a professional tax preparer \n     to prepare their return and file electronically. By providing \n     free universal access to electronic filing these low-income \n     working families would be able to keep more of their hard-\n     earned dollars in their pocket.\n       HACBED fully supports this bill and we look forward to \n     working with you in the future to insure free and low cost \n     tax-related services for low-income families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Brent Dillabaugh,\n                                                  Deputy Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Stevens) (by request):\n  S1076. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nappropriations for the Federal Aviation Administration for fiscal years \n2008 through 2010, to improve aviation safety and capacity, to provide \nstable, cost-based funding for the national aviation system, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction, \nby request, of the Next Generation Air Transportation System Financing \nReform Act of 2007, the Bush administration's proposal for the Federal \nAviation Administration, (FAA), reauthorization.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I, along with vice chairman \nStevens, introduce this bill out of courtesy to the Bush \nadministration. They have outlined an aggressive proposal for the FAA \nreauthorization and while I cannot support all portions of this bill, I \nbelieve our colleagues should have an opportunity to consider the ideas \noutlined.\n  While I commend the Department of Transportation and the FAA for \ntheir work on the proposal, I have great concerns with some of the \nprovisions. Specifically, I am troubled by the proposal to dramatically \nincrease the general aviation fuel tax and substantially cut the \nAirport Improvement Program, AIP, funding level.\n  The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over the FAA and I will work \nwith Senator Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, and Senator Trent Lott,\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, along with other members of the \ncommittee, to craft a bipartisan bill that we can bring before the full \nSenate.\n  It is important that we act quickly, as the current aviation tax \nstructure expires at the end of the fiscal year. Therefore, we must \npresent our committee and this body with a bill that not only solves \nfunding issues for our Nation's air system, but also puts us on a \ncourse to fully modernize our aviation system to safely and efficiently \nhandle the increase in air traffic that is expected.\n  In the coming weeks, we will be back here with a bill that I believe \nwill gain the support of the majority of the Commerce Committee and the \nsupport of the Senate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as vice chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee I concur with my good friend and colleague. I applaud the \nadministration for moving the process forward but I echo Senator \nInouye's concerns with the proposal. I look forward to working with him \nand our colleagues on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee to craft a Committee proposal in the coming weeks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BYRD (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Isakson).\n  S.J. Res. 11. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to clarify that the Constitution \nneither prohibits voluntary prayer nor requires prayer in schools; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, West Virginians have always been a deeply \nspiritual people. Historically, we have stood fast in our devotion to \nthe Creator, even when--or especially when--faced with adversity, \ndeprivation, or misfortune. Just as we recognize that joyful events are \nbest celebrated with prayers of gratitude, we also believe that \nhardship can be endured and, in fact, diminished through the infinite \npower of the healing word.\n  As we leave for Easter recess to celebrate the resurrection, we lift \nour heads from the darkness to the light. We ask for God's blessings. \nThe Gospel at John 14:13 tells us that God answers prayer, meaning that \nhe hears us whenever we ask for anything according to his will.\n  The importance of prayer is recognized by people of faith in nearly \nevery denomination. Yet, in America, too many of our citizens belittle, \nignore, or denigrate the power of prayer. They believe that the \ndoctrine of separation of powers means that we can pray only within the \nfour walls of a house of worship, and nowhere else. But that viewpoint \ndoes not reflect the intent of the Creator.\n  Prayer, no matter where undertaken, by design, provides both \ninspiration and solace. It is comforting, particularly during a time of \nwar. No wonder, then, that prayer has always had a place in the lives \nof our military. In December 1944, General George S. Patton, Jr., \nordered Colonel James H. O'Neill, the chaplain of the Third Army, to \nproduce a prayer to the heavens, which requested clear weather. The \nprayer, written by Chaplain O'Neill, reads as follows:\n\n       Almighty and most merciful Father, we humbly beseech Thee, \n     of Thy great goodness . . . Grant us fair weather for Battle. \n     Graciously hearken to us as soldiers who call upon Thee, \n     that, armed with Thy power, we may advance from victory to \n     victory . . . and establish Thy justice among men and \n     nations. Amen.\n\n  Chaplain O'Neill's prayer was provided on behalf of all soldiers, \nregardless of denomination, when or where they prayed, and with whom. \nIt was a prayer in addition to the silent or outspoken, individual and \nvoluntary prayers of each of the enlisted men and women of the Army.\n  Although I cannot be sure of it, I would imagine that soldiers in the \nfield responded favorably to the prayer of Chaplain O'Neill. They \nassuredly did not object to his expression of faith--one in which they \nwere free to participate or not. Undoubtedly, the soldiers drew \ninspiration from the Chaplain's words.\n  Now, while our children do not normally face the mortal peril that \nU.S. troops inevitably face in a time of war, all Americans--whether \nyoung or old--in school or in battle, surely from time to time need to \ndraw upon the blessings of a higher power to face whatever tests fate \nmay throw their way on any given day.\n  Yet, one wonders what would happen if a student in an American \nclassroom today decided, of his or her own volition, to recite a prayer \nlike the one by Chaplain O'Neill. In some jurisdictions, it is probable \nthat the student would be disciplined and his/her teachers punished for \npotentially violating the First Amendment.\n  Is today's state of affairs consistent with the intent of the \nFramers? No. The Founding Fathers believed in a Supreme Being, and they \nwere proud of their faith. On February 22, 1756, John Adams wrote:\n\n       Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the \n     Bible for their only law book and every member should \n     regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited! Every \n     member would be obliged in conscience to temperance, \n     frugality, and industry; to justice, kindness, and charity \n     towards his fellow men; and to piety, love, and reverence \n     toward Almighty God . . . what a Utopia, what a paradise \n     would this region be.\n\n  As his words reflect, John Adams knew and recognized that we were and \nare a religious people.\n  The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nstate: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . .''\n  In my opinion, too many have not given equal weight to both of these \nclauses. Instead, they have focused only on the first clause, which \nprohibits the establishment of religion, at the expense of the second \nclause, which protects the right of Americans to worship as they \nplease. This country was founded by men and women of strong faith, \nwhose intent was not to suppress religion, but to ensure that the \ngovernment favored no single religion over another.\n  In particular, the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment states \nthat Congress cannot make laws that prohibit the free exercise of \nreligion. Consequently, I believe that any prohibition of voluntary \nprayer in school, either spoken aloud or recounted in silence, violates \nthe right of our schoolchildren to practice freely their religion. And \nthat's not right. Any child should be free to pray to God, of his or \nher own volition, whether at home, in church, or at school. Period.\n  I am not a proponent of repeatedly amending the U.S. Constitution. I \nbelieve that such amendments should be done only rarely and with great \ncare. However, because I feel as strongly about this today as I have \nfor over four decades, I am going to take this opportunity, once again, \nas I have at least eight times over the past 45 years, to introduce \ntoday a joint resolution to amend the Constitution to clarify the \nintent of the Framers with respect to voluntary prayer in school.\n  The language of the resolution that I am introducing today to amend \nthe Constitution simply states: ``Nothing in this Constitution, \nincluding any amendment to this Constitution, shall be construed to \nprohibit voluntary prayer or require prayer in a public school, or to \nprohibit voluntary prayer or require prayer at a public school \nextracurricular activity.''\n  This resolution is similar to legislation that I introduced or \ncosponsored starting in 1962, but more recently in 1973, 1979, 1982, \n1993, 1995, 1997, and 2006. This resolution is not a radical departure. \nIt simply reiterates what should already be permissible under a correct \ninterpretation of the First Amendment. It does not change the language \nof the First Amendment, and it would not permit any school to advocate \na particular religious message endorsed by the government. The \nresolution seeks neither to advance nor to inhibit religion. It does \nnot signify government approval of any particular religious sect or \ncreed. It does not compel a ``non-believer'' to pray. In fact, it does \nnot require an atheist to embrace or adopt any religious action, \nbelief, or expression. It does not coerce or compel anyone to do \nanything, and it does not foster excessive government entanglement with \nreligion.\n  This Constitutional Amendment simply allows children to pray, \nvoluntarily, if they wish to do so. The Supreme Court has held that the \nEstablishment Clause is not violated so long\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\nas the government treats religious speech and other speech equally. The \nresolution has a preeminently secular purpose, which is to ensure that \nreligious and non-religious speech are treated equally.\n  The First Amendment is to secure religious liberty. Justice Stevens \nhas written that, ``nothing in the Constitution as interpreted by this \nCourt prohibits any public school student from voluntarily praying at \nany time before, during or after the school day.''\n  Similarly, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has written that the Religion \nClauses of our Constitution have ``kept religion a matter for the \nindividual conscience, not for the prosecutor or bureaucrat.''\n  And we should make certain that religion is a matter for the \nindividual conscience. But keeping religion a matter for the individual \nconscience should not mean that a schoolchild must stand silent, unable \nto turn to God for comfort or guidance in times of need. Not every \nreference to God represents the impermissible establishment of \nreligion. Instead, let us make certain that every individual, including \nevery schoolchild, can be assured of his/her right to pray voluntarily \nto God, as he/she pleases, consistent with the intent of the Framers, \nwho wrote the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4215-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 134--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2007 AS ``ADOPT A SCHOOL \n                            LIBRARY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Coleman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, When I was growing up in East St. Louis, I \nspent hours reading about faraway places, exciting adventures, and \nhistoric figures and events. I spent countless hours in the library \ndiscovering wonderful stories and developed a lifelong love of reading.\n  Now imagine going to school where the library is dark and uninviting, \nand where there is no librarian in sight. These conditions are real. I \nhave visited schools in my home State of Illinois and seen libraries \nthat show their years of neglect.\n  The dire circumstances that face some of these school libraries are \nnot due to lack of concern by school officials. School leaders are \nworking with limited budgets and unforgiving performance standards. \nSchool libraries were once one of the central features of our school, \nbut are now one of the first programs to be cut.\n  In Cairo, IL, there is no money available for new books. The \nsuperintendent told me that his school libraries would have no books at \nall if it were not for the donations from the local community. In \nCollinsville, school libraries had science books so outdated they were \npublished before man landed on the moon. We cannot expect our students \nto compete in today's global economy unless we provide them with the \ntools that they need to succeed.\n  Many studies have demonstrated the strong link between high-quality \nschool libraries and student achievement, both in the classroom and on \nstandardized tests. School libraries benefit all students, regardless \nof race, class, or family situation. According to a study by the \nIllinois School Library Media Association, students average 5 percent \nto 13 percent higher on their reading and writing test scores when \ntheir libraries are well-funded. Students in schools with more current \ncollections in their libraries scored 7 percent to 13 percent higher in \nreading and writing in lower grades and 3 percent higher on college \nentrance exams. In Illinois, additional computers in school libraries \nled to an 8-percent increase in the reading performance of fifth to \neighth graders, and to an 11-percent increase in the writing scores for \neighth graders. The data is consistent and clear: All of our children \nare more likely to succeed when their school possesses a high-quality \nschool library.\n  Many groups recognize the importance of school libraries and are \ndoing something about it. In particular, I commend the Heart of America \nFoundation, which is focused on improving some of the Nation's most \nneedy school libraries. In impoverished communities where many \nlibraries have one book or less per student, Heart of America tries to \nbring the collections of these libraries up to at least the national \naverage of 22 books per student. Its READesign program offers intensive \ncare for school libraries through renovation, revitalizing technology, \nand replenishing book shelves. Heart of America makes READesigns a \ncommunity effort by bringing together individuals, corporate sponsors, \nand community groups to provide schools with ``library makeovers.'' The \ntransformation of these school libraries is truly extraordinary. It \ngoes beyond simply painting and restocking the bookshelves. After a \nREADesign, a school library once again becomes a welcoming and vibrant \ncenter of learning, books, and technology.\n  I am confident that others will be as inspired by the READesign \nprogram and the potential of our school libraries as I am. In \ndesignating September 2007 as ``Adopt a School Library Month,'' it is \nmy hope that individuals will remember the importance of school \nlibraries in facilitating the academic achievement of our children and \nsupport needy school libraries in their respective communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4215-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4215-S4216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 135--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n          UNITED STATES SHOULD SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE FOR KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Smith) \nsubmitted the followoing resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 135\n\n       Whereas the United States has enduring national interests \n     in the peace and security of southeastern Europe, and in the \n     greater integration of the region into the Euro-Atlantic \n     community of democratic, well-governed states;\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\n       Whereas, in March 1999, the United States, along with other \n     members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), \n     commenced military action aimed at ending Slobodan \n     Milosevic's brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the \n     people of Kosovo;\n       Whereas that military action resulted in the defeat of Serb \n     forces and the creation of the United Nations Mission in \n     Kosovo, an interim United Nations administration that governs \n     Kosovo, and which ended, de facto, the sovereignty that was \n     previously exercised by the Government of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia over Kosovo;\n       Whereas the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States have served bravely in Kosovo since 1999, and their \n     presence and participation in the NATO-led Kosovo Force has \n     been indispensable in protecting the people of Kosovo and \n     stabilizing the region;\n       Whereas United Nations administration was never intended \n     nor understood as a permanent solution to the political \n     status of Kosovo;\n       Whereas, in light of NATO's military intervention in Kosovo \n     and the United Nations trusteeship established in Kosovo \n     pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 \n     (1999), the international community has recognized the \n     political circumstances in Kosovo as unique, and the \n     settlement of Kosovo's status therefore does not establish a \n     precedent for the resolution of other conflicts;\n       Whereas continuing uncertainty about the status of Kosovo \n     is unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of the \n     inhabitants of Kosovo, inhibits economic and political \n     development in Kosovo, and contributes to instability and \n     radicalism in both Kosovo and Serbia;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the United Nations Secretary-General \n     appointed the former President of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, \n     as United Nations Special Envoy for Kosovo to develop a \n     comprehensive settlement proposal to resolve the political \n     status of Kosovo;\n       Whereas, in March 2007, after 14 months of intensive \n     diplomacy, Special Envoy Ahtisaari submitted to the Security \n     Council a comprehensive settlement proposal that would result \n     in supervised independence for Kosovo, with robust \n     protections for the rights of minorities; and\n       Whereas Special Envoy Ahtisaari has explored every \n     reasonable avenue for compromise in the course of his \n     diplomacy and has stated that further negotiations would be \n     counterproductive: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should support the independence of \n     Kosovo in accordance with its currently constituted borders, \n     a resolution that represents the only just, sustainable \n     solution for an economically viable and politically stable \n     Kosovo;\n       (2) the United States should, in consultation and \n     cooperation with its allies, vigorously and promptly pursue a \n     United Nations Security Council resolution that endorses the \n     recommendations of United Nations Special Envoy for Kosovo \n     Martti Ahtisaari;\n       (3) in the absence of timely action by the United Nations \n     Security Council, the United States should be prepared to act \n     in conjunction with like-minded democracies to confer \n     diplomatic recognition on, and establish full diplomatic \n     relations with, Kosovo as an independent state, much as the \n     United States worked in cooperation with like-minded \n     democracies to protect the people of Kosovo in 1999;\n       (4) the United States should oppose any delay in the \n     resolution of the political status of Kosovo as \n     counterproductive, potentially dangerous, and likely to make \n     the achievement of a lasting settlement more difficult;\n       (5) the United States should work together with the \n     European Union as a full partner in supporting the political \n     and economic development of an independent Kosovo;\n       (6) the United States should support the integration of \n     Kosovo into international and Euro-Atlantic institutions, \n     including its timely admission to the Partnership for Peace \n     program of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), \n     with the ultimate goal of full membership in NATO;\n       (7) the United States should reaffirm its commitment to \n     southeastern Europe, including the continuation of the \n     military mission in Kosovo to deter and disrupt any efforts \n     by any party to destabilize the region through violence;\n       (8) the Government of Kosovo should exercise responsible \n     leadership under supervised independence and thereby \n     accelerate the transition to full independence, taking \n     particular care to reassure, protect, and ensure the full \n     political and economic rights of Serb and other minority \n     communities in Kosovo;\n       (9) the Government of Kosovo should make every reasonable \n     effort to develop a cooperative relationship with the \n     Government of Serbia, in recognition of its legitimate \n     interests in the safety of the Serb population in Kosovo and \n     in the protection and preservation of the patrimonial sites \n     of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo; and\n       (10) the Government of Serbia should exercise responsible \n     leadership and seize the opportunity and the imperative \n     presented by the independence of Kosovo to end the dark \n     chapter of the 1990s and focus its energies toward achieving \n     a prosperous and peaceful future through regional cooperation \n     and integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions, including \n     NATO and the European Union, and toward the establishment of \n     open, constructive relations with the government of Kosovo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4216-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 136--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONDEMNING \nTHE SEIZURE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN OF 15 BRITISH NAVAL PERSONNEL IN \n IRAQI TERRITORIAL WATERS, AND CALLING FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE, SAFE, AND \n                         UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBrownback, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Casey, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Clinton, \nMrs. Dole, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Smith) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 136\n\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2007, a naval vessel of the United \n     Kingdom, the HMS Cornwall, was conducting routine operations \n     in Iraqi territorial waters pursuant to United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1723 (2006) and in support of the \n     Government of Iraq;\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2007, a boarding team consisting of 7 \n     Royal Marines and 8 sailors embarked in 2 of the boats of the \n     HMS Cornwall to conduct a routine boarding of an Indian \n     flagged merchant vessel pursuant to the authorization of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723 (2006);\n       Whereas, as Vice Admiral Charles Style, Deputy Chief of the \n     British Defense Staff (Commitments), demonstrated in a \n     presentation on March 28, 2007, ``the merchant vessel was 7.5 \n     nautical miles south east of the Al Faw Peninsula, . . . 29 \n     degrees 50.36 minutes North 048 degrees 43.08 minutes East. \n     This places her 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi territorial \n     waters. This fact has been confirmed by the Iraqi Foreign \n     Ministry.'';\n       Whereas at some point shortly after completion of the \n     successful inspection of the merchant ship, the two United \n     Kingdom vessels were surrounded and escorted by Iranian \n     Islamic Republican Guard Navy vessels toward the Shatt `Al \n     Arab Waterway and into Iranian territorial waters;\n       Whereas, as Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary of the \n     United Kingdom, stated to the House of Commons on March 28, \n     2007, even the coordinates of the seizure event that were \n     given by Iran's Ambassador to the United Kingdom at the \n     Ambassador's first meeting with United Kingdom officials were \n     themselves in Iraqi waters;\n       Whereas Foreign Secretary Beckett noted in that same \n     statement that authorities of the Government of Iran provided \n     ``corrected'' coordinates of the incident on March 25, 2007, \n     claiming that the event took place in Iranian waters;\n       Whereas the merchant vessel that was boarded had remained \n     anchored since the time it was boarded, and on March 25, \n     2007, its location was verified to be in Iraqi waters;\n       Whereas Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair \n     stated on March 25, 2007, that ``there is no doubt at all \n     that these people were taken from a boat in Iraqi waters.

Mr. President, this week, our Nation comes together to \nhonor one of our Nation's foremost civil rights and labor leader, Cesar \nEstrada Chavez. I rise today, along with my colleague Senator Ken \nSalazar, to submit a resolution honoring the accomplishments and legacy \nof Cesar Chavez.\n  Cesar Estrada Chavez was born 80 years ago, on March 31, 1927, in \nArizona to poor migrant farm workers. He and his family struggled to \nsurvive at a time when ``Whites only'' signs were still on display and \nwhen it was necessary to trade in his school books to support his \nfamily working full-time in the fields.\n  ``But rather than just survive those times, Cesar Chavez turned his \nexperiences into ammunition to help fight for a better life for all \nAmericans, becoming one of our Nation's most inspirational leaders.\n  Following the principles of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King \nJr., in 1962 Cesar Chavez co-founded the first successful farm workers \nunion in the United States--the United Farm Workers (UFW). Through the \nUFW, Chavez brought many farm workers together, including Mexican- and \nFilipino-Americans, to fight for common goals. He also inspired hope in \nthese workers through his great rallying catchphrase, ``Si Se Puede.''\n  In one of their major victories, after 5 years of boycotting table \ngrapes, the United Farm Workers gained the first-ever collective \nbargaining agreement between farm workers and growers in the history of \nour country.\n  As the son of poor, working-class parents who were not afforded the \nbenefits of a union, I am moved by Cesar Chavez's selfless work on \nbehalf of others. Remembering his legacy reinforces my belief that all \nhard-working individuals deserve the right to bargain collectively to \nachieve better wages, better health benefits and suitable working \nconditions.\n  I am happy that New Jersey has a proud labor tradition, which would \nnot have been possible without people committed to fairness, social \njustice and equality. The legacy of Cesar Chavez still resonates today, \nfrom the rural agricultural fields to the urban centers all across this \nNation, and his achievements are an inspiration to all hard-working \nAmericans who want to achieve a better quality of life.\n  Senator Robert F. Kennedy rightly said that Cesar Chavez was ``one of \nthe heroic figures of our time,'' and I believe our resolution \nreinforces that statement. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution, and by doing so, acknowledge that Cesar Chavez is \ntruly an American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4217-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4217-S4218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 139--COMMENDING GENERAL PETER J.

Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate took an \nimportant step for our troops and for the security of our Nation. For \nthe first time since this ill-conceived war began more than 4 years \nago, a bipartisan majority of the Senate told the President to change \ncourse in Iraq. As the American people know, this war has lasted going \ninto 5 years, costing the lives of more than 3,200 Americans and tens \nof thousands of wounded troops, many of whom I met yesterday at Walter \nReed. It has also depleted our Treasury of over $400 billion.\n  Despite these facts and the brave sacrifice of our troops, the \nviolence continues unabated in Iraq. Our troops are enmeshed in an \nunquestionable civil war. The people who attacked us on 9/11 have not \nbeen brought to justice, and America is less secure today than it was \non 9/11.\n  After all of that, one would think every Member of this body would \nrecognize we are on the wrong path. The more we look at this, it is \nclear that more of the same will not produce a different result; that \nsuccess requires a different course. As General Petraeus has said, \nthere is no military solution in Iraq. In fact, he said only 20 percent \ncan be solved militarily; the rest has to be solved diplomatically and \neconomically. That is clear.\n  Unfortunately, as evidenced by the votes of many of my Republican \ncolleagues and the words of the minority leader on the floor earlier \ntoday, this is not the case. There are still too many Members of this \nbody, including the minority leader, who are willing to give this \nadministration a blank check and a green light to proceed down this \nfailed path. It is a long path, with failure every step of the way.\n  The supplemental spending bill contains an important change of course \nin the President's Iraq policy, something we, as a separate, \nindependent branch of Government, have the right to do. Our Founding \nFathers, when they drafted the Constitution 220 years ago, set forth \nthe few words that have directed this country for more than two \ncenturies: that there would be three separate branches of Government, \nnot any one more powerful than the other--the House and the Senate make \nup the legislative branch, the judiciary, and executive branches of \nGovernment.\n  We have every right to do what we did. For 6 plus years the President \nhas ignored us. The Republican House and Senate have given him \neverything he has wanted. But now there is a new Congress. He can't do \nthat anymore. We have constitutional responsibilities. We have to \nfulfill those responsibilities.\n  On November 7 the American people spoke very clearly. They said: We \nwant a change of course in Iraq. That is what we legislated this week.\n  The supplemental spending bill contains important changes in the \ncourse of the President's Iraq policy. Given the importance and urgency \nof this legislation, I am surprised to hear the minority leader \ndiscredit this bill and the need to change course in Iraq the way he \ndid earlier today. Senate Democrats believe our troops should get the \nfunding they need without further delay. The only question is whether \nPresident Bush and the Senate Republicans will prevent that from \nhappening.\n  The Senate has now acted and the ball is squarely in the President's \ncourt. However, before even being presented with the final version of \nthe legislation, the President has promised a veto. This appears to be \nnothing more than a strategy designed to score political points, not \ndoing a thing to assist the troops. I am sorry the minority leader has \nbecome a facilitator of that strategy.\n  Senate Democrats will continue to fight to provide the troops the \nfunds they need and a real strategy for success. We have taken an \nimportant step in that direction this week, and we will continue to \npress the President and congressional Republicans to join us in this \neffort.\n  This is our constitutional responsibility. I am disappointed and \nsomewhat in a state of disbelief that our President would threaten a \nveto without even seeing the final legislation. We have obligations, \nand we are going to fulfill those obligations.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to speak?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I came to hear the majority leader's \nconcluding comments and to put a statement in the Record.\n  Mr. REID. I do have to say to Senator Specter, I haven't had a chance \nto compliment him lately, but I have done it in the past. Even though \nit has been 25 years since I practiced law, I look back with great, \nfond memories of my practice of law. I did a lot of trial work. From \nthe first day I arrived in Washington, I recognized the intellectual, \nlegal brilliance of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I say that without \nany question. He is someone who has made Washington a better place \nbecause of his probative questions always. I appreciate having the \nopportunity to congratulate the Senator once again on his skill as a \nlawyer. He has used it well in the Senate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am grateful to the distinguished \nmajority leader for those comments. I am going to drop in on his \nspeeches more often. Now that I know what to expect, I will show up on \nall occasions.\n  Senator Reid is a distinguished lawyer and a trial lawyer. He \nexhibits those skills on this floor with frequency and fluency and \nerudition. Every now and then our legal training comes through.\n  We have just finished a lengthy proceeding in the Judiciary Committee \non the issue of the resignation of the U.S. attorneys. The \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, former U.S. attorney, was \nthere and participated. We are determined to find out all the facts \nbefore coming to judgment.\n  In the course of those proceedings, there were a lot of questions, \nand some of the legal skills of a number of the people were present. We \nhave a great many lawyers on the Judiciary Committee. We have some who \nare not lawyers. All performed well today.\n  Again, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, through the Chair, say to my \nfriend from Pennsylvania, one of the things we learn as lawyers, which \nis certainly important, and I wish it would rub off on all Members of \nthis body--I have been in trials with people, and these have been tough \ncases, but we would walk out of there, shake hands, and become better \nfriends as a result of our adversarial positions.\n  I wish that would happen on the Senate floor more often. We can \ndisagree on issues, but it should not make us disagreeable. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and I, on rare occasions, have \ndisagreed on issues, but instead of weakening our bonding, it \nstrengthens it because it reminds us--I am confident for him as it does \nme--of our days in the courtroom, where you would have someone whom you \nwould oppose on an issue, but it\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\ndid not mean you opposed them as a person. We would have a \nresponsibility. We were simply doing as a lawyer what that person we \nrepresented would have done if they had our education and training.\n  So as we finish this very difficult week, I again say I look back \nwith such----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, one addendum to what the majority leader \nhas said; that is, the interaction among Members is not understood \nunless you either are a keen observer of the Senate or have been here \nfor a while. But the relationships are very important. It is the \ndevelopment of skills on accommodation.\n  One of the facets about the Senate that has always intrigued me is \nwhat happens between the votes when we are all captive here, so to \nspeak. You have to wait a while for late Senators to show up--though \nnot as long with the new majority leader--and there are conversations \nthat go on. A tremendous amount of business is transacted. In a sense, \nit is like there is a certain aspect of a social event--not quite a \ncocktail party without cocktails--but a lot of business is transacted. \nThere are a lot of accommodations and a lot of learning about \npersonalities and how to come together on issues.\n  We have too much partisanship in this body. This aisle that separates \nthe Democrats and the Republicans is too wide much of the time. But \nthere are also occasions where we come together and work together. I am \npleased to say in the last few days I think we are going to meet the \nmajority leader's timetable on an immigration bill, where we have to \ncome together.\n  It is experience and relationships and skills which lead us to many \nconclusions, notwithstanding all of our problems. Nobody said it better \nthan Churchill, that the system has lots of failings, but it is the \nbest compared to any other system. Sometimes we muddle through, but at \nleast we get through.\n  Well, I see the real Republican leader on the floor, so I am going to \ngive him his podium.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, I would say, in closing here, one of the things I \nhave found in this legislative body that is so unique is, if a Member \nof the Senate gives their word to a Democrat or Republican, or whatever \ncombination thereof, that is it; there need be nothing in writing. The \nagreements that are made in this body last for years and years. Once \nyou tell a Member of this body: ``This is the deal we have,'' that is \nthe way it is, and I have never had anyone change that. On one \noccasion, I am sure it happened. I am sure it was from a \nmisunderstanding. But in all the 25 years I have been here, all you \nneed is somebody to tell you what they are going to do, and that is the \nway it is. That speaks well of everyone serving here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4221-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1071\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 136\n\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2007, a naval vessel of the United \n     Kingdom, the HMS Cornwall, was conducting routine operations \n     in Iraqi territorial waters pursuant to United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1723 (2006) and in support of the \n     Government of Iraq;\n       Whereas, on March 23, 2007, a boarding team consisting of 7 \n     Royal Marines and 8 sailors embarked in 2 of the boats of the \n     HMS Cornwall to conduct a routine boarding of an Indian \n     flagged merchant vessel pursuant to the authorization of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723 (2006);\n       Whereas, as Vice Admiral Charles Style, Deputy Chief of the \n     British Defense Staff (Commitments), demonstrated in a \n     presentation on March 28, 2007, ``the merchant vessel was 7.5 \n     nautical miles south east of the Al Faw Peninsula, . . . 29 \n     degrees 50.36 minutes North 048 degrees 43.08 minutes East. \n     This places her 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi territorial \n     waters. This fact has been confirmed by the Iraqi Foreign \n     Ministry.'';\n       Whereas at some point shortly after completion of the \n     successful inspection of the merchant ship, the two United \n     Kingdom vessels were surrounded and escorted by Iranian \n     Islamic Republican Guard Navy vessels toward the Shatt `Al \n     Arab Waterway and into Iranian territorial waters;\n       Whereas, as Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary of the \n     United Kingdom, stated to the House of Commons on March 28, \n     2007, even the coordinates of the seizure event that were \n     given by Iran's Ambassador to the United Kingdom at the \n     Ambassador's first meeting with United Kingdom officials were \n     themselves in Iraqi waters;\n       Whereas Foreign Secretary Beckett noted in that same \n     statement that authorities of the Government of Iran provided \n     ``corrected'' coordinates of the incident on March 25, 2007, \n     claiming that the event took place in Iranian waters;\n       Whereas the merchant vessel that was boarded had remained \n     anchored since the time it was boarded, and on March 25, \n     2007, its location was verified to be in Iraqi waters;\n       Whereas Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair \n     stated on March 25, 2007, that ``there is no doubt at all \n     that these people were taken from a boat in Iraqi waters. It \n     is simply not true that they went into Iranian territorial \n     waters.''; and\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has yet to release the 15 \n     British sailors it has been holding captive since seizing the \n     sailors from Iraqi waters on March 23, 2007: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the seizure by \n     the Government of Iran of 15 British naval personnel from \n     Iraqi territorial waters as a provocative and illegal act; \n     and\n       (2) calls for the immediate, safe, and unconditional \n     release of the personnel from captivity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4223-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4223-S4224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2007 AS ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS \n                            AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to talk to you about an important \nresolution that the Senate adopted today: the Asbestos Awareness Week \nresolution. This resolution recognizes the first week in April as \nNational Asbestos Awareness Week.\n  This resolution acknowledges the dangerous nature of asbestos. \nImportantly, it gives tribute to hundreds of thousands of people who \nhave died from exposure.\n  To me, this resolution is very personal Deaths from exposure to \nasbestos are common in my home State of Montana--all too common. Libby, \nMT is a small community in the western part of Montana. Libby is a very \nunique place.\n  It is surrounded by the beauty and splendor of the Cabinet Mountains. \nBut it is also plagued with sickness and disease. The extent of \nasbestos contamination in Libby, the number of people who are sick, the \namount of people who have died from asbestos exposures just staggering.\n  The community of Libby suffers from asbestos related diseases at 40 \nto 60 times higher than the rest of the country. Folks in Libby are \ndiagnosed with mesothelioma, the deadly form of cancer from asbestos, \nat 100 times higher than the average rate.\n  Mesothelioma recently took the life of a very dear friend of mine \nfrom Libby--Les Skramstad. Just a few weeks ago, I came to the floor to \ntalk about Les and how he was an outspoken advocate for Libby.\n  Until the day he died, Les worked tirelessly to share his story and \nthe story of Libby's quiet emergency.\n  The first night I met Les in January of 2000, he challenged me to \nhelp all those in Libby suffering from asbestos-related diseases. Les \nchallenged me ``to do something.''\n  He said: Max, please, as a man like me--as someone's father too, as \nsomeone's husband, as someone's son, help me. Help us. Help us make \nthis town safe for Libby's sons and daughters not even born yet. They \nshould not suffer my fate too. I was a miner and\n\n[[Page S4224]]\n\nbreathed that dust in. Everyday I carried that deadly dust home on my \nclothes. I took it into our house and I contaminated my own wife and \neach of my babies with it too. I just don't know how to live with the \npain of what I have done to them.\n  If we can make something good come of this, maybe I'll stick around \nto see that, maybe that could make this worthwhile.\n  I told him I would do all that I could, that I wouldn't back down, \nand that I wouldn't give up. Les accepted my offer and then pointed his \nfinger and said to me: I'll be watching, Senator.\n  I have kept my promise to Les and I have worked hard to help people \nin Libby. I will continue to do all I can to help Libby.\n  I know that now even though Les is not with us today he is still \nwatching. Les is my inspiration.\n  Because of Les's work and other advocates in Libby, we launched the \nCenter for Asbestos Related Diseases in Libby--called the CARD clinic. \nCARD has screened and provided health care to hundreds of Libby \nresidents.\n  Screening is an essential part of making sure people get the help \nthey need. Spreading the word about asbestos exposure is also vital to \nensure that people who are sick get the treatment they deserve.\n  The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization is a leader in this \nfight. They work tirelessly to advocate on behalf of asbestos victims \nso that thousands more in the future should not suffer the same fate.\n  Along with the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, others in the \nLibby community such as Gayla Benefield and Dr. Brad Black have worked \nto educate people about the dangers of asbestos exposure.\n  Then there are also those who have left Libby, but continue to \nadvocate on behalf of asbestos victims such as Margy Urnberg and Kenny \nand Karen Moss, all former residents of Libby and remarkable \nvolunteers.\n  An asbestos awareness week will help spread the word about the \ndeadliness of these fibers and bring relief to those who suffer from \nasbestos-related diseases. I will continue to fight for those like Les, \nwhose lives have been taken by asbestos. I made a promise to Les and I \nwon't stop until I have fulfilled that promise.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record as if given, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to H.R. 1132.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1132) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to provide waivers relating to grants for preventive health \n     measures with respect to breast and cervical cancers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of \nH.R. 1132, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Reauthorization Act of 2007, \na program that the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and I have \nworked closely to reauthorize. H.R. 1132, like our companion bill S. \n624, reauthorizes the successful Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program. The legislation authorizes increased funding for \nthis program to $275 million over 5 years and provides States with \ngreater flexibility to reach priority, hard to reach populations \nincluding women living in rural areas and racial and ethnic minorities.\n  Senator Hutchison and I would like to clarify with the chairman and \nranking member the intent of the new waiver demonstration project. The \nlegislation authorizes the establishment of a waiver demonstration \nproject that will allow States to leverage nonFederal funds for breast \nand cervical cancer screening and follow-up services, reduce barriers \nto screening, and increase the number of women served. Non-Federal \nfunds for breast and cervical cancer services/activities are available \nin some States through State or local government sources and private \nsources. Leveraging these non-Federal funds will augment limited \navailable Federal funding and thus enable the efficient and effective \nutilization of resources to provide education and outreach to screen \nmore women. It is Congress's intent that the Secretary, acting through \nthe Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, will \nadminister the described demonstration project as part of its overall \nmanagement of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Program.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maryland \nfor her support and partnership in reauthorizing this very important \npiece of legislation, and I appreciate the assistance we received from \nChairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi, as well as the administration \nand our House colleagues. Early detection of breast and cervical \ncancers saves lives\n\n[[Page S4225]]\n\nand is essential to our fight against these devastating diseases. The \nnational early detection program has given millions of disadvantaged \nwomen access to vitally important cancer screenings, and I am proud of \nour commitment to continuing the Federal investment in these services. \nI hope that the new waiver demonstration project will provide the small \nnumber of States seeking to fully leverage private contributions the \nability to capitalize on those fund expand access and services to even \nmore women. I also look forward to the information CDC gathers in its \nreport to help guide us in ensuring we provide the most screenings for \nour Federal investment. I thank my colleagues for working with us to \nexpand this important program in our fight to reduce the number of \ncancer deaths in the United States.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend Senators Mikulski and Hutchison for their \nleadership on this issue and thank Senator Enzi for his hard work to \nget this bill through the Senate. I agree with Senator Mikulski that it \nis the intent of Congress that the Secretary, acting through the \nDirector, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, will administer \nthe described demonstration project as part of its overall management \nof the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Program.\n  Mr. ENZI. I want to thank all of the key members--Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Kennedy and others for their ongoing work and \ndedication to this program. I am glad that we have been able to \ncomplete our work today and send this bill to the Presiaent. I also \nagree that it is our intent that the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention administer the new waiver authority which is added to the \nNational Breast and Cervical Cancer Program as part of this \nreauthorization process. The waiver authority is integral to the \noverall program implementation. As such, it should remain within the \npurview of the CDC.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 682 and the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 682) to award a congressional gold medal to \n     Edward William Brooke III in recognition of his unprecedented \n     and enduring service to our Nation.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the award of a Congressional Gold Medal \nto our former colleague, Senator Ed Brooke, is eminently well-deserved, \nand I urge the Senate to approve this legislation.\n  To all of us who know Ed Brooke, he was an outstanding Senator, a \ntrue statesman, a champion of equal justice and opportunity for all, \nand a man of great conscience and compassion.\n  Senator Brooke was born in Washington, DC, not far from these \nChambers on Capitol Hill, and he graduated from Howard University. He \nhad studied medicine, intending to become a physician, but realized \nthat he was more at home in the fields of literature, political \nscience, and history.\n  After finishing his degree at Howard, he served our country in World \nWar II as a captain in the Army's segregated 366th Infantry Regiment, \nwhich fought with great courage in the Italian theater. During his \nservice, he distinguished himself not only as a gifted leader, but as a \nskilled defense counsel in court martial proceedings.\n  Returning from the war, he enrolled in Boston University Law School \nand became editor of the Law Review. After graduating, he began a \nsuccessful law practice in Massachusetts and continued his commitment \nto public service as well. He chaired the Finance Commission of Boston, \nand specialized in rooting out public corruption. His ability, energy, \nand dedication won him renown, and he was elected attorney general of \nMassachusetts, becoming the first African American in the Nation to \nhold such a position.\n  In his two terms as attorney general, he became a leader in the \nbattle against organized crime\n  In 1966, he was elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, the first \nAfrican-American Senator since Reconstruction. I vividly remember \nescorting him down the center aisle of this Chamber for his swearing \nin. At that time, the Senate was deeply involved in enacting the \nhistoric civil rights legislation of the 1960s, and I was touched by \nthe magnitude and immense symbolism of that moment for Ed and his \nfamily, for African Americans, for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \nand for the Nation as a whole.\n  When people question Ed about his significant place in history, his \nresponse is always spirited and unchanging. He didn't want to be \nremembered only as the Senate's African-American Member. During his \ncampaign for attorney general, he had said, ``I'm not running as a \nNegro. I never have. I'm trying to show that people can be elected on \nthe basis of their qualifications and not their race.''\n  Ed always saw himself in this light. Despite his other ``firsts,'' he \nwas first and foremost an American and a son of Massachusetts, and it \nwas important to him that his accomplishments and talents speak louder \nthan the color of his skin.\n  Needless to say, his heritage uniquely qualified him to combat social \ninjustice and stand as an eloquent voice for America's oppressed. He \nserved on President Johnson's Commission on Civil Disorders, which \ninvestigated the causes of the race riots in American cities at the \ntime, and the committee's recommendations became a central part of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1968.\n  When he spoke on the Senate floor in support of the extending the \nVoting Rights Act in 1975, he addressed this body with inspiring candor \nand sincerity. In a time of great turmoil and division, he was a symbol \nof hope for Americans of color throughout our Nation--hope that our \ncountry was changing, hope that the American dream was still alive.\n  Those who were intent on defeating the Voting Rights Act could not \navoid pangs of conscience as Ed declared, ``I cannot believe that in \n1975, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, we are ready to say to the \nAmerican people, black and white, red and brown, that they cannot be \nassured of the basic right to vote!'' His point was irresistible, and \nthe very next day, the Senate passed the bill.\n  Ed was passionate about opportunity for all. In his two terms with \nus, he set a high standard for public service and was a model of \nsenatorial independence, supporting measures on both sides of the aisle \nthat he felt strengthened our country, and improved the lives of all \nAmericans. He was a champion of the minimum wage, a strong voice for \nMedicare and Social Security, and an effective defender of women's \nrights. The title of his autobiography, ``Bridging the Divide,'' \npublished earlier this year, says it all. He bridged race, he bridged \nparties, and defied any conventional categorization.\n  I remember Ed discussing the difficulty of providing a home for his \nfamily after his return from World War II, at a time when race \ndisqualified him from considering certain properties. His plight was \ncharacteristic of the struggle experienced by millions of Americans at \nthat time. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 is a tribute to his leadership \nas a Senator, and long after he left the Senate, he continued the \nbattle for fair housing and opportunity as leader of the National Low \nIncome Housing Coalition.\n  As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``We must come to see that the \nend we seek is a society of peace. That will be the day not of the \nwhite man, not the black man. That will be the day of man as man.'' \nEdward Brooke is the embodiment of Dr. King's vision. He was a great \nSenator among us, he is still a caring public servant. He is a great \nAmerican, and he certainly deserves this very special tribute from \nCongress. I urge my colleagues to approve this award of the \nCongressional Gold Medal to our former colleague, Ed Brooke.\n\n[[Page S4226]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to this bill be printed in the \nRecord, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 682) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Edward William Brooke III \n     Congressional Gold Medal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Edward William Brooke III was the first African \n     American elected by popular vote to the United States Senate \n     and served with distinction for 2 terms from January 3, 1967, \n     to January 3, 1979.\n       (2) In 1960, Senator Brooke began his public career when \n     Governor John Volpe appointed him chairman of the Boston \n     Finance Commission, where the young lawyer established an \n     outstanding record of confronting and eliminating graft and \n     corruption and proposed groundbreaking legislation for \n     consumer protection and against housing discrimination and \n     air pollution.\n       (3) At a time when few African Americans held State or \n     Federal office, Senator Brooke became an exceptional pioneer, \n     beginning in 1962, when he made national and State history by \n     being elected Attorney General of Massachusetts, the first \n     African American in the Nation to serve as a State Attorney \n     General, the second highest office in the State, and the only \n     Republican to win statewide in the election that year, at a \n     time when there were fewer than 1,000 African American \n     officials in our nation.\n       (4) He won office as a Republican in a state that was \n     strongly Democratic.\n       (5) As Massachusetts Attorney General, Senator Brooke \n     became known for his fearless and honest execution of the \n     laws of his State and for his vigorous prosecution of \n     organized crime.\n       (6) The pioneering accomplishments of Edward William Brooke \n     III in public service were achieved although he was raised in \n     Washington, DC at a time when the Nation's capital was a city \n     where schools, public accommodations, and other institutions \n     were segregated, and when the District of Columbia did not \n     have its own self-governing institutions or elected \n     officials.\n       (7) Senator Brooke graduated from Paul Laurence Dunbar High \n     School and went on to graduate from Howard University in \n     1941.\n       (8) Senator Brooke's enduring advocacy for self-government \n     and congressional voting rights for the citizens of \n     Washington, DC has roots in his life and personal experience \n     as a native Washingtonian.\n       (9) Senator Brooke served for 5 years in the United States \n     Army in the segregated 366th Infantry Regiment during World \n     War II in the European theater of operations, attaining the \n     rank of captain and receiving a Bronze Star Medal for \n     ``heroic or meritorious achievement or service'' and the \n     Distinguished Service Award.\n       (10) After the war, Senator Brooke attended Boston \n     University School of Law, where he served as editor of the \n     school's Law Review, graduating with an LL.B. in 1948 and an \n     LL.M. in 1949, and made Massachusetts his home.\n       (11) During his career in Congress, Senator Brooke was a \n     leader on some of the most critical issues of his time, \n     including the war in Vietnam, the struggle for civil rights, \n     the shameful system of apartheid in South Africa, the Cold \n     War, and United States' relations with the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (12) President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Senator Brooke \n     to the President's Commission on Civil Disorders in 1967, \n     where his work on discrimination in housing would serve as \n     the basis for the 1968 Civil Rights Act.\n       (13) Senator Brooke continued to champion open housing when \n     he left the Senate and became the head of the National Low-\n     Income Housing Coalition.\n       (14) Senator Brooke has been recognized with many high \n     honors, among them the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, \n     an honor that recognizes ``an especially meritorious \n     contribution to the security or national interests of the \n     United States, world peace, cultural or other significant \n     public or private endeavors''; the Grand Cross of the Order \n     of Merit from the Government of Italy; a State courthouse \n     dedicated in his honor by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \n     making him the first African American to have a State \n     courthouse named in his honor; the NAACP Spingarn Medal; and \n     the Charles Evans Hughes award from the National Conference \n     of Christians and Jews.\n       (15) Senator Brooke's biography, Bridging The Divide: My \n     Life, was published in 2006, and he is the author of The \n     Challenge of Change: Crisis in Our Two-Party System, \n     published in 1966.\n       (16) Senator Brooke became a racial pioneer, but race was \n     never at the center of his political campaigns.\n       (17) He demonstrated to all that with commitment, \n     determination, and strength of character, even the barriers \n     once thought insurmountable can be overcome.\n       (18) He has devoted his life to the service of others, and \n     made enormous contributions to our society today.\n       (19) The life and accomplishments of Senator Brooke is \n     inspiring proof, as he says, that ``people can be elected on \n     the basis of their qualifications and not their race''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design \n     to Edward William Brooke III in recognition of his \n     unprecedented and enduring service to our Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A great man once said, ``We cannot seek achievement for \nourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community . \n. . Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and \nneeds of others, for their sakes and for our own.''\n  Those are the words of Cesar Chavez.\n  His friend, Robert Kennedy, once called Cesar Chavez ``one of the \nheroic figures of our time.''\n  He was a man of uncommon moral courage, a disciple of nonviolence who \nbelieved deeply in the promise of American democracy. He sacrificed \nmuch to extend that promise to some of the poorest people in America: \nfarm workers.\n  ``Yes, we can.'' That was Cesar Chavez's message to people who had \nfelt powerless against the crushing\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nhand of fate. Yes, we can make a better life for ourselves and our \nchildren. Yes, we can overcome injustice, without resorting to \nviolence.\n  His words and his work inspired not only the Latino farmworkers with \nwhom he lived but all Americans.\n  This coming Saturday, March 31, would have been Cesar Chavez's 80th \nbirthday. In California, where his birthday is a legal holiday, and in \nhomes and communities throughout our Nation, Americans will pause over \nthe next few days to remember and celebrate the life and legacy of this \ngreat man.\n  Cesar Chavez was the founder of the United Farm Workers Union, a \nlabor and civil rights leader. He established the first collective \nbargaining agreement between farmworkers and growers in the United \nStates. That agreement allowed farmworkers to negotiate for safer and \nbetter working conditions--for such simple, basic human needs such as \nthe right to a drink of clean water after hours working in a hot field.\n  In 1993, at the age of 66, Cesar Chavez died--his great heart \nweakened by the many fasts he had conducted to call attention to the \nplight of farmworkers. But his legacy lives on.\n  In a time when our Nation is at war and the income and equality gaps \nare again widening in America, we would do well to remember the lessons \nof peace and social justice from the life of Cesar Chavez.\n  There is no better way to promote his legacy than to continue these \nteachings in our communities and especially among our young people.\n  In my State of Illinois, schools set aside 1 day in the month of \nMarch as ``Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning.'' It is an idea \nthat was introduced by our Lieutenant Governor, Pat Quinn, in 2004. \nStudents in kindergarten through high school learn about Cesar Chavez's \nlife and beliefs in the classroom, and they also learn about his ethic \nof service and social responsibility by participating in community \nservice projects.\n  Here in Congress, as we debate the war, the Federal budget, and other \nmatters that affect the lives of so many people so profoundly, perhaps \nwe should have our own Cesar Chavez Day of Service and Learning.\n  We would do well to remember his challenge: ``We cannot seek \nachievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for \nour community . . . Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the \naspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own.''\n  Can we make America better, more just--a more perfect union? In the \nwords of Cesar Chavez, ``Yes, we can.'' It is not easy, but it can be \ndone. And it is up to each of us to try.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4227-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BRADLEY UDALL TO BE A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF \n               THE MORRIS K.

I would also say, Mr. President, that I have conferred with \nthe Republican leader, and there is no reason that we will have any \nvotes scheduled for Tuesday, the day we return. Monday is a legal \nholiday, and Tuesday we are going to start the stem cell debate. The \ndebate on that will last for at least 2 days, so there is no reason we \nwill need to come back for a vote on Tuesday. People will have plenty \nto do here, and the vote would just interrupt that.\n  I have told the Republican leader, and he acknowledges that is \nprobably the right thing to do. So we will have no votes on Tuesday. \nThe first vote will be sometime on Wednesday.\n  If there is no further business today, I would turn to the Republican \nleader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would just say to the majority leader \nthat I agree there is no necessity to have a vote on Tuesday, the week \nafter next, and I think we will proceed with the debate on the stem \ncell proposals and be ready to vote on Wednesday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I failed to announce, but it was very \nimportant, those numbers that we read off were two very important \nambassadorships: Ford M. Fraker, to be the Ambassador to the Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia; Zalmay Khalilzad, who, of course, has served so well in \nIraq and is now going to be the Ambassador to the United Nations. That \nis very important, and I am glad we did that.\n\n  One thing I did not mention is, for all Senators and staff, our \nDemocratic caucus, which is normally held on Tuesday, we are going to \nhave that on Wednesday. It is obvious now, with no votes on Tuesday, \nthat is probably the right thing to do. So, for all Democrats, we will \nhave our caucus on Wednesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, likewise on this side of the aisle, we \nwill be having our policy luncheon, which normally happens on Tuesday, \non Wednesday. We have already notified our members of that, but it \nbears repeating here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/29/senate-section/article/S4227-5", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4227-S4228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 2007, AT 10 A.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
