Mr. President, on the morning of October 30, 1929, \nPresident Herbert Hoover awoke the day after the biggest one-day stock \nmarket crash in American history, surveyed the state of the U.S. \neconomy and declared:\n\n       The fundamental business of the country, that is production \n     and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous \n     basis.\n\n  In the coming weeks and months after that, President Hoover remained \nin an economic bubble, unaware of the extreme suffering of ordinary \nAmericans--even declaring that anyone who questioned the state of the \neconomy was a ``fool.''\n  For Herbert Hoover, I guess ignorance was bliss. It wasn't until the \nAmerican people replaced this out-of-touch Republican President with a \nDemocrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that our Nation's economic \nrecovery began. Yesterday, nearly 80 years after the Hoover \nadministration took America with blissful ignorance into a depression, \nthe Dow Jones industrial average dropped 504 points--the biggest one-\nday decline since trading opened after the attacks of 9/11.\n  With one major investment bank headed for bankruptcy, and another \nsold at a bargain-basement price, and one of the world's largest \ninsurance companies teetering, investors rushed to sell their shares, \nand not only in America but all over the world.\n  With our financial markets reeling, the American people are wondering \nwhether they will lose their jobs, whether they will be able to pay \ntheir child's next tuition bill, and whether their pension and \nretirement savings will be safe, or even whether their bank will \nsurvive.\n  There is no reason to think we are headed into an economic \ndepression. I believe there is no reason to panic. Yet one Senator--\nJohn McCain--woke up yesterday morning, surveyed the state of the U.S. \neconomy, summoned the ghost of his fellow Republican Herbert Hoover, \nand declared:\n\n       The fundamentals of our economy are strong.\n\n  For whom are the fundamentals of our economy strong? Certainly not \nthe 606,000 American people who have lost their jobs this year. \nCertainly it is not strong for the commuters and truckers who are \nsending more and more of their hard-earned dollars overseas to pay for \nfuel. Certainly our economy is not strong for those struggling to make \none paycheck last until the next, with record home heating prices \nlooming in the coming winter months, and the price of oil teetering \naround $4 for a gallon of gasoline. It is not strong for the cities and \ntowns that have been forced to cut back on police, schools, and \nfirefighters because their tax base is shrinking. Certainly it is not \nstrong for the millions of families who have or may soon lose their \nhomes, or the tens of millions who are seeing their home equity \nplummet.\n  No matter what George Bush, John McCain, or the ghost of Herbert \nHoover may think, this economy is not strong, and the American people \ndeserve better.\n  This is not a time for panic, but it is a time to look back on the \npast 8 years of the Bush-Hoover-McCain economics and figure out what \nbrought us to this point so we don't repeat the same mistakes.\n  The tragic truth is this disaster was avoidable. In its palpable \ndisdain for\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\nall things relating to government, the Bush-Cheney administration \nwillfully neglected the Government's most important function, which is \nto safeguard the American people from harm--not only physical harm but \neconomic harm.\n  In their simplistic philosophy of ``big business equals good, \ngovernment equals bad,'' the administration and the Republican Congress \nfailed to conduct oversight, and let the financial sector go wild.\n  Without anyone regulating their actions, market excess destroyed the \nfinancial prudence that allowed a firm such as Lehman Brothers to \nprosper for 158 years.\n  Vast fortunes were made virtually overnight, and now vast fortunes \nhave been literally lost overnight. Yesterday, we heard that Hewlett-\nPackard laid off 25,000 people. There is some talk that Lehman \nBrothers--somebody may buy them, so instead of losing 25,000 jobs, they \nwill only lose 15,000 jobs. I hope that is the case for those 10,000.\n  The unfortunate irony is that the Bush administration's zeal to favor \nbig business has crippled it and left the American people to pay the \nprice. President Bush did nothing to stop this disaster, and now he \nwill leave the mess to the next President.\n  Now our Nation must decide who is better suited to end the Bush-\nHoover economics and return sanity and security to our economy.\n  Senator McCain says the economy is not his strong suit. That is an \nunderstatement. That is what he said about himself. So John McCain went \nsearching for an economic adviser who could bolster his weakness. Who \ndid he choose? Phil Gramm. I served with Phil Gramm in the Senate--the \nsame Phil Gramm who was responsible for deregulation in the financial \nservices industry that paved the way for much of this crisis to occur. \nI like Phil Gramm, but I don't like his economics.\n  A respected economist at the University of Texas, James K. Galver, \nsaid that Gramm was: ``the most aggressive advocate of every predatory \nand rapacious element that the financial sector has'' and that ``he's \nsorcerer's apprentice of instability and disaster in the financial \nsystem.''\n  It was Phil Gramm who pushed legislation through a Republican Senate \nthat allowed firms such as Enron to avoid regulation and destroy the \nlife savings of its employees, and it was Phil Gramm's legislation that \nnow has Wall Street traders to bid up the price of oil, leaving us to \npay the bill.\n  Warren Buffett called the results of Gramm's legislation ``financial \nweapons of mass destruction.'' That is what Warren Buffet said.\n  And now the architect and leading cheerleader for every mistake and \nneglect that created the Bush-Cheney financial nightmare is whispering \ninto the ear of John McCain, who says he doesn't know much about the \neconomy. I repeat, that is an understatement.\n  Whether you call it Hoover economics, Bush economics, or McCain \neconomics, it is not a recipe for change; it is a recipe for more of \nthe same.\n  For all of the college students worried about finding a job, the \nworking families who don't know how they will pay their bills--talking \nabout families and jobs, a man is coming to visit me from Las Vegas. He \nhas two sons who are so brilliant. One of them, a few years ago, was \nthe only person in Nevada to be admitted to Harvard. He had a perfect \nscore in his SAT. He can't find a job. He is a graduate, with honors, \nfrom one of our elite ivy league schools and he cannot find a job. His \ndad is coming to talk to me to see if I can help him. His other boy is \nstill in college and, of course, worried, as I have indicated, about \nfinding a job. Working families don't know how they will pay their \nbills, and the fixed-income seniors are trying to figure out how to pay \nfor medicine. We have to do better.\n  We cannot afford another Republican President who will follow his \nparty's ghosts down the path of recession, depression, and more \nsuffering. We desperately need a President who understands that working \npeople, not industry titans, are the backbone of our country and \neconomy.\n  We need a President who will cut taxes for working people and senior \ncitizens, end the windfall profits of oil companies, and put that money \nback into the pockets of those who are paying record prices at the \npump, and put millions of Americans back to work by investing in jobs \non Main Street, not Wall Street.\n  In November, we can elect a President who will break from the past \nand invest in the future, a person of change. But until then, the \nSenate should pass our tax extenders. We need to do that. If we want to \njump-start the economy, let's pass the tax extenders for renewable \nenergy. In the State of Montana, the State of the Presiding Officer, \nrenewable energy is a job creator. On August 18 and 19, I had an energy \nsummit in Las Vegas. We had Democrats, Republicans, academics, and \npeople from the industry. I talked to the Governor from Colorado and \nasked him how his State is doing. He said they are not being hit as \nhard as others because they are creating thousands of jobs with \nrenewable energy projects. That is what the future holds for us. We \nneed to pass the energy tax extenders. I hope we can work something out \nwith the Republicans to pass other tax extenders for more than 1 year. \nWe have to get away from the 1-year deal. Let's do them for 2 years so \nthat people in the private sector can look at Congress as a friend. I \nhope we can do that.\n  I also think we have to take a look at a stimulus package that funds \ninfrastructure projects, creates jobs, prevents cuts in desperately \nneeded State services, invests in renewable energy, expanded \nunemployment benefits for victims of this administration's economy, and \nhelps working people and senior citizens afford the costs of energy.\n  I think the House of Representatives will pass the stimulus bill in \nthe coming days. I hope that today they pass the Energy bill. As I \nindicated to the distinguished Republican leader, we are going to \nfinish this Defense authorization as soon as we can. I hope to get \ncloture on it this afternoon.\n  I hope the unanimous-consent request Senator Levin will offer around \n11 o'clock--whenever we finish morning business--will be accepted. When \nwe finish that, I think there is an agreement between the Republican \nleader and me that we are going to go to the tax extenders, renewable \nfirst. We have to have a vote on AMT. We are going to vote on the other \ntax extenders. That will be helpful. It sets a great pattern for what \nwe need to do here. I hope the House follows suit and takes care of \nthat business.\n  We are going to now have a period for morning business, with Senators \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each, as soon as the Republican \nleader finishes his statement, if he has one. The Republicans will \ncontrol the first 30 minutes, and the majority will control the second \n30 minutes.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nS. 3001, the national defense authorization bill. The managers are \nworking through filed amendments to the bill. Senators should be on \nnotice that the chairman has shared a proposed unanimous consent \nagreement with Republicans and will ask for consent prior to the caucus \nrecess. If we are unable to reach agreement, at 3 p.m. the Senate will \nproceed to a cloture vote on the bill, with the final 30 minutes \nequally divided and controlled by the two leaders, with the majority \nleader controlling the final 15 minutes. Senators have until 12 noon to \nfile second-degree amendments to the Defense bill.\n  I will finally say that under the regular procedure, we would have a \ncloture vote an hour after we come into session. But I had a \nconversation with the Republican leader last evening, and we felt it \nwould be best to wait until after our caucus so people understood how \nimportant this Defense authorization bill is and how Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin have tried hard to work through all these amendments. \nHopefully, we can get cloture invoked and work on the amendments that \nare available postcloture and finish this bill, say, 9:30 tomorrow \nmorning, something like that. I hope that can be the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8810-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have heard a very powerful Presidential \ncampaign speech by my good friend the majority leader. He asked what \nhas brought us to this point. What has brought us to the point that \nfarmers are suffering, families are suffering, truckdrivers are \nsuffering--all of us are suffering from the high prices of energy.\n  It should be no secret to anybody who knows what is going on around \nhere that for the last 20 years, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have instituted a policy of ``don't drill, don't refine, don't \ndevelop nuclear power.'' Our gas and oil prices have gone through the \nroof because we have artificially constrained the amount of energy we \ncan produce.\n  What we are asking for and the American people are asking for every \ntime I go home is some common sense. Impose our good, strong \nenvironmental regulations. We have the strongest environmental \nregulations of any nation on the Earth on producing oil and gas. We can \npay high sums of ransom to foreign powers, such as Hugo Chavez in \nVenezuela or Vladimir Putin in Russia or Ahmadinejad in Iran, and get \noil and gas that has not been produced with the same environmental \nprotections we have.\n  Today, the price of oil is only $92 per barrel. A gallon of gas on \nFriday, before Hurricane Ike, averaged only $3.65. It has come down \nsome now with the unwinding of the Lehman investments in long-term \nenergy futures. But the problem is still there. We have not solved the \nproblem. We have taken some steps that I believe will give the market \nsome encouragement. But if you think oil at only $92 per barrel is good \nenough, if you think gas falling to $3.65 a gallon is good enough, then \nyou must be one of these people who support the Pelosi plan, the Gang \nof 10 proposal. You must be one of those people who think we can get \naway with giving just a little bit of opening of our tremendous oil \nreserves and gas reserves.\n  What I can tell you is that the price of oil falling only a little \nbit is not good enough for the families of Missouri, the farmers, the \nsmall businesses in Missouri, the truckers, all of the people who have \nbeen hit hard by the high price of gas. The price for a gallon of \ngasoline falling only a little bit is not good enough for my workers \nand families in Missouri or the workers and families in the United \nStates. That is why opening a little bit of new oil production is not \ngood enough for our farmers and workers. Missouri's families and \nfarmers, workers and small businesses, like the entire Nation, deserve \nas much relief as we can responsibly give them from the high gas \nprices, and we need to do it now.\n  The suffering of our families in today's tough times is certainly not \nover yet. The mortgage crisis brought on by speculation in the housing \nfinance market is still ravaging our neighborhoods. High food prices \nare still ravaging household budgets. High health care budgets are \nravaging lifetime savings. High education costs are still crimping our \nretirement funds. Missouri farmers are still struggling with the high \nfuel costs they pay to run their farm equipment. Dairy producers are \nstruggling with the surcharges they pay to ship their milk to markets. \nOur food processors in Missouri and across the Nation are struggling \nwith high transportation costs to obtain their raw goods. Grocers in \nMissouri and across the Nation are still struggling with high shipping \ncosts. That is the high cost of the price of food--the off-farm fuel \ncosts that go to transportation, driving, and other procedures. And \nMissouri truckers are suffering from high diesel costs. Missouri \nairline workers are losing their jobs because of high jet fuel costs. \nSo why would anyone think that just a little price relief is OK? Why \nwould anyone think we just have to lower gas prices a little bit? Our \nfamilies don't just deserve a little relief; our families deserve as \nmuch gas price relief as we can give them. Our truckers don't deserve \njust a little relief; they deserve as much diesel relief as we can give \nthem. Our farmers don't deserve just a little relief; our farmers \ndeserve as much fuel price relief as we can give them. That is why we \nshould not open just a little bit of offshore oil production. We should \nopen as much new offshore oil production as we can, have it produced in \nan environmentally responsible manner to drive oil and gas prices as \nfar down as we possibly can to provide as much relief to families and \nworkers as we can.\n  The proposal we will consider from the Gang of 10 will not open as \nmuch new offshore oil as we can, so it will not drive down oil and gas \nprices as much as we can. It plans to open a handful of sites in \nsoutheast Florida to offshore production, but it leaves closed to the \nAmerican people east coast and Northeast States. It leaves the entire \nPacific coast of America closed. Seventy percent of America's offshore \nareas, off lower 48 States, would still be closed to the American \npeople and the energy they need under the Gang of 10 plan. Eighty-five \npercent of offshore areas are currently off limits. So how is opening \nonly 15 percent more in offshore production going to provide relief to \nthe American people?\n\n  On the other side, the Speaker's plan does not provide relief to the \nAmerican people either. It opens certain areas of the east and west \ncoasts of America but does so only outside the 50 miles from shore.\n  There is a funny little statistic that maybe people would be \ninterested in, and that is that most of the oil off the Pacific west \ncoast is less than 25 miles off the shore. More of it is within 50 \nmiles off the shore. So no more than 3 to 5 percent of the oil off \nCalifornia and the west coast would be opened. It leaves closed to the \nAmerican people the eastern half of the Gulf of Mexico where almost of \nall the new oil in the east coast lies.\n  So the Pelosi plan may well be described as opening everywhere that \noil is not and leaving closed and off limits to the needs of the \nAmerican people everywhere the oil is. The plan will do almost nothing \nto bring the American people gas price relief.\n  Let me talk about the Gulf of Mexico. We wish everyone--Texas, \nLouisiana, across that part of the country--Godspeed in their recovery. \nWe prayed for you during the storm. We now pray for you as you put your \nlives back together. But we are also putting the Nation's oil \ninfrastructure back together.\n  Hurricane Alley, as the western Gulf of Mexico is often known, is \nalso the port of entry for 64 percent of our imported oil and most of \nour refineries. Rolling right down Hurricane Alley, Hurricane Ike has \nshut down 63 percent of our oil rigs, idled 73 percent of our gas \noutput, closed 8 refineries, and stopped 96 percent of gulf oil output. \nMother Nature can only tell us we asked for it by concentrating so much \noil production in the western gulf, by concentrating so much oil \nrefining in the western gulf, by forcing so much oil importation \nthrough the western gulf.\n  We have only ourselves to blame when we keep other parts of our ocean \nclosed to production. We only have ourselves to blame when we keep the \nother parts of our shores closed to refining. We have only ourselves to \nblame when prices spike 17 cents in a weekend, as they did over this \nweekend. We have only ourselves to blame if we continue the Democratic \npolicies of ``don't drill, don't refine, don't use nuclear resources.'' \nAnd if we vote for proposals that still keep most all of our shores off \nlimits, we will have only ourselves to blame for not providing American \nfamilies, workers, and small businesses the relief they need. We will \nhave only ourselves to blame if we do not provide American families the \nrelief they deserve.\n  I urge our colleagues to consider American families when we vote to \ngive them as much energy, gas, oil relief as we can--not just a little \nbit more relief but a lot more relief, finding not just a little bit of \noil production but as much new oil production as\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\nwe can. Our American workers, American farmers, American small \nbusinesses--all of us in our American economy deserve no less. We must \nproduce what we have, and we must do it now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his \ncomments this morning. I, too, wish to make some comments about our \nenergy problems we are having in this country.\n  Before the August recess, I and many of my Republican colleagues came \nto the floor of this great body to make the case for a sound national \nenergy policy that would make a difference to the millions of Americans \nstruggling with high energy prices.\n  We just heard the majority leader mention energy as a critical \nproblem in America. But, unfortunately, instead of dealing with this \nissue, it was set aside by the majority party in favor of a recess, and \nlike the recess enjoyed by millions of American schoolkids, this recess \nwas an opportunity for the majority party to run away from the hard \nwork waiting for them on their desks on energy.\n  When or if we move to the energy debate again, I am hopeful we will \nbe able to accomplish something. This is especially important because \nthis will likely be the last opportunity for many months to offer \nrelief to millions of Americans struggling with high fuel prices. It is \nrelief to commuters, school carpoolers, it is relief for farmers, it is \nrelief for small businesses, grocery shoppers, and all across the \nspectrum of American life where higher prices mean budget problems.\n  The price of oil has dropped from its summer high, and that is good, \nbut the fundamental truth remains: America does not control its energy \nsources. Americans rely on overseas energy, and we pay billions and \nbillions for it. We see those dollars go to countries that sponsor \nterrorism, which creates additional problems for the security of this \ncountry.\n  Our precarious position comes to everyone's realization when we deal \nwith an interruption in energy. My esteemed colleague from Missouri \njust finished talking about the impact of Hurricane Ike and how it has \nhad an effect, and that is when Americans realize how precarious our \nenergy supplies are in this country.\n  For weeks now, dating back to before the August recess, Republicans \nhave been pushing and prodding the Democrats in an effort to address \nthis growing crisis. I suspect that during the August recess Democrats \ngot an earful from their constituents on energy. The citizens of this \ncountry told them to release areas off the coast for domestic \nexploration. They told them to open sections of ANWR to tap millions of \nbarrels of our own vital oil and natural gas supplies. I heard those \nsame concerns raised when I was back in my State during the summer.\n\n  Mr. President, the American people have spoken, and it is high time \nthe Democratic Congress started to listen. We must open the Outer \nContinental Shelf for exploration. Unfortunately, Congress has enacted \nappropriations riders prohibiting the Department of the Interior from \nconducting activities related to production of oil and natural gas on \nmuch of the Outer Continental Shelf every year since 1982. The current \ncongressional moratorium under which we are operating places nearly 86 \npercent of America's Outer Continental Shelf lands off-limits for \nexploration. No other country does that. Fortunately, the current \nmoratorium is set to expire at the end of this current fiscal year; \nthat is, September 30 of this year. In July, President Bush lifted the \nexecutive moratorium leaving only the congressional appropriations \nOuter Continental Shelf moratorium standing in the way of increased \nU.S. energy production. I encourage our Democratic friends to allow the \nmoratorium to lapse. With the high cost of fuel, we must allow American \ncompanies to seek out new sources of energy off our coastal regions.\n  In conjunction with offshore exploration, we must open vital areas of \nAlaska and the West. Recently, in my home State of Colorado, the Roan \nPlateau was finally opened to the bidding process, and I am pleased the \nBureau of Land Management was able to move forward with the Roan \nPlateau lease sale. This sale was important for the people of Colorado \nbecause it will generate millions of dollars of revenue for our State. \nBut more importantly, Mr. President, the Roan Plateau development is \none of the most environmentally conscious plans ever created, \nrepresenting almost a decade of collaboration between local, State, and \nFederal officials. Also, more importantly, is what the Roan Plateau \nlease sale means for people around the Nation. The development of the \noil and gas resources on the Roan Plateau will help secure the midrange \nfuture energy needs of our Nation.\n  The development of the Roan Plateau will be conducted in a staged \napproach in order to minimize wildlife habitat fragmentation, \ndisturbances, and to encourage innovation in reclaiming many of our \ndisturbed areas. The Roan Plateau is an example of how we can strike a \nbalance between energy development and environmental protections.\n  While additional production of traditional oil sources is vital, we \nin Congress must continue to provide incentives for implementation of \nrenewable energy and for the infrastructure necessary to support them. \nOur fossil fuels have become a bridge to better technology and much of \nwhat lies in the area of renewable energy. This is a necessary step in \nbalancing our domestic energy portfolio, increasing our Nation's energy \nsecurity, and advancing our economic prosperity.\n  The American people deserve an energy policy that calls for funding \nmore domestic energy sources, including oil, natural gas, clean coal, \nnuclear, as well as renewable resources and new energy efficiency \ntechnologies while not forgetting the conservation aspect of our energy \nproblem and doing everything we possibly can to conserve our precious \nenergy supplies. By investing in renewable energy research and \ndevelopment today, we will actually be saving money in future energy \ncosts.\n  Energy runs the world in which we live, so without affordable, \naccessible sources of energy we open ourselves to dangers we simply \nshould not allow to happen. I believe renewable energy and energy-\nefficient technologies help offset fuel imports, create numerous \nemployment opportunities, develop our domestic economy, and enhance and \ncreate export opportunities. In addition, renewable energy and energy-\nefficient technologies provide clean, inexhaustible energy for millions \nof consumers.\n  But renewable energy alone is not enough. We still need additional \nsources of domestic energy. Mr. President, I disagree with my own \nGovernor from the State of Colorado and the points he was making at the \nmajority leader's energy conference in Nevada, where he stated that \nrenewable energy was the main reason we were having many job \nopportunities and why our economy was doing well in Colorado. There is \nno doubt that the renewable energy effort in Colorado has created more \njobs. It has created some diversity in our economy, and that is good. \nBut it is the oil and gas industry that has provided the revenues for \nthe State of Colorado and will continue to do it for some time. If we \npush too hard and too quickly to go to renewable energies before that \nindustry has matured, we will create additional economic problems not \nonly for the State of Colorado but for this country.\n  It is fascinating when one looks at the retirement portfolio for the \nemployees of the State of Colorado. A large percentage of that revenue \nand that portfolio is coming from oil and gas companies. It is helping \nprovide for the future retirement of employees who have worked for the \nState of Colorado. So although renewable energy is beginning to play a \nlarger and more important role in the State of Colorado, it is not \nready to replace the huge amount of revenue oil and gas is producing \nfor my State.\n  One of the most promising sources of domestic energy in the Nation is \nfound in my State of Colorado, and that is oil shale. This shale could \neasily yield 800 billion barrels of oil, which is more than the entire \nproven reserves of Saudi Arabia. Now, the estimates on the oil shale in \nColorado and Utah and Wyoming are estimated up to 2 trillion, but 800 \nbillion seems as though it is the minimum amount that most people \nbelieve we can bring to the surface with the new technologies we have \nin oil shale, which, by the way, is environmentally favorable.\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\n  Unfortunately, we can't even begin to move toward assessing this \nunparalleled resource because Democratic obstructionism has effectively \nput this resource out of reach. Any Member of Congress who refuses to \nconsider comprehensive solutions that include reducing energy \nconsumption while increasing domestic supplies is ignoring the needs of \nthis country.\n  I am very hopeful that within the next few weeks we will be able to \nfind a commonsense approach to our energy crisis that addresses the \nbasic economic law of supply and demand. It is simple: If we increase \nour supply while reducing demand, energy prices will go down. We \nshouldn't forget that we live in a supply-and-demand economy.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the majority leader, and I urge the \nmajority party to quickly get us on the issue of energy and onto \nreasonable commonsense solutions to move us forward. This country is \ndependent on our doing the right thing on energy because it is such an \nessential part of our economy. It builds into all levels of \nmanufacturing, it builds into each individual American's life, and it \nis a driving factor when we talk about the inflation that is happening \nright now in our economy.\n  So, Mr. President, let's move forward. Let's do something about the \nenergy crisis we have in this country, and let's not let the current \nelection year environment in this country disrupt our effort to try to \ndo what is best in making sure we have a safe and secure country and a \nsecure economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe remainder of the Republican time be reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8813-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8813-S8814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OIL MARKET SPECULATION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as I rise to speak this morning, for the \nfirst time since April 1, the price of oil has fallen to below $100 a \nbarrel, and that is certainly a welcome relief to many Americans across \nthis country and to businesses who have been devastated by high energy \nmarkets.\n  We shouldn't underestimate the damage that has been caused. Just this \npast Friday, in my home State of Washington, Alaska Air announced that \nmore than 1,000 people will lose their jobs because of high fuel prices \nand a slowing economy. Compared to last year, Americans have paid $76 \nbillion more for gasoline in 2008, and I know many people went without \nvacations, and businesses have cut back on their operations.\n  Now, we have had various independent reports that have shown that the \nfluctuation in price from 2007 to 2008 cannot be explained by simple \nsupply-and-demand fundamentals. And we are having a hearing at 2:30 \nthis afternoon in the Energy Committee about excessive speculation and \nhow prices were driven to record highs this summer. But what we need to \nalso realize is the scrutiny Congress has placed on Wall Street along \nwith the promise to have stricter oversight has had an impact; \nprompting a large volume of capital starting to leave these markets.\n  It wasn't that long ago when President George Bush was picked up on \nthe Internet at a reception saying ``Wall Street got drunk.'' Now, I \ndon't know if the President really meant to have this publicly captured \non the Internet, but it was, and I know afterwards his Press Secretary \nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       Well, you know, I actually haven't spoken to him about \n     this, but I imagine what he meant, as I have heard him \n     describe it before in both public and private, was that Wall \n     Street let themselves get carried away and that they did not \n     understand the risks these newfangled financial instruments \n     would pose to the markets.\n\n  And while it is Wall Street that has gotten drunk, it is the American \npublic paying for the hangover.\n  Today, we are struggling to contain one of the most severe credit \ncrises since the Great Depression, and American families are going to \npay dearly for that lack of oversight and regulatory indifference to \nwhat have been critical markets for us to oversee. I give credit to \nSecretary Paulson for his swift action over the last couple of weeks to \ncontain the economic fallout from a reeling Wall Street.\n  During the past decade, the agencies charged with financial oversight \nhave turned their eye from what has been one of the worst excesses our \ncountry has seen. My question for my colleagues today is, when are we \ngoing to learn the lessons of history and make sure Congress does its \njob in the oversight of the regulatory agencies so they do theirs?\n  In many ways, today's super-bubbles are a repeat of the 1920s when \ntoo much borrowing to underwrite too many speculative bets using too \nmuch of other people's money set up the entire economy for a crash. In \n1999, Congress repealed key parts of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. \nThe repeal allowed banks to operate any kind of financial businesses \nthey desired, and it set up a situation where the banks had multiple \nconflicts of interest.\n  Several economists and analysts have cited the repeal of this act as \na major contributor to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis.\n  In fact, Robert Kuttner, cofounder and co-editor of the American \nProspect magazine wrote in September 2007:\n\n       Hedge funds, private equity companies, and the subprime \n     mortgage industries have two big things in common. First, \n     each represents financial middlemen unproductively extracting \n     wealth from the real economy. Second, each exploits loopholes \n     in what remains a financial regulation.\n\n  But we didn't end our deregulation there.\n  In 2000 we also deregulated a new and volatile financial derivative \nthat is at the heart of today's housing credit crisis--credit default \nswaps.\n  As White House press secretary Dana Perino described it earlier this \nyear, these ``newfangled financial instruments'' that posed a risk to \nthe market actually grew into a $62 trillion industry.\n  Warren Buffett has called these credit-swaps ``financial weapons of \nmass destruction.''\n  The proliferation of these newfangled financial instruments has \nresulted in huge profits and losses without any physical goods changing \nhands.\n  I come to the floor asking my colleagues: when are we going to learn \nthe lessons of the past?\n  When are we going to realize that the 1929 stock market crash has the \nsame root cause as the recent housing bubble?\n  Both were financed by dangerously high leveraged borrowing. And after \nthe crash many banks failed--causing a ripple effect that devastated \nour Nation's economy.\n  After the 1929 crash, Congress stepped up and changed the banking \nlaws to eliminate some of the abuses that had paved the way for \neconomic disaster.\n  My question is--we acted after the crisis and Congress did step up \nand do something. What I want to know is whether we have learned our \nlesson. Are we going to legislate consumer protections in advance, or \nonly after a bubble bursts?\n  The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s when 747 savings \nand loan associations went under provides a similar lesson.\n  Like before, much of this mess can be traced back to the deregulation \nof the savings and loans which gave these associations many of the \ncapabilities of banks, but failed to bring them under the same \nregulations.\n  Congress eliminated regulations designed to prevent lending excesses \nand minimize failures.\n  Deregulation allowed lending in distant loan markets on the promise \nof higher returns, and it also allowed associations to participate in \nspeculative construction activities with builders and developers who \nhad little or no financial stake in the projects.\n  The ultimate cost of this crisis is estimated to have totaled around \n$160 billion, with U.S. taxpayers bailing out the institutions to the \ntune of $125 billion. This, of course, added to our deficit of the \nearly 1990s.\n  I ask my colleagues: When are we going to learn this lesson?\n  We have failed to see that oversight and transparency are always \ncritical parts of any functioning market.\n  We have failed to see that when Congress makes reforms, like the \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act in 2000, or like the repeal of \nkey portions of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, or the deregulation of \nthe energy markets in\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\nthe 1990s, they cannot disregard these important fundamentals of \ntransparency and strong Federal oversight authority.\n  I could go on and on for my colleagues on my own personal experience \nwith the western energy crisis that happened in electricity markets in \n2000 and 2001.\n  We saw that during the electricity deregulation experience which \nstarted in the mid 1990s, people argued that electricity was just \nanother commodity. But it is really a very critical element to our \neconomy.\n  Many experts cautioned that electricity was too vital a part of our \neconomy and way of life to let these markets go without the \ntransparency and oversight that is essential.\n  We all know the rest of the story. We saw that deregulation set the \ntable for some of Enron's spectacular manipulation schemes of 2000 and \n2001 among other bad actors, that caused more than $35 billion in \neconomic loss and cost our nation over 589,000 jobs.\n  Again, only after the crisis was over, did Congress step in. Only \nafter the crisis did Congress give the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, and now the FTC, more regulatory authority on energy \nmarkets. And once more, Congress illustrated that it prefers to act \nafter the fact.\n  So I ask my colleagues: When are we going to learn?\n  When are we going to quit deregulating these critical markets without \nmuch thought to the transparency and oversight that is critical for \nmarkets to operate and function correctly?\n  When are we going to learn that when we take our eye off he ball, \nWall Street raids the cabinet and, as the President say, Wall Street \ngets drunk?\n  I mentioned that later today we will be holding a hearing in the \nEnergy Committee to examine the oil futures market. We will examine why \nwe need meaningful legislation to close the loopholes that exist in \nthose dark markets.\n  This deregulation has helped spark today's price super-bubble, as \nGeorge Soros warned at a June 3 Commerce Committee hearing, that is \ndriving our markets to no longer be based on supply-and-demand \nfundamentals.\n  In one fell swoop, this deregulation did a number of things that \nenabled today's perfect storm to brew.\n  No. 1, we let these newfangled financial instruments called credit \ndefault swaps go unregulated, and it made it easy to use bad debt to \nfinance home mortgages.\n  As George Soros wrote in his book documenting the credit crisis:\n\n       At the end of World War II, the financial industry--banks, \n     brokers, other financial institutions--played a very \n     different role in the economy than they do today.\n\n  He went on to explain, as I said, that banks and markets are not as \nstrictly regulated today as they were in the past.\n  In 2000 we deliberately chose not to learn this harsh lesson and \nallowed these new, volatile financial derivatives that are the heart of \ntoday's markets to go unregulated by the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission.\n  What we need to do is make sure we learned this lesson, to go back \nnow and close the loopholes that exist and make sure the agencies that \nare in charge of oversight actually do their job. We do not want the \nAmerican people to continue to have to pay for mismanagement and lack \nof oversight by not having transparency in these markets. We need to \nmake sure these agencies are accountable.\n  The bottom line is we have a CFTC that is more lax in allowing \ntraders to run amok than protecting families who live on Main Street in \nAmerica. That is why I continue to hold up CFTC nominations. We need a \nmore sophisticated regulatory regime oversight, including regulators \nwho will be aggressive policemen on the beat. We need to collect more \ndata to make sure that markets are not being manipulated. We need to \nmake sure the market is driven by basic market fundamentals and not \ngreed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I would like now to address the Senate \nwith regard to my interpretation of the many constructive efforts that \nhave gone on with the chairman and myself and other colleagues to try \nto move this bill forward. As I speak for a few minutes, I urge my \ndistinguished chairman to engage me in any questions or colloquy if he \nhas views that could be at variance to what I express.\n  I have an amendment at the desk. It is No. 5569. I shall not call it \nup at this time. The history of that amendment is as follows:\n  As many of our Senate colleagues are aware, this past January 29, the \nPresident of the United States issued Executive Order No. 13457 \ninstructing the executive branch that agency heads should not base \nfunding decisions on language in a committee report or conference \nreport or any other nonstatutory statement of the views of Congress. \nThe President took this unprecedented step because he believes--and to \nsome extent I share his concern--that it is necessary to reduce the \nnumber and cost of what we refer to as earmarks substantially; that is, \nto reduce them substantially and to make the origin and purpose of the \nearmark more transparent. To accomplish these objectives, the Executive \norder requires that henceforth earmarks, as well as any other funding \ndirection from Congress in its exercise of the power of the purse, must \nbe included in the text of the bill voted on by Congress and presented \nto the President.\n  In response to the Executive order, I offered an amendment during \ncommittee markup, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself and others, \nwhich would have put the committee's funding tables in the text of the \nbill. This was the most simple and direct way to comply with the \nExecutive order. My amendment, after deliberation in committee, was \ndefeated on a 12-to-12 vote. As a result, as reflected in section 1002 \nof the bill, the committee decided to incorporate our funding tables \ninto the bill by reference; that is, by a provision that states that \neach funding table in the committee report is incorporated into the act \nand is made a requirement of law to the same extent as if the funding \ntable was included in the text.\n  Once our bill reached the Senate floor for consideration by the full \nSenate, a colleague, Senator DeMint, filed amendment No. 5405 which, \nagain, takes up the same issue.\n  Senator DeMint's amendment would strike section 1002 in its entirety \nfrom the bill, thereby removing the funding tables from the bill. The \nresult, as I interpret it, of adoption of the amendment would be that \nour funding tables would remain only in the committee\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\nand conference report, setting up a conflict with the Executive order. \nDirection by Congress on the specific funding levels throughout the \ndefense budget would be advisory only.\n  The President's Executive order, on the other hand, would continue to \nrequire agency heads to ignore congressional funding directions unless \nit is in the text of bills enacted into law.\n  While I appreciate the efforts by our distinguished colleague from \nSouth Carolina and his concern about the use of the incorporation-by-\nreference technique which I opposed during committee markup, I am just \nas concerned about striking the reference to the funding tables in the \nbill and leaving them only in the committee and conference report, \ngiven the President's Executive order. While the DeMint amendment would \nhave the positive impact of making earmarks advisory only, it would \nalso undercut the legal authority of every other congressional funding \ndecision which differed from the President's budget. In short, the \nDeMint amendment would seriously impair the ability of the Senate and \nCongress to meaningfully exercise the power of the purse. The Armed \nServices Committee and the Senate and Congress as a whole would lose \nthe ability to direct and enforce cuts in funding, additions to funding \nthat were, in our discretion, required in the President's budget, or to \nrestructure programs that are part of the defense budget.\n  The amendment I have offered and wish to offer as an alternative to \nSenator DeMint is No. 5569. My amendment takes the same approach which \nI argued during the committee markup. It takes the funding tables from \nour committee report and puts them directly into the bill text. The \namendment is extraordinarily long. It goes on for 225 pages, but it \ncomplies with the Executive order in the most direct way possible. As a \nresult, all of our funding decisions are transparent, and each item of \nfunding is subject to further debate and amendment by the full Senate. \nIf the funding decisions are adopted by the Senate and sustained \nthrough the conference between the two Houses, they will be included in \nthe text of the bill as passed by Congress and presented to the \nPresident. Changes to the funding decisions recommended by the \ncommittee are subject to the normal process of amending a bill under \nthe Senate rules and procedures.\n  I am aware if my amendment was adopted, it would increase the burden \nof producing our bill and conference report by several days. Many \npeople would be involved in that rather arduous process. We are \ninformed that the best estimate is that about 4 additional days would \nbe required for the committee staff, the Government Printing Office, \nand supporting House and Senate staff offices to process the detailed \ndata that appears in the funding tables, if they were incorporated into \nthe bill, assuming the Government Printing Office could prioritize its \nattention and resources on our bill. By ``prioritize,'' I mean what \nother work from other committees of the Congress, House and Senate, \nwould be before those various administrative sections.\n\n  Given the time constraints we face, these 4 additional days add \nsignificantly to the challenges of completing a conference between the \nHouse and Senate and passing a conference report in both Chambers \nbefore the target date for adjournment. While I acknowledge these \nchallenges, I believe my amendment will best comply with the Executive \norder and its laudatory purposes. We must not simply ignore the \nExecutive order and trust the executive branch to follow congressional \nfunding directions, when the President has emphatically said the \nCongress must express its direction in the text of bills enacted into \nlaw.\n  When Congress exercises its constitutional power of the purse, it \nshould do so in a transparent, open way subject to full debate and \namendment. When Congress speaks on its funding priorities, it should do \nso decisively, and its pronouncement should have the binding force of \nlaw subject only to the President's veto.\n  The current posture is, this is an important issue. The distinguished \nchairman and I, together with our staffs, have worked on it. We have \nrecognized the precarious nature of the bill in terms of its ability to \nbe put together, brought to the desk of Senators, and then, \nsubsequently, the conference report, and likewise that being properly \nput together to comply with this amendment and others. It is a \nchallenge. I have discussed it with the chairman. I guess perhaps being \nan optimist, I believe if my amendment were adopted, it would reach the \nresult of many colleagues, and we could go forward and do our very best \nto shorten the time normally in the history of these bills that is used \nby the conference.\n  This is our 30th bill. Senator Levin is chairman of the conference \nthis year. I would try in every way to support him, if he so desired to \ntry to move, subject to the adoption of this amendment, this bill \nthrough the conference. This bill is so important to our country. It is \nso important to so many Members of our body. We have pending a \nmanagers' amendment which Senator Levin and our staffs have been \nworking on for the last 4 or 5 days. It is close to 100 amendments \nwhich we have reconciled in such a way that, subject to UC, they could \nbe adopted and immediately become a part of the bill prior to any \ncloture action that will take place as scheduled at 3 o'clock today. \nThat embraces the work and the desires and the objectives of so many \nMembers.\n  I am not here to fault the fact that a hold or objection is put on a \nUC to move that package; it is to state the fact. But that objection \nlargely emanates from the issue which I have tried to describe in a \nvery pragmatic and forthright way to help colleagues better understand \nthe current procedural dilemma that faces the body with regard to the \nbill.\n  The committee and my distinguished colleagues will work as hard as we \ncan to get this bill through. This is one roadmap; there may be a \nbetter one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia for \noutlining the history of this issue in which we are involved. I am \nparticularly gratified that he now agrees the DeMint amendment will be \na significant abdication of legislative power to the executive branch. \nThe reason that would be true is, there would be no reference to the \nline items we have worked so hard on in law or by reference in law, and \nthat would mean the only thing that would be remaining would be a \ncommittee report that has all the work of our committee, not just the \nearmarks which we have added but also the lines we have added or \nsubtracted to what the President has requested. That is the essential \npoint relative to the DeMint amendment. It would be an absolutely \nrevolutionary change in the powers of the purse, shifting a great deal \nof that power to the executive branch.\n  I am delighted the Senator from Virginia has stated it exactly that \nclearly, or approximately that clearly, so that, hopefully, we can, if \nnot unanimously but on a bipartisan basis defeat the DeMint amendment, \nif it is offered. Then the question comes up: How can we then \nincorporate all our effort in committee into the law? There is a lot of \nproblems with doing it, which we pointed out during the committee \ndebate, including the lack of flexibility that this would result in for \nthe President in terms of reprogramming because now every line becomes \na program, and that means it would be harder to shift money than it is \nnow because it is easier to shift money within a program through \nreprogramming than it is between programs. That was an argument which \nwe used in committee. We believe it is true that the executive branch \nwill have less flexibility when it comes to reprogramming if every \nsingle line is in law. However, if that is what this body wishes to \ndo--to make it less flexible for the President to offer reprogramming \nsuggestions--that is a problem the executive branch should have, not \nours.\n\n  Our problem is it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get a \nconference report--first of all, it is difficult enough to get to \nconference, but then it would be extremely difficult, if not \nimpossible, to bring a conference report back in the next couple weeks. \nWe have gone through these numbers with the minority. We have a clear \nassessment by the Government Printing Office that it would add about \n4\\1/2\\ days to their work if every single line were made part of the \nbill rather than being\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\nsimply incorporated by reference in the bill, as it now is. We should \nnot take a chance on jeopardizing this bill. This bill is too important \nto be jeopardized.\n  The difference between incorporating all these lines by reference in \nthe bill and actually printing them in the bill is either minor, minute \nor nonexistent legally. What this bill does is incorporate by reference \nall these lines. They are incorporate into the bill. They are \ntransparent--as transparent as though they were printed in the bill. \nThis green document is no less transparent than this white document. \nThey are both equally transparent. The work of our committee is laid \nout in the moment in the green document. In this white document, which \nis the bill, we incorporate by reference in the bill all the line items \nso they are in the bill, and they can be changed by an amendment which \nsays no money will be spent or less money will be spent for a \nparticular item. It is very readily addressable by the Senate on the \nfloor. The transparency issue is the same. They are both transparent \nand should be.\n  So then the question becomes: Is the nonexistent or minute difference \nbetween incorporating all these charts in here by law or actually \nprinting them in here, should that risk the passage of this bill? They \ncan be addressed by amendment on the floor of the Senate, even though \nthey are incorporated by reference.\n  Now, this bill, as my good friend from Virginia says, is too \nimportant for us not to pass. We have never not passed an authorization \nbill, and this should not be the first year, when we have troops in \nharm's way, when we do not pass a Defense authorization bill. There are \nhundreds of provisions in here which directly affect the troops and \ntheir families. It would be unconscionable for us not to pass a Defense \nauthorization bill. The reason for jeopardizing it simply does not hold \nwater.\n  So that is the dilemma we are in. If the Warner amendment is adopted, \nit would seriously jeopardize the chances of being able to pass a bill, \neven if we can get to conference in the next couple of days. That \nassessment was made over the weekend in terms of the number of days' \ndelay that would result. That assessment was made by the Government \nPrinting Office. They spent 700 person hours over the weekend at the \nGovernment Printing Office to give us this assessment. This is not some \ncasual assessment off the back of an envelope; this is a very serious \nassessment that was made at huge expense over the weekend in order to \ngive us the most accurate idea as to what the delay would be if we had \nto print each one of those thousands of lines in the bill itself, \ninstead of incorporating them in the bill by reference. We should not \njeopardize the passage of this bill.\n  That is the only difficulty I now have as a legislator with the \nWarner amendment. The other difficulty, which we pointed out in \ncommittee, has to do with the lack of flexibility that would result to \nthe executive branch in their reprogramming requests. That is a problem \nthe executive branch needs to face, I would think, but as a legislator, \nwhat we have to protect is the power of our purse, the power of this \nCongress to make changes. That is protected in the Warner amendment.\n  What the Warner amendment does is put at risk this bill, as it may be \nphysically impossible to get to conference, the conference completed, \nand a conference report back by the end of next week. If we knew there \nwas going to be a lameduck, there would be no problem because we could \ndo this in a lameduck session no matter how much time it took between \nnow and then, but we don't know that there will be a lameduck session.\n  So the question is whether we are willing to take this risk. I, for \none, cannot in good conscience risk the passage of this bill. Although \nI don't have any problem now with the Warner amendment in terms of its \nsubstance, it is what it would result in, in terms of the bill not \nbeing able to be adopted as a practical matter.\n  My problems with the DeMint amendment are very serious and severe. I \nhope that amendment is not offered, and if it is, I would hope, on a \nbipartisan basis, it would be rejected by a Senate which has the \nresponsibility to abide by the Constitution of the United States and \nmaintain the power of the purse.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am looking at a memorandum prepared by \nour staff, and I presume it has been shared with the chairman's staff. \nWe should state to colleagues that what we learned by virtue of a long \nprocess that many people were involved in over the weekend is as \nfollows:\n  In summary, incorporation of the funding tables into the bill would \nadd about 4 days to the process: About a half day for committee staff \nto prepare the files for the GPO, although much could be done during \nthe conference; 3 days for the GPO to convert the files and proofread \nthem; and about half a day for the committee staff to proofread them \nwhen GPO returns the bill in printed form.\n  Let's sort of chart out a calendar. Today, we are, at the present \ntime, scheduled to have a cloture vote, and if cloture comes about, \nthere is an entirely different scenario, if it is voted in, by which we \ncontinue to address the bill. But if by any chance we could reconcile \nour differences--and we would want Members to know that last night the \nmajority presented to the minority a draft UC that is now being \nreviewed by my leadership. I am at this moment unable to give the \ndetails of what decisions will be made or what options, other than what \nwas presented to us, may be returned back by way of compromise. That is \nto take place in the coming hours, before 3 o'clock. But there is still \nthe possibility that we could get a UC through that would resolve much \nof this problem. Then, if we took final passage, say, even late \ntonight--I mean if we can get the managers' package through, we will \nhave close to 100 amendments in addition to those already handled, and \nthat package is basically equally divided with Republican and \nDemocratic amendments--let's say we have final passage tonight or \ntomorrow. How does the chairman then plot the timetable by which he \nused pretty strong language, that this amendment of mine jeopardizes \nthe bill not being passed? Would the chairman give us his basic \nschedule?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. Before I do that, Senator Webb came \nto the floor when I assured him he would be able to discuss his \namendment, and I am wondering if we could ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Webb be recognized as soon as our colloquy is completed and \nthen that Senator Collins be recognized after Senator Webb.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was not present when either of these Senators appeared. \nI am being advised by our cloakroom staff that Senator Collins came \nearly this morning, at which time the assurance was given to her by \nsomeone that she could have 11:30. Now, I don't know quite how to sort \nthis out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could inquire of the Senator from Maine how \nmuch time she would be using.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could inquire of the Senator from Virginia how much \ntime he would be using.\n  Mr. WEBB. About 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If either had said 9 minutes, they would have had a better \ncase.\n  I wonder if the two Senators whom we referred to could get together \nand resolve this issue for us as to who would go first and who would go \nsecond. Could we ask the two Senators to perhaps help us out on that, \nand then I would ask that after we talk, if we could have a UC as to \nthat procedure.\n  In terms of the schedule, assuming we could get the bill passed by \ntomorrow, which would probably be lucky because there are a number of \namendments that are in that unanimous consent agreement that are \nreferred to specifically that have time connected to them--if we could \nget this bill passed by tomorrow, or cloture invoked, then there is 30 \nhours of postcloture. We don't know whether that would be used by any \nof our colleagues. They have a right to do that, and around here, as we \nknow, frequently that 30-hour period is used. If it is not used, we \nwould then have to name conferees, which hopefully would be done fairly \nquickly. Then the House reviews the Senate bill and determines the \ncommittee jurisdiction and names their conferees. That, at a minimum, \nis\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\n2 to 3 days for the House to do that--to go through that process to see \nwhat committees have jurisdiction over the language in our bill, other \nthan the Armed Services Committee. Then the House and the Senate staffs \nhave to match up these provisions for conference. That usually takes 2 \ndays--usually takes 2 days. So if we are lucky, we could start \nconference 3 to 4 days after passage of this bill, although it usually \ntakes a longer period of time. So if we pass this bill tomorrow, that \nwould take us to the end of the--that would take the House to the end \nof the week to be ready for conference, if we started conference on \nMonday. Whatever period the conference takes, even if it took 2 or 3 \ndays, it is the middle of next week. That is before the 4-day period is \ntriggered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the chairman \nand I jointly agreed to ask our staffs to begin to preconference this \nbill. There has been a considerable amount of work done in the form of \npreconferencing a number of issues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There has.\n  Mr. WARNER. Once the House sees the finality of the Senate bill, I am \nof the view that the balance can come together fairly swiftly. So I \nthink we have somewhat of a difference of opinion as to the ability of \nall people of good intention to get together and crunch this time so we \ncan meet the projected deadline of adjournment on the 26th, as I \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't think we have any difference on that, in terms of \nthe ability of people of good faith to get things done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This assumes maximum crunch, what I specified for the \nSenator from Virginia. This is an optimistic view of the timetable, \nwhere everybody is using 24/7, to the extent that human bodies permit. \nWe don't have any difference in terms of that.\n  I am wondering if our two friends from Virginia and Maine have \nresolved who would go first. Could we then allow them to proceed in the \norder they have agreed upon, and then the Senator from Virginia and I \ncould pick this up after that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's do that. Mr. President, couldn't we just do this \ninformally? Once we ask unanimous consent, we are in a whole new \nframework of procedures. I think we recognized that, I believe, Senator \nCollins--and my distinguished colleague from Virginia has graciously \nallowed her to go first, and she would be followed by the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. WARNER. We are back to UC. The word triggers----\n  Mr. LEVIN. It shouldn't trigger a problem. We use it all day around \nhere. I am simply stating the order for the two Senators to know.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maine be recognized for \n10 minutes, and the Senator from Virginia then be recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for finally working \nthis out.\n  I rise today in strong support of the Fiscal Year 2009 National \nDefense Authorization Act. Let me begin by thanking the committee's \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Levin, for his leadership, and also \nSenator Warner, who is taking on double duty, acting as the ranking \nRepublican on the committee in the absence of Senator McCain. I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank the senior Senator from Virginia for his \nyears of service on the committee. He has been a true friend to me and \nto the members of our committee and the armed services of this Nation, \nand his guidance, wisdom and, above all, his civility in all matters \nwill be greatly missed. I deeply admire him, and I thank him for his \nleadership on this bill and on so many other issues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I humbly thank my distinguished colleague \nand longtime friend. I am certain she can take my place.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will provide essential training, \nequipment, and support to our troops as they engage in combat overseas \nand in exercises at home. It also offers an important opportunity for \ncontinued debate as to our Nation's strategy in Iraq, especially the \ncost of reconstruction in Iraq.\n  I am particularly pleased the legislation we are now debating \ncontains an amendment that Senators Ben Nelson, Evan Bayh, and I \noffered to alleviate the burden on the American taxpayers of our \noperations in Iraq. It is time for the Iraqis to pay more of the costs \nof securing, rebuilding, and stabilizing their own country. During the \nArmed Services Committee markup, I joined Senators Nelson and Bayh in \nauthoring the provisions that are in this bill which shift to the Iraqi \nGovernment the costs of securing and rebuilding Iraq in order to lift \nthat burden from the shoulders of the American taxpayers.\n  While our country is struggling with a soaring deficit, the Iraqi \nGovernment is awash in oil revenues. The Special Inspector General for \nIraq Reconstruction has estimated that Iraq's oil profits will reach \n$70 billion this year. That is far more than the Government of Iraq \nanticipated when it established its budget of $47 billion.\n  Similarly, on August 5, the Government Accountability Office issued a \nreport that provided an in-depth examination of Iraqi revenues, \nexpenditures, and surpluses. This GAO report underscores the need for \nour amendment requiring the Iraqi Government to assume greater \nresponsibility for its own costs. The report verifies the stronger \nfinancial position of the Iraqis due to the unanticipated windfall \nbrought about by record-high oil revenues. According to the GAO, Iraq \nis likely to receive between $67 billion and $79 billion in revenues \nfrom oil sales in 2008 alone--twice the average of revenues between \n2005 and 2007. Yet the Iraqis still have not adequately invested in \nreconstruction efforts in their own country. In fact, they have spent \njust 28 percent of the $12 billion investment budget.\n  In addition, the Iraqis had approximately $29 billion in surplus \nfunds that actually went unused during the past 2 years. When Americans \nare struggling with the high cost of energy, a weakening economy, and a \nburdensome deficit, there is simply no reason for the American \ntaxpayers to continue paying for the major reconstruction projects, for \nthe salaries, training, and equipping of the Iraqi security forces, or \nthe cost of fuel in a country that has the second largest oil reserves \nand a burgeoning budget surplus.\n  Our bipartisan amendment would shift these costs to the Iraqis. \nSpecifically, our amendment prohibits America's tax dollars from being \nspent on major reconstruction projects in Iraq. It requires the Iraqis \nto assume the responsibility of paying for the salaries, training, and \nequipping of Iraq's security forces, including the army, the police, \nand the Sons of Iraq; it initiates negotiations between our Government \nand the Iraqi Government on a plan to cover other expenses, such as the \nfuel used by American forces when they are in-country.\n  Our proposal was approved unanimously by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and it represents a significant bipartisan change in our \npolicy in Iraq.\n  The fact is, the American taxpayers cannot wait for the \nadministration to act. We must require this significant reform by \nchanging the law. Asking the Iraqis to take more responsibility for \ntheir own security and for the reconstruction of their own country will \ngive them a sense of ownership, and it makes common sense given Iraq's \ngrowing budget surplus. That is the purpose of our provision, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the proposal that we have incorporated \ninto the Defense authorization bill.\n  The legislation before us also includes a strong commitment to \nstrengthening Navy shipbuilding by including more than $14 billion for \nshipbuilding programs. It fully supports the Navy's shipbuilding \npriorities. The declining size of our naval fleet is of great concern \nto me. This legislation is an important step toward reversing that \ntroubling decline.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Roughead, has put forth a plan \nfor a 313-ship Navy. It would address longstanding congressional \nconcerns that naval shipbuilding has been inadequately funded. The \ninstability and\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\ninadequacy of previous naval shipbuilding budgets has had a number of \ntroubling effects on our shipbuilding industrial base and has \ncontributed to significant cost growth in the Navy's shipbuilding \nprograms. The 313-ship plan, combined with more robust funding by \nCongress, will begin to reverse the decline in Navy shipbuilding.\n  This bill authorizes funding for construction of a third Zumwalt \nclass destroyer. The DDG-1000 represents a significant advancement in \nNavy surface combatant technology.\n  It is critical that the construction of the first two DDG-1000 \ndestroyers continue on schedule without further delay. It is equally \nimportant that Congress provide full funding for the third ship.\n  The dedicated and highly skilled workers at our Nation's surface \ncombatant shipyards, such as the Bath Iron Works in my great State of \nMaine, are simply too valuable to jeopardize with any cuts or delays in \nthis program. To date, the Navy has spent more than $11 billion on \nresearch, development, detailed design, and advanced procurement for \nthis program. In addition, industry, including not just our shipyards \nbut also a multitude of vendors in over 48 States, has made significant \ninvestments in preparation for building this new class of ship. It is \ncritically important in these tight budget times that we not throw away \nthe investment our country has made as the Navy prepares to build the \ndestroyer for the 21st century. That is why I am so concerned that the \nHouse version of the Defense authorization bill eliminates funding for \nthe construction of a third ship, and even more troubling, does not \nprovide sufficient funding for the construction of any surface \ncombatant.\n  Mr. President, as the threats from around the world continue to grow, \nit is vitally important that the Navy have the best fleet available to \ncounter those threats, keep the sealanes open, and to defend our \nNation.\n  Bath Iron Works and the shipyards of this country are ready to build \nwhatever ships the Navy needs. But it is vitally important that there \nnot be a gap in shipbuilding that jeopardizes our industrial base. I am \npleased with the funding provided in this bill. I look forward to \nresolving this important issue in conference.\n  Earlier this year, the Navy proposed to truncate the DDG-1000 program \nafter just two ships. In July, after further evaluation, the Navy \nrealized the terrible effect that such a decision would have on the \nindustrial base and on our shipyards, in particular. It would have \ncreated a gap in work for Bath Iron Works because of the delays and \ncosts inherent in restarting the DDG-51 line.\n  It is important to note that Bath Iron Works is prepared to build \nwhatever ships the Navy needs, but that there must be a stable work \nplan to sustain the industrial base. The best way to achieve that goal, \nand to take advantage of the billions of dollars already invested in \nthe DDG-1000, is to proceed with the third ship at this time even if \nthe Navy ultimately decides to build more DDG-51s.\n   The House version of this bill would also require that the next-\ngeneration class of amphibious ships be powered by nuclear propulsion \nsystems, even though the shipyard that currently builds those ships \ndoes not have either the facilities or certifications required to \nconstruct nuclear-powered ships. This provision could dramatically \nincrease the costs of future amphibious force vessels, with some \nestimates stating it could be as much as $800 million more per ship. \nThis would reduce the overall number of ships that could be built at a \ntime when the Navy is seeking to revitalize and modernize its fleet. It \nis completely contradictory to the Chief of Naval Operations 313-ship \nplan.\n  I am pleased that our Senate bill also includes funding for \nadditional littoral combat ships. While this program has suffered a \nnumber of setbacks, the Navy, with the help of Congress, has taken \nsignificant steps in order to begin to get this program under control. \nThese ships are important for the Navy in order to counter new, \nasymmetric threats, and the Navy needs to get these ships to the fleet \nsoon.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Armed Services Committee also agreed to \nmy request for $25 million in additional funding to continue the \nmodernization program for the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers. \nThis program provides significant savings to the Navy by applying some \nof the technology that is being developed for the DDG-1000 destroyer \nand back fitting the DDG-51, which may reduce the crew size by 30 to 40 \nsailors.\n  The Senate's fiscal 2009 Defense authorization bill also includes \nfunding for other defense-related projects that benefit Maine and our \nnational security.\n  The bill also authorizes $20.6 million for construction of a new \ndrydock support facility at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, \nME. This drydock, and its accompanying support facility, are essential \nfor the shipyard's future work on Virginia-class submarines, the Navy's \nnewest attack submarine.\n  Funding is provided for machine guns and grenade launchers, both of \nwhich are manufactured by the highly skilled workers at Saco Defense in \nSaco, ME.\n   In addition, the legislation provides $1.5 million to the University \nof Maine for the continued research and development of modular \nballistic tent insert panels. These panels provide crucial protection \nto servicemembers in temporary dining and housing facilities in mobile \nforward operating bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The bill also authorizes an additional $1.5 million for the \nUniversity of Maine's work on high temperature sensors that is \nimportant to the Air Force. These sensors are capable of sensing \nphysical properties such as temperature, pressure, corrosion and \nvibration in critical aerospace components.\n  The legislation also provides $3.5 million for further development of \nthe ripsaw ground vehicle, an innovative unmanned tank-like vehicle, \nmanufactured by Howe and Howe Technologies in North Berwick, ME. This \ntechnology will have the ability to provide force security for our \ntroops by taking them directly out of harm's way.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this bipartisan Defense bill also \nauthorizes a 3.9 percent across-the-board pay increase for \nservicemembers, half a percent above the President's budget request.\n  This bill provides the necessary resources to our troops and our \nNation and recognizes the enormous contributions made by the State of \nMaine. The bill provides the necessary funding for our troops, and I \noffer it my full support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might ask my colleague for 30 \nseconds. I listened carefully to the Senator's thoughts on the Iraqi \nfunding issue. I commend the Senator for that. We have amendments that \naddress it. In the managers' package are certain amendments that the \nSenator from Maine put in. That is a very important issue. We owe no \nless responsibility to the American taxpayers but to assure that every \nsingle dollar going into that area at this time is absolutely essential \nfor the purpose of the mission of our troops and otherwise, and that \nthe Iraqi Government be made aware that they are a sovereign government \nnow and such expenses as can be should be borne by that Government.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman. I agree with his comments. I am \ndelighted with the support he and the chairman have given to this \neffort. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes on amendment No. 5499.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I will begin by associating myself with many \nof the remarks made by the Senator from Maine. As someone who served as \nthe Secretary of the Navy, along with the senior Senator from Virginia, \nI have strong feelings about the strength of the Navy and the size of \nour fleet.\n  I introduced an amendment on Friday that I would like to urge my \ncolleagues to examine and support. We are in an odd situation in the \nbusiness of Government at the moment in that the international \nauthority for the United States to be operating in Iraq will expire at \nthe end of this year. The U.N. mandate, through the U.N. Security \nCouncil, expires at that time.\n  Since last November, this administration has been negotiating what is \ncalled a Strategic Framework Agreement that is intended to replace the\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\ninternational authority of that U.N. mandate. Two questions have come \nup, however, with respect to what the administration is doing. The \nfirst is the timeline. This is an agreement that, by all accounts, has \nnot yet been fully negotiated. It is being negotiated by the \nadministration without the participation of the Congress, and there are \nindications from Iraq that the Iraqi Government negotiators themselves \nhave serious questions that had not been anticipated at the beginning \nof this process. So we have a potential, with the timeline, that the \nU.N. mandate will run out at the end of the year and there will not be \nan agreement in place that authorizes the presence of our forces in \nIraq under international law.\n  The larger question is constitutional. What entity of the Federal \nGovernment has the authority to enter the United States into a long-\nterm relationship with another government? Both of these are serious \nissues. I submit that the conditions under which we will continue to \noperate in Iraq militarily, diplomatically, economically, and even \nculturally, are not the sole business of any administration. These \nquestions involve the legal justification under domestic and \ninternational law for the United States to operate militarily--and \nquasi-militarily, by the way, given the hundreds of thousands of \nindependent contractors that are now essentially performing military \nfunctions in that country.\n  There are questions about the process by which the U.S. Government \ndecides upon and enters into long-term relations with another nation--\nany nation. In that regard, there are serious questions about the very \nworking of the constitutional system of our Government.\n  This administration has claimed repeatedly since last November that \nit has the right to negotiate and enter into an agreement that will set \nthe future course of our relations with Iraq without the agreement, the \nratification, or even the participation of the Congress.\n  The administration claims the justification for this authority can be \nfound in the 2002 congressional authorization for the use of force in \nIraq or, as a fallback position, the President's inherent authority, at \nleast from the perspective of this administration, as Commander in \nChief.\n  Both of these justifications are patently wrong. The 2002 \ncongressional authorization to use force in Iraq has nothing to do with \na negotiation of a government which replaced the Saddam Hussein \ngovernment which did not exist in October of 2002, as to the future \nrelations culturally, economically, diplomatically, and militarily \nbetween our two countries.\n  On the other hand, we are faced with the reality that the U.N. \nmandate will expire at the end of this year and that this expiration \nwill terminate the authority under international law under which the \nUnited States is operating in Iraq at a time when we have hundreds of \nthousands of Americans on the ground in that country.\n  I and several other colleagues have been warning of this serious \ndisconnect for 10 months. Many of us were trying to say last November \nthat apparently the intention of this administration has been to \nproceed purely with an Executive agreement to drag this out until the \nCongress was going out of session, as we are about to do, and then to \npresent essentially a fait accompli in the sense that with the \nexpiration of the international mandate from the United Nations at the \nend of the year, something would have to be done, and that something \nwould be an Executive agreement that to this point the Congress has not \neven been allowed to examine. We have not been able to see one word of \nthis agreement.\n  We tried to energize the Congress. We met with all of the appropriate \nadministration officials. There have been hearings. There have been \nassurances from the administration that they will consult at the \nappropriate time, as they define it. We have seen nothing. And so we \nare faced with a situation that is something of a constitutional coup \nd'etat by this administration.\n  I say to my colleagues that we all should be very concerned. At risk \nis a further expansion of the powers of the Presidency, the result of \nwhich would be to affirm in many minds that the President--any \nPresident--no longer needs the approval of Congress to enter into long-\nterm relations with another country, in effect committing us to \nobligations that involve our national security, our economic well-\nbeing, and our diplomatic posture around the world without the direct \ninvolvement of the Congress. This is not what the Constitution \nintended. It is not in the best interest of the country.\n  This amendment, which I offered on Friday, is designed to prevent \nthis sort of imbalance from occurring and at the same time it \nrecognizes the realities of the timelines that are now involved with \nrespect to the loss of international authority for our presence in Iraq \nat the end of this year.\n  The amendment is a sense of the Congress. On the one hand, it is a \nsense that we should work with the United Nations to extend the U.N. \nmandate up to an additional year, giving us some additional \ninternational authority for being in Iraq, if needed, taking away the \npressure of this timeline that could be used to justify an agreement \nthat the Congress has not had the ability to examine, but also saying \nthat an extension of the U.N. mandate would end at any time where a \nStrategic Framework Agreement and a Status of Forces Agreement between \nthe United States and Iraq would be mutually agreed upon.\n  The amendment also makes the point that the Strategic Framework \nAgreement now being negotiated between the United States and Iraq poses \nsignificant, long-term national security implications for this country, \nand this would be the sense of the Congress. We need to be saying that. \nThe Iraqis need to hear it from the Congress.\n  The amendment also puts Congress and the administration on record \nregarding the many assurances that the Bush administration has made to \nfully consult with the Congress with respect to all the details of the \nStrategic Framework Agreement and the Status of Forces Agreement and \nthat copies of the full text of these agreements will be provided to \nthe chairmen and ranking minority members of the appropriate committees \nin the House and the Senate prior to the entry into either of these \nagreements.\n  It is important to say that the Strategic Framework Agreement that \nhas been mutually agreed upon by the negotiators from our executive \nbranch and the Iraqi Government officials will cease to have effect \nunless it is approved by the Congress. This amendment states that \nwithin 180 days of the entry into force of that agreement, the Congress \nwould approve it. We are not calling for the full and complicated \nprocedures of a treaty, but we are saying a majority of the Congress \nshould approve any agreement that has been entered into.\n  On the one hand, this agreement recognizes the realities of where we \nare in terms of timelines, but on the other it protects the \nconstitutional processes by which we are entering into long-term \nrelations with other countries, whether it is Iraq or any other country \naround the world.\n  We need, as a Congress, to preserve this process. It does not operate \nin a way that would disrupt our operations in Iraq. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me on this amendment and protect the prerogatives of \nthe Congress under the Constitution.\n  I understand this amendment will be included in the unanimous consent \nrequest that will come for a vote later today. I hope my colleagues \nwill support me on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may say, I have been viewing the two \ndrafts of the UCs. Momentarily, I expect the chairman and I will decide \nhow to deal with it. But I assure the Senator that the Webb amendment \nis in both drafts of UCs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Webb for this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. We have the assurance of the administration that \nthey will share the text with the leadership of the Congress and with \nthe chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Armed Services \nCommittees and Foreign Relations Committees. But this goes beyond it \nand takes an essential step beyond that commitment.\n  We should be involved in this kind of a long-term relationship. I \ncommend\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\nthe Senator from Virginia for his drafting of this amendment. It is \nvery careful. I believe, based on the assurance of Senator Warner, that \nit will be included in any UC that is propounded. I hope that UC--any \nUC--can be adopted and that, indeed, it will include the Webb amendment \nas having the assurance of a vote.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the chairman and the senior Senator from Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when I \nhave reached the 1-minute mark.\n  Mr. President, I first want to say, as I rise to support the National \nDefense Authorization Act of 2009 and honor all of our service members \nand their families who continue to serve and sacrifice for the sake of \nthe country, that I am very appreciative of the leadership of both \nChairman Levin and Senator Warner and, obviously, Senator McCain who \nhas been absent some and Senator Warner has so ably filled in.\n  Chairman Warner will always be chairman to me. He has been my dear \nfriend through many years. What a great service to our country this \ngreat American has provided in the true Virginia gentleman tradition. \nHe has always been such an asset to this body and such an asset to our \nmen and women in uniform. I thank Senator Warner for his great service, \nI thank him for his friendship, and I thank him for what he does every \nday for our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I humbly acknowledge the gracious remarks, \nand I express my appreciation.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, last week marked the seventh \nanniversary of the day our country was attacked by terrorists, \nresulting in the deaths of approximately 3,000 innocent people. Since \nthat day and for the past 7 years, our Nation has devoted itself to \nwinning the global war on terrorism.\n  It is astonishing how the commitment of our soldiers, airmen, \nsailors, and marines has inspired the Afghan and Iraqi people to build \ntheir own political framework, improve their security and \ninfrastructure, and promote human rights, freedom, and democracy in \ntheir respective countries. I am proud to say that our commitment to \nand investment in the global war on terrorism is now bearing fruits \nthat are leading to a safer and more democratic world.\n  All of our accomplishments in this area start with our servicemembers \nand their families who every day face the challenges, sacrifices, and \ndangers inherent in the profession of arms. Congress is entrusted with \nproviding the necessary resources, policies, and programs for our \nservicemembers and military departments in order to ensure their \nsuccess.\n  This year's National Defense Authorization Act serves as the vehicle \nto do just that and provides the resources and policies to carry out \nthe missions we ask of our military.\n  Specifically, the bill provides the following:\n  An increase of 7,000 soldiers, 5,000 marines, and 3,371 full-time \npersonnel for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve over the 2008 \nforce structure levels; a 3.9-percent pay raise for all military \npersonnel; a total of $125 billion for military personnel to improve \nallowances, bonuses, permanent change of station moves, and death \nbenefits; reauthorization of over 25 types of bonuses and special pay \nto promote enlistment and continued military service; more rigorous \noversight procedures for military housing privatization projects; and a \nreport to Congress on the implementation of the Yellow Ribbon \nReintegration Program.\n  I also have several amendments to the bill, all of which I understand \nwill be included in a manager's package. I wish to discuss these \namendments very briefly.\n  First, last year, I worked with many of my colleagues to include a \nprovision in the National Defense Authorization bill allowing for \nmembers of the Guard and Reserve who deploy in support of a contingency \noperation to receive their retired pay early based on how much time \nthey deploy. This year, Senator Kerry and I, along with 15 other \nSenators, have offered an amendment that would make this provision \nretroactive to include any duty performed after September 11, 2001.\n  This amendment recognizes a significant sacrifice that members of the \nGuard and Reserve and their families have made since 9/11 in answering \nthe call of duty. It is only right that their duty and support of the \nglobal war on terrorism since September 11 be recognized and included \nwhen considering when they should receive retired pay. It is my hope we \ncan keep this provision in conference and included in the final version \nof the bill.\n  Also for the Guard and Reserve, I have offered an amendment, \ncosponsored by my colleague Mark Pryor from Arkansas, which would \nprovide 180 days of transitional health care for members leaving active \nduty who agree to affiliate with the Guard and Reserve. An identical \nprovision was sponsored and included in the House bill by my good \nfriend Congressman Sanford Bishop from Georgia. This amendment provides \na powerful incentive for members leaving active duty to join the Guard \nand Reserve and could result in several thousand more people entering \nthe Guard and Reserve each and every year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nsupport for this amendment from the Reserve Officers Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Reserve Officers Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2008.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Chairman of the Senate Reserve Caucus, Russell Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chambliss: The Reserve Officers Association, \n     representing 65,000 Reserve Component members, supports \n     Amendment 5356 of the Senate Defense Authorization bill, S. \n     3001, which grants transitional health care to active duty \n     personnel as they become a member of the armed forces reserve \n     component.\n       It is important to reduce the barriers that prevent people \n     from joining the National Guard or Reserve. Providing \n     transitional TRICARE health coverage permits serving members \n     and their families to continue with the same coverage they \n     received while on active duty, and allow them time to qualify \n     for TRICARE Reserve Select. Your amendment provides a \n     recruiting incentive that helps the individual, his or her \n     family and the armed forces.\n       Thank you for your efforts on this key issue, and other \n     support to the military that you have shown in the past. \n     Please feel free to have your staff call ROA's legislative \n     director, Marshall Hanson with any question or issue you \n     would like to discuss.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Dennis M. McCarthy,\n\n                                Lieutenant General USMC (Retired),\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, another amendment I have offered to the \nbill, along with my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, provides a \nsense of the Senate on the care of wounded warriors. Last year's \nDefense Authorization bill contained the Wounded Warrior Act which went \na long way to helping DOD and Department of Veterans Affairs establish \na network of recovery care coordinators who would work to manage and \ncoordinate care for recovering servicemembers. This is a powerful \nprogram and stands to make a huge impact in the lives of our wounded \nwarriors. My amendment calls on DOD and the VA to expedite the \nrecruiting, training, and hiring of these personnel, and also to \npartner with civilian institutions, such as the Medical College of \nGeorgia School of Nursing, to help train these personnel and ensure \nthey have access to the most up-to-date research and skills in order to \nbest serve our wounded warriors.\n  Two other amendments I will mention briefly are first a sense of the \nSenate that the Air Force should conduct a robust demonstration of the \nSYERS system on the Joint STARS aircraft. SYERS would provide an \nexpanded combat identification capability for Joint STARS and the Air \nForce should fully explore its utility and the possibility of \nincorporating SYERS on the entire Joint STARS fleet.\n  Second, I have offered an amendment that would require DOD to report \nto Congress on the requirement for Non-dual status National Guard \ntechnicians. These personnel are often used to backfill deploying Guard \npersonnel, and due to the large number of deployments, we need to look \nat expanding the number of Non-dual status technicians as a means of \nensuring the Guard's home State missions are not neglected.\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\n  The National Defense Authorization Act is designed to strengthen our \nmilitary, provide the required resources to the Department of Defense \nto carry out the responsibilities our Nation asks of them, and to \nimprove our servicemembers' and their families' quality of life. The \nproposed legislation and the funding priorities will ensure that our \nNation maintains an adept and quality force to defend our country and \nallow us to continue to be an ambassador for a prosperous and peaceful \nworld. I commend the chairman, the ranking member, and committee staff \nfor their hard work on the bill and their diligence in bringing it to \nthe floor.\n  Unfortunately, the bill does have several problematic provisions, \nincluding an unnecessary limitation on the role of private security \ncontractors and an unnecessary prohibition on trained and qualified \npersonnel conducting lawful interrogations. I hope we can address and \nresolve these issues in conference in a way that best serves our \nmilitary personnel and allows them to effectively carry out their \nresponsibilities.\n  I also hope the Senate can complete action on this very important \npiece of legislation and proceed to a House-Senate conference and \npassage of a conference report prior to the end of this month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Feinstein pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 3493 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we continue to read today, as we did \nyesterday, about dramatic changes in the American economy, particularly \nthe problems facing many of our larger financial institutions.\n  Not that many weeks ago, the Federal Government stepped in when Bear \nStearns was in a terrible economic state and took over the \nresponsibility for that company. It was an extraordinary decision \nbecause this is a company that we had not regulated as a Federal \nGovernment, not one at least in detail. We knew their transactions and \nbalance sheets, but we put the full faith and credit of the American \npeople and our Treasury behind rescuing Bear Stearns.\n  Then a little over a week ago the decision was made by this \nadministration to do the same for two entities, Government-sponsored \nentities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These were the major institutions \nfor housing in America. Between them, some 50 percent of all mortgages \nwere being held. It was understandable that decision was made because \nthe alternative was unthinkable. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should \ncollapse, it would jeopardize not only mortgages and homeowners but \nalso the American economy. It is such a large part, it is \nunderstandable that the administration stepped in to make that \ndecision.\n  Now this week comes a new round. Lehman Brothers, a company in New \nYork which has prospered for many years, now faces bankruptcy, and \nalong with it the question of the future of Merrill Lynch, a major \nbrokerage house which appears to be in line to be acquired by Bank of \nAmerica.\n  These are dramatic and unsettling events and a reminder to all of us \nthat the state of the American economy is not as sound and solid as we \nwould like to see it. But those are the events which happened at the \nhighest levels of finance and the highest levels of Wall Street.\n  All of us representing our constituents--I represent Illinois--have \ntraveled around our States and met with small business men and women, \nfamily farmers, and families as well, talking about the situation they \nface today. They do not make the headlines as Merrill Lynch or Lehman \nBrothers, but they should because if you go across the board and talk \nto these working families, these middle-income families, you will find \nthat over the last 7 or 8 years, this country has not been kind to \nthem. Their spending power has been reduced. They continue to work. \nThey are productive workers. America's economy is a productive economy. \nAnd yet they have not been rewarded for their work. Their wages have \nnot kept up with the cost of living. They have fallen behind under this \nBush administration some $2,000 worth of spending power at a minimum. \nThese are the people who are paying $4.50 per gallon of gasoline trying \nto figure out how to get back and forth to work and to meet their \nobligations to their families and friends.\n  These are folks who are struggling with the cost of groceries and \nclothing. They are the same ones trying to figure how in the world to \nput their kids through college so their kids will not end up with \nstudent loans that look like their first mortgages.\n  They are worried also about health care, about the health insurance \nplans that do not cover as much this year as they did last year. They \nare worried about the out-of-pocket payments they may have to make. \nThey realize, most of them, they are one diagnosis away from \nbankruptcy. That is the reality of life in the economy beyond Wall \nStreet.\n  So when you look across the board at this economy, you realize the \nfundamental weaknesses of what we face today. Of course, the housing \nmarket has been the catalyst for some of the problems we now see. It \nturned out that the greed of Wall Street, of the overreaching of some \ncompanies, led to loans and mortgages which were totally unwise.\n  Many of those now have resulted in foreclosures, where people are \nhaving to leave their homes. Their misfortune is being visited on their \nneighbors. I recently had an appraisal on my home in Springfield. It is \nthe same home I lived in when I was first elected to Congress many \nyears ago. I have been there a long time. I have to tell you the value \nof my home has gone down 20 percent.\n  Why? It is not because we did not keep it up--we do a fairly good job \nwith that--it is because the economy is weak in my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, and foreclosures nearby have taken their toll on the \nvalue of my home. We made all of our mortgage payments, but the value \nof our home went down 20 percent. That is the reality a lot of people \nare facing. My story is not one that should bring tears to anybody's \neyes; we will get through it. But a lot of folks cannot. They cannot \nget through this, and that is where we are in the economy today.\n  How did we reach this point? We reached this point when we adopted a \nmentality that was dominant in this city for so long that, first, get \nGovernment off my back. Government is my enemy. Deregulate.\n  That was a pretty popular mantra around here 10 or 15 years ago. In \nfact, a lot of people laughed about it. Even\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\npeople such as the venerable wise critic, Rush Limbaugh, said: If we \nclose down the Federal Government no one would even notice.\n  Well, he was wrong when he said it. He would certainly be wrong today \nbecause what has happened to us is a reminder that there is an \nappropriate and important role that Government needs to play. As strong \nas our entrepreneurial free market economy is, if it is not subject to \noversight and accountability, it can spin out of control.\n  That is what happened with this subprime mortgage market. Instead of \nhaving appropriate oversight and accountability, loans were made which \nmade no sense whatsoever, and eventually that credit operation \ncollapsed leading to the foreclosures we see today.\n  What we see on Wall Street now with many of these investment banks \ngoing under are credit institutions which are not subject to Government \nregulation. It is like playing ``off the books.'' If a business does \nthat, the IRS comes in and says: You have just violated the law. You \nare supposed to put everything on the books and report to us.\n  Well, there is a whole world of credit and finance that is ``off the \nbooks'' when it comes to regulation and oversight by the Federal \nGovernment. And that is the world that is collapsing. It is an \nindication to me that when we faced a similar situation 75 years ago, \nwith the Great Depression, that Franklin Roosevelt got it right. He \nunderstood that the economic problems in America called for sensible \nregulation and disclosure and transparency and accountability.\n  He created agencies which responded to the economy of the day. \nRegulation, yes, but without that regulation, unfortunately, the market \nwas spinning out of control to the detriment of everyone, not just \nbusiness owners but workers, farmers, and people who are just trying to \nget by.\n  We need to return to a mindset which says there is an appropriate \nrole for Government. There are things which our Government can do which \nprivate industry, on its own devices, will not do. That is why we need \nto be more sensible when it comes to regulation.\n  Yesterday, the Republican candidate for President, John McCain, said:\n\n       Our economy, I think still the fundamentals of our economy \n     are strong.\n\n  I would say that Senator McCain does not accurately portray our \neconomy today. I wonder which economy he is talking about? Is he \ntalking about an economy with record unemployment, the highest in 5 \nyears? Is he talking about an economy with record home foreclosures, \nthe most since the Great Depression? Is he talking about an economy \nwhere people's savings that they count on for the future--the value of \ntheir home or their 401(k) or their retirement account--have been \ndiminished by the state of this economy? He cannot be talking about the \neconomy where middle-income families have fallen behind in their \nspending power, where they find it difficult to live paycheck to \npaycheck, let alone save some money. He cannot be talking about an \neconomy with $4.50 gasoline, with diesel fuel that is even more \nexpensive, and jet fuel that is running the aviation industry out of \nbusiness.\n\n  What economy is John McCain talking about? It is interesting how \nclose his quote comes to one from another person who happened to be \nelected President. His name was Herbert Hoover; the date was October \n25, 1929. This was just shortly before, days before, the great stock \nmarket crash.\n  Here is what President Herbert Hoover said then:\n\n       The fundamental business of the country, that is production \n     and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous \n     basis.\n\n  That was said days before the stock market collapsed. This quote from \nJohn McCain yesterday is reminiscent of President Hoover. It shows the \nsame lack of connection to the real world in which people are living.\n  When it comes to Senator McCain's philosophy and how we should \napproach these issues, he has been pretty outspoken. It has been \nprinted this morning in an article in the New York Times written by \nJackie Calmes. She wrote:\n\n       In early 1995, after Republicans had taken control of \n     Congress, Mr. McCain promoted a moratorium on Federal \n     regulations of all kinds. He was quoted as saying that \n     excessive regulations were ``destroying the American family, \n     the American dream,'' and voters ``want these regulations \n     stopped.'' The moratorium measure was unsuccessful.\n\n  He told the Wall Street Journal last March: ``I'm always for less \nregulation, but I am aware of the view that there is a need for \ngovernment oversight'' in situations like the subprime lending crisis, \nthe problem that has cascaded through Wall Street this year.\n  Senator McCain concluded: ``But I am fundamentally a deregulator.''\n  Later that month Senator McCain gave a speech on the housing crisis \nin which he called for less regulation saying:\n\n       Our financial market approach should include encouraging \n     increased capital in financial institutions by removing \n     regulatory, accounting and tax impediments to raising \n     capital.\n\n  Senator McCain has been consistent. He has opposed Government \noversight, accountability, and regulation. Now, it can go too far. Do \nnot get me wrong. We have seen it at its worst. But if you do not have \na fundamental oversight effort being made by the Government, then \nconsumers and the economy are at the mercy of those who go too far.\n  Inevitably they will go too far. I can recall the savings and loan \ncrisis, leading to a taxpayers bailout. I now see the problems in the \nsubprime mortgage situation leading to a taxpayers bailout of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, and maybe others. If we do not keep \nan eye on their activities and demand accountability, we will end up \npaying the price.\n  That is why this election is so fundamental. If we want to continue \nthe economic policies of the Bush-Cheney administration that have led \nus to this sorry moment, then Senator McCain is clearly the person who \nshould lead this country for the next 4 years. But if we are going to \nchange those policies, if we are going to give middle-income and \nworking families a fighting chance in this economy, if we are going to \nhave a Tax Code written not to reward wealth but to reward work for a \nchange, then we need a change in Washington. We need to have a new \napproach, not only a new economic and tax policy but the kind of \nregulation that provides protection from the excesses of the market. \nEven Senator McCain yesterday referred to the greed on Wall Street. \nLeft unchecked, unfettered, this greed can spin out of control. That is \nwhy there is such a fundamental choice facing American families in only \n7 weeks.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the New York Times article to which I \nreferred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 16, 2008]\n\n               In Candidates, 2 Approaches to Wall Street\n\n                           (By Jackie Calmes)\n\n       Washington.--The crisis on Wall Street will leave the next \n     president facing tough choices about how best to regulate the \n     financial system, and although neither Senator Barack Obama \n     nor Senator John McCain has yet offered a detailed plan, \n     their records. and the principles they have set out so far \n     suggest they could come at the issue in very different ways.\n       On the campaign trail on Monday, Mr. McCain, the Republican \n     presidential nominee, struck a populist tone. Speaking in \n     Florida, he said that the economy's underlying fundamentals \n     remained strong but were being threatened ``because of the \n     greed by some based in Wall Street and we have got to fix \n     it.''\n       But his record on the issue, and the views of those he has \n     always cited as his most influential advisers, suggest that \n     he has never departed in any major way from his party's \n     embrace of deregulation and relying more on market forces \n     than on the government to exert discipline.\n       While Mr. McCain has cited the need for additional \n     oversight when it comes to specific situations, like the \n     mortgage problems behind the current shocks on Wall Street, \n     he has consistently characterized himself as fundamentally a \n     deregulator and he has no history prior to the presidential \n     campaign of advocating steps to tighten standards on \n     investment firms.\n       He has often taken his lead on financial issues from two \n     outspoken advocates of free market approaches, former Senator \n     Phil Gramm and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve \n     chairman. Individuals associated with Merrill Lynch, which \n     sold itself to Bank of America in the market upheaval of the \n     past weekend, have given his presidential campaign $300,000, \n     making them Mr. McCain's largest contributor, collectively.\n       Mr. Obama sought Monday to attribute the financial upheaval \n     to lax regulation during the Bush years, and in turn to link \n     Mr. McCain to that approach.\n       ``I certainly don't fault Senator McCain for these \n     problems, but I do fault the economic\n\n[[Page S8823]]\n\n     philosophy he subscribes to,'' Mr. Obama told several hundred \n     people who gathered for an outdoor rally in Grand Junction, \n     CO.\n       Mr. Obama set out his general approach to financial \n     regulation in March, calling for regulating investment banks, \n     mortgage brokers and hedge funds much as commercial banks \n     are. And he would streamline the overlapping regulatory \n     agencies and create a commission to monitor threats to the \n     financial system and report to the White House and Congress.\n       On Wall Street's Republican friendly turf, Mr. Obama has \n     outraised Mr. McCain. He has received $9.9 million from \n     individuals associated with the securities and investment \n     industry, $3 million more than Mr. McCain, according to the \n     Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. His \n     advisers include Wall Street heavyweights, including \n     Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary who is now \n     a senior adviser at Citigroup, another firm being buffeted \n     by the financial crisis.\n       If many voters are fuzzy on the events that over the \n     weekend forced Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy \n     and Merrill Lynch & Company. to be swallowed by the Bank of \n     America Corporation, the continuing chaos among the most \n     venerable names in American finance--coming on top of the \n     recent government seizure of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac and the demise of the Bear Stearns Companies--has \n     stoked their anxiety for the economy, the foremost issue on \n     voters' minds.\n       So it was that first Mr. Obama and then Mr. McCain rushed \n     out their statements on Monday morning before most Americans \n     had reached their workplaces.\n       To the extent that travails on Wall Street and Main Street \n     have both corporations and homeowners looking to Washington \n     for a hand, that helps Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats who \n     see government as a force for good and business regulation as \n     essential. Yet Mr. McCain has sold himself to many voters as \n     an agent for change, despite his party's unpopularity after \n     years of dominating in Washington, and despite his own \n     antiregulation stances of past years.\n       Mr. McCain was quick on Monday to issue a statement calling \n     for ``major reform'' to ``replace the outdated and \n     ineffective patchwork quilt of regulatory oversight in \n     Washington and bring transparency and accountability to Wall \n     Street.'' Later his campaign unveiled a television \n     advertisement called ``Crisis,'' that began: ``Our economy in \n     crisis. Only proven reformers John McCain and Sarah Palin can \n     fix it. Tougher rules on Wall Street to protect your life \n     savings.''\n       Mr. McCain's reaction suggests how the pendulum has swung \n     to cast government regulation in a more favorable political \n     light as the economy has suffered additional blows and how he \n     is scrambling to adjust. While he has few footprints on \n     economic issues in more than a quarter century in Congress, \n     Mr. McCain has always been in his party's mainstream on the \n     issue.\n       In early 1995, after Republicans had taken control of \n     Congress, Mr. McCain promoted a moratorium on federal \n     regulations of all kinds. He was quoted as saying that \n     excessive regulations were ``destroying the American family, \n     the American dream'' and voters ``want these regulations \n     stopped.'' The moratorium measure was unsuccessful.\n       ``I'm always for less regulation,'' he told The Wall Street \n     Journal last March, ``but I am aware of the view that there \n     is a need for government oversight'' in situations like the \n     subprime lending crisis, the problem that has cascaded \n     through Wall Street this year. He concluded, ``but I am \n     fundamentally a deregulator.''\n       Later that month, he gave a speech on the housing crisis in \n     which he called for less regulation, saying, ``Our financial \n     market approach should include encouraging increased capital \n     in financial institutions by removing regulatory, accounting \n     and tax impediments to raising capital.''\n       Yet Mr. McCain has at times in the presidential campaign \n     exhibited a less ideological streak. As he did on Monday, he \n     from time to time speaks in populist tones about big \n     corporations and financial institutions and presents himself \n     as a Theodore Roosevelt-style reformer. He supported the Bush \n     administration's decision to seize Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac, the mortgage giants, and he has backed as unavoidable \n     the promise of taxpayer money to help contain the financial \n     crisis.\n       Other than Mr. Gramm, who as chairman of the Senate Banking \n     Committee before his leaving Congress in 2002 worked to \n     block efforts to tighten financial regulation, Mr. \n     McCain's closest adviser on matters of Wall Street is John \n     Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, who has \n     raised about $500,000 for Mr. McCain. Unlike Mr. Gramm, \n     Mr. Thain has a reputation as a pragmatic, nonideological, \n     moderate Republican. That the men are Mr. McCain's \n     touchstones is typical of his small and eclectic mix of \n     advisers, making it hard to generalize about how Mr. \n     McCain would act as president.\n       A prominent McCain supporter, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of \n     Minnesota, signaled how Mr. McCain would try to make his \n     antiregulation record fit the proregulation times that the \n     next president will inherit. Mr. Pawlenty suggested in an \n     interview on Fox News that, given the danger that ``any \n     future administration'' would go too far, Mr. McCain would be \n     the safer bet to protect against ``excessive government \n     intervention or excessive government regulation;''\n       Mr. Obama also does not have much of a record on financial \n     regulation. As a first-term senator, he has not been around \n     for the major debates of recent years, and his eight years in \n     the Illinois Senate afforded little opportunity to weigh in \n     on the issues.\n       In March 2007, however, he warned of the coming housing \n     crisis, and a year later in a speech in Manhattan he outlined \n     six principles for overhauling financial regulation.\n       On Monday, he said the nation was facing ``the most serious \n     financial crisis since the Great Depression,'' and attributed \n     it on the hands-off policies of the Republican White House \n     that, he says, Mr. McCain would continue. Seeking to showcase \n     Mr. Obama's concerns, his campaign said Mr. Obama led a \n     conference call on the crisis early Monday that included Paul \n     A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve; Mr. \n     Rubin; and his successor as treasury secretary, Lawrence H. \n     Summers.\n       Later, citing Mr. McCain's remarks about the economy's \n     strong fundamentals, he told a Colorado crowd that Mr. McCain \n     ``doesn't get what's happening between the mountain in Sedona \n     where he lives and the corridors of power where he works.''\n       One reason for both men's sketchy records on financial \n     issues is that neither has been a member of the Senate \n     Banking Committee, which has oversight of the industry and \n     its regulators. Under both parties' leadership, the committee \n     often has been a graveyard for proposals opposed by lobbyists \n     for financial institutions, including Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac, which last week were forced into government \n     conservatorships.\n       Industry lobbyists' success in killing such regulations \n     meant senators outside the banking panel did not have to take \n     a stand on them.\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the hour of 2:30, I ask unanimous \nconsent to be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also ask unanimous consent that the Republican leader's \ntime begin 5 minutes after I begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to address the Senate not only as a \nSenator from the largest State in the Union, a State that is \nexperiencing many problems that started with the housing crisis about \nwhich we talked a long time ago, before the Fed stepped in and did \nsomething, but I also rise as an economics major. I received my degree \nin economics. My minor was political science. I was a stockbroker a \nlong time ago on Wall Street. I know a little bit about Wall Street, \nand I know a little bit about the times we are in right now. I worked \non Wall Street when John Kennedy was assassinated. It was a horrible \ntime. Confidence was shattered. The stock market actually closed down \nfor a period. Now we are facing a meltdown. The fact is, we are all \ngoing to work and hope that it doesn't melt all the way down.\n  On the day that we learn about Merrill Lynch, which was the gold \nstandard of brokerage houses, and AIG, what I understand is the largest \ninsurance company in America, when we hear about that and about Lehman \nBrothers, which we also hope can survive in some form via purchase--and \ncertainly we know thousands of people have lost everything--to hear a \nU.S. Senator--namely, Senator McCain--say the fundamentals of this \neconomy are strong sends cold shivers up and down my spine. To think \nthat anyone would say that, one would have to go back to the days of \nHerbert Hoover, President of the United States, the day after the \nmarket crashed in 1929 and we entered the Great Depression. He said:\n\n       The fundamental business of the country, that is production \n     and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous \n     basis.\n\n  We have Senator McCain memorializing this attitude and these words.\n  I wish to spend the rest of my time going through the fundamentals of \nthis economy. I will come back and speak later when I have a little \nmore time to expand.\n  In 1999, the average American family spent $3,261 on cost-of-living \nexpenses; in 2007, $7,585. The average household earned less in 2006 \nthan they did in 2000. Incomes are going down. Expenses are going up--\ngroceries, heating, gas, health care. The fundamentals of our economy \nare strong? As Senator Obama said: What economy? Not this economy. The \naverage household earned less in 2006 than they did in 2000. Job growth \nduring this administration has been the slowest since Herbert Hoover in \n1929, the Great Depression. Our economy has lost jobs for 8 straight \nmonths; 84,000 jobs were lost last month. The fundamentals of this \neconomy are strong? What?\n  One in five Americans is unemployed for more than 26 weeks, an \nincrease of\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\n8.2 percent over 2001. Americans living in poverty increased by 5.7 \nmillion since 2000, and 37 million Americans live in poverty. The \nfundamentals of this economy are strong? Spare me.\n  Existing home sales fell by 22 percent in 2007. President Bush \ninherited a surplus. We now have an enormous deficit. The debt has \nincreased over $4 trillion since 2001. We are spending $10 billion a \nmonth in Iraq. The money is leaving the country. We are not making the \ninvestment. The fundamentals of this economy are strong?\n  Every American, I don't care what party--Republican, Democratic, \nIndependent--should be up in arms about a leader looking at these \nfigures. I have only given a little of the story. Let's get real. The \nfundamentals of this economy are weak. The people are anxious, and they \nshould be. It is time for change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired. Who seeks recognition?\n  Under the previous order, the time until 3:06 is equally divided, \nwith the Republican leader controlling the first 15 minutes and the \nmajority leader controlling the last 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, unfortunately, we are in a situation with \nthis bill where we have not been able to reach an agreement on how to \nproceed. I say this notwithstanding the Herculean efforts by the \nchairman and the ranking member of the committee. Senator Warner \ninformed me a moment ago about the negotiations that have been ongoing, \nliterally over the weekend, and yet it appears that notwithstanding \ntheir best efforts it has been impossible to find a way to move forward \non this bill that encompasses amendments or embodies those amendments \nin a managers' amendment to the bill such that the Members, at least on \nour side, would feel comfortable proceeding to close off debate on the \nbill and bring debate to a close so we could move on with the bill. \nUnfortunately, I believe we have had two votes so far on this bill. I \nthink one of those was on an amendment I offered, or it was accepted.\n  In any event, I think they have accepted two amendments, we have had \ntwo votes, and I am informed that over the past three Department of \nDefense authorization bills, we had a rollcall vote average of 21 votes \nper bill. That is about right for a Defense authorization bill. This is \none of the most important bills we have each year. There is a lot of \nMember interest. The committee has always allowed a robust debate and \namendments by Members and, an average, as I said, of 21. We have had \ntwo so far. Clearly we are not ready to stop this bill. There is more \nwork to be done. Frequently, amendments are embodied in a managers' \namendment, on average, of 192 amendments that were agreed to during the \nconsideration of the last three DOD authorization bills. As I said, \nthis year the majority has accepted but two.\n  Now, on our side we had hoped we would have a unanimous consent \nagreement that could be entered into at this point to obviate the \nnecessity of the vote on cloture. It appears now that that will not be \nthe case. So unfortunately we are in a situation where we are clearly \nnot ready to call an end to this bill. There is still a lot more work \nto be done. The two managers have tried very hard to reach an \nagreement. That has not been possible to do. Therefore, at least for \nme--and I don't pretend to speak for everyone on the Republican side--\nbut at least for me, I can't in good conscience vote to close off \ndebate, bring this bill to a close when there are so many outstanding \nissues that I know Republicans wish to bring to closure. There is one \nin particular I will mention before I close.\n  There is this matter of earmarks. What we had resolved to do in the \nSenate was to say that only legislative language would be sufficient \nfor a so-called earmark to have the force of law. You couldn't put \nearmarks in report language and then expect the executive branch to \nadhere to those earmarks when it spent the money appropriated by \nCongress. Well, once again, we have the specific items of spending that \nsome call earmarks not put in legislative language except by reference. \nI know both Senator Warner and Senator DeMint and some others had \nproposed amendments to deal with that. I would have liked to have voted \non a Senator Warner amendment to deal with that subject but, \napparently, without a unanimous consent agreement, that is not going to \nbe possible. So there are a variety of things that remain to be done. \nIf we vote for cloture on the bill, they are not going to get done.\n  Therefore, reluctantly, as I said, it will be my position to vote \nagainst cloture on this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has all time of Senator McConnell expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this will be one of the most difficult \nvotes that I will have had to cast in my almost 30 years in the Senate. \nI must say to my dear friend, the chairman of the committee, we have \nworked together these years and we just made our last efforts in the \ncloakroom to try and bridge the gap--I respect both sides--bridge the \ngap. We failed, and now we are confronted with cloture. I then searched \nmy conscience: What do I do? Because I am definitely more than \nsympathetic, completely in support that the minority has to have \ncertain rights and a certain ability. That is the way this institution \nis constructed.\n  I shall vote for cloture for the following reason: I ran a quick \nmental calculation. It was 63 years ago, in January of 1945, that I \njoined the U.S. Navy. If I had to point to the one single thing in my \nsome 40 years plus of public service that has meant the most to me \npersonally, it is working with and learning from the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States. My military career on active \nduty is of no great consequence, but my learning experience was \nenormous, and I have tried through these 30 years in the Senate to pay \nback to this generation and future generations of men and women all the \nwonderful things, including two GI bills, that were done for me.\n  So I could not have this, being almost the last vote that I will cast \nin these 30 years, in any other way than be consistent with my \nconscience, as I have tried to do the best, and will continue to do the \nbest, on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their \nfamilies.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the opportunity in August to travel to \nAfghanistan. I always try to find the Nevada troops and I was able to \ndo that because there are a lot of them over there. But I talked to \ntroops--not Nevada troops but American service men and women. I have \nhad the good fortune of being able to go to Iraq and talk to our \nmilitary in Iraq. To try to explain to them that we are not doing a \nDefense authorization bill because minority rights aren't protected, I \nmean what is--what are we doing? This will be the 94th time we voted on \ncloture this Congress--the 94th time--far breaking any records ever in \nthe history of our great country; more than double.\n  My friend, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, says they are not \nready to end this debate. We have a professional staff. The Republican \nstaff of the Armed Services Committee is as professional as you can \nget, and that on the Democratic side is as professional as you can get, \nled by two of America's all-time great Senators: Levin and Warner. I \nsay that without any degree of trying to make them feel good. It is the \ntruth. They are two of the great Senators in the history of our \ncountry. They have worked as hard as they could to put together a \nDefense authorization bill. Now, let's assume we don't do anything to \nthat bill and cloture is invoked and we pass that bill. Wouldn't that \nbe a great time to celebrate here? Because you know what would happen? \nWe would have a conference with the House and work out whatever \ndifferences in their bill and our bill.\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\n  This is about earmarks? Oh, come on. We have had congressionally \nmandated spending since we have been a country. Why? Because our \nFounding Fathers set the country up that way. We have three separate \nbranches of government. We don't have a king. We have a President. He \ndoesn't make all the decisions. Benjamin Franklin and all of those men \nwho met in Philadelphia wanted us to have three separate branches of \ngovernment and they determined what our duties would be in the \nConstitution. One of them is to determine the spending. That is our \nrole. That is our obligation. Now, are these two men trying to hide \nsomething from the American people, trying to sneak something in to \nhelp a military base someplace in America? No. Everything is \ntransparent. This earmark is only one of the issues of the day to give \nsomebody something to talk about, to talk about how bad government is.\n  During the past 8 years, our Armed Forces--the best trained, the most \ncourageous armed forces the world has ever known--have been stretched \nto the limit. I don't say this; our military commanders say it. Both \ncivilian and military leaders of our country say we have to help our \nmilitary. History will remember that during these years, despite \ntremendous strain, our military accomplished everything asked of them \nwith heroism and success. We have all been to the funerals. I never \nunderstood until I went to Afghanistan what Shane Patton went through \nas a SEAL in Afghanistan. I went to that funeral and I thought why is a \nSEAL in Afghanistan. There is no water there. He is there doing the \nthings they are trained to do--going after terrorists--and he was \nkilled in the process. It won't be easy to rebuild our Armed Forces. It \nmust be a priority of our next President to give them proper rest, \nproper training and equipment when they are deployed, and proper \nphysical and mental health care when they return from combat.\n\n  Part of my security detail as the majority leader--because people \ndon't like what I do and say, I have had people threaten me. I have had \nas a part of my security detail a guy by the name of James Proctor. \nSince I was assistant leader and leader, he has been with me all that \ntime, but it has been interrupted by three tours of duty to Iraq. He is \nan Army officer. Three tours of duty. He leaves his little family and \nheads off to Iraq. For James Proctor--to tell him we are not doing a \nDefense authorization bill because of earmarks or because we didn't \nhave enough time to debate it, it is laughable, and he would laugh. \nThey would all laugh. It is unfair.\n  So next January 20, I guess, we will see what we can do to move \nforward, because we have to rebuild our Armed Forces. In the meantime, \nCongress can begin, I hope, to do something in the interim. We can \nbegin now by passing the Defense authorization bill, a sensible, \nbipartisan bill that will honor our troops and enhance our national \nsecurity.\n  Just a few things: For men and women in uniform, this bill will give \nalmost a 4-percent increase--exactly 3.9 percent increase--a pay \nraise--to our troops and other military personnel. Do they deserve it? \nOf course they do. If this bill doesn't pass, do they get it? Of course \nthey don't. This will mean more money in the pockets of military \nfamilies struggling to make it from one paycheck to the next. It will \nhelp returning heroes afford a place to live or go back to school. We \ninvest in Defense health programs for men and women which, among other \nthings, prevent the need to raise TRICARE fees. This bill will fight \nterrorism and protect our national security, and to tell James Proctor \nand people who have served gallantly in this military that we are not \nmoving forward on this because minority rights aren't protected?\n  This bill funds international nonproliferation efforts to combat \nweapons of mass destruction as well as programs that will help us \nprepare the homeland for chemical or biological attacks. This bill will \nincrease funding for special operations command to train and equip \nforces and support ongoing military operations. If we hear one thing \nwhen we go to Afghanistan, they will tell you how important special \noperations officers and troops are. This bill provides funds supporting \nthe development and use of unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  Creech Air Force Base--named after General Creech who ended his \ncareer and his life in Nevada--was named after him, a great military \nofficer. Indian Springs Air Base, it used to be called. It is midway \nbetween Las Vegas and the Nevada test site. This facility was going to \nbe closed, until they determined these drones were some of the most \nimportant things in the military, and this legislation takes into \nconsideration how important unmanned aerial vehicles are. This \nlegislation helps reinforce special intelligence capabilities within \nthe Army and the Marine Corps. This is a very good piece of \nlegislation, an important step toward rebuilding our Armed Forces and \nprotecting the American people.\n  I wish I had words adequate to express my personal appreciation--and \nI can speak for everyone on this side of the aisle--for the work done \nby Chairman Levin and John Warner. There are no two more honorable \npeople in the world; whether they are rabbis, priests, ministers, there \nis no one who has more credibility and honesty than these two men. I \nhave had conversations with these two fine Senators, where they said: \nThis is what I am going to do. Do I need to check back with them and \nask: Do you really mean what you said? No. Their word is their bond. \nOnce they have said it, that is it.\n  I feel very bad. Senator Levin is going to have another opportunity \nto do one of these bills, but this man, Senator Warner, won't unless we \ninvoke cloture. We need to do that so that he can participate in coming \nup with the final bill that will lead to a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. For 30 years--as I have said on the floor before, I \ndon't know his predecessors--I served with a number of them--but the \nState of Virginia could not have had a better Senator than John Warner. \nThey could have had one as good but nobody better. These two men have \ndone their very best. I accept the product they have given us, the \nproduct we have right here, now, today. I accept it. Let's pass it. \nLet's invoke cloture on it, and if there are germane postcloture \namendments, we will take care of those. That is what these men do.\n  Now, I want to say one other thing. Let's not forget that the ranking \nRepublican on the Armed Services Committee is Senator John McCain. I \nunderstand the Presidential campaign takes candidates away from what \ngoes on here. Both parties realize that. But it certainly would have \nhelped move this legislation forward if the ranking member of this \ncommittee, the Republican nominee for President, had shown leadership \nand a commitment to this cause by talking to his fellow Republicans and \nsaying: Come on, we need to get this passed. Not a word publicly or \nprivately, that I know of.\n  We have a chance to do the right thing by coming together to invoke \ncloture and move toward passing this legislation. I hope all Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans, will join to move forward so we can honor \nand promptly care for our military families, while enhancing our \ncountry's ability to meet the security challenges we face.\n  Let me say that, while I talked about John Warner, I want to close by \ntalking about Carl Levin. I, too, don't know all of his predecessors. I \ndo know a little history. There could have been a Senator as good as \nCarl Levin from Michigan but no one any better.\n  We deserve this legislation. The country deserves this legislation. \nThese two managers deserve this legislation. Let's invoke cloture. It \nwill give us an opportunity to complete this legislation. I hope we can \ndo that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin be given 2 minutes to \nclose the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the leader and I thank Senator \nWarner for his statement in support of cloture. It is a difficult and \ncourageous vote. I commend them on it.\n  The issue here is not earmarks; the issue is a perception that is \nbeing perpetrated that it is about earmarks. This green book is our \ncommittee report. It lists all of the items to be added to it and \nsubtracted. This white book is our bill. It incorporates the charts and \nlines from the committee\n\n[[Page S8826]]\n\nreport and is incorporated into this bill as law. The lines here--add-\nons, subtractions, all of the requests of the President that weren't \ntouched, by the thousands--are incorporated by reference in our bill.\n  The amendment of Senator DeMint, who wants to eliminate the \nincorporation by reference, has exactly the opposite effect. All the \nline items that were added or subtracted would not be part of the bill \nif the DeMint amendment were agreed to. They would remain in the \ncommittee report without incorporation by reference in the bill. It \ngoes exactly the opposite direction of making ``earmarks'' part of law.\n  The Warner amendment, on the other hand, would incorporate not just \nby reference but all of the language in the thousands of lines in the \nbill. The problem is that it would take so much time, according to the \nGovernment Printing Office, to do that, we probably could not get to \nconference and back to the Senate unless we had a lameduck session. We \ndon't know that we will.\n  We cannot jeopardize this bill, which means so much to the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, by a requirement that achieves no purpose \nbecause the lines are already incorporated by reference, that achieves \nonly the perception of a purpose, which apparently meets some political \nneeds of people who are out campaigning. That is not enough to \njeopardize the Defense bill.\n  This bill means everything to the men and women in the armed \nservices. It should mean everything to us because they mean everything \nto us. We cannot jeopardize this bill by any action which may make it \nimpossible for us to bring back a bill from conference.\n  I wish to end by again complimenting Senator Warner. He has been \nabsolutely wonderful in trying to work out a unanimous consent \nagreement. I treasure our 30 years together. I wish we could end this \nwith a cloture vote that would allow us to finish positively the great \neffort he has put in. I hope we can get 60 votes for cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 3001, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009.\n         Carl Levin, Patrick J. Leahy, Bernard Sanders, Robert P. \n           Casey, Jr., Claire McCaskill, Sheldon Whitehouse, \n           Benjamin L. Cardin, Robert Menendez, Bill Nelson, \n           Charles E. Schumer, Richard Durbin, Thomas R. Carper, \n           Patty Murray, Amy Klobuchar, Jon Tester, Jeff Bingaman, \n           Harry Reid.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. \n3001, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, \nshall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to and to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \neveryone. I tell all Senators that Senator Warner and Senator Levin are \ngoing to do everything they can to process this bill. We are going to \ncomplete this bill by tomorrow night, and we will get the bill to \nconference.\n  We can get a bill. Everyone who has something they want to do, talk \nto these two managers and they will do the best they can. This is an \nimportant bill, and the Senate realized that. I think this is really a \ngood day for the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business with the time to run postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, there is no doubt Wall Street and Main \nStreet are in a crisis. The floodgates from the subprime storm have \nripped open and the effects are clearly devastating--unemployment is up \nand markets are down.\n  While I may not be able to predict what is coming next, I would like \nto talk a little bit about how we got here. Americans may not have been \ntracking the exact moves and, I believe, the negligence on the part of \nthe Bush administration that has led us to this point, but we certainly \nunderstand the consequences.\n  For New Jersey, my home State, financial losses on Wall Street mean \njob losses at home. I am worried about the 1,700 employees of Lehman \nBrothers in Jersey City. I am worried about the 6,000 employees at \nMerrill Lynch in Hopewell. I am also worried about those families and \nothers who are going to have to face foreclosure or watch their home \nvalues plummet. And I am worried about millions of retirees and people \napproaching retirement who are going to realize that their life savings \nare under attack and diminishing as quicksand below their feet.\n  Everyone is demanding to know what got us here. Well, what got us \nhere to a large degree is that for the last 8 years we have had an \nadministration that has turned a blind eye to financial markets and \nderegulated at every turn, playing Russian roulette with our economy. \nTheir regulatory changes gave lenders the chance to invent new ways to \nmake bad loans and to pass off the risks on investors.\n  The Federal Reserve had a power given to it long ago by a Democratic \nCongress to fight predatory lending. For more than 7 years of the Bush \nadministration it failed to use it. If they\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\nhad acted, many predatory lenders wouldn't have been allowed to pedal \nbad loans, which investment banks bought and then went bust and spurred \nthis crisis.\n  There are so many parts to this pattern of deception and neglect. In \n1994, a Democratic Congress passed the Homeowner's Equity Protection \nAct. It was the first statute to fight predatory lending. That was in \n1994. That law mandates that the Federal Reserve must issue regulations \nto prohibit abusive and deceptive practices. But how long did it take \nthe Federal Reserve to do so? It took the Federal Reserve 14 years--\nfrom 1994--to implement these regulations.\n  Senator Sarbanes, the former chairman and sometimes ranking member of \nthe Banking Committee, and Senators Schumer and Dodd have repeatedly \nintroduced legislation to protect against predatory lending. Not once \nhas any Republican been a cosponsor in the Senate. Yet we have been \nhearing a lot about Senator McCain suggesting that all of a sudden he \nhas seen the light. But he wasn't here all those years.\n  Even after reaching a bipartisan agreement on the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act and its successor, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act \nof 2008 in June, Republican Senators delayed the final passage of the \nlegislation for weeks--for weeks. Between the two bills, Republicans \nhad six filibusters to prevent the passage of this legislation.\n  Notwithstanding what was happening throughout the country, as a \nmember of the Senate Banking Committee in March of 2007--well over a \nyear and a half ago--I raised the prospect of a tsunami--my word--of \nforeclosures. But the administration said: Oh, no, that is an \noverexaggeration. Unfortunately, I wish they had been right and I had \nbeen wrong. But the fact is, we haven't even seen the crest of that \ntsunami take place.\n  A few months later, as foreclosures mounted, they assured us that the \nproblems we were concerned about might bring broader consequences to \nthe economy. But oh, no, all those who came before our committee, all \nthe financial leaders of this administration--the Secretary of the \nTreasury, the head of the Federal Reserve, and the regulatory side of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission--oh, no, those problems would be \ncontained to only the housing market, even though they couldn't even \nsee the foreclosure crisis being the tsunami it has become.\n  In July I asked them about the prospect of a bailout of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, but they couldn't foresee that either or they were \nmisleading the committee. I see the distinguished chairman of the \nBanking Committee is here, and he will recall they were asked head on. \nThey asked for incredible authorities. Yet they could not foresee the \npossibility, even as the mortgage crisis continued to rear its ugly \nhead in dimensions that some of us predicted a year and a half ago. \nThose who are in charge of the regulatory process, appointed by the \nBush administration, ultimately could not see.\n  So even in the face of all that, we had the White House issue \nnumerous veto threats against the bill that was critical to try to get \nto the very root cause of what is happening in America today--the \nhousing foreclosure crisis--which has created this ripple effect in all \nour financial institutions. Yet they were issuing veto threats--veto \nthreats. How could you be so blind or how could you be so much in the \ninterests of one sector that you are unwilling to mitigate the risks on \nbehalf of the American people?\n\n  This is not new. Look at 2005. In 2005, the House of \nRepresentatives--I was a Member there at the time--passed a bipartisan \nGSE reform bill by a vote of 331 to 90. GSEs are those Government \nentities; that is, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We wanted to have a \nstrong reform bill. It was offered by Republicans. Mike Oxley, the \nchairman at that time, a Republican, working with Barney Frank, offered \nthe bill. It passed overwhelmingly. In the House of Representatives--I \nserved there for 13 years--I can tell you, when you get a vote of 331 \nto 90, that is about as bipartisan as you can get.\n  That bill was offered here by Senate Democrats exactly as it passed \nthe House. But it was blocked by the White House. Even Mike Oxley, the \nformer Republican chairman of the House committee, said recently:\n\n       We missed a golden opportunity that would have avoided a \n     lot of the problems we are facing now if we had not had such \n     a firm ideological position at the White House and the \n     Treasury and the Fed. What did we get from the White House? \n     We got a one-finger salute.\n\n  His words, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, \nwhich passed the bill in a big bipartisan vote. We couldn't get it \nthrough here in the Senate.\n  I find it incredibly difficult to see that one of our colleagues who \nis running for President, Senator McCain, now talks about all of these \nissues. He has a new ad out suggesting he is a reformer. But he was \npart of the same Bush views. He basically was in support of most \nlifting of regulations.\n  So as the tsunami approached--the one that we were told, when I \nraised it a year and a half ago, they couldn't see--the administration \nwas consistently on the back side of that tsunami, watching it sweep \ntoward us, watching while the American people got washed under.\n  We have had 8 years of our regulatory entities. Who are they? The \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the OCC--the \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency under the Treasury \nDepartment. Instead of being the cops on the beat to ensure we have a \nmarketplace that is balanced--yes, we believe in a free marketplace \nand, yes, we believe in free enterprise, but an unregulated \nmarketplace, as we found, is one that has excesses. The reason there \nare regulators is to make sure there is balance at the end of day. But \nwhen those who are supposed to be the cops on the beat--the \nregulators--hit the snooze button instead of going into action so we \ncan prevent or mitigate what we are now facing, we see the \nconsequences.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle call this scheme \n``the ownership society,'' which means today: You are on your own. A \nstrong belief in this scheme has led Senator McCain, in the face of \nthis crisis, to repeat the same old claim yesterday that the \nfundamentals of the economy are strong. Housing foreclosures are \ndefying gravity, and he continues to make statements that defy reality. \nGreat financial institutions collapse, and Senator McCain has generally \nsupported deregulation as the answer. That is like trying to say you \nwant to take cops off the street to deal with a riot.\n  I have a real concern as we now move forward. We are where we are as \na result of economic and regulatory policies of the Bush administration \nthat John McCain thinks are the sound underpinnings of a good economy \nand how we continue to move forward. It is unacceptable. That is not \nchange. That will not change the course of where we are headed in this \neconomy. That will not change the course of the consequences to \nmillions of Americans.\n  This is not just about wealthy investors. Look at the consequences. \nLook at what is happening. When Lehman Brothers has to close, not only \nare those 1,600 jobs in New Jersey at risk, but it affects all of those \nwho had mortgages, all of those who used a service, all of those who \nbought a product, all of those who went out to eat in restaurants, all \nof those who, in fact, employed someone else to give them a service \nwhile they were working. The ripple effect is very significant.\n  When people get their statements for their retirement accounts, \nwhether it be a 401(k) or a thrift savings or whatever, we are going to \nsee what that means to people in real life. Some are going to look and \nsay: I am going to have to keep working because I cannot continue this \nway.\n  I want to echo what one of my distinguished colleagues, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, said a few weeks ago in Colorado:\n\n       Enough. Enough of more of the same. Enough denial about our \n     challenges. It is time to develop solutions.\n\n  We look forward to having the Secretary of the Treasury before the \nBanking Committee this Thursday. There are very tough questions to be \nanswered, not only about what has happened but what we are doing as we \nmove forward.\n  It is enough of more of the same. Enough denial about our challenges. \nIt is time to develop solutions. I believe we have to act fast to \nprovide an economic stimulus package targeted to provide relief to \nthose most in need, in\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\nways that stimulate our economy and infrastructure.\n  Let's be clear, we have to recognize the potential for what we call \nmoral hazard. We can't have everyone on Wall Street think they can go \nto any excess whatsoever and the Government will bail them out. But at \nany given time in this process we have to look at what entity creates \nthe risk. We are in one of the most precarious moments in our financial \nhistory. What entity creates perhaps a systematic risk, something that \ncreates such a widespread risk that we have to look at that as an \nindividual case and determine whether there is a different governmental \naction to be recognized.\n  In general, as we move forward, I certainly hope the legislation \nSenator Dodd and Senator Shelby worked on together, that went through \nsix filibusters and a bunch of veto threats by the President and \nfinally got through into law, is now actively pursued starting on \nOctober 1, which is when it goes into effect. We cannot have any of the \nBush administration agencies and regulatory entities involved not be \nready to go on October 1 to start providing relief on those hundreds of \nthousands of foreclosures--not only for those families but at the same \ntime to try to make those performing loans so we can prop up all of \nthese functioning institutions at the same time so all of us as \nAmericans get some relief from an economy that is definitely headed in \nthe wrong direction.\n  In general, as we move forward we have to establish which failures \nare isolated and which present a systemic risk to the entire financial \nsystem.\n\n  Second, it is fundamental to the health of our economy that we help \nhomeowners stay in their homes. The housing market is not just a center \nof the crisis, it is also a pillar of our society. Taking steps to \nshore it up makes sense on so many levels. Especially as this school \nyear gets underway, we can't sit back and watch children get thrown out \nnot only from their homes but pulled from their schools.\n  Third, we absolutely must hold administration officials and \nregulators accountable. I myself promise to do my part when they come \nbefore the Banking Committee this week and next. They better be \nprepared for some tough questions and some straight answers. I am tired \nof hearing that you could not foretell what some of us were telling you \nand others about the tsunami of foreclosures. We could have stemmed the \ntide. We could have acted in a regulatory process to make sure that was \nminimized.\n  When you are asked what is the possibility of a bailout of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, I am tired of being told you can't foresee that \nhappening, and just a month and a half later you have a very \nsignificant bailout--and you can't tell us how much the taxpayers will \nbe on the hook for it.\n  I am tired of being told by some of our colleagues, such as Senator \nMcCain, that this economy has all the right underpinnings and all the \nright regulatory processes. That is a fantasy world. It is a world that \nultimately Americans cannot afford. They cannot afford that type of \nthinking in terms of where we go over the next 4 years.\n  I look forward to those opportunities, moving forward this week and \nthe next, to try to turn the course of where we are for all Americans \nand for our Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I commend our colleague from New Jersey, a wonderful member of the \nSenate Banking Committee who has been invaluable over the last 18 \nmonths as we confronted a morass of problems that, as he very properly \nand accurately points out, began building up years ago.\n  This did not all of a sudden happen 18 months ago. As I said so many \ntimes, this was not a natural disaster. This was avoidable. That is the \ngreat tragedy of all of this. Had we had regulators on the beat--as he \ndescribes it, cops on the beat--had the legislation that passed \noverwhelmingly in this Congress actually been enforced with regulations \npromulgated dealing with deceptive and fraudulent practices in the \nresidential mortgage market as many as 4 years ago--without a single \nregulation, under the leadership of this administration, being \npromulgated--we could have avoided the ``no doc'' loans, the liar \nloans, the subprime predatory lending, luring innocent people into \ndreadful situations that these brokers and lenders knew they could \nnever afford to pay and then packaging them and branding them triple-A \nmortgages and selling them off as quickly as they wrote them to get \npaid off themselves and then pass on the responsibility to someone \nelse. All of that history is replete as to how this situation unfolded. \nNow, of course, they want to avoid the blame for the consequences--this \ncrowd does--for what happened.\n  The Senator from New Jersey laid it out very well. The public needs \nto know that. They also need to know what we should be doing together \nto get it right. We have a lot of work in front of us to get it right, \nbut in order to get it right, we also have to acknowledge what went \nwrong, and there is a long history of what went wrong here.\n  I welcome the remarks of my colleague and thank him for his \nleadership and look forward to working with him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, now that cloture has been invoked on our \nbill, we are going to be working very hard with Senators who have \ngermane amendments that have not been cleared to see if we can make \nprogress on such amendments. We not only request that Senators who have \nsuch amendments come promptly to the floor to meet with us or our \nstaffs, but we also have to recognize that any such amendment, if it is \nnot in a cleared package, would require consent, given the \nparliamentary situation. We have a cleared package already, which I \nthink is upwards, perhaps, of 90 amendments or so, which we would hope \nto add to before we offer it to the Senate by unanimous consent.\n  After Senator Warner has an opportunity to speak, I think we will put \nin a quorum call and do some other work we need to do in order to get \nto the next stage in this bill. Hopefully, we can now move promptly on \nthis bill now that cloture is invoked. I thank the Senator from \nVirginia for all he did to make that possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman said, we \nhave some 90 amendments now cleared. Now that the issue of going \nforward is also at this time clear, there should be an impetus to move \nforward such that the package of 90-some can grow, hopefully by 30 or \n40, before close of business tonight and possibly we can consider \nmoving that as quickly as we can. We are ready to assist all Senators \nwith regard to their amendments filed and, indeed, otherwise. We are \nhere to try to ascertain our ability to put them in a package that is \ncleared; if not, despite the parliamentary situation, to help them \nsecure a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we will, of course, do our very best, \nworking with Senators, to add to this package. There are some \npossibilities there. Again, I wish to alert Senators to the fact that \nwe are in a postcloture situation, which means they must be germane \nunless there is unanimous consent to the contrary. Also, the \nparliamentary situation is such that it would require consent. But as \nthe Senator from Virginia wisely points out, we are going to do our \nvery best to not be limited to technicalities if we can get consent of \nthe body to obviate those technicalities.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I come to the floor, as many of my \ncolleagues have on this side of the aisle, to express my outrage and my \namazement at the continued comments of one of our colleagues, who is \nnot here but is running for President, Senator John McCain, when even \nas Wall Street now is crumbling--we have seen the actions of the last \ncouple days--he continues to say the fundamentals of the economy are \nstrong. No matter what caveats he puts on it, he says the fundamentals \nof the economy are strong. That shows how out of touch he is, as is the \nPresident whom he works with, George Bush, and those who support this \nview that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.\n  I remember a while back coming to the floor after comments were made, \nas well, about at that time the chief economic adviser for Senator \nMcCain. Even though this person has now stepped down--also a former \ncolleague--from that position, we know he is still very close to \nSenator McCain and is involved in his efforts and so on. That is \nSenator Phil Gramm, whom I served with on the Banking Committee. He was \nthe chairman of the committee when I was first taking my place in the \nSenate. To hear Senator Phil Gramm, who worked so closely with Senator \nMcCain--we assume, based on their long relationship and the positive \nthings Senator McCain has said, that he would play a major role in a \nnew administration under John McCain, and he has said as well, in \naddition to Senator McCain repeating that the fundamentals of the \neconomy are strong, we also remember former Senator Phil Gramm's \ncomment that this is just a psychological recession; it is all in our \nminds. He said it is psychological and Americans have become a nation \nof whiners--a nation of whiners.\n  I am wondering if people made it up or if they were hallucinating \nwhen they lost their jobs this year; 605,000 Americans have lost good-\npaying jobs this year, since this past January. Were they \nhallucinating? Was this a figment of their imagination? Is it a figment \nof their imagination that they cannot make their mortgage payment or \nput food on the table or pay their electric bill or go to the gas pump \nand be able to refuel with outrageously high gas prices? Of course \nnot. Of course not.\n\n  We have seen the economy unfolding in a way so that only those who \nare very wealthy, who have the ability to take their capital anywhere \nin the world, can succeed under this philosophy that has been in place, \nthis Republican philosophy of no accountability, no transparency, no \none watching in the public interest as people have made decisions that \nhave undermined pensions of working people. Heaven forbid, can you \nimagine if Lehman Brothers had been managing Social Security payments \nfor millions of senior citizens, which is, by the way, something else \nSenator McCain wishes to see happen, privatizing Social Security.\n  What we have seen is an undermining of the fundamentals of what has \nbeen the strength of our economy--good jobs, not just supply, but \nsupply and demand, putting money in people's pockets so they can afford \nto take care of their families and keep the economy going.\n  In addition to 605,000 people who have lost their jobs since the \nbeginning of this year, we had 3.5 million manufacturing jobs lost, and \ncounting, since 2001, since President Bush came into office. Madam \nPresident, 3.5 million people were not hallucinating. It was not a \nfigment of their imagination that they lost their job and that their \nfamilies have been put into a tailspin as they are now trying to figure \nout where they go from here to try to keep some semblance of the \nAmerican dream.\n  The fundamentals of the economy are strong, says Senator John McCain. \nWe are, in fact, looking at an example of what it means to live under a \nphilosophy of President Bush, John McCain, and the Republicans, and \nwhat actually happens if their philosophy comes into being, in terms of \nactions.\n  For the first time, in the time I can remember, we saw from 2001 \nuntil 18 months ago a time when the House, the Senate, and the \nPresidency were all in the hands of the same party. We had a chance to \nsee what they believe in, what are their values, what are their \nphilosophies.\n  What we have seen is a philosophy that has raised greed to a national \nvirtue, that has viewed public regulation and accountability in the \npublic interest, to protect public resources or public funds, as \nsomething to be scoffed at and to be unwound, to deregulate, to make \nsure that the areas of Government that have responsibility, that are \naccountable for our financial systems, our monetary systems, our energy \nresources and other areas, in fact, are not held accountable.\n  We have seen an administration and a Republican philosophy that \ndoesn't work for the majority of Americans. It works for a few. If you \nare one of the folks who is out there trying to make sure you can make \nas much money as possible for yourself and your friends, you may have \ndone pretty well. But there has been no willingness to understand the \nconsequences for the majority of Americans or to accept any \nresponsibility to make sure that the majority of Americans can benefit \nfrom the resources and opportunities and wealth of this great country.\n  This culture of greed and corruption, supported by Senator McCain and \nPresident Bush and others for 6 years running, has led to Enron. I \nremember having people sitting in my office who had everything in their \ncompany's pension. They worked for Enron. They lost it all. They lost \nit all because of the schemes and the lack of accountability and \noversight. They lost everything in their pension plans and they sat in \nmy office and said: Thank goodness for Social Security because that is \nall I have left.\n  The same folks who gave us the Enron debacle want to privatize Social \nSecurity, including John McCain. No-bid contracts, such as Halliburton \nin Iraq; continual tax cuts only for the wealthiest Americans; weak \noversight of public industries, regulated industries, regulated in the \npublic interest; a disregard for the Constitution; and now the latest \neconomic crisis we see.\n  Fundamentally, the question is: Who are we as a country and do we \nwant to continue these failed philosophies? That is not by accident. I \nsuggest this is the result of a world view, a set of values and \nphilosophies that does not put the majority of Americans and our \ncountry first, but basically puts in place the idea that greed is good \nand you should make it while you can, and we are going to make sure we \nstrip away any public protections so your ability is unfettered to do \nwhat you want to do for yourself as opposed to what needs to be done on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  If we don't have a change in this country, we are going to see the \nsame failed blueprint with more of the same failed results, disastrous \nresults. That is why I believe so strongly we need a change in \ndirection and a change of values to put the American people first.\n  Again, our colleague, Senator McCain, who has said that the \nfundamentals of the economy are strong, has worked to deregulate \nmarkets, has called himself a deregulator. Unfortunately, it is those \npolicies that have gotten us to where we are today.\n  This is the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. \nAnd what is the plan at this point? To study the problem. Senator \nMcCain has said today we should study the problem.\n  We don't need another commission. What we need are people who will \nmake sure that the accountability, the oversight, the power that is \nhere to stop price gouging, to bring oversight to what is going on is \nactually used. It hasn't been used under this administration. For 6 of \nthe last 7\\1/2\\ years there was every effort, in fact, to pull back on \nwho was put on boards and commissions, the regulators, the overseers. \nThey essentially were made up of people who didn't believe in the \nmission, who didn't believe they were there for the public interest.\n  Right now we have a situation where there are 84,000 Americans who \nlost their jobs last month, 90,000 Americans who lost their homes last \nmonth. They don't want another study. They don't want another \ncommission. They want leaders who get it. They want leaders who \nunderstand their role in this Government of ours, this public trust we \nhave, not on behalf of just ourselves and our friends but on behalf of \neverybody in this country, to make sure the rules are fair, that they \nare followed,\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\nand that everybody has a chance to make it. That is what it is supposed \nto be about.\n  I am also reminded that Senator McCain has chaired the Commerce \nCommittee and oversaw a massive deregulation scheme that gutted our \noversight of these markets. Where is the accountability? Instead of \nprotecting consumers and preventing abuse, the special interests ruled. \nAnd Chairman McCain oversaw that effort.\n  The same economic philosophy of the Bush administration joined by \nSenator McCain for the last 8 years has been to give more and more to \nthose who have the most, ignore the ability of others to make sure they \ncan have what they have earned--their job, their pension, that Social \nSecurity is strong, they can afford to put food on the table and pay \nfor the gas and be able to have what we all expect as Americans that \nwill be available to us if we work hard and follow the rules.\n\n  We have had the same philosophy in place, the same philosophy that \nhas brought us 8 straight months of job loss, the same economic \nphilosophy that has left incomes stagnant while families find \nthemselves spending twice as much on the basics of their life.\n  Real household income is down. Imagine, we were lower in 2007 than in \nthe year 2000. Incomes were lower in 2007 than they were in 2000. We \nare in a generation of having real concerns, and rightly so, that our \nchildren's lives and economic circumstances will not be as good as our \nown.\n  The same philosophy has led to gasoline inching upwards to $5 a \ngallon, and the same economic philosophy that leaves 47 million people \nwithout health insurance, leaving them worried about whether their \nchildren will be cared for when they are sick. The same philosophy has \nbeen in place since 2001 with this President with 6 years of no balance \nand accountability, just one world view, 18 months of our coming in now \nand slowing the trend down, working hard to bring in some \naccountability, even though there are unprecedented Republican \nfilibusters to stop us.\n  But we have seen a philosophy that has failed. We need to be taking \nactions to stop the fraudulent, risky, and abusive lending practices, \nand that has been proposed over and over again. I commend Chairman Dodd \nof the Banking Committee and Chairman Baucus of the Finance Committee \nand all those who have brought forward proposals that will make a \ndifference.\n  We need to modernize the rules for a 21st century marketplace that \nwill protect American investors and consumers. We have been proposing \nthose changes. We also know we have in place a series of mechanisms \nthat would hold special interests accountable and be able to make sure \nthat people's incomes and pensions and the economy in general are \nprotected. We just haven't used it.\n  I stand with another colleague of ours, Senator Barack Obama, who has \nsaid if you borrow from the Government, you should be regulated. There \nshould be public accountability, transparency, if you are borrowing \nfrom the Government. If we want to stop abuses of the public trust, we \nneed to have openness, we need to know what is going on in the markets, \nwe need to know what is going on. If we want to protect the American \npeople, we need to regulate dangerous practices, such as predatory \nlending.\n  We know there is so much that we need to do right now. First is to \naddress the hole we are in economically, and the next is to stop \ndigging, stop making it worse. Stop tax breaks for those who have \nalready done so well, even in these terrible circumstances. We need to \nmake sure we are focusing on those who have worked so hard all their \nlives, and their families who are looking for the opportunity to be \nsuccessful in America. They want to know they are going to have a fair \nchance to do that, that the rules are going to be fair, they are not \ngoing to be stacked against them and in the interest of a special few, \nwhich is what has been happening since 2001 over and over.\n  Let me go back to my original comment and look at the 3.5 million \nmanufacturing jobs lost since 2001. Our colleague, John McCain, says \nthe fundamentals of the economy are strong. I beg to differ. The \nfundamentals of the economy for Americans working hard every day making \na paycheck, trying to make ends meet, worrying about whether they are \ngoing to have a job, health care, send the kids to college, put food on \nthe table, pay for the gas and all the other things, for them the \neconomy is not strong.\n  People are working too hard, making too little, and paying too much \nevery day, and we do not need another study or another commission. We \nneed leaders who get it, who have the right values, who understand, who \nhave the intestinal fortitude to stand up and fight for the American \npeople, the middle-class families who are sick and tired of what has \nbeen going on.\n  I can tell you, coming from the great State of Michigan, the people \nof Michigan have had enough. We have had enough. We can't take more of \nthis. We can't take 4 more years of this. We can't take 4 more days of \nthis. We have had enough. But to change it, I believe strongly that we \nneed to understand this is not just an accident that we are where we \nare. It is a conscious philosophy. It is actions and inactions that \nhave been taken by those in charge--by this President, supported by \nSenator John McCain, supported by Republicans in the House and the \nSenate--that have created the situation that has fostered the \ncircumstances in which we find ourselves.\n  We can't do this anymore. We need to make sure government works for \nreal people, real people who have had enough. I can't say it more \nstrongly: We have to stop traveling down the road we are on, following \nthis philosophy that has run us into extremely dangerous economic \nterritory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, are we on the Defense bill or in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Department of Defense bill under \ncloture.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank Chairman \nLevin and Senator Warner for their willingness to work with me on the \namendment that has been accepted into the managers' package. This \namendment provides some additional comfort to family members whose \nloved one is killed while serving in the military by allowing the \nDefense Department to pay for travel to a memorial service honoring a \nservicemember killed on Active Duty.\n  Currently, the law allows for the services to provide transportation \nof family members to a burial service of a servicemember killed on \nActive Duty. Although the law makes this voluntary, the services, much \nto their credit, all make this travel available to the families. \nHowever, current law does not allow travel to memorial services. With \nmany families split up over long distances, this can be particularly \npainful when a parent or sibling of one of our fallen heroes cannot \nafford to travel to a memorial service held by a unit or even other \nmembers of the family. Although some charity groups have been able to \nhelp these families attend memorial services for their fallen loved \nones, when servicemembers die in service to their country, it is this \ncountry's moral obligation to help their families in every possible \nway.\n  This amendment would allow the Secretary of each service to allow \nfamily members of fallen heroes to attend one memorial service as a way \nof helping to honor those who give the ultimate sacrifice--their \nlives--to our Nation. It would be voluntary. The services do not have \nto participate, but at least they would have the option, which is \nsomething they currently do not have.\n  Earlier this year, a constituent of mine suffered the loss of his \nson. He died in a hospital in Canada after being injured in Iraq. He \nwas on a transport flight from Germany to Walter Reed when his \ncondition worsened and the plane diverted to Halifax. When my \nconstituent's ex-wife sought to have a memorial service for their son \nin Phoenix prior to the burial at Arlington National Cemetery, the Army \nhad to tell the man, whose son had given his life for our country, that \nthe country could\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nnot help him attend that memorial service.\n  I think we can do better. I think we should do better. This amendment \nwill allow us to do better.\n  When a soldier or marine or airman goes to war, the whole family goes \nto war. When a servicemember gives the ultimate sacrifice and is killed \nin service to our Nation, we need to do the right thing for the family. \nThat is why I have offered this amendment. Again, I thank Chairman \nLevin and Senator Warner for working together to help get this \namendment into the managers' package.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to be able to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this week we have learned that Lehman \nBrothers, one of the oldest financial institutions in our country, an \ninvestment bank that has survived two world wars and a Great \nDepression, has proven that even it could not survive 8 long years of \nderegulation and lax oversight by the administration of George W. Bush. \nIt is going bankrupt.\n  Yesterday we also learned that the beleaguered Merrill Lynch, the \nlargest brokerage firm in this country, will be bought out by Bank of \nAmerica, the largest financial depository institution in this country. \nNow we are also learning that AIG, the largest insurance company in the \nUnited States, and Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan \nassociation in this country, are also in deep financial trouble. The \nlist of troubled banks that the FDIC maintains is growing larger and \nlarger.\n  In addition, last week, to avert a complete mortgage meltdown, we saw \nthe Bush administration bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, putting \ntens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars at \nrisk. Earlier this year, we saw the Federal Reserve orchestrate the \ntakeover of Bear Stearns, a deal backed by $30 billion in taxpayer \ndollars.\n  At the same time, Americans are still paying outrageously high prices \nat the gas pump. Prices are still over $3.50 a gallon, even though the \nprice of oil is now down to almost $90 a barrel. Every little hiccup to \nsend gas prices up or down with virtually no connection to real supply \nand demand indicators.\n  Up to this point, the Republicans in the Senate have prevented us \nfrom taking any real action to rein in those volatile energy markets, \nso oil could be down this week, but any kind of rumor or instability, \nwhether man made or natural, could send those same prices soaring \nagain.\n  I think it is important the American people understand why we got to \nwhere we are today; why we are in a situation where millions of workers \nare fearful about being able to heat their homes in the wintertime \nwhile workers all over this country are finding it very difficult to \nfill their gas tanks. Is what occurred simply bad luck? Are we at the \nbottom of the so-called business cycle? How do these happenings occur \nto what was once the strongest economy in the world with the greatest \nmiddle class?\n  If we take a deep look at what is going on in terms of the financial \ncrisis we are suffering through today and the volatile energy prices we \nare suffering through today, we can understand that both are the result \nof deliberate policy decisions made by the Congress and the \nadministrative negligence on the part of the Bush administration. These \ndeliberate policies were the result, to a significant degree, of the \npower and influence of corporate lobbyists--who also make huge campaign \ncontributions--representing some of the most powerful special interests \nin the world, whether it is big oil, big coal or whether it is the \nlargest financial institutions in the world.\n  What these lobbyists fought for and secured was selling deregulation \nsnake oil, deregulation snake oil backed with millions in campaign \ncontributions. That is what I think is the overlying issue as we look \nat the financial crisis facing Wall Street and the soaring and volatile \nprices in terms of oil.\n  All too often when bad things happen because of failures here in \nWashington, both parties generically blame it on the other and no one \nstands up and tries to point out what, where, why and, most \nimportantly, who is behind these bad policies. As an Independent, I \nthink that breeds a cynicism and an anger and a frustration on the part \nof the American people about the political system of our country.\n  Well, in this case, I think the American people deserve a little more \nof an explanation. It has been their hard-earned dollars that have been \nneedlessly spent on $4 a gallon gasoline. It is their retirement \nsavings and, my God, I wonder all over this country the kind of \nfrustration that exists today with the volatility in the stock market \ngoing down 500 points yesterday and what people are worried about, \nwhether their 401(k)s are going to be worth very much in the future. \nThese are very frustrating times for the American people.\n  In the case of both of these current crises, the financial services \nand energy crisis, one of the major actors and perhaps the main actor \nin creating what we have seen today is a former Senator from Texas \nnamed Phil Gramm. In terms of our financial crisis, one of the reasons \nwe are in the mess we are in today is because of the enactment of the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999. As you may recall, this legislation was \nresponsible for deregulating the financial services industry by \ncompletely repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.\n  Now, I was a Member in the House of Representatives at the time. I \nwas a member of the House Banking Committee when this legislation was \nbeing debated. I remember that debate very well because I was in the \nmiddle of it. Let me tell you, I do not mean to be patting myself on \nthe back, but I think it is important to take a little bit of a look at \nrecent history.\n  This is 1999 during the debate. This is what I said as a member of \nthe House Banking Committee:\n\n       I believe this legislation will do more harm than good. It \n     will lead to fewer banks and financial service providers, \n     increased charges and fees for individuals, consumers and \n     small businesses, diminished credit for rural America, and \n     taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial \n     conglomerate fail. It will lead to more mega mergers and a \n     small number of corporations dominating the financial service \n     industry and a further concentration of economic power in our \n     country.\n\n  Unfortunately, that is exactly what is happening today, and I would \nmuch prefer to have been wrong than right. But on the other hand, \nformer Senator Phil Gramm--who I should mention to you has been Senator \nMcCain's top economic adviser--at that time had a very different \nopinion of the legislation which bears his name. Senator Gramm at that \ntime said something very interesting about that piece of legislation. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       Ultimately the final judge of the bill is history. \n     Ultimately, as you look at the bill, you have to ask \n     yourself, will people in the future be trying to repeal it? I \n     think the answer will be no.\n\n  Well, put me down as a Senator who believes we need to repeal Gramm-\nLeach-Bliley. Put me down as a Senator who believes we need to restore \nstrong Government oversight of the banking industry. Put me down as \nsomeone who believes we need to have firewalls in the financial \nservices sector so that we do not have the domino effect we are seeing \nright now.\n  There was a reason Congress enacted reforms of the banking industry \nin the 1930s, and that was because we did not want to repeat the \nmistakes that caused the Great Depression. Failing to have learned from \nour mistakes, it looks as if we are doomed to repeat them.\n  The lesson here is that left to their own devices, company executives \nwill make poor decisions and put their investors' capital at risk. The \nimportant lesson here is that poorly regulated financial markets \ninvariably endanger the health of the entire economy and, of course, as \nthis world becomes more and more interlocked, in fact, the economy of \nthe entire world.\n  In that context, the extreme economic ideology of people such as\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\nformer Senator Gramm, and for that matter Senator McCain, says that the \npeople of this country should simply stand back and allow executives in \nWall Street boardrooms to make decisions with no public oversight that \nhave the potential of wrecking our economy. In other words, deregulate \nthem, let them do whatever they want in order to improve their bottom \nline, and the Government does not have to watch to see what the \nimplications of their decisions are for our country or for our \ntaxpayers.\n  I disagree with Senator Gramm's perspective. People who want to \ngamble their own money are certainly welcome to do that. But when your \nactions have the ability to dry up credit for businesses all over our \ncountry, when your actions can dry up mortgages for people who \ndesperately want to buy a home or stay in their home, when your actions \ndepress the value of Americans' savings, we need public oversight, and \nit should be strong oversight with the primary mission being to protect \nthe American public from the reckless greed that has brought us to \nwhere we are today.\n  In former Senator Gramm's world view, when it comes to protecting the \nAmerican consumer and the safety and soundness of our financial \ninstitutions, Government is not the answer, Government is the enemy, \nGovernment is terrible. But when banks fail, all of a sudden, guess \nwhat happens. The Government has no choice but to intervene to prevent \nthe entire economy from collapsing. The Gramm-McCain version is one \nwhere profits are private, going to the very wealthiest people in this \ncountry, but risk is public, being assumed, by and large, by the \nmiddle-class and working people of this country. It is socialism for \nthe very rich, and free enterprise for everyone else.\n  Unfortunately, former Senator Gramm was not satisfied by having set \nup the dominos in 1999 that made our current financial crisis possible. \nIn 2000, he decided his loot-and-burn economics had to be applied to \nthe energy markets as well now. This is an achievement. First you go \nafter deregulating the financial markets, and then you move to energy. \nAnd out of his efforts in energy, of course, the so-called Enron \nloophole was born. Senator Gramm, who was then Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, was one, if not the main proponent of the provision \nderegulating the electronic energy market that we now know as the Enron \nloophole.\n  Was this done through a deliberative process with debate and \nhearings? Actually, no, it was not. This very important provision was \nslipped into a massive unrelated bill with no discussion and no \nhearings, and the American people today are paying the price for that.\n  The Federal agency that oversees those energy markets was the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC. Conveniently, the head \nof that agency at the time was a Wendy Gramm. Yes, you guessed it, it \nwas his wife. And Wendy Gramm had become head of the CFTC after being \non the board of directors of, well, you guessed it, the Enron \nCorporation. Even Hollywood could not come up with a plot quite so \ntransparent.\n  The result of this deregulation of the energy markets has, according \nto many experts who have testified before Congress, allowed speculators \non unregulated markets to artificially drive the cost of a barrel of \noil up to over $147 a barrel.\n  My colleagues, including Senator Dorgan and Senator Cantwell and many \nothers, have laid out the way that speculators have driven up oil \nprises in many well-researched presentations here on the floor and a \nnumber of Senate committees. I applaud them for their leadership. But \nall of this speculation and all of the millions and billions of dollars \nthat Americans have spent on exorbitantly priced gasoline would not \nhave happened if it had not been for the efforts of Senator Gramm \npushing through the so-called Enron loophole.\n  As central as Senator Gramm was in creating the financing and energy \ndisasters we are currently facing, he was aided and abetted by the Bush \nadministration's willingness to simply look the other way. Even with \nall of the harm that has been done to the economy, President Bush still \nrefuses to acknowledge it. One wonders what world he is living in.\n  And, shockingly, Senator McCain is singing from the same song sheet. \nOn September 15, Senator McCain said:\n\n       The fundamentals of our economy are strong.\n\n  Does that sound familiar? Well, it should. Since 2001, President Bush \nand members of his administration have repeatedly described the economy \nas strong and getting stronger: Thriving, robust, solid, booming, \nhealthy, powerful, fantastic, exciting, amazing, the envy of the world.\n  Those are the adjectives used by the President and members of his \nadministration over the last 8 years. What economy are they looking at? \nThe fact is, when it comes to the economy, Senator McCain and President \nBush do not get it. Is it a surprise to anyone that Senator Gramm, who, \nuntil fairly recently, was Senator McCain's major economic adviser on \nhis campaign, described Americans as ``a nation of whiners'' who are \nsuffering through a ``mental recession''?\n  Was it a surprise? What is surprising is that Senator McCain is \ntrying to pass himself off as a maverick when he looks to the same \npeople, people such as Senator Gramm, who laid the groundwork for our \ncurrent economic problems.\n  While Senator McCain and President Bush think the fundamentals of our \neconomy are strong, while they talk about how robust things are, the \nreality is the middle class in this country is collapsing. And if we do \nnot make the kind of bold changes we need to make, for the first time \nin the modern history of America our children will have a lower \nstandard of living than we do.\n  We are looking at the American dream as an American nightmare. We are \nmoving in the wrong direction economically as well as in so many other \nareas.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, nearly 6 million Americans \nhave slipped out of the middle class and into poverty. How do you think \nthe fundamentals are strong when 6 million more Americans enter the \nranks of the poor? Since Bush has been in office, over 7 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance. Now well over 46 million \nAmericans are without any health insurance at all, and even more are \nunderinsured. Does that sound like the fundamentals of the economy are \nstrong?\n  Since President Bush has been in office, over 3 million manufacturing \njobs have been lost, total consumer debt has more than doubled, median \nincome for working-age Americans has gone down over $2,000 after \nadjusting for inflation. They do not get or do not care that prices on \nalmost everything we consume are going up and up and up.\n  Today the typical American family is paying over $1,700 more on their \nmortgages, $2,100 more for gasoline, $1,500 more for childcare, $1,000 \nmore for a college education, $350 more on their health insurance, and \n$200 a year more for food than before President Bush was in office.\n  In addition, home foreclosures are the highest on record, turning the \nAmerican dream of home ownership into the American nightmare. The \nunemployment rate has skyrocketed. Since January of this year, we have \nlost over 600,000 jobs. Adding insult to injury, the national debt has \nincreased by over $3 trillion, and we are spending $10 billion a month \non the war in Iraq, making it harder and harder to do anything to help \nthe struggling middle class.\n  Is it any wonder that Rick Davis, Senator McCain's campaign manager, \nrecently said: ``This election is not about issues''? If my economic \npolicies were to follow President Bush's and the economy was in a state \nof near recession and unemployment was up and median family income went \ndown and more people were losing health insurance and more and more \npeople were in debt, the foreclosure rate at the highest rate in \nAmerican history, if all those things were happening, I would certainly \nalso run on a campaign not having anything to do with issues \nwhatsoever. That is what I would do. I would run away from all of those \nissues. That is certainly John McCain's strategy. Who can blame him?\n  John McCain claims to be offering change. But on issue after issue, \nhe is offering more of the same--more tax breaks for the very rich, \nmore unfettered free-trade agreements that will\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\ncost our country millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs, more tax \nbreaks to big oil companies ripping off the American consumer at the \ngas pump; in other words, more of George Bush's failed policies that \nhave led to a collapse of the middle class, an increase in poverty, and \na wider gap between the very rich and everyone else.\n  John McCain and George Bush may be right in one respect: If they are \ntalking about the wealthiest people and the most profitable \ncorporations, the economy is fundamentally strong. Things could not be \nbetter for those people, that small segment of our society. In fact, \none can make the case--and economists have--that the wealthiest people \nhave not had it so good since the robber baron days of the 1920s.\n  Right now--this is really quite an astounding fact--the top one-tenth \nof 1 percent of income earners earn more income than the bottom 50 \npercent. That gap between the people on top, who are busy trying to \nbuild recordbreaking yachts and all kinds of homes, busy buying jewelry \nthat is unbelievably expensive--one-tenth of 1 percent earn more income \nthan the bottom 50 percent--that gap is growing wider. Also the top 1 \npercent own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. We as a nation have \nthe dubious distinction of having the most unfair distribution of \nwealth and income of any major country on Earth.\n  The wealthiest 400 people have not only seen their incomes double, \ntheir net worth has increased by $640 billion since President Bush has \nbeen in office. Can we believe that? The wealthiest 400 Americans have \nseen their net worth increase by $640 billion since George Bush has \nbeen in office. Today, the richest 400 Americans are now worth over \n$1.5 trillion. At the same time, we have the highest rate of childhood \npoverty; 20 percent of our children live in poverty. We have working \nfamilies lining up at food banks because they don't earn enough to pay \nfor food.\n  Apparently, all of that is not good enough for Senator McCain and for \nPresident Bush. They insist that those tax breaks be made permanent. In \nGeorge Bush's and John McCain's world, those are the Americans who are \nstruggling. The wealthiest 400 Americans just can't make it on $214 \nmillion a year. It must be pretty hard to scrape through and get the \nfood and shelter a family needs, so obviously those are the guys who \nneed a tax break.\n  We have had almost 8 years of President Bush's economic policies. \nThey follow, of course, 8 years of the policies of President Clinton. I \nthink it is important to say a word to compare what happened during \nthose two administrations.\n  I happened, as a Member of the House, to have disagreed with \nPresident Clinton on a number of issues. But I think when we look at \nhis overall economic record and contrast it to the overall economic \nrecord of President Bush and the policies Senator McCain would like to \nfollow, the record speaks for itself.\n  Take a look at job creation, how many new jobs have been created. \nUnder President Clinton, almost 23 million new jobs were created. That \nis a pretty good record. Did every one of those jobs pay the kind of \nwages we would like? No. But nonetheless, almost 23 million new jobs \nwere created in Clinton's 8-year term. Under President Bush, less than \n6 million jobs have been created.\n  Under President Clinton, more than 6 million Americans were lifted \nout of poverty and into the middle class. Under President Bush, the \nexact opposite has occurred. Nearly 6 million people who were in the \nmiddle class have been forced into poverty. Under President Clinton, \nmedian family income went up by nearly $6,000. That is a lot of money. \nUnder President Bush, median family income is going down.\n  The Republican Party for years has told us they are the party of \nfiscal responsibility above all. Yet, under President Bush, the \nnational debt has increased by more than $3 trillion. Under President \nClinton, we had Federal surpluses as far as the eye could see. Under \nPresident Bush, we have had Federal deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  There is a clear choice to be made this year. That choice is, does \nGovernment work for all of the people, for the middle class, for \nworking families, for people who are struggling, or do we continue to \ndevelop policies which represent the people on the top who, in fact, \nhave never had it so good since the 1920s?\n  The future of our country is at stake. I personally believe we cannot \nafford 4 more years of President Bush's policies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SALAZAR). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the wreckage all of us observed yesterday \nand the consequences of a 504 point drop in the stock market and the \nconcern in this country about its economic future can be traced to a \nlot of things. I wish to talk about some of them for a few minutes. I \nwant to show a couple charts that describe some of the origin of what \nhas weakened this economy, and then I will talk about how this all \nhappened.\n  Almost everyone in this country in recent years has seen ads like \nthis from Countrywide, the biggest mortgage banker in the country. \nCountrywide had an advertisement that said: Do you have less than \nperfect credit? Do you have late mortgage payments? Have you been \ndenied by other lenders? Call us.\n  Countrywide Bank, the biggest bank of its type in America, saying, \nessentially: You have bad credit? You need money? Call us. Most people \nwould probably hear that, as I did over the years, and think: How can \nthey do that? How does that work. You advertise that if people have bad \ncredit, they ought to come to you.\n  Here is Millenia Mortgage. They said:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payment. That's right. We will \n     give you the money to make your first 12 payments if you call \n     in the next 7 days. We pay it for you. Our loan program may \n     reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 percent \n     and allow you no payments for the first 12 months. Call us \n     today.\n\n  Here is a mortgage company saying: Come on over here, get a mortgage \nfrom us. We will give you a home mortgage. You don't even have to make \nthe first 12 months' payment. We will make it for you. They don't, of \ncourse, say here that what they will do is stick that on the back of \nthe mortgage and add interest to it. But that is what they \nare advertising.\n\n  Here is Zoom Credit. All of these are television, radio ads. They \nsaid:\n\n       Credit approval is just seconds away. Get on the fast track \n     at Zoom Credit. At the speed of light, Zoom Credit will \n     preapprove you for a car loan, a home loan or a credit card. \n     Even if your credit's in the tank, Zoom Credit's like money \n     in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit repair and \n     debt consolidation too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit--\n     who cares?\n\n  That is what Zoom Credit was saying to customers. You got bad credit, \nyou have been bankrupt, who cares? Come and get a loan from us. They \nsay: We don't care if you have bad credit.\n  In fact, here is what they also say: Get a loan from us. We will give \nyou what is called a ``low doc'' loan or a ``no doc'' loan. If you have \nbad credit, we will give you a ``low doc,'' which means we will give \nyou a home mortgage and you don't even have to document your income for \nus. You don't have to prove your income to us. That is called no \ndocumentation. Bad credit, come and get a loan from us. No \ndocumentation, that is OK. It is unbelievable and unbelievably \nignorant.\n  I pulled this off the Internet. Perfect credit not required. No-\nincome-verification loans. Pretty interesting, isn't it? Come and get a \nmortgage from this company. You don't have to verify your income, and \nyou don't need perfect credit. Here is a company on the Internet that \nwants to give you a home loan. It says: You can get 5 years' fixed \npayments with a 1.25-percent interest rate. That is interesting, isn't \nit? Of course, it is a sham, the 1.25-percent interest rate you get to \npay. Again, bad credit? Come to us, we will give you a mortgage. You \ndon't want to document your income, that is OK. Bad credit and no \ndocumentation. And by the way, we will give you a 1.25-percent interest \nrate.\n  All of us, when we were kids, went to western movies from time to \ntime. In virtually every movie, they had the guy who came into town \nwith a couple old mules driving a slow wagon. He wore a silk shirt and \nstriped pants, and he was selling snake oil. It cured everything from \nhiccups to the gout. He was selling snake oil from the back of his\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\nwagon. This is not in an old western. These are companies on the \nInternet, on television, on radio.\n  I go back to Countrywide, the largest mortgage broker. Do you have \nless than perfect credit? Come to us. We want to invite you, get a \nmortgage from us. That is what happened.\n  Now the stock market collapses on Monday. What is the relationship? \nThe relationship is that our economy is reeling from the wreckage of \nthe subprime loan scandal. What does that mean, subprime loans? All of \nthis starts with some brokers out there who are selling mortgages. Then \nthey sell to it a mortgage bank, and then the mortgage bank securitizes \nit and sells it up to a hedge fund, and the hedge fund probably sells \nto it an investment bank. What they do is, they loan money to people \nwith bad credit and provide no documentation or they loan money to \npeople with good credit and give them teaser rates with resets and \nprepayment penalties that the people can't possibly pay 3 years later \nand set them up for failure and then sell these loans in a security. As \nthey used to pack sawdust in sausage, they pack bad loans with good \nloans. They slice them and dice them and sell them up the stream.\n  So now you have loans, a cold call to a person who had a home by a \nbroker saying: You are paying 6 percent interest rate on your home \nmortgage? We will give you one for 1.25 percent. We will dramatically \nreduce your home mortgage monthly payment. And by the way, we are not \ngoing to emphasize this--in fact, we may just mention it in a whisper--\nultimately, it is going to reset, and it will be 10 percent in 3 years. \nAnd by the way, you don't have to document your income. At any rate, \nyou can't pay with your income at a 10-percent rate in 3 years, but it \ndoesn't matter, you can sell that home and flip it between now and \nthen. Don't worry about it. That is the kind of thing that was going on \nwith an unbelievable amount of greed--with the brokers, with the \nmortgage companies, with the hedge funds, the investment banks, all \ngrunting and snorting and shoving in the hog trough here. They were \nmaking massive amounts of money, and the whole thing collapsed, just \ncollapsed.\n\n  Now, how does it happen that it helps cause a bankruptcy in France or \na bankruptcy in Italy or a 504-point drop of the stock market here in \nthe United States on Monday and so many other failures? Bear Stearns \ndoesn't exist anymore, Lehman Brothers is going bankrupt. I could go \nthrough them all. How is it that all of this is happening, all of this \ncarnage and wreckage as a result of this greed?\n  Let me go back just a bit. Two things, it seems to me. No. 1, there \nare a bunch of folks who were fast talkers who decided they were going \nto sell Congress on financial modernization. We have learned this \nlesson. This lesson existed in the 1930s. In the Roaring Twenties, it \nwas ``Katy, bar the door,'' anything goes, and the economy collapsed \ninto a Great Depression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with the New Deal, \nsaid: This isn't going to happen again. Banks were failing. Banks were \nclosing. Depositors couldn't get their money. Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nand the New Deal repaired that economy by saying: We are going to \nseparate commercial banking institutions from other risky enterprises. \nWe are not going to let banks get engaged in real estate and securities \nand insurance. We are not going to do that because this is the very \nperception of safety and soundness. Safety and soundness determines \nwhether a bank is safe and sound. If you injure that perception by \nfusing risky enterprises--real estate, for example, and securities \nunderwriting--with traditional banking issues, you do a great \ndisservice to this country's economy. So they were separated with the \nGlass-Steagall Act, for example.\n  In 1999, the Financial Modernization Act was passed. I was one of \neight Members of the U.S. Senate to vote against it because it repealed \nthe Glass-Steagall Act. Oh, they all promised firewalls. It didn't mean \na thing. I warned then, and I warn again now: These are the significant \nconsequences of forgetting the lessons of the 1930s which are going to \nhaunt us, and they are haunting us.\n  So what happens is they not only passed a Financial Modernization Act \nwhich repeals Glass-Steagall and the very things we put in place to \nprotect against this sort of thing--the mingling of risky enterprises \nwith banking--they not only do that, but George W. Bush wins the \nPresidency and he comes to town and he appoints regulators--i.e., \nHarvey Pitt to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, just as an \nexample. What is the first thing he says when he gets to town? He says: \nYou know something, you should understand that the Securities and \nExchange Commission is a business-friendly place now. Right. Well, that \nis what happened in virtually every area of regulation. People were \nappointed who didn't have the foggiest interest in regulating. The \nwhole mantra was to deregulate everything: Don't look, don't watch, \ndon't care. As a result, in virtually every single area, we saw this \nkind of greed and unbelievable activity develop across this country.\n  So now we went through this period with a housing bubble built up \nwith these subprime mortgages, and then we saw the whole thing go sour \nand people wonder why. It is not surprising at all that it went sour. \nWhat is surprising to me is how so many interests got sucked in by this \nand how unbelievably damaging it has been to the American economy.\n  How could they have missed what was going to happen here? We had some \nof the biggest investment banks in the world that were buying \nsecurities that had bad value mixed in with securities, and they didn't \nknow it, they say. Where is the due diligence? How on Earth could that \nhave happened?\n  Now, there is a kind of a no-fault capitalism and no-fault politics \ngoing on around here. No-fault capitalism--all of those folks who said: \nGet Government off my back. We want to run these big enterprises the \nway we want to run them. Then they run them into the ground, and they \nneed to have the Federal Reserve Board open--for the first time in \ntheir history--a window for direct lending to investment banks just as \nthey do to regulated banks. Why? Because they were worried they were \ntoo big to fail. If an enterprise such as that is too big to fail, why \nis it too small to regulate? Why is it that all of the regulators sat \non the sidelines while something that most people don't even know \nabout--$40 trillion in value of credit default swaps were out there, \nand much of it is as a result of dramatic borrowing and leverage. It is \na house of cards with a big wind coming, and that wind can play havoc \nwith this financial house of cards.\n  So the no-fault capitalism portion of it is that they do what they \nwant to do--make a lot of money. We all know what the compensation has \nbeen: unbelievable money for those at the top who are running these \norganizations. Then it takes a nosedive, and a bunch of our bankers and \nothers convene in New York and they just say: All right, who are we \ngoing to save, who are we going to prop up, or who are we going to give \na direct loan to? That is no-fault capitalism. No-fault politics: It is \nall of those who were running around here thumbing their suspenders \nsaying: Well, we have to deregulate, we have to do this and that. Let's \nignore the lessons of the 1930s. Let's get rid of Glass-Steagall. Let's \nlet commercial banks get engaged in securities underwriting and other \nrisky activities. All of those folks are now saying: Well, that is not \nwhat caused this problem. In fact, they are still strutting their stuff \nsaying the economy is strong.\n  The economy is not strong. The economy is dramatically weakened as a \nresult of what these folks did to the economy and as a result of this \nadministration's decision that regulation is a four-letter word. I have \nnews for them: Regulation has more letters than four, and regulation is \nessential to the functioning of this kind of Government.\n  I think free markets are very important. I believe in capitalism and \nthe free market system. I don't know of a better allocator of goods and \nservices than the marketplace, but I also understand the marketplace \nneeds a regulator. There need to be regulators who make certain that \nwhen the marketplace gets out of whack, somebody calls it back in. \nRegulators are like referees, except these regulators in this \nadministration had no striped shirts and no whistles to call fouls \nbecause they didn't think anything represented a foul. It was ``let the \nbuyer beware.''\n  Now, what happens next? Well, regrettably, none of us know. We don't\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\nknow what will happen after yesterday. We don't know what will happen \nthe rest of the week. We don't know what else is there. Some say the \nbiggest reset of mortgages will occur in the fourth quarter of this \nyear, which is very soon now. We don't know the consequences of all of \nthis because this was a spectacular, unbelievable trail of greed that, \nin my judgment, has dramatically injured this country.\n  What is important now is for us to try to create some sort of a net \nto catch this economy and then put it back on track with really \neffective regulation--and decide that we are going to have sound \nbusiness principles and we are going to relearn the lessons of the \npast. We shouldn't have to relearn them, but we will. We understood the \nlesson from the 1930s. We taught it in our colleges, about the \nfundamentally unsafe condition of merging risk with banks. Yet, I can \nrecall when it was sold to the Congress as financial modernization. It \nwas the big shots getting their way, and we all pay a dramatic penalty \nfor it.\n  ``The economy is strong,'' my colleagues have said. Senator McCain--\nand I wouldn't normally mention him on the floor of the Senate. He is \nout there running for the Presidency. But since Senator McCain grabbed \npictures of me and several others and put them in television \ncommercials to suggest, here is what is wrong, perhaps maybe it is OK \nfor us to say what is wrong are those who were such cheerleaders for \ntaking apart that which was to protect this country in the first \nplace--Glass-Steagall and others. They knew better--should have known \nbetter--and what is wrong is those who aided and abetted and carried \nthe wood in the last 7 years to say to regulators: Don't bother \nregulating. Get your paycheck. We will give you a paycheck. Just be \nfriendly. Don't regulate. Don't look. Those who did that did a great \ndisservice to this country, in my judgment.\n\n  Now, I recognize this is not a political system in which one side is \nalways all right and one side is always all wrong. That is not the \ncase. It just is not. Both political parties for a long time have \ncontributed much to this country. But I would say this: We have been \nthrough a period that I think is devastating to this country's economic \nfuture. A lot hangs in the balance.\n  I think if the American people want more of the same, then they can \nsign up for that. They can say: Well, we kind of like what is going on \nhere. We like the notion that regulators were told not to regulate and \ncomplied aggressively. We like the notion that we have nearly 700,000 \npeople who have lost their jobs just since the first of this year. We \nthink that has gone really well. We like the fact that the price of oil \ndoubled from July of last year to July of this year. We think that is \njust fine. If people really believe that--we like all of these things--\nthere is certainly a way to continue that, and that is just to say to \nall those who are running in support of President Bush's policies: Boy, \nlet's just keep doing it. But it seems to me--the old law says when you \nare in a hole, stop digging. It seems to me the American people \nunderstand that very well.\n  It is time now--long past the time--for this country to get back to \nfundamentals and for the American people to insist from their \nGovernment the kind of responsibility that Government should manifest \nin terms of its responsibility to protect the marketplace, to protect \nthe American taxpayer, to try to do things that help all Americans, \nhelp lift up all Americans.\n  My colleague described a bit ago the circumstance in this economy \nwhere the wealthy have gotten very wealthy--much wealthier--and then \nthe folks in the rest of the population are struggling to figure out: \nHow on Earth can I keep my job. We have all of these folks sending \nthese jobs to Asia. How do I keep my job? Or if I keep my job, why is \nit that they withdraw my health insurance and no longer provide health \ninsurance? Why do I not have a retirement program anymore? That is what \nworking people face every single day. They get out of bed, many of them \nwork two jobs, they work hard, trying to do the right thing, and they \ndiscover the folks at the very top are getting by with really huge \nincomes.\n  By the way, last year the top income from a hedge fund manager was \n$3.6 billion--$3.6 billion--and they pay a 15-percent top income tax \nrate. Isn't that unbelievable? By the way, they don't even pay that, in \nmost cases, because they try to run their carried interests, as they \ncall it, through tax-haven countries in a circumstance where they can \ndefer compensation and avoid paying even the small 15 percent income \ntax rate. So when somebody comes home making $3.6 billion and the \nspouse says: How did you do today, honey? Well, pretty well. This \nmonth, I made $250 million. That is a far cry from what most American \nworking people would understand or accept, in my judgment. When you see \nwhat is happening at the top compared to what is happening to the rest, \nthere is something wrong with this economy.\n  Now, I have just described in some detail what happened to cause this \nsubprime collapse. To most people--it is a term that is almost \nforeign--subprime lending. Yet much of it is at the root of the \ndramatic problems we now have: the failure of investments, the \ndifficulty of all kinds of institutions that loaded up with this. Why \ndid they load up? Because the people who sold these subprime mortgages \nput prepayment penalties in them. They loaded them with very low \ninterest rates at the front end and then a reset to very high interest \nrates on the back end--in most cases, 3 years--and then put prepayment \npenalties in so you couldn't get out of it. So when they securitized it \nand sold the security upstream to the hedge funds and the investment \nbanks, they looked at that and said: This is really good. We have a \nhuge, built-in, high income from these mortgages, and the borrower \ncan't get out of it because there is a prepayment penalty. That is why \nthey paid premiums for it. That is why they all thought they were \ngetting rich. It was unfettered greed. They all made money in the short \nterm, and the American economy takes a giant hit in the longer term.\n  Finally, let me just say I don't think this is a case that is like \nall other cases. We are challenged in lots of ways on many different \ndays here in the Congress. This is a different challenge. This \ncountry's economic future hangs in the balance, and the question is, \nWill we have the leadership? Will we exhibit the leadership to do this?\n  Mr. President, the answer has to be yes. We cannot decide no, maybe, \nmaybe not. The answer has to be that this requires new, aggressive \nleadership. We have a Presidential campaign going on now, and I happen \nto support Senator Obama. I think it is critically important to look at \nthe history and the record of the candidates to find out who is going \nto support the kinds of things that are necessary to get this country \nback on track.\n  I have talked previously a couple times about John Adams' description \nof trying to put a new country together when he would write to Abigail. \nHe traveled a lot and was in Europe as they were trying to put this new \ncountry together. He would write to his wife Abigail and say \nplaintively in letters: Who will provide the leadership for this new \ncountry of ours? Where will the leadership come from? Who will be the \nleaders? Then in another one he would lament that there is only us--me, \nGeorge Washington, Ben Franklin, Mason, Madison, and Jefferson.\n  In the rearview mirror of history, that was some of the greatest \nhuman talent ever assembled, and this country was given leadership. \nEvery generation asks, where will the leadership come from? If ever \nthere was needed new leadership to step forward and say we need a new \nway, not the old way, we need to put America back on track, to get our \ngrip and our traction, it is now.\n  I think our economy is in significant peril. I know what happened to \nit. The question is, how do we fix this mess? How do we deal with the \nwreckage? I hope the debate we have--let me just say in this discussion \nabout running for President, I have seen so much dishonesty with \nrespect to the television commercials that have been run and the making \nof issues and about the phrases that are used. It is unbelievable to \nme. The one thing I will say I admire is that Barack Obama--whom I have \ncampaigned with in this country--is talking about the future, about \nissues, and he is talking about raising up this country, which I think \nis so important at this point. We need that leadership now.\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I am going to speak later this week on some \nother issues. I wanted to talk today about the issue of the two points \nthat I think have dramatically weakened this country: One, the \nsalesmanship of the Financial Modernization Act. Eight of us--myself \nincluded--voted against that in the Senate, believing that it would \ndamage this country, and indeed it has. Second, the arrival of George \nW. Bush, who decided he didn't believe in Government regulation. We now \nsee the carnage and wreckage that has resulted from that. This country \ndeserves better and will get better, in my judgment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as we debate legislation to authorize \nmore than $600 billion for our Armed Forces, we have a responsibility \nto the taxpayers who foot the bill to make sure that money is being \nused as carefully and as wisely as possible. Today I rise in support of \nan amendment offered by Senator Sanders and cosponsored by myself and \nSenator Feingold that exposes unnecessary and wasteful spending within \nthe Department of Defense and offers a solution.\n  From storage warehouses to assembly lines, the Department of Defense \nis sitting on billions of dollars in parts and supplies that are in \nexcess of the military's requirements--everything from jet engines to \nsprings to fuel tanks.\n  The Army, Navy, Air Force, and other Department of Defense agencies \ncurrently possess $30.63 billion of unneeded spare parts, in addition \nto $346 million of excess spare parts that are on-order--parts that are \nstill being produced or delivered, but that the military already knows \nit doesn't need. The Air Force has $18.7 billion of excess spare parts \non hand; the Navy has $7.7 billion, and the Army has $4.21 billion. On-\norder excess spare parts are at lower but still unacceptable levels. \nThe Air Force has $1.3 billion in excess parts on-order; the Navy has \n$130 million, and the Army has $110 million.\n  It gets worse. Branches of the Armed Forces have millions of dollars \nof spare parts on-order that they have already decided they will \ndispose of when they arrive. If a retailer like Target or Best Buy or \nKmart controlled its inventory so poorly that it had $307.48 million \nworth of items on-order that it knew it would have to dispose of \nimmediately upon arrival, that company would quickly go bankrupt. The \nAir Force has $235 million of spare parts marked for disposal; the Navy \nhas $18.18 million, and the Army has $54.3 million. That's a \nnonsensical and unacceptable waste of taxpayers' money.\n  The Defense Department's inventory management systems are a big part \nof the problem: they are incompatible, duplicative, and ill-equipped to \nthe task of managing such a massive volume of parts and supplies. Don't \njust take my word for it. Over the last decade, the General \nAccountability Office has repeatedly flagged these inventory management \nsystems as ``high-risk,'' vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and \nmismanagement. If American companies can get this right, there is no \nreason that America's military can't.\n  Waste in excess inventory is part of a bigger problem of waste in the \nDepartment of Defense. The distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin, recently cited a GAO report detailing $295 \nbillion in cost overruns and an average 21-month delay on Pentagon \nweapons systems. The GAO report recommends strong congressional \noversight of defense programs. To that end, the reporting mechanisms of \nthe Sanders-Feingold-Whitehouse amendment increase oversight and \nprevent waste in the Department of Defense.\n  Our amendment calls on the Department of Defense to cut waste and fix \nthe problem. This measure would require the Secretary of Defense to \ncertify to Congress that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense \nLogistics Agency have reduced by half their spare parts that are on-\norder and already labeled as excess. Until this certification is \ncompleted, the amendment would withhold $100 million from the defense \nbudget for military spare parts.\n  Our amendment would also require the Department of Defense to come up \nwith a plan to reduce the acquisition of unnecessary spare parts and \nimprove its inventory systems. It would then require quarterly progress \nreports to Congress, including reports on the levels of excess \ninventory that are on hand and on-order.\n  Our troops deserve the best equipment and the best supplies we can \ngive them to help them do their jobs and keep us safe. Leaving billions \nof dollars of spare parts to rust away in warehouses just doesn't serve \nthat purpose. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, \nimportant amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks and \nappreciation to Chairman Levin and Senator Warner for their outstanding \nefforts on the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2009.\n  I would especially like to recognize Senator Warner for his \nstewardship of this bill this year, and his determined role managing \nthe bill on the floor over the last few weeks. Senator Warner has \nplayed a role in most of the Defense authorization bills over the last \n40 years. His sage counsel and steady hand on the rudder are an \ninvaluable asset to the Senate in meeting our commitment to our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  I would like to thank the committee for supporting $1.3 billion in \nmilitary construction and base realignment and closure funding for \nMaryland's military installations. This funding is especially critical \nto ensuring that the BRAC transition of Walter Reed Army Hospital to \nthe National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, stays on track. \nWe owe it to our wounded warriors and their families to give them world \nclass medical facilities that they deserve.\n  This bill also makes great strides in continuing to focus on the \nDole-Shalala recommendations that outline the best courses of action \nfor improving the quality of care for our wounded warriors. This bill \nrequires the Department of Defense to establish Post Traumatic Stress \nDisorder and Traumatic Brain Injury Centers of Excellence and conduct \npilot programs to better treat these disorders. The bill will also \nrequire that the Department of Defense to develop uniform standards and \nprocedures for disability evaluations of recovering servicemembers \nacross military departments. I commend the committee for continuing to \nmake quality military health care a priority.\n  This legislation provides vitally important increases in authorized \nfunding for our National Guard. This bill shows a clear and substantial \ncommitment to restore and improve the homeland defense capabilities and \nreadiness of our National Guard. I am very pleased that the committee \nincreased the authorization of the Army's procurement budget by $391.2 \nmillion for dual-purpose equipment in support of National Guard \nreadiness. In addition to giving our National Guard the tools and \nequipment they need, this bill also enhances Guard and Reserve family \nsupport programs.\n  In closing, I commend Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, and their \nstaffs for putting together a bill of which we can all be proud. This \nbill sends the message that we in the Senate remain committed to \nsupporting our troops, both in combat and at home.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I commend the work of my colleagues on the \nArmed Services Committee on this important legislation which I hope \nPresident Bush will sign into law prior to the start of the fiscal \nyear. In this tremendous time of transition for our military, we owe \nthem a law that will enable the DOD to execute this year's budget \nefficiently and effectively.\n  This bill provides a budget that allows the DOD to plan for future \nthreats, combat current threats, and provide for the welfare of our \nbrave veterans both past and future.\n  It should also be noted that this year's bill and the authorization \nbills from the preceding 28 years could not have been completed without \nthe statesmanship and the strong bipartisan leadership provided by \nSenator John Warner. This will be Senator Warner's final authorization \nbill during his nearly 30 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, \non which he also served as chairman and ranking member. In his nearly \n60 years of serving our country both in and out of uniform, he has \nalways upheld his commitment to our brave service men and women with \nthe highest standards of honor and integrity\n  I would first like to point out a few of the highlights of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act currently being considered:\n  Authorizes a much needed 3.9 percent across-the-board pay raise for \nthe brave men and women of our armed forces. This pay raise is a half \npercent higher than that requested by President Bush;\n  Fully funds Army readiness and depot maintenance programs to ensure \nthat forces preparing to deploy are properly trained and equipped;\n  Authorizes $26.1 billion for the Defense Health Program, which \nincludes\n\n[[Page S8837]]\n\nthe $1.2 billion necessary to cover the rejection of the administration \nproposal to raise TRICARE fees;\n  Requires the Secretaries of Defense and VA to continue the operations \nof the Senior Oversight Committee to oversee implementation of Wounded \nWarrior initiatives; and\n  Fully funds the eight ships requested in the President's budget, \nincluding full funding for the third ZUMWALT class destroyer. This ship \nis critical to maintaining the technical superiority that our Navy has \nenjoyed on the oceans throughout the world. The future maritime fleet \nmust be adaptable, affordable, survivable, flexible and responsive. The \nZUMWALT class provides all of these characteristics as a multimission \nsurface combatant, tailored for land attack and littoral dominance. It \nwill provide independent forward presence, allow for precision naval \ngun fire support of Joint forces ashore, and through its advanced \nsensors ensure absolute control of the combat air space. All of this \ncapability is based on today's proven and demonstrated technologies. We \ncannot build the same ships that we did 20 years ago and hope to defeat \ntomorrow's emerging threats.\n  This year I once again had the honor of serving as the chairman of \nthe Emerging Threats Subcommittee. Senator Dole served as the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee and working together, our subcommittee \nproduced good results in the bill now before the Senate. The Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee is responsible for looking at new \nand emerging threats to our security, and considering appropriate steps \nwe should take to develop new capabilities to face these threats.\n  In preparation for our markup, Senator Levin, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, provided guidelines for the work of the \ncommittee, including the following two items:\n  Improve the ability of the armed forces to counter nontraditional \nthreats, including terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and\n  Promote the transformation of the armed forces to deal with the \nthreats of the 21st century.\n  In response, our subcommittee recommended initiatives in a number of \nareas within our jurisdiction. These areas include:\n  Supporting crucial nonproliferation programs and other efforts to \ncombat Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD);\n  Supporting advances in medical research and technology to treat such \nconditions as traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress \ndisorder;\n  Increasing investments in new energy technologies such as fuel cells, \nhybrid engines, and alternate fuels to increase military performance \nand reduce costs;\n  Increasing investments in advanced manufacturing technologies to \nstrengthen our defense industrial base so that it can rapidly and \nefficiently produce the materiel needed by our Nation's warfighters; \nand\n  Increasing investments in research at our Nation's small businesses, \nGovernment labs, and universities so that we have the most innovative \nminds in our country working to enhance our national security.\n  Specifically, some notable initiatives in this bill that originated \nin the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee include:\n  Authorizing more than $120 million in the area of nonproliferation \nand combating weapons of mass destruction, including $50 million for \ndenuclearization activities in North Korea; $20 million for the \nCooperative Threat Reduction program; and more than $50 million for \nchemical and biological defense programs.\n  Consolidating funding for the Mixed Oxide, MOX, program in the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, as a nonproliferation \nactivity, rather than as part of the nuclear energy budget as the \nbudget requested.\n  Clarifying that excess fissile material disposition is an NNSA \nnonproliferation responsibility.\n  Establishing a nonproliferation scholarship fund to deal with \nshortages in technical and other fields such as radiochemistry and \nnuclear forensics.\n  Adding $25 million to nonproliferation research & development, R, \nfor nuclear forensics and other R activities.\n  Authorizing the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and providing an \nadditional $10 million for new initiatives outside of the former Soviet \nUnion, $1 million for Russian chemical weapons demilitarization, and $9 \nmillion for nuclear weapons storage security in Russia to complete the \nwork under the Bratislava agreement.\n  The bill also includes a number of legislative provisions that will \nenhance the Department's ability to procure and use critical defense \ntechnologies, such as:\n  Legislation that would implement recommendations of the National \nAcademy of Sciences to help ensure that the DOD develops and procures \nprinted circuit boards that are trustworthy and reliable for use in \ndefense systems;\n  Legislation that would implement the recommendations of the Defense \nScience Board seeking to enhance the Department's ability to ensure \nthat microelectronics procured from commercial sources, including \nforeign sources, and embedded throughout defense systems are reliable \nand trustworthy; and\n  Legislation requiring the development of a joint government-industry \nbattery technology roadmap to ensure that a healthy and innovative \ndefense industrial base for batteries exists in the United States, to \nsupport a variety of requirements in military vehicles, computers, and \nother equipment.\n  Relative to science and technology funding levels, the bill would \nincrease the Department's investments in innovative science and \ntechnology programs by nearly $400 million to over $11.8 billion; and \nfully support the Secretary of Defense's initiative to increase \nuniversity defense basic research funding and increase the level by \nnearly $50 million over the President's request.\n  In the area of force protection, the bill includes a provision that \nwould increase the amount and quality of testing performed on force \nprotection equipment, such as body armor, helmets, and vehicle armor, \nbefore it is deployed to the field, to ensure that our soldiers and \nmarines have the best available equipment and protection.\n  In order to enhance our ability to combat international terrorist \ngroups, the bill would fully fund the $5.7 billion budget request, and \nadd over $20 million for items to help find and track terrorists, \nincluding intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance packages; \nextend authorization to the Special Operations Command to train and \nequip forces supporting or facilitating special operations forces in \nongoing military operations, and increase the funding available for \nthis activity; and increase funding for DOD's Regional Defense \nCombating Terrorism Fellowship.\n  Concerning counterdrug programs, the bill includes a provision that \nwould extend the authority to use counterdrug funds to support the \nGovernment of Colombia's unified campaign against narcotics cultivation \nand trafficking, and against terrorist organizations involved in such \nactivities. It also includes a provision that would extend the \nDepartment's authority to use counterdrug funds to support law \nenforcement agencies conducting counterterrorist activities.\n  This is a good bill. The members of the committee and the committee \nstaff have worked many hours to get this bill to the floor. We are a \nnation at war and the military needs this bill. I urge my colleagues to \nwork together to pass it so that we can conference with the House and \nsend it on to the President for his signature.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8837-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8837-S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, today President Bush was in Texas to see \nfirsthand the devastation from Hurricane Ike. Unfortunately, this is \nnot the first time, nor will it be the last time, that Mother Nature \nhas shown us her worst. My heart goes out to the millions of displaced \nresidents and evacuees who are anxious to return home, who are without \npower, who must depend on others for food and water and other \nnecessities, and who face the long hard task of rebuilding their homes \nand communities.\n  We know a little of what that is like in Illinois. In June, the \nMidwest was hit by massive flooding, some of the worst we have seen \nsince the Great Flood of 1993. Experts called it a 200 to 500-year \nevent. It left entire communities underwater, broke levees, and washed \naway roads, bridges, and millions of acres of cropland. The damage \ncould have been worse, if Illinoisans had not worked so long and so \nhard to fill sandbags, fortify levees, and stand their ground against \nthe rising waters of the Mississippi.\n  But sometimes weather-related disasters strike with no warning and \nyou don't have time to prepare for the worst. Over the weekend my State \nwas hit by the sixth major flooding event in the last year alone when 3 \ndays of rain dumped more than 100 billion gallons of water on the city \nof Chicago--two or three times the normal amount. More than 7 inches of \nrain fell on the Chicago area on Saturday alone, setting a new 1-day \nrecord at O'Hare. In the suburbs, some of the worst flooding was along \nthe Des Plaines River, which crested at near-record levels, displaced \nthousands of residents, and flooded hundreds of homes.\n  On Monday I had a chance to see for myself the damage in Albany Park, \na neighborhood in Chicago that was one of the hardest hit areas. \nThirty-ninth Ward Alderman Margaret Laurino accompanied me as I met \nwith residents like Aaron Gadiel, who waded through knee-high water in \nhis fishing boots and searched his home to see if he could salvage \nclothing for his kids. I want to commend the local and city officials I \nsaw going door to door with pumps, checking to see if residents needed \nhelp, and pitching in wherever they were needed. I especially want to \nthank Terry O'Brien, president of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation \nDistrict, and Ray Orozco, executive director of Chicago's Office of \nEmergency Management and Communications, OEMC, for taking the time to \nshow me the extent of the flood damage.\n  The same weather system that dumped billions of gallons of rain on \nChicago also caused the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to swell in \nother parts of Illinois. U.S. Army Corps officials are keeping a close \neye on the system of levees and dams that protect these communities to \nmake sure that these residents don't experience a repeat of the June \nfloods.\n  Today the skies are clearing over Chicago. Water levels are falling, \nroads are reopening and some folks are returning home. But the \nrecordbreaking rains that evacuated thousands, left four dead, closed \nroads and flooded homes have left more than a watermark. As Des Plaines \nMayor Tony Arredia rightly pointed out, we still have cleaning up to \ndo. I am committed to making sure that Illinoisans do not face this \ntask alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8838-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO SECOND LIEUTENANT HOWARD CLIFTON ENOCH, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today because after more than 60 \nyears, a Kentucky family has been reunited with a father and \ngrandfather they never knew. And an American hero is coming home.\n  Second Lieutenant Howard Clifton Enoch, Jr., U.S. Army Air Forces, \nwas last seen on March 19, 1945, when he took off in his P-51D Mustang \nsingle-seat fighter plane for a mission over Germany. He crashed while \nengaging enemy aircraft near the city of Leipzig.\n  His remains could not be immediately recovered, and once Soviet \nforces took over the part of that country that would become East \nGermany--including the area around Leipzig recovery became impossible \nfor decades.\n  Howard Enoch III was born 3 months after his father's plane crashed. \nHe grew up in Marion, KY, never knowing his namesake. Now, thanks to \nthe work of some dedicated men and women in the Department of Defense, \nhis father's remains have been identified.\n  A German researcher originally identified the crash site, and \nnotified our Government. The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, the arm \nof the Department of Defense charged with recovering the remains of our \nlost heroes, sent a recovery crew to Germany. They used mitochondrial \nDNA analysis to identify the remains, and in 2007 they contacted Howard \nEnoch III with the astonishing news.\n  Howard Enoch III's two young daughters gained new insight into their \ngrandfather. And the discovery brought Howard in touch with a cousin he \nnever knew, who had served alongside Second Lieutenant Enoch in Europe \nin World War II.\n  Now Second Lieutenant Enoch will be buried at Arlington National \nCemetery, alongside America's greatest heroes. And the Enoch family can \nknow that after valiant service to his country, six decades later, a \nsoldier will finally rest in peace. I wish to offer my deepest \nappreciation to Howard Enoch III for his father's service and his \nfamily's sacrifice on behalf of our country.\n  Earlier this month, the Bluegrass Chapter of Honor Flight paid \nspecial tribute to Second Lieutenant Enoch at the World War II Memorial \nin our Nation's Capital. Honor Flight is a nonprofit organization which \ntransports World War II veterans from anywhere in the country to see \nthe memorial, free of charge.\n  Honor Flight and its volunteers, many of whom are veterans \nthemselves, are doing a great service for our Nation by allowing these \nveterans to make this important trip. Second Lieutenant Enoch never got \na chance to visit the World War II Memorial. But it was built for him, \nand his thousands of fellow soldiers. So I am glad that 63 years later, \nHonor Flight has recognized his service.\n  For a long time, the Enoch family has felt not only the loss of \nSecond Lieutenant Enoch, but also doubt about his final fate. I am \npleased for them that that doubt is over. They can take comfort that \n2LT Howard Clifton Enoch, Jr. will lie among Arlington's heroes. And \nthey can take pride that this U.S. Senate honors his service and his \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8838-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8838-S8840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REPORT ON THE TOMB OF THE UNKNOWNS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to share a report with our \ncolleagues, which I received last month from the Departments of the \nArmy and Veterans Affairs. The report addresses the Army's and VA's \nplans for repairing and preserving the Tomb Monument at the Tomb of the \nUnknowns. As many of our colleagues may know and appreciate, the Tomb \nis a national monument of great historical significance, especially to \nour Nation's veterans, located on the hallowed ground of Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  The Tomb Monument, which sits above the tombs for the unknowns from \nWorld War I, World War II, and the Korean conflict, has developed \nseveral cracks along the natural faults in the marble. For some time, \nthere has been discussion of possibly replacing the original monument. \nHowever, prior to taking this option, I wanted to ensure that at the \nvery least decisionmakers considered options for preserving, rather \nthan replacing the monument. While I understand the concerns about the \ncracks in the Tomb Monument, I along with many others believe that our \nnational monuments are not diminished by signs of their age. Many of \nour most treasured American symbols, from the Liberty Bell to the Star-\nSpangled Banner, are physically worn and weathered. This does not \ndiminish their value or significance. I would argue that the same is \ntrue for the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n  It is our Nation's tradition to preserve our historic national \nsymbols. We must protect them from the notion that they can be easily \ndiscarded or replaced. With those concerns in mind, my colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Webb, and I successfully added language requiring a \nreport on plans for the Tomb Monument to last year's National Defense \nAuthorization Act. The joint report acknowledges that replacement of \nthe Tomb Monument could have a negative impact on the historic \nsignificance of the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\n  I am pleased that the joint report outlined several alternatives to \nreplacing the Tomb Monument. I urge the Departments, in their \nrespective capacities, to pursue the best means of preserving the Tomb \nMonument for future generations of veterans and Americans. While the \nDepartments may have to consider partial or full replacement of the \nTomb Monument at some future date, at this time there are still a \nnumber of other options which should be pursued.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters and the Executive \nSummary of the report be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary, Civil Works,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 11, 2008.\n     Hon.

The Tomb Monument is the four-piece marble \n     object located over the vault containing the remains of the \n     World War I Unknown, and is a component of the Tomb of the \n     Unknowns. Section 2873 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Public Law 110-181 (Act), directed \n     the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs to submit a joint report to Congress on plans to \n     address the cracks with respect to (1) replacing the Monument \n     and its disposal, if it were removed; (2) an assessment of \n     the feasibility and advisability of repairing the Monument \n     rather than replacing it; (3) a description of current \n     efforts to maintain and preserve the Monument; (4) an \n     explanation of why no attempt has been made since 1989 to \n     repair it; (5) comprehensive estimates of the cost of \n     replacement and the cost of repair; and (6) an assessment of \n     its structural integrity.\n       In 1963, ANC initiated a program of monitoring and \n     investigation of the Monument in response to the development \n     of two parallel cracks in its main block. The cracks, which \n     now measure nearly 48 feet in combined length, appear on all \n     four sides of the Monument and extend almost entirely through \n     the block. According to stone conservation experts, the \n     cracks are not compromising the structural integrity of the \n     stone and are repairable. ANC repaired the cracks twice, once \n     in 1975, and again in 1989, and is now in the process of \n     initiating another repair of the Monument. The results of \n     studies and monitoring of the Monument over the past four \n     decades confirm that, despite repairs, the cracks continue to \n     lengthen and widen, which is perhaps a natural phenomenon of \n     the material. Since 1990, a third crack has become visible, \n     whose origins are uncertain. The Monument can be repaired \n     again, but its condition will continue to deteriorate. \n     Although it is not known when the Monument will reach the \n     point of being beyond repair, the natural aging process that \n     weathers and cracks outdoor marble makes it likely that it \n     will need to be replaced at some point in the future. The \n     cracking and minor erosion of the Monument have led ANC to \n     consider various treatment options, including repairing the \n     cracks, obtaining and stockpiling marble for future \n     replacement of the monument, and the immediate replacement of \n     its cap, die block, and base.\n       The impetus to consider various treatment options for the \n     Monument is the culmination of over 40 years of deliberation, \n     starting with the first report on the cracks in the early \n     1960s, and continuing through the two previous repairs. In \n     evaluating whether to continue to maintain and repair the \n     Monument or replace it, ANC is giving full consideration to \n     its historic significance. ANC recognizes the associative \n     qualities that link the Monument to World War I and its \n     veterans. ANC also realizes that the Tomb of the Unknowns has \n     come to memorialize all of the service men and women that \n     have sacrificed their lives for this country in subsequent \n     military conflicts that continue today. In this regard, the \n     Tomb of the Unknowns has significance, beyond its historic \n     significance, that transcends the past and present to the \n     future. As its steward, ANC is responsible to do what it can \n     to ensure that the Monument stands, as unflawed and \n     perfect as possible, in honor of the sacrifices that it \n     represents.\n       To preserve the solemn dignity of the Monument for those \n     that it honors and for\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n     future generations of Americans, ANC is considering \n     alternative actions that could be taken. Repair of the \n     Monument is a viable alternative, as verified by experts in \n     the field of stone conservation. Replacement is another \n     alternative under consideration, due to the uncertainty of \n     obtaining suitable marble in the future. Only marble with \n     specific qualities can be used for replacement, so the \n     current and future existence and availability of such marble \n     is of concern. Suitable marble is available today, but may \n     not be in the future, and there will never be a greater \n     quantity of suitable marble in the future than there is now. \n     It is primarily for this reason that ANC is considering \n     replacement of the Monument as one potential long-term \n     solution.\n       There is more information in this report on the potential \n     replacement option than there is for other options, because \n     the replacement option is much more complex than the other \n     options under consideration. Also, the potential replacement \n     option has undergone the most scrutiny through the Section \n     106 review process. The preponderance of information on \n     replacement should not be construed as favoring this option \n     over the other options under consideration.\n       In response to ANC's request to provide a Tomb Monument \n     replacement, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) entered \n     into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Department \n     of the Army in 2004 that outlines respective \n     responsibilities. VA will be responsible for the procurement, \n     transportation, and sculpting of a replacement for the base, \n     main die block, and cap of the Tomb Monument when and if Army \n     decides replacement is necessary. Both agencies have \n     compliance requirements under Section 106 of the National \n     Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental \n     Policy Act (NEPA). No decision on a final course of action \n     will be made until both agencies fulfill their respective \n     responsibilities under both of these laws.\n       Furthermore, subsection 2873(b) of the Act states that \n     ``The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs may not take any action to replace the monument at \n     the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, \n     Virginia, until 180 days after the date of receipt by \n     Congress of the report required by subsection (a).'' \n     According to subsection 2873(c), the limitation in subsection \n     2873(b) does not prevent the repair of the current Monument \n     or the acquisition of blocks of marble. Accordingly, while \n     long-term options such as continued repair, procurement of \n     replacement marble, and immediate replacement continue to be \n     explored, ANC is working with experts in the field of marble \n     maintenance and conservation to develop and implement a \n     maintenance and repair plan to ensure that the existing \n     marble is appropriately protected. ANC will take no action to \n     acquire replacement blocks of marble until after Section 106 \n     and NEPA requirements are complete.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8840-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8840-S8844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STATEMENT OF MANAGERS--S. 3406\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n               I. Purpose and Summary of the Legislation\n\n       The purpose of S. 3406, the ``ADA Amendments Act of 2008'' \n     is to clarify the intention and enhance the protections of \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, landmark civil \n     rights legislation that provided ``a clear and comprehensive \n     national mandate for the elimination of discrimination on the \n     basis of disability.'' \\1\\ In particular, the ADA Amendments \n     Act amends the definition of disability by providing \n     clarification and instruction about the terminology used in \n     the definition, by expanding the definition, and by rejecting \n     several opinions of the United States Supreme Court that have \n     had the effect of restricting the meaning and application of \n     the definition of disability.\n       S. 3406 is the product of an extensive bipartisan effort \n     that included many hours of meetings and negotiation by \n     legislative staff as well as by stakeholders including the \n     disability, business, and education communities. In addition, \n     two hearings were held in the Senate Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions Committee to explore the issues addressed \n     in this legislation. The goal has been to achieve the ADA's \n     legislative objectives in a way that maximizes bipartisan \n     consensus and minimizes unintended consequences.\n       This legislation amends the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     of 1990 by making the changes identified below.\n       Aligning the construction of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, The bill amends Title I of the ADA to provide that no \n     covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified \n     individual ``on the basis of disability.''\n       The bill maintains the ADA's inherently functional \n     definition of disability as a physical or mental impairment \n     that substantially limits one or more life activities; a \n     record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such \n     an impairment. It clarifies and expands the definition's \n     meaning and application in the following ways.\n       First, the bill deletes two findings in the ADA which led \n     the Supreme Court to unduly restrict the meaning and \n     application of the definition of disability. These findings \n     are that there are ``some 43,000,000 Americans have one or \n     more physical or mental disabilities'' and that ``individuals \n     with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority.'' The \n     Court treated these findings as limitations on how it \n     construed other provisions of the ADA. This conclusion had \n     the effect of interfering with previous judicial precedents \n     holding that, like other civil rights statutes, the ADA must \n     be construed broadly to effectuate its remedial purpose. \n     Deleting these findings removes this barrier to construing \n     and applying the definition of disability more generously.\n       Second, the bill affirmatively provides that the definition \n     of disability ``shall be construed in favor of broad coverage \n     of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent \n     permitted by the terms of this Act.''2 It retains \n     the term ``substantially limits'' from the original ADA \n     definition but makes it clear that this is intended to be a \n     less demanding standard than that enunciated by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. \n     v. Williams.3 With this rule of construction and \n     relevant purpose language, the bill rejects the Supreme \n     Court's holding in Toyota v. Williams that the terms \n     ``substantially'' and ``major'' in the definition of \n     disability must be ``be interpreted strictly to create a \n     demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,''4 \n     as well as the Court's interpretation that ``substantially \n     limits'' means ``prevents or severely \n     restricts.''5\n       Third, the bill prohibits consideration of mitigating \n     measures such as medication, assistive technology, \n     accommodations, or modifications when determining whether an \n     impairment constitutes a disability. This provision and \n     relevant purpose language rejects the Supreme Court's \n     holdings in Sutton v. United Air Lines6 and its \n     companion cases7 that mitigating measures must be \n     considered.8 The bill also provides that \n     impairments that are episodic or in remission are to be \n     assessed in an active state.\n       Fourth, the bill provides new instruction on what may \n     constitute ``major life activities.'' It provides a non-\n     exhaustive list of major life activities within the meaning \n     of the ADA. In addition, the bill expands the category of \n     major life activities to include the operation of major \n     bodily functions.\n       Fifth, the bill removes from the third ``regarded as'' \n     prong of the disability definition the requirement that an \n     individual demonstrate that he or she has, or is perceived to \n     have, an impairment that substantially limits a major life \n     activity. Under the bill, therefore, an individual can \n     establish coverage under the law by showing that he or she \n     has been subjected to an action prohibited under the Act \n     because of an actual or perceived physical or mental \n     impairment. Because the bill thus broadens application of \n     this third prong of the disability definition, entities \n     covered by the ADA will not be required to provide \n     accommodations or to modify policies and procedures for \n     individuals who fall solely under the third prong. Such \n     entities will, however, still be subject to discrimination \n     claims.\n       Finally, the bill clarifies that the agencies that \n     currently issue regulations under the ADA have regulatory \n     authority related to the definitions contained in Section 3. \n     Conforming amendments to Section 7 of the Rehabilitation Act \n     of 1973 are intended to ensure harmony between federal civil \n     rights laws.\n\n                II. Background and Need for Legislation\n\n       When Congress passed the ADA in 1990, it adopted the \n     functional definition of disability from the Section 504 of \n     the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\\9\\ in part, because after 17 \n     years of development through case law the requirements of the \n     definition were well understood. Within this framework, with \n     its generous and inclusive definition of disability, courts \n     treated the determination of disability as a threshold issue \n     but focused primarily on whether unlawful discrimination had \n     occurred.\n       More recent Supreme Court decisions imposing a stricter \n     standard for determining disability had the effect of \n     upsetting this balance. After the Court's decisions in Sutton \n     that impairments must be considered in their mitigated state \n     and in Toyota that there must be a demanding standard for \n     qualifying as disabled, lower courts more often found that an \n     individual's impairment did not constitute a disability. As a \n     result, in too many cases, courts would never reach the \n     question whether discrimination had occurred.\n       Thus, some 18 years later we are faced with a situation in \n     which physical or mental impairments that would previously \n     have been\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\n     found to constitute disabilities are not considered \n     disabilities under the Supreme Court's narrower standard. \n     These can include individuals with impairments such as \n     amputation, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, multiple \n     sclerosis, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. The \n     resulting court decisions contribute to a legal environment \n     in which individuals must demonstrate an inappropriately high \n     degree of functional limitation in order to be protected from \n     discrimination under the ADA.\n       The ADA Amendments Act rejects the high burden required in \n     these cases and reiterates that Congress intends that the \n     scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act be broad and \n     inclusive. It is the intent of the legislation to establish a \n     degree of functional limitation required for an impairment to \n     constitute a disability that is consistent with what Congress \n     originally intended, a degree that is lower than what the \n     courts have construed it to be. In addition, the bill \n     provides for application of this standard to a wider range of \n     cases by expanding the category of major life activities. \n     These steps, resulting from extensive bipartisan negotiation \n     and discussion among legislators and stakeholders, are \n     intended to provide for more generous coverage and \n     application of the ADA's prohibition on discrimination \n     through a framework that is more predictable, consistent, \n     and workable for all entities subject to responsibilities \n     under the ADA.\n\n            III. Explanation of the Bill and Manager's Views\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (``the ADA'') \n     is a landmark statute that has fundamentally changed the \n     lives of many millions of Americans with disabilities. The \n     managers of this legislation were proud to be leaders in that \n     effort that was accomplished in a deliberative careful manner \n     that allowed for the development of a strong bipartisan \n     coalition in both Houses of Congress and the Administration \n     of President George H. W. Bush and led to Senate passage with \n     a definitive vote of 91-6.\n       However, as discussed in more detail below, a series of \n     Court decisions have restricted the coverage and diminished \n     the civil rights protections of the ADA, especially in the \n     workplace, by narrowing its definition of disability. As a \n     result, lower court cases have too often turned solely on the \n     question of whether the plaintiff is an individual with a \n     disability rather than the merits of discrimination claims, \n     such as whether adverse decisions were impermissibly made by \n     the employer on the basis of disability, reasonable \n     accommodations were denied inappropriately, or qualification \n     standards were unlawfully discriminatory.\n       The managers have introduced the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 \n     to restore the proper balance and application of the ADA by \n     clarifying and broadening the definition of disability, and \n     to increase eligibility for the protections of the ADA. It is \n     our expectation that because this bill makes the definition \n     of disability more generous, some people who were not covered \n     before will now be covered. The strong bipartisan support for \n     this legislation once again demonstrates the continuing \n     bipartisan commitment to protecting the civil rights of \n     individuals with disabilities among members of the Senate \n     Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions and the \n     Senate as a whole.\n       The ADA Amendments Act renews our commitment to ensuring \n     that all Americans with disabilities, including a new \n     generation of disabled veterans who are just beginning to \n     grapple with the challenge of living to their full potential \n     despite the limitations imposed by their disabilities, are \n     able to participate to the fullest possible extent in all \n     facets of society, including the workplace. We acknowledge \n     and applaud the substantial improvements in medical science \n     and the courageous efforts of individuals with disabilities \n     to overcome the impact of those disabilities, but in no way \n     wish to exclude them thereby from protection under the ADA.\n       By retaining the essential elements of the definition of \n     disability including the key term ``substantially limits'' we \n     reaffirm that not every individual with a physical or mental \n     impairment is covered by the first prong of the definition of \n     disability in the ADA. An impairment that does not \n     substantially limit a major life activity is not a disability \n     under this prong. That will not change after enactment of the \n     ADA Amendments Act, nor will the necessity of making \n     this determination on an individual basis. What will \n     change is the standard required for making this \n     determination. This bill lowers the standard for \n     determining whether an impairment constitute a disability \n     and reaffirms the intent of Congress that the definition \n     of disability in the ADA is to be interpreted broadly and \n     inclusively.\\10\\\n\n\n                         Findings and Purposes\n\n       Given the importance the Court has placed upon findings and \n     purposes particularly in civil rights statutes like the ADA, \n     the ADA Amendments Act contains a detailed Findings and \n     Purposes section that the managers believe gives clear \n     guidance to the courts and that they intend to be applied \n     appropriately and consistently. As described above, the \n     legislation deletes two findings in the ADA that have been \n     interpreted by the Supreme Court to require a narrow \n     definition of disability. We continue to believe that \n     individuals with disabilities ``have been faced with \n     restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of \n     purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of \n     political powerlessness in our society, based on \n     characteristics that are beyond the control of such \n     individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not \n     truly indicative of the individual ability of such \n     individuals to participate in, and contribute to, \n     society.''\\11\\\n       In addition to deleting the findings forming the basis of \n     the Sutton and Toyota decisions, the bill states explicitly \n     its purpose to reject the holdings in those cases (and their \n     progeny), and to ensure broad coverage under the ADA. To be \n     clear, the purposes section conveys our intent to clarify not \n     only that ``substantially limits'' should be measured by a \n     lower standard than that used in Toyota,\\12\\ but also that \n     the definition of disability should not be unduly used as a \n     tool for excluding individuals from the ADA's protections.\n       The bill expresses the clear intent of Congress that the \n     EEOC will revise its regulations that similarly improperly \n     define the term ``substantially limits'' as ``significantly \n     restricted''; again, this sets too high a standard.\n       The bill's purposes also reject the Supreme Court's holding \n     that mitigating measures must be considered when determining \n     whether an impairment constitutes a disability. With the \n     exception of ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses, \n     impairments must be examined in their unmitigated state.\n       These purposes are specifically incorporated into the \n     statute by the rule of construction providing that the term \n     ``substantially limits'' shall be construed consistently with \n     the findings and purposes of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. \n     This rule of construction, together with the rule of \n     construction providing that the definition of disability \n     shall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals \n     sends a clear signal of our intent that the courts must \n     interpret the definition of disability broadly rather than \n     stringently.\n\n\n                        Definition of Disability\n\n       In the ADA of 1990, Congress sought to protect anyone who \n     experiences discrimination because of a current, past, or \n     perceived disability. Under the ADA, there are three prongs \n     of the definition of disability, with respect to an \n     individual:\n       (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially \n     limits one or more of the major life activities of such \n     individual;\n       (2) a record of such an impairment; or\n       (3) being regarded as having such an impairment.\n       This definition is of critical importance because as a \n     threshold issue it determines whether an individual is \n     covered by the ADA. The ADA Amendments Act retains the \n     definition of disability but further defines and clarifies \n     three critical terms within the existing definition \n     (``substantially limits,'' ``major life activities,'' \n     ``regarded as having such impairment'') and, under the rules \n     of construction for the definition, adds several standards \n     that must be applied when considering the definition of \n     disability.\n     Physical or mental impairment\n       The bill does not provide a definition for the terms \n     ``physical impairment'' or ``mental impairment.'' The \n     managers expect that the current regulatory definition of \n     these terms, as promulgated by agencies such as the U.S. \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Education \n     Office of Civil Rights (DOE OCR) will not \n     change.13\n     Substantially limits\n       We do not believe that the courts have correctly instituted \n     the level of coverage we intended to establish with the term \n     ``substantially limits'' in the ADA. In particular, we \n     believe that the level of limitation, and the intensity of \n     focus, applied by the Supreme Court in Toyota goes beyond \n     what we believe is the appropriate standard to create \n     coverage under this law.\n       We have extensively deliberated with regard to whether a \n     new term, other than the term ``substantially limits'' should \n     be used in this Act. For example, in its ADA Amendments Act, \n     H.R.3195, the House of Representatives attempted to \n     accomplish this goal by stating that the key phrase \n     ``substantially limits'' means ``materially restricts'' in \n     order to convey that Congress intended to depart from the \n     strict and demanding standard applied by the Supreme Court in \n     Sutton and Toyota.14\n       We have concluded that adopting a new, undefined term that \n     is subject to widely disparate meanings is not the best way \n     to achieve the goal of ensuring consistent and appropriately \n     broad coverage under this Act. The resulting need for further \n     judicial scrutiny and construction will not help move the \n     focus from the threshold issue of disability to the primary \n     issue of discrimination.\n       We believe that a better way is to express our disapproval \n     of Sutton and Toyota (along with the current EEOC regulation) \n     is to retain the words ``substantially limits,'' but clarify \n     that it is not meant to be a demanding standard. In addition, \n     we believe eliminating the source of the Supreme Court's \n     decisions narrowing the definition and providing more \n     appropriate findings and purposes for properly construing \n     that definition will accomplish our goal without introducing \n     novel statutory terms.\n       We believe that the manner in which we understood the \n     intended scope of ``substantially limits'' in 1990 continues \n     to capture our sense of the appropriate level of coverage\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\n     under this law for purposes of placing on employers and other \n     covered entities the obligation of providing reasonable \n     accommodations and modifications to individuals with \n     impairments. As we described this in our committee report to \n     the original ADA in 1989:\n       ``A person is considered an individual with a disability \n     for purposes of the first prong of the definition when [one \n     or more of] the individual's important life activities are \n     restricted as to the conditions, manner, or duration under \n     which they can be performed in comparison to most people. A \n     person who can walk for 10 miles continuously is not \n     substantially limited in walking merely because on the \n     eleventh mile, he or she begins to experience pain because \n     most people would not be able to walk eleven miles without \n     experiencing some discomfort.'' S. Rep. No. 101-116, at 23 \n     (1989).\n       We particularly believe that this test, which articulated \n     an analysis that considered whether a person's activities are \n     limited in condition, duration and manner, is a useful one. \n     We reiterate that using the correct standard--one that is \n     lower than the strict or demanding standard created by the \n     Supreme Court in Toyota--will make the disability \n     determination an appropriate threshold issue but not an \n     onerous burden for those seeking accommodations or \n     modifications. At the same time, plaintiffs should not be \n     constrained from offering evidence needed to establish that \n     their impairment is substantially limiting.15\n       Thus, we believe that the term ``substantially limits'' as \n     construed consistently with the findings and purposes of this \n     legislation establishes an appropriate functionality test for \n     determining whether an individual has a disability.\n     Major life activities\n       The bill provides significant new guidance and \n     clarification on the subject of major life activities. First, \n     a rule of construction clarifies that that an impairment need \n     only substantially limit one major life activity to be \n     considered a disability under the ADA. This responds to and \n     corrects those courts that have required individuals to show \n     that an impairment substantially limits more than one life \n     activity. It is additionally intended to clarify that the \n     ability to perform one or more particular tasks within a \n     broad category of activities does not preclude coverage under \n     the ADA.\\16\\\n       For purposes of clarity, the bill provides an illustrative \n     list of ``major life activities'' including activities such \n     as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, \n     hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, \n     bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, \n     concentrating, thinking, communicating and working. In \n     addition, for the first time, the category of ``major life \n     activities'' is defined to include the operation of major \n     bodily functions, thus better addressing chronic impairments \n     that can be substantially limiting. Major bodily functions \n     include functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, \n     digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, \n     circulatory, endocrine and reproductive functions.\\17\\\n       Both the list of major life activities and major bodily \n     functions are illustrative and non-exhaustive, and the \n     absence of a particular life activity or bodily function from \n     the list does not create a negative implication as to whether \n     such activity or function constitutes a ``major life \n     activity'' under the statute.\n       Finally, we also want to illuminate one area which may be \n     easily misunderstood, with respect to individuals with \n     specific learning disabilities. When considering the \n     condition, manner, or duration in which an individual with a \n     specific learning disability performs a major life activity, \n     it is critical to reject the assumption that an individual \n     who has performed well academically cannot be substantially \n     limited in activities such as learning, reading, writing, \n     thinking, or speaking.\n     Rules of construction on the definition of disability\n       The bill further clarifies the definition of disability \n     with a series of rules of construction. As discussed \n     elsewhere, the rules of construction specifically require \n     that the definition of disability be interpreted broadly and \n     that the term ``substantially limits'' be interpreted \n     consistent with this legislation. This construction is \n     also intended to reinforce the general rule that civil \n     rights statutes must be broadly construed to achieve their \n     remedial purpose. In addition, the rules of construction \n     provide that impairments that are episodic or in remission \n     be assessed in their active state for purposes of \n     determining coverage under the ADA.\n     Mitigating measures\n       The bill also prohibits consideration of the ameliorative \n     effects of mitigating measures when determining whether an \n     individual's impairment substantially limits major life \n     activities, overturning the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Sutton and its companion cases. This provision is intended to \n     eliminate the situation created under current law in which \n     impairments that are mitigated do not constitute disabilities \n     but are the basis for discrimination. We expect that when \n     such mitigating measures are ignored, some individuals \n     previously found not disabled will now be able to claim the \n     ADA's protection against discrimination.\n       The legislation provides an illustrative but non-\n     comprehensive list of the types of mitigating measures that \n     are not to be considered. This list also includes low vision \n     devices, which are devices that magnify, enhance, or \n     otherwise augment a visual image, such as magnifiers, closed \n     circuit television, larger-print items, and instruments that \n     provide voice instructions. The absence of any particular \n     mitigating measure from this list should not convey a \n     negative implication as to whether the measure is a \n     mitigating measure under the ADA.\n       We also believe that an individual with an impairment that \n     substantially limits a major life activity should not be \n     penalized when seeking protection under the ADA simply \n     because he or she managed their own adaptive strategies or \n     received accommodations (including informal or undocumented \n     ones) that have the effect of lessening the deleterious \n     impacts of their disability.\n       The bill provides one exception to the rule on mitigating \n     measures, specifying that ordinary eyeglasses and contact \n     lenses are to be considered in determining whether a person \n     has a disability. The rationale behind this exception is that \n     the use of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses, without \n     more, is not significant enough to warrant protection under \n     the ADA. Nevertheless, if an applicant or employee is faced \n     with a qualification standard that requires uncorrected \n     vision (as the sisters in the Sutton case were), an employer \n     will be required to demonstrate that the qualification \n     standard is job-related and consistent with business \n     necessity.\n     Regarded as\n       Under this bill, the third prong of the disability \n     definition will apply to impairments, not only to \n     disabilities. As such, it does not require a functional test \n     to determine whether an impairment substantially limits a \n     major life activity.\n       This section of the definition of disability was meant to \n     express our understanding that unfounded concerns, mistaken \n     beliefs, fears, myths, or prejudice about disabilities are \n     often just as disabling as actual impairments, and our \n     corresponding desire to prohibit discrimination founded on \n     such perceptions. In 1990 we relied extensively on the \n     reasoning of School Board of Nassau County v. Arline\\18\\ \n     that the negative reactions of others are just as \n     disabling as the actual impact of an impairment. This \n     legislation restates our reliance on the broad views \n     enunciated in that decision and we believe that courts \n     should continue to rely on this standard.\n       We intend and believe that the fact that an individual was \n     discriminated against because of a perceived or actual \n     impairment is sufficient. Thus, the bill clarifies that \n     contrary to Sutton, an individual who is ``regarded as having \n     such an impairment'' is not subject to a functional test. If \n     an individual establishes that he or she was subjected to an \n     action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or \n     perceived impairment--whether the person actually has the \n     impairment or whether the impairment constitutes a \n     disability--then the individual will qualify for protection \n     under the Act.\n       This provision is subject to two important limitations. \n     First, individuals with impairments that are transitory and \n     minor are excluded from eligibility for the protections of \n     the ADA under this prong of the definition, and second, the \n     bill relieves entities covered under the ADA from the \n     obligation and responsibility to provide reasonable \n     accommodations and reasonable modifications to an individual \n     who qualifies for coverage under the ADA solely by being \n     ``regarded as'' disabled.\n     Transitory and minor\n       The bill contains an exception that clarifies that coverage \n     for individuals under the ``regarded as'' prong is not \n     available where an individual's impairment is both transitory \n     (six months or less) and minor. Providing this exception \n     responds to concerns raised by employer organizations and is \n     reasonable under the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition \n     because individuals seeking coverage under this prong need \n     not meet the functional limitation requirement contained in \n     the first two prongs of the definition. A similar exception \n     for the first two prongs of the definition is unnecessary as \n     the functional limitation requirement already excludes claims \n     by individuals with ailments that are minor and short term.\n     Accommodations\n       The bill establishes that entities covered under the ADA do \n     not need to provide reasonable accommodations under Title I \n     or modify policies, practices, or procedures under Titles II \n     or III when an individual qualifies for coverage under the \n     ADA solely by being ``regarded as'' having a disability under \n     the third prong of the definition of disability.\n       Under current law, a number of courts have required \n     employers to provide reasonable accommodations for \n     individuals who are covered solely under the ``regarded as'' \n     prong.\\19\\ In each of those cases, the plaintiffs were found \n     not to be covered under the first prong of the definition \n     of disability because of the overly stringent manner in \n     which the courts had been interpreting that prong. Because \n     of our strong belief that accommodating individuals with \n     disabilities is a key goal of the ADA, some members \n     continue to have reservations about this provision. \n     However, we believe it is an acceptable compromise given \n     our strong expectation that such individuals would now be \n     covered under the first prong of the definition, properly \n     applied.\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\n               Discrimination On The Basis Of Disability\n\n       The bill amends Section 102 of the ADA to mirror the \n     structure of nondiscrimination protection provision in Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It changes the language \n     from prohibiting discrimination against a qualified \n     individual ``with a disability because of the disability of \n     such individual'' to prohibiting discrimination against a \n     qualified individual ``on the basis of disability.'' This \n     ensures that the emphasis in questions of disability \n     discrimination is properly on the critical inquiry of whether \n     a qualified person has been discriminated against on the \n     basis of disability, and not unduly focused on the \n     preliminary question of whether a particular person is a \n     ``person with a disability.''\n\n\n                         Rules of Construction\n\n     Benefits under state worker's compensation laws\n       The bill provides that nothing in the Act alters the \n     standards for determining eligibility for benefits under \n     State worker's compensation laws or other Federal or State \n     disability benefit programs.\n     Fundamental alteration\n       The bill reiterates that no changes are being made to the \n     underlying ADA provision that no accommodations or \n     modifications in policies are required when a covered entity \n     can demonstrate that making such modifications would \n     fundamentally alter the nature of the service being provided. \n     This provision was included at the request of the higher \n     education community and specifically includes ``academic \n     requirements in postsecondary education'' among the types of \n     policies, practices, and procedures that may be shown to be \n     fundamentally altered by the requested modification or \n     accommodation to reaffirm current law. It is included solely \n     to provide assurances that the bill does not alter current \n     law with regard to the obligations of academic institutions \n     under the ADA, which we believe is already demonstrated in \n     case law on this topic. Specifically, the reference to \n     academic standards in postsecondary education is unrelated \n     to the purpose of this legislation and should be given no \n     meaning in interpreting the definition of disability.\n     Claims of no disability\n       The bill prohibits reverse discrimination claims by \n     disallowing claims based on the lack of disability, (e.g., a \n     claim by someone without a disability that someone with a \n     disability was treated more favorably by, for example, being \n     granted a reasonable accommodation or modification to \n     services or programs). Our intent is to clarify that a person \n     without a disability does not have the right under the Act to \n     bring an action against an entity on the grounds that he or \n     she was discriminated against ``on the basis of disability'' \n     (i.e., on the basis of not having a disability).\n\n\n                          Regulatory Authority\n\n       In Sutton, the Supreme Court stated that ``[n]o agency . . \n     . has been given authority to issue regulations implementing \n     the generally applicable provisions of the ADA which fall \n     outside Titles I-V.'' \\20\\ The bill clarifies that the \n     authority to issue regulations is granted to the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission, the Attorney General, and \n     the Secretary of Transportation and specifically includes the \n     authority to issue regulations implementing the definition of \n     disability as amended and clarified by this legislation.\n       We anticipate that the agencies charged with regulatory \n     authority under the ADA will make any necessary modifications \n     to their regulations to reflect the changes and \n     clarifications embodied in the ADA Amendments Act, including \n     the addition of major bodily functions as major life \n     activities and the broadening of the ``regarded as'' prong. \n     We also expect that the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission (EEOC) will revise the portion of its ADA \n     regulations that defines ``substantially limits'' as ``unable \n     to perform a major life activity. . . . or significantly \n     restricted as to . . . particular major life activity. . . \n     .'' given the clear inconsistency of that portion of the \n     regulation with the intent of this legislation.\n\n\n                          Conforming Amendment\n\n       The bill ensures that the definition of disability in \n     Section 7 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which shares the \n     same definition, is consistent with the ADA. The \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 preceded the ADA in providing \n     civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities, \n     and in drafting the definition of disability in the ADA, the \n     authors relied on the statute and implementing regulations of \n     the Rehabilitation Act. Maintaining uniform definitions in \n     the two federal statutes is important so that such entities \n     will generally operate under one consistent standard, and the \n     civil rights of individuals with disabilities will be \n     protected in all settings. The ADA, under Title II and Title \n     III, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provide \n     overlapping coverage for many entities, including public \n     schools, institutions of higher education, childcare \n     facilities, and other entities receiving federal funds.\n       We expect that the Secretary of Education will promulgate \n     new regulations related to the definition of disability to be \n     consistent with those issued by the Attorney General under \n     this Act. We believe that other current regulations issued by \n     the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights under \n     Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are currently \n     harmonious with Congressional intent under both the ADA and \n     the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       We intend that that the sum of these changes will make the \n     threshold definition of disability in the ADA--under which \n     individuals qualify for protection from discrimination--more \n     generous, and will result in the coverage of some individuals \n     who were previously excluded from those protections.\n       We note that with the changes made by the ADA Amendments \n     Act, courts will have to address whether an impairment \n     constitutes a disability under the first and second, but not \n     the third, prong of the definition of disability. The \n     functional limitation imposed by an impairment is irrelevant \n     to the third ``regarded as'' prong.\n       In general, individuals may find it easier to establish \n     disability under this bill's more generous standard than \n     under the Supreme Court's demanding standard. To repeat, we \n     intend this bill to return the legal analysis to the balance \n     that existed before the Supreme Court's Sutton and Toyota \n     decisions. The determination of disability is a necessary \n     threshold issue in many cases, but an appropriately generous \n     standard on that issue will allow courts to focus primarily \n     on whether discrimination has occurred or accommodations \n     improperly refused.\\21\\\n\n              IV. Legislative History and Committee Action\n\n       Prior to introduction of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 on \n     July 31, 2008 with 55 original cosponsors the following \n     actions occurred in the 110th Congress.\n       On July 26, 2007, Senator Tom Harkin introduced S. 1881, \n     the ADA Restoration Act of 2007 together with Senator Arlen \n     Specter. Senator Edward Kennedy, the Chairman of the Senate \n     Heath, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee cosponsored \n     the legislation along with Senator Ted Stevens. The bill was \n     referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n     Committee.\n       Similarly, on July 26, 2007, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer \n     (D-MD) and F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) introduced H.R. \n     3195, the ADA Restoration Act of 2007, with 144 original \n     cosponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committees on \n     Education and Labor, Judiciary, Transportation and \n     Infrastructure, and Energy and Commerce.\n       On October 4, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee held a \n     hearing on H.R. 3195. Six witnesses appeared before the \n     committee: Honorable Steny Hoyer (D-MD), House Majority \n     Leader; Cheryl Sensenbrenner, Chair of the Board, American \n     Association of People with Disabilities; Stephen Orr, \n     Pharmacist (Plaintiff in Orr v. Wal-Mart); Michael Collins, \n     Executive Director, National Council on Disability; Lawrence \n     Lorber, Attorney, on behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; \n     Chai Feldblum, Director, Federal Legislation Clinic and \n     Professor of Law, Georgetown Law Center.\n       On November 15, 2007, the Senate HELP Committee held a \n     hearing chaired by Senator Tom Harkin, ``Restoring \n     Congressional Intent and Protections under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act.'' Five witnesses appeared before the \n     committee: John D. Kemp, President, United States \n     International Council on Disabilities; Dick Thornburgh, \n     Former United States Attorney General and Counsel, \n     Kirkpatrick & Lockhart; Stephen Orr, Pharmacist (Plaintiff in \n     Orr v. Wal-Mart), Camille Olson, Labor and Employment \n     Attorney, Seyfarth & Shaw; Chai Feldblum, Director, Federal \n     Legislation Clinic and Professor of Law, Georgetown Law \n     Center.\n       On January 29, 2008, the House Committee on Education and \n     Labor held a hearing on H.R. 3195. Five witnesses appeared \n     before the committee: Honorable Steny Hoyer (D-MD), House \n     Majority Leader; Andrew Imparato, President and CEO, American \n     Association of People with Disabilities; Carey McClure, \n     Electrician (Plaintiff in McClure v. General Motors); Robert \n     L. Burgdorf, Professor of Law, University of the District of \n     Columbia; David K. Fram, Director, ADA & EEO Services, \n     National Employment Law Institute.\n       On June 18, 2008, the House Committee on Education and \n     Labor held a markup to consider H.R. 3195. An amendment was \n     offered as a substitute to the original bill, and it was \n     reported out of the Committee by a vote of 43 to 1.\n       On June 18, 2008, the Committee on the Judiciary held a \n     markup to consider H.R. 3195. An amendment was offered as a \n     substitute to the original bill, and it was reported out of \n     the Committee by a vote of 27 to 0.\n       On June 25, 2008 the United States House of Representatives \n     held a vote on H.R. 3195 and passed the legislation by a vote \n     of 402-17.\n       On July 15, 2008, the Senate HELP Committee held a \n     Roundtable: ``H.R. 3195 and Determining the Proper Scope of \n     Coverage for the Americans with Disabilities Act.'' Eight \n     individuals gave testimony before the committee: Samuel R. \n     Bagenstos, Professor of Law, Washington University School of \n     Law; Carey McClure, Electrician (Plaintiff in McClure v. \n     General Motors); JoAnne Simon, Disability Rights Attorney; \n     Sue Gamm, Elementary and Secondary Education Consultant; \n     Terry Hartle, Senior Vice President, American Council on \n     Education; Chai Feldblum, Professor, Federal Legislation \n     Clinic, Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, DC; \n     Michael Eastman, Executive Director of Labor Policy, U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce; Andrew Grossman, Senior Legal Policy \n     Analyst, Heritage Foundation.\n       On July 31, 2008 Senators Tom Harkin and Orrin Hatch \n     introduced S. 3406, The ADA\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n     Amendments Act of 2008. The bill was placed on the Senate \n     calendar (under general orders/pursuant to Rule XVI?).\n\n          V. Application of the Law to the Legislative Branch\n\n       Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104-1, the Congressional \n     Accountability Act (CAA), requires a description of the \n     application of this bill to the legislative branch. S. 3604 \n     does not amend any act that applies to the legislative \n     branch.\n\n                    VI. Regulatory Impact Statement\n\n       The managers have determined that the bill may result in \n     some additional paperwork, time, and costs to the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission, which would be entrusted \n     with implementation and enforcement of the act. It is \n     difficult to estimate the volume of additional paperwork \n     necessity by the bill, but the committee does not believe it \n     will be significant. Pursuant to the requirements of \n     paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the committee has determined that the bill will not \n     have a significant regulatory impact.\n\n                    VII. Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title. This Act may be cited as the ``ADA \n     Amendments Act of 2008.''\n       Sec. 2. Findings and Purposes. Acknowledges Congressional \n     intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) \n     to ``provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for \n     the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \n     disabilities'' and to provide broad coverage, and that the \n     U.S. Supreme Court subsequently erroneously narrowed the \n     definition of disability in a series of cases. The purposes \n     of the Act are to reinstate a broad scope of protection to be \n     available under the ADA, to reject several Supreme Court \n     decisions, and to re-establish original Congressional intent \n     related to the definition of disability.\n       Sec. 3. Codified Findings. Amends one finding in the ADA to \n     acknowledge that many people with physical or mental \n     impairments have been subjected to discrimination, and \n     strikes one finding related to describing the population of \n     individuals with disabilities as ``a discrete and insular \n     minority.''\n       Sec. 4. Disability Defined and Rules of Construction. \n     Amends the definition of ``disability'' and provides rules of \n     construction for applying the definition. The term \n     ``disability'' is defined to mean, with respect to an \n     individual, a physical or mental impairment that \n     substantially limits one or more major life activities, a \n     record of such impairment, or being regarded as having such \n     an impairment.; provides an illustrative list of `major life \n     activities' including major bodily functions; and defines \n     `regarded as having such an impairment' as protecting \n     individuals who have been subject to an action prohibited \n     under the ADA because of an actual or perceived impairment, \n     whether or not the impairment is perceived to limit a major \n     life activity. Requires the definition of disability to be \n     construed broadly and consistent with the findings and \n     purposes. Provides rules of construction regarding the \n     definition of disability, requiring that impairments need \n     only limit one major life activity; clarifying an \n     impairment that is episodic or in remission is a \n     disability if it would substantially limit a major life \n     activity when active; and prohibiting the consideration of \n     the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such as \n     medication, learned behavioral modifications, or auxiliary \n     aids or services, in determining whether an impairment is \n     substantially limiting, while excluding ordinary \n     eyeglasses and contact lenses.\n       Sec. 5. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability. \n     Prohibits discrimination under Title I of the ADA ``on the \n     basis of disability'' rather than ``against a qualified \n     individual with a disability because of the disability of \n     such individual.'' Clarifies that covered entities that use \n     qualification standards based on uncorrected vision must show \n     that such a requirement is job-related and consistent with \n     business necessity.\n       Sec. 6. Rules of Construction. Provides that nothing in \n     this Act alters the standards for determining eligibility for \n     benefits under State worker's compensation laws or other \n     disability benefit programs. Prohibits reverse discrimination \n     claims by disallowing claims based on the lack of disability. \n     Provides that nothing in this Act alters the provision in \n     Title III that a modification of policies or practices is not \n     required if it fundamentally alters the nature of the service \n     being provided. Establishes that entities covered under all \n     three titles of the ADA are not required to provide \n     reasonable accommodations or modifications to an individual \n     who meets the definition of disability only as a person \n     ``regarded as having such an impairment.'' Authorizes the \n     EEOC, Attorney General, and the Secretary of Transportation \n     to promulgate regulations implementing the definition of \n     disability and rules of construction related to the \n     definition.\n       Sec. 7. Conforming Amendments. Amends Section 7 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to cross-reference the definition \n     of disability under the ADA.\n       Sec. 8. Effective date. Amendments made by the Act take \n     effect January 1, 2009.\n       September 11, 2008.\n     Tom Harkin,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Orrin Hatch,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n                                Endnotes\n\n       1. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101.\n       2. This rule of construction is consistent with earlier \n     judicial precedents and parallels the rule of construction in \n     the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, \n     which Congress unanimously passed in 2002.\n       3. Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, \n     534 U.S. 184 (2002).\n       4. Id. at 197.\n       5. Id. at 198. See also, 29 CFR 1630.2.\n       6. Sutton v. United Airlines, 527 U.S. 471 (1999).\n       7. Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 527 U.S. 516 \n     (1999), Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U.S. 555 \n     (1999).\n       8. Ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses are excluded from \n     this prohibition.\n       9. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794. Sections 501 and 503 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act also use the same definition of disability \n     and prohibit disability discrimination by federal employees \n     and federal contractors, respectively. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 791, 793. Note that the definition of disability is \n     found in Section 705(20)(B).\n       10. This bill does not change any current statutory \n     requirement that an individual must be qualified to perform \n     the essential functions of the job.\n       11. 42 U.S.C. 12101.\n       12. The bill's purposes include rejecting the holding in \n     Toyota that in order for an impairment to be substantially \n     limiting, the impairment must ``prevent or severely restrict \n     the individual from doing activities that are of central \n     importance to most people's lives.''\n       13. 28 CFR Sec. 36.104; 29 CFR Sec. 1630.2(h) (1)-(2); 34 \n     CFR Sec. 104.3(j)(2)(i).\n       14. We have chosen not to adopt the House's term \n     ``materially restricts'' or the House Committees' use of a \n     range or spectrum of severity to define ``materially \n     restricts'' because we are concerned both by the lack of \n     clarity in the terms ``material'' ``moderate'' and ``severe'' \n     and because we believe that such terms encourage the courts \n     to engage in an inappropriate level of scrutiny as to the \n     severity of an impairment when determining whether an \n     individual has a disability.\n       15. Under the first prong, of course, a plaintiff must \n     still provide evidence that that his or her impairment is \n     substantially limiting.\n       16. See Holt v. Grand Lake Mental Health Center, Inc., 443 \n     F. 3d 762 (10th Cir. 2006) holding an individual with \n     cerebral palsy who could not independently perform certain \n     specified manual tasks was not substantially limited in her \n     ability to perform a ``broad range'' of manual tasks.\n       17. We expect that this illustrative list of major life \n     activities (including major bodily functions), in combination \n     with the rejection of both the ``demanding standard'' in \n     Toyota and the consideration of mitigating measure in the \n     Sutton trilogy will make it easier for individuals to show \n     that they are eligible for the ADA's protections under the \n     first prong of the definition of disability. While it is \n     impossible to predict the type of cases that will be brought \n     following passage of this bill, we would expect that the bill \n     will make it easier for individuals in cases like the \n     following to qualify for the protections of the ADA--\n     Littleton v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, 231 Fed. Appx. 874 (11th \n     Cir. 2007) (individual with intellectual disability); Furnish \n     v.

The following courts have held that the ADA requires \n     that reasonable accommodations be provided to individuals who \n     are able to establish coverage under the ADA under the \n     ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of disability: Kelly \n     v.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for requesting my input on the energy crisis. I \n     found out several years ago that energy prices were going to \n     skyrocket due to the imminent peaking of oil production (and \n     natural gas) worldwide. I read every book on the subject of \n     the coming energy crisis such as ``Twilight in the Desert'', \n     ``The Party's Over'', ``The Long Emergency'', ``Big Coal'', \n     ``Powerdown'', and probably 15 others. I read most every \n     relevant news story as collected by www.energybulletin.net.\n       I have heard the pleas from Al Gore, Bill Clinton, Matt \n     Simmons, Rep. (R) Roscoe Bartlett (Maryland) and many other \n     prominent Americans who want our citizens to know the truth \n     about Peak Oil Theory, and the implications of a global peak \n     and inevitable decline in production.\n       I have since sold my car, my house, and am living with \n     massive inflation, food and gasoline shortages, and likely \n     economic collapse in mind. I am growing a large garden this \n     year and riding my bicycle(s) most everywhere. I have met \n     with local leaders, including Boise Mayor Dave Bieter, to \n     talk about real solutions, and have written letters to the \n     editor of the Idaho Statesman monthly.\n       We need to grow most all of our own food locally, produce \n     and distribute most goods locally, and keep people employed \n     doing things to create and expand our new localized economy. \n     We need to accept that our population will decline due to \n     lowering food production. We need to know that the era of \n     high consumption, personal automobiles, travel, and \n     technology is coming to a close. People must understand that \n     in 100 years our planet will sustain perhaps 1 billion \n     people, living primarily an agrarian existence, without \n     technology.\n       If the people remain in the dark about our true future, \n     there are unspeakable dangers. Dictatorship in America, \n     nuclear confrontations over resources, and rioting are \n     likely. Please help to inform the American public now.\n     Bob, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the email telling us of your position on the \n     energy crunch (and thank you for opposing that climate change \n     legislation). I am all in favor of developing alternative \n     energy sources, such as biodiesel, and in expanding our \n     refinery capacity for conventional petroleum fuels. I \n     heartily support tapping the petroleum resources we have here \n     in the United States and, from all that I have heard, we have \n     (or can soon develop) the technology to do it with less harm \n     to the environment. I understand that Congressman Chris \n     Cannon of Utah is making efforts to develop oil shale fields \n     that are located under Utah, Colorado and Wyoming. I support \n     this and hope that you will uphold these efforts if \n     corresponding legislation reaches the Senate. I also support \n     conservation incentives that would encourage companies to \n     come up with more environmentally friendly methods of \n     developing these resources.\n       I support expanding our use of nuclear energy. My \n     understanding is that the popular fears of nuclear power \n     plants are largely based on myth. And most of the ``waste'' \n     produced is either relatively benign, or can be recycled or \n     reused. If federal regulations were changed so that all \n     radioactive byproducts did not have to be shipped to a \n     nuclear waste repository, we would have plenty of space in \n     places like Yucca Mountain. Apparently, only 2% of byproducts \n     from nuclear reactors really need to be taken to such \n     facilities. As an aside, France produces 80% of its \n     electricity from nuclear power. What in the world is holding \n     us back from building more nuclear power plants?\n       Please do whatever you can to bring about changes at the \n     federal level so that the private sector can go to work \n     developing technologies and resources to solve our growing \n     energy problems. I agree that we are ``too dependent on \n     petroleum,'' and that we are ``far too dependent on foreign \n     sources of that petroleum.'' We must move forward in availing \n     ourselves of the resources we have. We should do so in an \n     environmentally conscientious manner, yes, but we must move \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n     Blake, Hamer.\n                                  ____\n\n       A few years ago I needed to re-do a roof. I considered \n     solar panels and energy conservation devices. It added a lot \n     of costs, but I thought that it would be worthwhile if I \n     could get a bit of a tax break. I contacted the state, power \n     company, gas company, and checked the Internet for federal \n     tax breaks. There weren't any for individuals. The lady with \n     the state simply stated that ``they do not do things that \n     way.'' I felt this was short-sighted at the time, and, as \n     things are now, my opinion seems to be correct. I do not \n     foresee a turn around any time soon. Why does not the \n     legislature encourage the gas and power companies to offer \n     incentives? Why does not the state or federal legislatures \n     offer tax incentives to individuals instead of to major \n     corporations?\n       The engine that drove America to its current prominence is \n     the creativeness and industry of the every day American. \n     Release it! Encourage people to come up with their own energy \n     saving ideas and devices. At least, stop blocking individual \n     efforts that are attempted by easing legal restrictions. \n     America's and Idaho's energy companies and legislatures have \n     created barriers to individual ingenuity. It is not in their \n     respective interests to encourage such action. I feel that \n     this is short-sighted at this time, but I expect more of the \n     same. Until the economic pain of the individual is shared by \n     the existing energy corporation executives and current \n     legislators, little more than lip service can be expected. \n     Some have said that gas at $5/gallon would wake us all up and \n     cause change to occur. The fallacy in this logic is that the \n     $5/gallon is increased profits and corporations seldom \n     discourage profit. There is economic pain all right, but the \n     pain is not felt by the folks who initiate changes.\n       Here is a radical proposal: Remove the existing corporate \n     tax benefits related to oil and some other energy \n     corporations. (Windfall profits are possible, but I am not \n     recommending them.) Offer the same amount as tax benefits to \n     individuals. These can be in the form of worthwhile \n     individual energy grants and can be emergency economic tax \n     credits in places like the Midwest. You are probably aware \n     that there have been significant floods in the Midwest. You \n     are probably aware that this is expected to affect the cost \n     of food and fuel adversely. This will result in the same type \n     of economic pain as the current ``Gas Crisis''. The fund \n     might be an ``Economic Crisis'' fund. I have little doubt \n     that there are many other economic crises that will occur.\n       The engine of America is in need of maintenance. This \n     maintenance is needed at the individual level. The Economic \n     Crisis fund can provide for maintenance, and some \n     improvements. Once the engine of America stops running, the \n     entire world is going to see some real economic pain. Some of \n     the most short sighted world leaders will transfer this \n     economic pain into other kinds of pain. Somebody else will be \n     blamed and punitive action started.\n       Here is another consideration. Some say that the cost of \n     gas is based on speculation. If this is true, a disincentive \n     can easily be added to dampen speculative zeal in the form of \n     capital gains taxes. There are long and short term capital \n     gains. Let us add another class that would penalize \n     speculation. Extend long term capital gains taxes to five \n     years. This will allow reasoned investments. Keep the tax \n     rate on these low. Speculators are usually short term. Raise \n     the tax rate on the speculation profits. No doubt there will \n     be howls, but then there will be an adjustment, and the \n     overall effect could be that market manipulation is \n     discouraged while prudent or targeted investment is \n     encouraged. The tax code would also need to be amended.\n     Kelly.\n                                  ____\n\n       We would like to express our concern over Congress's \n     reluctance to address the energy problem. Rather than blaming \n     oil companies for making an 8\\1/2\\% profit, you should all be \n     blaming yourselves for your lack of foresight. The law of \n     supply and demand is well understood out here, but Washington \n     does not seem to grasp it. Drill . . . off-shore, ANWR, coal-\n     to-oil, nuclear, solar, wind, shale oil. In short, go to work \n     on the problem instead talking it to death. Immediately lift \n     your restrictions on drilling here.\n       Our propane went from $124 every three weeks last winter, \n     to $227 this spring. We are broke. Between my physical \n     inability to work, (but not disabled enough to draw \n     disability), my husband's $10 an hr. job, our mortgage, \n     utilities, transportation costs, property taxes, auto \n     licenses, home owner's insurance, medical insurance, and auto \n     insurance, we now find ourselves with no grocery money. Our \n     daughter, tax rebates, unexpected refund of medical \n     overpayment, (God), have fed us the first half of this year.\n       Tell your colleagues that there are real people out here \n     that do not make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, (of \n     course, if we could set our own wages, we would), but try to \n     live on a gross of $20,000 a year.\n       We, our friends, relatives and neighbors are beginning to \n     suffer. This is the first time in many years that we have had \n     to worry about our next week's groceries. We are agonizing \n     over whether to drop our medical coverage, but that is so \n     frightening.\n       Thank you for listening.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles and Wanda.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your support in trying to keep our gas prices \n     down. Thank you also for trying to utilize energy sources \n     here in America.\n       We are disability retired and taking care of my 90-year-old \n     father. Of course you are aware that gas prices are driving \n     the cost of everything else up. It is difficult to make our\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\n     fixed income stretch through the entire month. We only drive \n     when absolutely necessary for doctor's appointments and \n     shopping. If we forget something at the store, then we go \n     without until the next time. It cost $51.00 to fill our tank \n     in our mid-size car last time. The thought of gas reaching \n     $6.00 or even $8.00 per gallon makes us wonder how we will \n     possibly pay for it. We do not have bus service in Hayden, \n     and being disabled are unable to walk to the nearest store \n     which is a couple of miles away.\n       We plead with Congress to help us and the many that are in \n     the same situation! Hopefully, Republicans will not sustain \n     too great a loss in the upcoming election so they can push \n     for a sensible domestic energy policy.\n       We are wondering if you support Newt Gingrich's ``Drill \n     Here. Drill Now. Pay Less.'' proposal? Hopefully so.\n       Thank you.\n           Respectfully,\n     Mike and Mary.\n                                  ____\n\n       This Congress has a terrible record when it comes to \n     sensible solutions to our energy problem!\n       This [current] Congress has failed miserably to address the \n     real problems we the public face and instead wasted time \n     investigating horse racing and drugs in sports or anything \n     else [that provides easy publicity]. Many [conservatives] are \n     also failing miserably and voting for (the wrong) politics \n     over principle in misguided attempts to hang on to their \n     jobs: earmarks come to mind here as well as voting with the \n     [majority] and for special interest groups that are against \n     solving our energy problems using our own abundant resources. \n     We need to get rid of these people FAST so that somebody that \n     really represents us can get on with solving the problem!\n       As I see it, with all major potential sources of domestic \n     oil now legally ``off limits'' to exploration; with \n     refineries effectively prevented from increasing their \n     capacities; with nuclear plants unable to expand and increase \n     because they are prevented from safely storing their waste; \n     with our monstrous quantities of coal, clean or otherwise, on \n     the verge of being banned; with heavily-subsidized corn-based \n     ethanol now a major reason for the world-wide food crisis, \n     Congress needs to call a ``time out'' and take a good look at \n     what they're doing to our country! It is not something that \n     can continue or ``our way of life'' as we know it will end! \n     And if it does, the party identified as making it happen will \n     find itself at an end too! At some point, I expect to see our \n     country experience the kind of public protests becoming \n     common elsewhere around the world, and with elections coming \n     up shortly, the means will be readily at hand to make \n     whatever changes we need. I vote, and I am really looking at \n     the candidates voting records closely this time.\n     Fred, Priest River.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am grateful for this opportunity to explain to you how \n     the high gas prices are affecting me. I am a 23-year-old \n     senior in college from the Burley area. I came home this \n     summer and got a job as a pizza deliverer, therefore the \n     amount I make depends a lot on the price of gasoline, because \n     as the cost of gasoline rises that is less money that is \n     available for me to set aside for college. Since I came back \n     to Burley in the end of April, I have seen the price of gas \n     at the cheapest gas station in town jump from $3.369 to \n     $3.959 tonight as I drove home from work. In nearly two \n     months on the job, my fuel expenses have almost exceeded \n     $400.\n       I pay for college myself, with the assistance of some \n     academic scholarships. I do not qualify for government aid. I \n     did not qualify for the recent tax rebate. And I have made a \n     goal to earn my undergraduate degree without taking out a \n     loan because, in this unstable economy, I do not want to have \n     that added albatross when I go to buy a house and start my \n     family. I am not asking for a handout, or a loan or even a \n     tax cut (though, admittedly, that would be nice). I am a hard \n     worker, and I can make it through college without incurring \n     one cent's worth of debt if the government would make a \n     sensible energy policy that kept prices at the pump \n     reasonable. What I am afraid is that most members of \n     Congress, and especially the leadership, do not understand \n     that rising gas prices affect lower income families and \n     individuals like I the most. Do they not see that the entire \n     $150 billion tax rebate will likely be used to cover the \n     increased price of energy? The net economic benefit of the \n     tax rebate is being pumped into our cars and burned. Fiery \n     rhetoric about record profits in the oil industry may get \n     some people angry, but does it really do any good? What \n     assurance do I get that the price of gas will drop if \n     Congress taxes the oil industry more? What's more, what \n     assurance can you give me that the price will not increase as \n     the oil companies pass the tax on to me? Some also suggest \n     that we raise the miles per gallon standards on cars. That \n     sounds good to me, but I cannot afford to buy a brand new \n     Prius, much less a brand new anything. Some also say we \n     should increase nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and wind power, \n     all sentiments that I agree with. But, forgive my \n     ignorance if I fail to see how building nuclear plants, \n     dams, windmills or solar panels increase the oil supply. \n     None of those options helps me at the pump. I still end up \n     paying the high price of gas.\n       My feelings on how to solve the current energy crisis can \n     be summed up with the title of Speaker Newt Gingrich \n     nationwide petition drive: ``Drill Here. Drill Now. Pay \n     Less.'' which more than 800,000 Americans have signed to \n     date. My plea, Senator Crapo, is that you stand up for the \n     people like me and demand we open our coasts for drilling, \n     open the ANWR for drilling, open the Rocky Mountains for \n     drilling. I know we can do it in an environmentally friendly \n     way. We are the United States, the greatest, most powerful \n     nation on earth. Nothing is impossible for us. My \n     grandparents and great-grandparents lived through a \n     Depression, which dwarfed the current economic crisis. I want \n     to have faith in my country that our generation will meet \n     this issue head on. I have heard people say we cannot drill \n     ourselves out of the crisis. But I fail to see how doing \n     nothing to increase domestic oil production solves the \n     problem either. If a college student who struggled through \n     Economics 101 understands that the bulk of this issue is a \n     supply problem, what does that say about the lack of economic \n     prowess on display by a majority of Congress? Perhaps an \n     equitable solution for both sides would be to write a bill \n     that opens the ANWR and at the same time releases half of the \n     strategic oil reserve. That would have the immediate effect \n     of lowering gas prices and a longer term effect of increased \n     supply. Can both sides agree to something like that?\n     Jared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8846-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8846-S8847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very concerned that one of Africa's \nmost gruesome and longstanding conflicts is once again falling off the \nradar screen of this Congress and this administration. For 22 years, \nnorthern Uganda has been caught in a war between the Ugandan military \nand rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army, leading at its height to the \ndisplacement of 1.8 million people, nearly 90 percent of the region's \npopulation. Just a few years ago, an estimated 1,000 people were dying \neach week in squalid camps, and northern Uganda was called the world's \nworst neglected humanitarian crisis. The rebels for their part are \nreviled across the world for their horrific brutality. Over the course \nof the conflict, they have reportedly abducted more than 66,000 \nchildren, forcing them into sexual slavery or child soldiering.\n  In March of 2007, the Senate passed a resolution I introduced \nrecognizing this crisis and calling on the administration to support \nthe ongoing peace negotiations. These negotiations--which began in 2006 \nin Juba, Southern Sudan, and were mediated by the Government of \nSouthern Sudan--brought a cessation of hostilities and offered the best \nopportunity in a decade to bring an end to the war. At the urging of \nthis Congress and thousands of concerned Americans, the State \nDepartment finally appointed a senior diplomat to coordinate U.S. \nsupport for this peace process. That diplomat, Tim Shortley, played a \ncrucial role over the last year in moving the negotiations forward. In \nMarch 2008, the parties reached an agreement that was one of the most \ncomprehensive of its kind, including provisions for truth-telling, \ndisarmament and demobilization, reconciliation and accountability.\n  Unfortunately, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army--LRA--Joseph \nKony, has refused to sign the agreement. Far more disturbing, his \nrebels now operating almost entirely outside Uganda and instead in the \nborder region between Central African Republic, Congo, and Southern \nSudan have resumed attacks and abducting children. They are easily \nexploiting the region's porous borders and ungoverned spaces a problem \nwhich, in my view, constitutes a threat to international peace and \nsecurity. Yet rather than intensify efforts to engage and pressure Kony \nto accept the agreement, the United States and others in the \ninternational community have downscaled our efforts. Instead of \nmustering the tremendous resources at our disposal to press the rebels \nto accept a political solution, we have turned our attention elsewhere \nagain.\n  As a result, there is now a haphazard military operation underway to \ncontain the rebels by the Congolese military a force not known for its \nsuccess in defeating armed groups or for respecting civilians caught in \nthe crossfire. Yes, the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Congo, known by its \nFrench acronym MONUC, is supporting the Congolese military, but MONUC \nis already overwhelmed by its inability to fully address its primary \ntask: controlling the persistent violence in the eastern Congo. I \nvisited that region last summer and it is a region desperately in need \nof greater security. Without expanded resources and capacity focused\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\non this problem, a completely new offensive runs a high risk of \nexacerbating the region's volatility rather than addressing it. We have \nseen too many times in this part of the world how rash and \nuncoordinated ``military solutions'' have fueled the flames of conflict \nand generated new political grievances.\n  This is not to say that security measures aren't needed to protect \ncivilians in the region and thereby bring permanent peace to eastern \nCongo and northern Uganda. They are. Until we are able to build the \ncapacity of national and regional institutions, the LRA and other armed \ngroups will continue to exploit the region's borders and wreak havoc \nthroughout these four countries. We need more inter-agency \ncollaboration to consider how we can bolster sustainable long-term \ncivilian protection mechanisms, while in the meantime devising creative \nshort-term strategies to help fill the gaps.\n  The calm brought by the Juba peace process presented an unprecedented \nopportunity in this conflict's history to rebuild northern Uganda's \ninstitutions, which is the surest safeguard against future violence and \ninstability. I fear that this opportunity is being squandered. Since \nthe cessation of hostilities was signed two years ago, nearly half of \nthe people displaced have returned to their original homes and begun to \nrestore their livelihoods. However, this process has increasingly been \nfraught with problems. The lack of access to basic services in the \nvillages and transit sites, such as clean water, health care and \neducation, has broken up families and hindered recovery. The lack of a \ncapable and competent police force and judiciary has left women and \ngirls vulnerable to sexual violence. Finally, the lack of programs to \naddress underlying grievances and psychosocial trauma has allowed \ntensions to fester.\n  Responsibility for managing northern Uganda's transition lies first \nand foremost with the Government of Uganda. I realize that the \ngovernment has limited capacity, but it seems there has been a distinct \nlack of high-level leadership. In October 2007, the Ugandan government \nlaunched a three-year $600-million recovery plan for the war-torn \nregion, but that plan has been mired in confusion. Its partial \nimplementation only began 2 months ago. Moreover, there continues to be \na lack of coordination between the government, donors, U.N. agencies \nand non-governmental organizations. I urge the Ugandan government to \nshow leadership at the highest levels and demonstrate its willingness \nto fulfill the promises it made to the people of northern Uganda over \nthe last year.\n  If the Ugandan government leads and takes measures to prevent \ncorruption, the international community should back it up with the \nnecessary financial and technical support. To signal that commitment, I \ncall on the administration to help convene a high-level conference of \nUganda donors. Such a conference can coordinate an effective donor \nstrategy to support recovery efforts and hold the Ugandan government \naccountable. This conference, though, must only be the beginning of \nreinvigorated institutional engagement by this administration and the \nnext to bring this conflict to its conclusion, which is finally in \nsight after 22 years. Let us make it clear once and for all that the \nUnited States is resolved to see peace secured in northern Uganda.\n  Too often this Administration has leapfrogged from one crisis to \nanother in Africa, trying to put out fires but not addressing the \nunderlying factors driving these conflicts. This is not a result of \nlack of interest or dedication from our diplomats, for I have seen \nfirst-hand their resourcefulness and hard work. But the reality is that \nthe State Department's Africa Bureau is overwhelmed and under \nresourced. For places like northern Uganda or eastern Congo or the \nNiger Delta, we do not have the personnel or on-the-ground presence to \nrespond comprehensively to insecurity. We in Congress must give greater \nattention in the coming months and years to ensuring our diplomats have \nthe resources they need to operate in these neglected conflict areas. \nHowever, that process begins with us committing to these places, not \njust whenever they hit the headlines but because they are important to \nour collective security and to basic American principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8847-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8847-S8848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two Vermonters who \nrepresented their country this summer in China. Everyone at one time or \nanother has heard the Mark Twain quote, ``It's not the size of the dog \nin the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.'' Nothing embodies \nthis adage to me more than the commendable determination of this year's \nVermont summer Olympians. Vermonters have always stood as an example of \nwhat a good hard day's work can accomplish, and this summer in Beijing \nwas no exception. In a world of more than 6.5 billion people, our great \nState of 610,000 creates world class athletes that stand out against \nthe crowd.\n  Representing Vermont on the U.S. Women's Weightlifting Team was \nCarissa Gump, originally of Essex. Ever since her middle school gym \nteacher first convinced her to pursue weightlifting, her dedication has \nbrought her success. One of only two U.S. women competing in her weight \nclass, Carissa was able to finish an impressive fifth in her group and \nthirteenth overall. Showing off her Vermont bred toughness, she managed \nto complete every one of her lifts all while nursing an aggravating \nleft wrist injury. From reading Carissa's online blog, anyone can also \nlearn about her amazing and loving family. Her parents, Kathie and \nMarty, and her husband Jason took time away from work to fly to Beijing \nwith Carissa and give her their support. This inspiring display of \nheart truly embodied Vermont's Olympic spirit and I would like to join \nwith her family and friends in commending Carissa's remarkable \nachievement.\n  On the track, the Men's 800 meters featured Norwich native Andrew \nWheating. Andrew has become a regular in the national headlines ever \nsince he finished second in the U.S. Olympic Trials and earned a ticket \nto represent his country in Beijing. Currently a sophomore at the \nUniversity of Oregon and the only Vermonter to run a 4-minute-mile, \nAndrew has already established himself as one of the sport's rising \nyoung talents. The son of Betsy and Justin Wheating, Andrew not only \nshowcased his talent to the world, he also realized a longtime family \ndream. Justin Wheating as a standout athlete in his home country of \nEngland never had a chance to represent his country in an Olympic \ngames. However, Mr. Wheating managed to pass the torch to an \nexceptional son who Vermont is proud to call one of our own and \nAndrew's thrilling performance in these Olympic quarterfinals showed \nthe world why. With all of the success and accolades this young man has \nalready accumulated, there is no doubt in my mind that he has a very \nbright future ahead of him.\n  In a place historically famous for its winter athletes, these \nexceptional competitors just further prove it is impossible to pigeon \nhole our great State. For those of you who enjoy skiing Vermont in the \nwinter, perhaps it is time to come see why we call them the ``Green \nMountains'' next summer? The extraordinary displays of speed and power \nby these Vermonters on the world's largest stage perfectly showcased \nour diverse range of talent and I want to thank Carissa and Andrew for \nmaking their State and country proud.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 10 \noutstanding Hoosier athletes who represented the State of Indiana and \nall of the United States in the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing, \nChina.\n  Lloy Ball, a volleyball player from Fort Wayne; David Boudia, a diver \nfrom Noblesville; Amber Campbell, a track and field athlete from \nIndianapolis; Lauren Cheney, a soccer player from Indianapolis; LeRoy \nDixon, a track and field athlete from South Bend; Mary Beth Dunnichay, \na diver from Elwood; Thomas Finchum, a diver from Indianapolis; David \nNeville, a track and field athlete from Merrillville; Samantha Peszek, \na gymnast from Indianapolis; and Bridget Sloan, a gymnast from \nPittsboro, all represented the Hoosier State as members of Team USA.\n  This Olympiad is the first for many of the Hoosier athletes; others \nhave donned the colors of Team USA before. This year, Lloy Ball, a \nmember of the\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\nU.S. men's volleyball team, became the first male athlete from the \nUnited States to compete in four Olympic Games. Lloy's incredible feat \nwill forever be part of Indiana and Olympic sports history, and I know \nour entire State is immensely proud to count him among our own.\n  These Hoosiers have shown superior abilities, extraordinary work \nethics, and unflappable determination in their quests to become Olympic \nathletes. The road to the pinnacle of athletic success has required \nthousands of hours of demanding training over years of preparation, yet \nthese athletes show us that commitment to excellence truly has its \nrewards. For many of our Hoosier athletes, the spoils of their hard \nwork and dedication came in the form of an Olympic medal. Lloy Ball and \nthe men's volleyball team brought home a gold medal, as did Lauren \nCheney and the women's soccer team. David Neville won the bronze medal \nin the 400 meter final, and Samantha Peszek and Bridget Sloan were \nawarded the silver medal with their teammates on the women's gymnastics \nteam.\n  These 10 athletes traveled halfway around the globe to compete \nagainst the worlds' finest, and brought with them the unwavering \nsupport of their fellow Hoosiers. The people of Indiana are fortunate \nto have had such an exceptional group representing us at the Olympic \nGames.\n  Team USA represents the best America has to offer, and these Hoosiers \nhave made our State and our country proud.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, the Olympic Games has always been a time \nfor the world to celebrate the triumph of the human spirit and personal \nqualities that determine excellence: discipline, commitment and a \npositive, winning attitude. Athletes from all over the world bring \npride to their countries, friends and family during the Olympic Games. \nMost importantly, they achieve the distinction that can come when an \nindividual applies determination and hard work to develop a God-given \ntalent. Motivated to get up early, often before work, to pound the \npavement, ride the roads and trails, shoot baskets, hit balls, lift \nweights or swim laps, these women and men are committed to improving \ntheir strength, agility, speed and stamina. I am especially proud of \nthe Idahoans who competed in the 2008 Olympics, representing their \nteams, their Nation and their families with skill and pride.\n  As you may know, Boise resident Kristin Armstrong won the gold in the \nwomen's cycling time trial. Kristin is well known around the Boise \narea: many have seen her cycling or at the local YMCA where she is an \ninstructor. She is an inspiration to those who know her and she has \nmade Idaho proud. Bishop Kelly High School graduate Nick Symmonds \nadvanced to the preliminary round in the 800 meter run. Georgia Gould, \na one-time Ketchum resident competed in the women's mountain bike race. \nTeam USA also included Idahoans: Matt Brown, a graduate of Coeur \nd'Alene High School, played third baseman for Team USA in baseball. \nDebbie McDonald, from Hailey, competed for Team USA in dressage. \nIdahoans excelled on teams from other nations as well. Clare \nBodensteiner, a graduate of Minico High School, played for the New \nZealand basketball team. Angela Whyte, a former University of Idaho \nrunner and now assistant coach competed for Canada in the 100 meter \nhurdles and, Joachim Olsen, also a University of Idaho athlete, \ncompeted in the shot put for Denmark. Emerson Frostad, a former Lewis-\nClark State College baseball player played for Team Canada as a \ncatcher/first baseman. Eric Matthias, a Boise resident and in graduate \nschool at Boise State University, competed for the British Virgin \nIslands in the discus throw.\n  And in the Paralympics--the second-largest sporting event in the \nworld after the Olympics--that are concluding in Beijing this week, \nIdaho native Barbara Buchan took the gold in the 3,000 meter cycling \nevent. Barbara was the 1972 high school mile run State champion from \nMountain Home High School and went on to graduate from Boise State \nUniversity. She was severely injured in a cycling accident in 1982, \nsuffering almost fatal wounds. In addition to terrible physical \ninjuries, she was in a coma for 2 months and had surgery to remove the \ndamaged parts of her brain. After years of physical and mental \nrehabilitation, Barbara came back, her passion for cycling unchanged. A \nfive-time Paralympics competitor at 52 years old, Barbara embodies the \nOlympic spirit.\n  To all these courageous, gifted and dedicated Idaho athletes, I offer \nmy heartfelt congratulations for a job well done. You continue to make \nIdaho proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8848-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleagues of \nmy request to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement that would \nallow for the consideration of S. 3325, the Enforcement of Intellectual \nProperty Rights Act of 2008. I intend to reserve my right to object to \nany such request.\n  S. 3325 was marked up by the Judiciary Committee just last Thursday \nafternoon. I circulated several amendments to address a number of \nconcerns I had about the bill. Two of my amendments--one that would add \nUSDA to the list of agencies on the IPEC Advisory Committee, and \nanother that would provide for an orderly transition from NIPLECC to \nIPEC--were adopted by the committee. However, I withheld from offering \nother amendments because I received a commitment that the chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee would work with me to address \nmy other concerns.\n  For example, I have concerns with the funding of the new State and \nlocal law enforcement grant programs in section 501 and the grant match \nratio for those programs. Further, I have concerns with the creation of \na new intellectual property crimes unit at the FBI to enforce \nintellectual property rights and the authorization of additional \nfunding, resources and staff for the FBI to implement these additional \nresponsibilities. I firmly believe that the FBI should focus its \nefforts on combating terrorism. I am concerned about duplication with \nwork currently being performed at ICE and its National Intellectual \nProperty Rights Coordination Center. Moreover, I am concerned with \nlanguage calling for the prioritization of cases involving foreign \ncontrolled companies, and the lack of any priority for cases \ninvestigated by the FBI that have a nexis to potential terrorist \nactivities.\n  My staff will be sitting down with the chairman and ranking member's \nstaff to work on my concerns. Again, I intend to reserve my right to \nobject to proceeding to the consideration of S. 3325 until my concerns \nhave been addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8848-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8848-S8849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     BURLINGTON COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

This \nschool is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nit is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves. \nThe district also received a total of $64,189 from two fire safety \ngrants. The federal grants have made it possible for the district to \nprovide quality and safe schools for their students.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration and governance in \nthe Shenandoah Community School District. In particular I would like to \nrecognize the leadership of the board of education--Marty Maher, Dr. \nMargaret Brady, Brian Maxine, Dwight Mayer and Keith Meyer. I would \nalso like to recognize superintendant Richard Profit as well as former \nboard members--Ken Lee, Roger Jones and Steve Berning and former \nsuperintendent Connie Maxson.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities. We have got to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Shenandoah Community School District. There is no question that a \nquality public education for every child is a top priority in that \ncommunity. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new school \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8850-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SOUTH PAGE COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

The district also received a $50,000 fire safety grant that \nwas used to replace and repair exit lighting and smoke detectors.

When a soldier serves overseas, his or her family and \nfriends must assume additional responsibilities and sacrifices. Thanks \nto the work of Tammy, and the family\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\nreadiness group, South Dakota National Guard families are provided with \nan extended network of support and resources to help them through their \ntime apart. Among her many tasks, Tammy maintains the telephone tree, \npublishes newsletters, provides baked goods to soldiers at monthly \ndrills, organizes family events, and prepares families for possible \ndeployments. Countless lives have been touched by her efforts.\n  Tammy is dedicated and committed to her volunteer work; she has been \nthe family readiness group leader for the past 11 years. She was \nrecently recognized for her efforts when she was presented with the \nAMVETS PNC John S. Lorec National Guard Volunteer of the Year award at \nthe National Guard Family Program conference in St. Louis, MO.\n  I am pleased that Tammy's efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated with this prestigious award. I applaud her for her years of \nhard work. Tammy's work in our communities and State is a testament to \nher selfless service to our country. Tammy's efforts on behalf of all \nthose that are currently serving in the National Guard are a shining \nexample of patriotism, and we can all be inspired by her dedication and \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8851-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF UNIVERSITY OF SIOUX FALLS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n125th anniversary of the founding of University of Sioux Falls. Over \nthe course of its history, USF has continuously produced extraordinary \ngraduates with a Christian liberal arts education. In the modern, high-\ntech, and competitive environment in which we live, USF students are \nequipped with the skills that are essential for success.\n  In education, technology, and research, USF is at the forefront of \nacademic and cultural achievement, with enrollment now at 1,700 and a \ndiverse student body from over 20 States. For 125 years, the university \nhas helped students realize their potential by offering them a quality \neducation and a positive social and religious environment. USF \ngraduates are well-equipped to succeed in a competitive world, \ndelivering countless benefits to organizations and communities close to \nhome and around the globe.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the University of Sioux \nFalls for its 125 years of outstanding service. I strongly commend \ntheir hard work and dedication, and I am very pleased that their \nsubstantial efforts are being publicly honored and celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8851-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO RICK AND KATHY CLARKE\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to honor two great \nOklahomans, Rick and Kathy Clarke, who are in Washington, DC, for the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's annual Angels in \nAdoption Gala. I was pleased to select Rick and Kathy as 2008 Angels in \nAdoption because of their great commitment to adoption at both a \npersonal and professional level.\n  When Rick Clarke served for 5 years as a judge in juvenile court, \nworking with abused and neglected children every day, both he and his \nwife, Kathy, formed a desire to help children who are most in need--\nthose without families. Today, Rick dedicates part of law practice to \nadoption cases. He serves as a volunteer attorney through Tulsa Lawyers \nfor Children, as a guardian ad litem through court appointments, and is \non the board of Heritage Family Services, a Tulsa-based adoption \nagency. Kathy has served as a Court Appointed Special Advocate for \nchildren. She also currently works on special education issues and is a \nmember of the PTA.\n  However, it is this family's personal story that sets it apart. The \nClarkes have personally participated in the adoption process for 13 \nyears and have adopted nine children. Throughout these years, the \nClarke family has faced tragedies, hardships, and obstacles. Yet they \ncontinue to grow as a family, both in number and in character.\n  The Clarke's first adopted child was a 3-year-old boy from Oklahoma. \nThe next two young children joined the family from Russia after being \ndiagnosed with medical complications. The Clarkes later adopted three \nunrelated girls--aged 15, 13, and 8--through Oklahoma Department of \nHuman Services. Lastly, they provided homes to two sisters from Liberia \nand an older boy from Ethiopia.\n  The faith and perseverance of Rick and Kathy Clarke enables them to \novercome the challenges of providing a permanent and loving home to so \nmany children. Remaining steadfast in their dedication and belief that \nGod has a special plan for every child, Rick and Kathy have raised each \nof their nine children to be productive, healthy, and strong leaders in \ntheir schools and communities.\n  The Clarkes truly represent the blessings and the power of adoption. \nI am pleased to congratulate Rick and Kathy Clarke, Oklahoma's 2008 \nAngels in Adoption, and to welcome them to our Nation's Capital for \nthis special honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8851-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HAROLD O. BOURNE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, several weeks back I had the great \npleasure of visiting with a constituent I would like to honor today. \nMilwaukee resident Harold O. Bourne recently received the Federal \nAviation Administration's Wright Brothers Master Pilot award for flying \n50 years without incident.\n  Mr. Bourne has given much to his country over the years. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Army in 1951, entered flight school in 1953 and served one \ntour in Korea, two tours in Germany and two tours in Vietnam. In 1980, \nafter 30 years of service he retired from the Army as a lieutenant \ncolonel and master army aviator. Upon his retirement, he moved to \nMilwaukee where his love for and expertise in aviation was put to good \nuse. Mr. Bourne embarked on what would become a 20-year career with \nAstronautics Corporation of America, a world leader in supplying \nmilitary and commercial electronics for aviation.\n  At 78, Mr. Bourne is still flying. He is a gentleman in the truest \nsense of the word. Harold and his wife of 57 years, Anne, have given \nmuch of themselves over the years, not only to aviation but to their \ncommunity and their church. And for that I congratulate and honor \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8851-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8851-S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK MILLAR\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I congratulate Mark Millar on \nreceiving the 2008 Angels in Adoption Award, a tremendous honor that \nhighlights his tireless commitment to achieving permanent family \nconnections for children in foster care in Maine. What a well-deserved \naccolade for such an ennobling endeavor.\n  Mark Millar began his career as a protective services worker and has \nbeen a critical part of Casey Family Services in Portland for more than \n20 years. In that time, he and his dedicated staff have helped \ntransform the lives of countless families, by promoting kinship care, \nproviding counseling and other services to strengthen families \npostadoption, and helping Maine reduce the amount of time required to \nreach legal permanence when a child enters foster care.\n  Undoubtedly, we as a nation can and must do more to better equip \nfamilies who sacrifice so much to provide safe, loving homes for \nchildren in foster care. For many families, the decision to open their \nhome to a child is easy, but it can also be emotionally trying and \nfinancially taxing. That's why Mark Millar's work at Casey Family \nServices is so indispensable and profoundly worthy of this distinction. \nAt a time where Federal dollars for child welfare services are \nregrettably too few, Mark Millar and Casey Family Services offer \nfamilies a support system that is dependable and viable.\n  Mark Millar has also performed remarkable work in helping teens \nprepare for the challenges of adulthood, whether though his efforts \nwith the First Jobs program, which provides initial and transitional \nemployment opportunities at Hannaford for youth aged 15-21, or Casey's \noutdoor work-readiness and skill development program. And he has been \nselfless in his extraordinary contributions and inspiring through the \npower of his benevolent example. In short, Mark understands and lives \nout what American novelist, Herman Melville, once eloquently described \nin words . . . ``We\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\ncannot live for ourselves alone. Our lives are connected by a thousand \ninvisible threads, and along these sympathetic fibers, our actions run \nas causes and return to us as results.''\n  Championing the cause of children and garnering tangible results that \neffect the everyday lives of many Mainers are the true measure of \nMark's phenomenal trajectory of accomplishment in helping others. And \nso, we couldn't be more grateful to Mark for what has given and \ncontinues to give back to Maine, and I couldn't be more pleased about \nthis tribute bestowed upon him which is a fitting recognition of all he \nhas achieved on behalf of all whom he has served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8852-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JACK VAN DER GEEST\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize the 85th birthday \nof Jack van der Geest of Rapid City, SD. A native of the Netherlands \nand author of ``Was God on Vacation?'', Jack's life story is a heroic \ndepiction of courage and the willingness to act against the evils that \nthreaten our world and our freedoms.\n  Born in the Netherlands in 1923, Jack's younger years witnessed the \nhorrifying and devastating effect of Nazi Germany in Europe. Jack \nendured many trials and tribulations after the Nazis invaded his \nhomeland in 1940; however, none of them would prove to break Jack's \nspirit of perseverance. After his capture, Jack's resilience served him \nwell as he became one of only eight prisoners to escape from the \nBuchenwald concentration camp.\n  Following Jack's escape from terror in the heart of Nazi Germany, he \nfurther pledged his services to fight the Nazi occupation throughout \nEurope. Jack joined the French Underground and helped Allied \nparatroopers escape capture in Vichy, France. Soon after, Jack arrived \nin England where he became an interpreter for the storied 101st \nAirborne. Jack eventually immigrated to America and became a United \nStates citizen in 1953.\n  In 1995, Jack authored the book ``Was God on Vacation?'', an \nautobiography of his life during World War II. This astonishing work \ngives an in-depth account of Jack's struggles and endeavors from 1940-\n1947. Jack's testimony truly shines a light on the persecution and \nchallenges many Europeans endured during World War II and how some \nfought dearly to repel the Nazi aggressors. The story of Jack van der \nGeest reminds us to never take for granted the freedoms that so many \nhave fought for in our armed services and around the world.\n  I would like to send my heartfelt congratulations to Jack on his 85th \nbirthday and thank him for telling his story and allowing us all to \nnever forget how fortunate we are to be free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8852-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING ARMOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. THUNE.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3493. A bill to require rail carriers to develop positive rail \ncontrol system plans for improving railroad safety and to increase the \ncivil penalties for railroad safety violations; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I make these remarks on behalf of my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Boxer. She and I are cosponsoring \nlegislation, which I will send to the desk at the end of my remarks.\n  On Friday, at 4:30 p.m., a Union Pacific freight train and a \nMetrolink commuter train, loaded with 225 commuters, leaving Los \nAngeles and traveling north through the San Fernando Valley, in the \nChatsworth area, collided on a single track. The collision took place \nat about 40 miles an hour for each train. The engine of the Metrolink \ntrain was rammed two-thirds through the first car of the Metrolink \ntrain. Here it is. Here is the Union Pacific engine and this mess is \nthe Metrolink engine and it rammed two-thirds through the first car. \nThus far, 26 people are dead. Some were dismembered by the crash, some \nbodies had to be removed in a dismembered state from the train. There \nare 138 people in the hospital, 40 of them in critical condition, and \nmore deaths could well take place.\n  This accident happened because of a resistance in the railroad \ncommunity in America to utilizing existing technology to produce a \nfail-safe control of trains to avoid colliding with each other and to \navoid one train from crashing into the rear of another. Both of these \nhave happened in the past. Yet today there is no requirement for a safe \ncontrol of track and train.\n  The House has passed a bill reauthorizing the Federal Railroad \nAdministration. The Senate has passed a bill reauthorizing the Federal \nRailroad Administration. They both have provisions, although they are \ndifferent, for safe train control in these bills. But nothing has \nhappened. The bills have not been conferenced. This must stop.\n  Let me point out for a minute how positive train control works. Every \ntrain's position is tracked through global positioning, which is new \ntechnology that can monitor its location and speed. These systems \nconstantly watch for excessive speed, improperly aligned switches, \nwhether trains are on the wrong track, unauthorized train movements, \nand whether trains have missed signals to slow or stop. Each train also \nhas equipment on board that can take over from the engineer if the \ntrain doesn't comply with the safety signals. The system will override \nthe engineer and automatically put on the brakes. These systems exist \nand are in use today. They are in place in the Chicago-Detroit corridor \nand in the Northeast corridor. But the railroad industry resists them.\n  I believe rail in America has a very real future. California believes \nit has a very real future. As a matter of fact, in 5 weeks, California \nhas on the ballot a $10 billion bond issue to create a high-speed rail \nspine down the center of California that runs from Sacramento all the \nway down to Los Angeles. Now, people aren't going to ride these trains \nunless they know they are safe, and we have an obligation, I believe, \nto provide that safety.\n  I am sorry to have to say this, but southern California has the most \nhigh-risk track in America. The majority of Metrolink's 388 miles of \ntrack, which crosses six counties, believe it or not, is shared with \nfreight trains. This is untenable.\n  Let me ask a question: How can you put commuter trains, passenger \ntrains, on the same track as freight trains going in opposite \ndirections with nothing more than a couple of signals that can be \nmissed, and have been missed, to avert disaster?\n  Again, over the years, the railroad resisted, saying these systems \nare too expensive. Well, how expensive is the loss of human life? The \ncost of any system doesn't come close to the cost of the lives that \nwere lost this past Friday and that will likely be lost in the future.\n  To date, positive train control has been put to use only in limited \nareas, including, as I said, parts of the Northeast and Chicago and \nDetroit. Nine railroads in at least 16 States have these positive \ncontrol projects, but California is not one of them. Why, I ask. It is \ncritical, particularly when--given the element of human error, which we \nmay well see in this instance--it may well have been a cell phone that \nwas in use at the time of the accident by the engineer.\n  Let me tell you what sort of hours this engineer works. He works 5 \ndays a week, and it is an 11-hour day. It is a split shift of 15 hours. \nLet me explain. He is due at work at 6 in the morning. He works until \nlate morning, and then he has 4 hours off but returns to work from 3 \np.m. to 9 p.m. That is an 11-hour day in an engine on high alert in \nmajor populated areas. He performs a critical function, and he does it \non an 11-hour workday on a split shift. I think that is untenable.\n  The NTSB, the National Transportation Safety Board, has pushed again \nand again for positive train control systems, particularly after a \ndeadly crash in my own State in Orange County in 2002. Three people \ndied and two hundred sixty were injured. In the Orange County crash, \nthe National Transportation Safety Board concluded that a Burlington \nNorthern engineer and a conductor were talking to each other. They \nfailed to see a yellow warning light telling them to slow down. I think \nthat same thing has happened again. Their freight train slammed into a \nMetrolink commuter train that had stopped on the same track.\n  Now, we know that positive, or safe, train control would prevent 40 \nto 60 accidents a year, 7 fatalities, and 55 injuries a year. So why \nhasn't it been put in place? I actually believe it is negligence, and I \nwill even go as far to say I believe it is criminal negligence not to \ndo so.\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\n  The report also concluded that positive train control could have \nprevented a fatal collision in Graniteville, SC, in 2005. In this \naccident, a rail employee failed to properly align a track switch. As a \nresult, several cars derailed, deadly chlorine gases escaped, and nine \npeople died.\n  Cost is used as the reason not to do this, but I ask: How can we \nafford not to do it, whatever the cost? How many accidents does it \ntake? How many deaths does it take? How many injuries does it take? \nExperts estimate that the cost is about $2.3 billion to install safe, \ntechnological train controls on 100,000 miles of track around the \nUnited States--high priority track.\n  Today, my colleague, Senator Boxer, and I are introducing legislation \nwhich takes the strongest parts of the House and Senate bills and beefs \nthem up. This legislation would require positive safe train controls \nfor major freight and passenger lines. By 2012, areas declared as high \nrisk by the Department of Transportation must run with positive train \ncontrol systems. Railroads would be required to develop plans to \nimplement these controls within 1 year of enactment of the legislation. \nThese plans must be submitted to the Secretary of Transportation also \nwithin 1 year of enactment. It sets a deadline of December 31, 2014, \nfor safe rail control to be in place on all major freight and passenger \nlines in America. It would be mandatory, and it would require penalties \nfor noncompliance, with fines of up to $100,000 per violation.\n  Passenger rail will not succeed in this country unless public safety \nis guaranteed. Again, on Friday, these trains hit at 40 miles per hour. \nWhat happens when trains pile into each other at 120 miles per hour?\n  I have asked the majority leader to include this in the continuing \nresolution. I don't know whether he will--I think it is a remote \npossibility--but I do believe we need to get this moving right now.\n  Once again, look at this. When we know there is global positioning \nthat can be in place to shut down the freight train and the passenger \ntrain before they run into each other and we do nothing about it, then \nI believe this body is also culpable and negligent.\n  Mr. President, if I might, I send this legislation to the desk with a \nplea that it be enacted right away, with a plea that we get the \nplanning moving, with a plea that we get 100,000 miles of high-priority \ntrack equipped with global positioning so this never again can happen \nin a high-priority passenger-freight train area where the trains are \ntraveling on the same track. If we don't do it, it is going to happen \nagain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Obama, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 3498.

EXTENSION OF EXEMPTION.\n\n       Section 3503(a) of title 46, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``2008'' and inserting ``2018''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3501. A bill to ensure that Congress is notified when the \nDepartment of Justice determines that the Executive Branch is not bound \nby a statute; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with the \nsenior Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, the OLC Reporting \nAct of 2008. In short, the bill would require the Attorney General to \nreport to Congress when the Department of Justice issues a legal \nopinion concluding that the executive branch is not bound by a statute. \nAlong with the Executive Order Integrity Act of 2008, which I \nintroduced in July with the junior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator \nWhitehouse, this bill takes an important step toward curbing the \nexecutive branch's reliance on secret law.\n  The principle behind this bill is straightforward. It is a basic \ntenet of democratic government that the people have a right to know the \nlaw. The very notion of ``secret law'' has been described in court \nopinions and law treatises as ``repugnant'' and ``an abomination.'' \nThat's why the laws passed by Congress have historically been matters \nof public record.\n  But the law that applies in this country includes more than just \nstatutes. It includes regulations, the controlling legal \ninterpretations of the executive branch and the courts, and certain \nPresidential directives. As we learned at a hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Constitution Subcommittee that I chaired in April, this \nbody of executive and judicial law is increasingly being kept secret \nfrom the public, and too often from Congress as well. Perhaps the most \ntroubling recent example of secret law is the elaborate legal regime \nconstructed by DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel to justify controversial \nadministration policies that operate outside the framework of statutory \nlaw.\n  An opinion issued by OLC is not just a piece of legal advice, such as \nthe advice individuals or corporations might solicit from their \nlawyers. An OLC opinion binds the entire executive branch, just like \nthe ruling of a court. If a court were to reach a different \ninterpretation than OLC, the court's interpretation would prevail--but \nmany OLC opinions address matters that courts never have the chance to \ndecide. On those matters, OLC essentially steps into the role of the \ncourts as the final interpreter of the law. In the words of Jack \nGoldsmith, former head of OLC under President Bush: ``These executive \nbranch precedents are `law' for the executive branch.''\n  OLC opinions are ``law'' in another sense as well. Attorney General \nMukasey has stated that DOJ will not prosecute a government actor for \ncriminal conduct if he or she relied on an OLC opinion. Thus, even if a \ncourt overturns OLC's interpretation, the opinion may grant retroactive \nimmunity for past violations of the law--effectively amending the law \nthat existed at the time of the criminal act.\n  The Bush administration has relied heavily on secret OLC opinions in \na broad range of matters involving core constitutional rights and civil \nliberties. The administration's policies on interrogation of detainees \nwere justified by OLC opinions that were withheld from Congress and the \npublic for several years. The President's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram was justified by OLC opinions that, to this day, have been seen \nonly by a select few Members of Congress. And, when it was finally made \npublic this year, the March 2003 memorandum on torture written by John \nYoo was filled with references to other OLC memos that Congress and the \npublic have never seen--on subjects ranging from the Government's \nability to detain U.S. citizens without congressional authorization to \nthe Government's ability to operate outside the Fourth Amendment in \ndomestic military operations.\n  The few opinions whose content has been made public share a notable \ncharacteristic: the conclusion that various laws enacted by Congress do \nnot apply to the conduct of the executive branch. The 2003 Yoo torture \nmemo took the alarming position that the executive branch was not bound \nby the criminal statute prohibiting torture when interrogating \ndetainees. Likewise, according to congressional testimony of former OLC \nhead Steve Bradbury, the President's warrantless wiretapping program \nwas supported by OLC opinions claiming that the President's wiretapping \nauthority was not limited by the constraints of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. The titles of other OLC opinions \nreferenced in the Yoo memo strongly suggest that other statutory \nconstraints have been disposed of in a similar manner.\n  The secrecy of these opinions cannot be justified or explained away \nby a wholesale claim of privilege. To be sure, there are sound \narguments for shielding from public disclosure deliberations among OLC \nlawyers, as well as final OLC opinions that are not adopted as the \nbasis for an executive branch policy. But once a final OLC opinion is \nissued and adopted by an executive\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\nbranch agency or official, that opinion is no longer mere legal advice \nor a deliberative document--it is effectively the law. Indeed, in his \ntestimony before the Constitution Subcommittee in April, the Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General for OLC acknowledged that the \nconfidentiality interest in OLC opinions is ``completely different'' \nfor opinions that have been implemented as policy, and that such \nopinions should be made public ``as fast as possible.'' The Supreme \nCourt expressed the same sentiment in legal terms, holding that \n``opinions and interpretations which embody [an] agency's effective law \nand policy'' are not privileged, precisely because agencies otherwise \nwould be operating under ``secret law.''\n\n  There is an even stronger interest in disclosure when an OLC opinion \nconcludes that the executive branch is not bound by a Federal statute. \nIn such cases, the executive branch is no longer operating according to \nthe rules that are on the books, and there is truly a separate--and \nsometimes conflicting--regime of secret law. Moreover, Congress has an \nobvious institutional interest in knowing when DOJ opines that the \nexecutive branch is not bound by a statute, and the reasons for that \nopinion. If DOJ concludes that a statute is unconstitutional, Congress \nmay wish to challenge this position, or it may decide to simply rewrite \nthe law to avoid the perceived constitutional problem. Similarly, if \nDOJ concludes that Congress did not intend for a statute to apply to \nthe executive branch, then Congress should have the opportunity to \nassess this conclusion and revise the law if necessary to make its \nintent clear. None of this can happen when Congress is denied access to \nthe opinion.\n  Recognizing Congress's strong interest in knowing when DOJ takes \nissue with its enactments, current law requires the Attorney General to \nreport to Congress when DOJ decides that it will not enforce or defend \na statute because the statute is unconstitutional. This reporting \nprovision, however, does not reach situations in which OLC stops short \nof declaring a statute unconstitutional, and instead construes the \nstatute not to apply to the executive branch in order to avoid a \nfinding of unconstitutionality. At the hearing I chaired on secret law, \nDawn Johnsen, who served as the head of OLC for 2 years under President \nClinton, testified that the law should be amended to require reporting \nto Congress in these situations as well. Bradford Berenson, former \ncounsel to President Bush from 2001-2003, agreed with this modest \nproposal.\n  The bill that Senator Feinstein and I are introducing today grew out \nof this bipartisan agreement. It was drafted with the substantial \nassistance and input of Johnsen, Berenson, and an impressive group of \nsome of the finest attorneys to serve in OLC in past years, many of \nwhom are now constitutional scholars. The aim was to craft a targeted \nbill--one that would allow Congress to be sufficiently informed when \nOLC purports to release the executive branch from the strictures of a \nstatute, without encroaching on the institutional interests, \nprerogatives, and privileges of OLC. We took great pains to ensure that \nan appropriate balance of power was maintained between the legislative \nand executive branches. The result is an approach that is narrowly \ntailored and eminently reasonable.\n  The bill adds a new disclosure requirement to 28 U.S.C. 530D, the \nstatutory provision that requires the Attorney General to report to \nCongress if DOJ decides not to enforce or defend a statute on the \nground that it is unconstitutional. Under the bill, the Attorney \nGeneral must also report to Congress under four circumstances. These \ncircumstances represent the means by which OLC is most likely to exempt \nthe executive branch from the reach of a statute, in those areas where \nCongress has the greatest interest in knowing about it.\n  First, a report is required if DOJ issues an opinion that concludes \nthat a Federal statute is unconstitutional. Current law requires \nreporting only when DOJ decides not to defend or enforce a statute, \nwhich does not necessarily reach cases in which an agency policy \nconflicts with a statute but DOJ is not presented with the opportunity \nfor an enforcement action.\n  Second, a report is required if DOJ relies on the so-called \n``doctrine of constitutional avoidance'' and cites Article II or the \nseparation of powers--in other words, if DOJ determines that applying a \nstatute to executive branch officials would raise constitutional \nproblems. Regardless of the validity of this determination, the effect \nis to exempt executive branch officials from the statute's reach--a \nresult that Congress should know about.\n  Third, a report is required if DOJ relies on a ``legal presumption'' \nagainst applying a statute to the executive branch. For example, the \nYoo torture memo relied on the legal presumption that laws of general \napplicability, such as those prohibiting torture, do not apply to the \nconduct of the military during wartime. The criterion of a ``legal \npresumption'' serves to keep the reporting requirement narrowly \ntailored: it captures situations in which the executive branch is \nexempted from a statute categorically, without requiring reporting in \nmore run-of-the-mill cases where a particular executive action simply \ndoes not fall within the statute.\n  Fourth, a report is required if DOJ determines that a statute has \nbeen superseded by a later enactment, when the later enactment does \nexpressly say so. This provision would address situations like OLC's \nconclusion that the Authorization for Use of Military Force superseded \nthe constraints of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In such \ncases, reporting to Congress gives Congress the opportunity to clarify \nits intent.\n  These reporting requirements are accompanied by several provisions to \nensure scrupulous respect for executive privileges and prerogatives. \nThe Attorney General would not be required to disclose the OLC opinion \nitself, as long as the report to Congress includes the information \nalready required under 28 U.S.C. 530D whenever DOJ decides not to \nenforce or defend a statute--namely, a complete and detailed statement \nof the relevant issues and background. Furthermore, the bill leaves \nintact section 530D's provision allowing the Attorney General to \nexclude privileged information from the statement; the only information \nthat could not be excluded is the date of the opinion, the statute \nat issue, and which of the four reporting categories the opinion falls \nwithin. No report would be required if officials expressly declined to \nadopt or act on the opinion, thus protecting from disclosure opinions \nthat are truly advisory in nature.\n\n  The bill also protects the security of classified information. \nInformation that could harm the national security if disclosed publicly \ncould be provided to Congress in a classified annex. Classified \ninformation involving intelligence activities would be reported only to \nthe Intelligence and Judiciary Committees--or, under appropriate \ncircumstances, a more narrow ``Gang of Twelve,'' to parallel the more \nlimited disclosure provisions of the National Security Act.\n  The bill's targeted focus and careful preservation of executive \nprerogatives has earned it the support of former officials from both \nthe Clinton and Bush Administrations. Former head of OLC, Dawn Johnsen, \nand former counsel to President Bush, Bradford Berenson, have written a \njoint letter endorsing the bill. In their words: ``[W]e believe [the \nbill] strikes a sensible and constitutionally sound accommodation \nbetween the executive branch's need to have candid legal advice, to \nprotect national security information, and to avoid being overburdened \nby overly intrusive reporting requirements and the legislative branch's \nneed to know the manner in which its laws are interpreted.'' They write \nthat enacting this bill ``would have the effect of enhancing democratic \naccountability and the rule of law.'' I ask unanimous consent to place \nthis letter in the record along with my statement.\n  Of course, the bill does not represent a perfect or complete solution \nto the problem of secret law. For example, it would not reach the now-\ninfamous OLC conclusion that the infliction of pain does not constitute \n``torture'' unless it approaches the level associated with ``death, \norgan failure, or serious impairment of body functions''--an \ninterpretation that effectively exempted the executive branch from the \nfull scope of the anti-torture statute. Moreover, under the provisions \nof the bill allowing the Attorney General to withhold privileged \ninformation, Congress may\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\nwell be forced to operate under a significant informational handicap. \nNonetheless, the bill represents an important and necessary step toward \ncurbing secret law and restoring the proper balance of power between \nthe executive and legislative branches.\n  When OLC concludes that a statute passed by Congress does not bind \nthe executive branch, Congress has a right to know that the executive \nbranch is not operating under that statute, and to be apprised of the \nlaw under which the executive branch is operating. The bill I am \nintroducing with Senator Feinstein codifies that right. I urge all of \nmy colleagues in the Senate to support this common-sense measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: We write to convey \n     our strong support for ``The OLC Reporting Act of 2008,'' to \n     be introduced by Senator Feingold and Senator Feinstein. We \n     respectfully urge the committee to give the bill prompt and \n     serious consideration, because we believe that the addition \n     of the reporting requirement it would create would have the \n     effect of enhancing democratic accountability and the rule of \n     law.\n       We both had the privilege to testify before Senators \n     Feingold and Brownback, and the Subcommittee on the \n     Constitution of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, on \n     April 30, 2008 in a hearing that examined ``Secret Law and \n     the Threat to Democratic and Accountable Government.'' We \n     served in different administrations, Brad Berenson as \n     Associate Counsel to President George W. Bush and Dawn \n     Johnsen as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office \n     of Legal Counsel (OLC) under President Clinton. During our \n     testimony, we found ourselves in substantial agreement about \n     the desirability for new legislation that would require \n     reporting to Congress regarding a limited category of OLC \n     legal opinions.\n       As a general matter, we share a deep concern about \n     safeguarding the legitimate need for confidentiality in the \n     legal advice OLC provides to the President and others in the \n     executive branch, by power delegated by the Attorney General. \n     For example, in some instances national security information \n     must be protected. In other instances, such as where OLC \n     advises that a proposed action would be illegal, and that \n     advice is accepted, the prospect of immediate and routine \n     disclosure could deter executive branch officials from \n     seeking advice in the first place.\n       We agree, however, that Congress has a legitimate \n     legislative interest in receiving broader notice than current \n     law provides with respect to certain categories of OLC \n     opinions, which can generally be described as those in which \n     OLC relies on constitutionally based interpretive doctrines \n     to interpret a law in a way that might come as a surprise to \n     Congress. These include the doctrine of ``constitutional \n     avoidance,'' as well as implied repeals or modifications and \n     certain presumptions against applying statutes to the \n     executive branch officials. In our view, OLC opinions that \n     place substantial reliance on such doctrines present the \n     greatest potential for overreaching by the executive branch \n     and thus the greatest need for notification to Congress. If \n     Congress does not know about these interpretations, Congress \n     is unable to consider the possibility of legislative change \n     or clarification.\n       For this reason, after the hearing we worked closely with \n     Senate staff as well as with a group of other former \n     executive branch officials and Office of Legal Counsel \n     lawyers to help draft ``The OLC Reporting Act of 2008.'' The \n     resulting bill text was the product of careful consideration \n     and negotiation. The bill mandates reporting in a carefully \n     defined category of cases and includes appropriate provisions \n     to protect national security and privileged information. All \n     in all, we believe it strikes a sensible and constitutionally \n     sound balance between the executive branch's need to have \n     access to candid legal advice, to protect national security \n     information, and to avoid being overburdened by unduly \n     intrusive reporting requirements and the legislative branch's \n     need to know the manner in which its laws are interpreted. We \n     both endorse the bill as introduced and urge its prompt \n     enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brad Berenson,\n       Sidley Austin.\n     Dawn Johnsen,\n       Indiana University School of Law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8862-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 662--RAISING THE AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR CRIME \n PREVENTION IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND DESIGNATING THE WEEK \n   OF OCTOBER 2, 2008, THROUGH OCTOBER 4, 2008, AS ``CELEBRATE SAFE \n                           COMMUNITIES'' WEEK\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, and \nMs. Stabenow) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of Pakistan and the United States have a \n     long history of friendship and comity, and the vital \n     interests of both nations are well-served by strengthening \n     and deepening this friendship.\n       (2) In February 2008, the people of Pakistan elected a \n     civilian government, reversing months of political tension \n     and intrigue, as well as mounting popular concern over \n     governance and their own democratic reform and political \n     development.\n       (3) A democratic, moderate, modernizing Pakistan would \n     represent the wishes of that country's populace, and serve as \n     a model to other countries around the world.\n       (4) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, \n     and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban.\n       (5) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several \n     thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security \n     forces of Pakistan over the past 6 years.\n       (6) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, more \n     al Qaeda terrorist suspects have been apprehended in Pakistan \n     than in any other country, including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, \n     Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi.\n       (7) Despite the sacrifices and cooperation of the security \n     forces of Pakistan, the top leadership of al Qaeda, as well \n     as the leadership and rank-and-file of affiliated terrorist \n     groups, are believed to use Pakistan's Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas (FATA) as a haven and a base from which to \n     organize terrorist actions in Pakistan and with global reach.\n       (8) According to a Government Accountability Office Report, \n     (GAO-08-622), ``since 2003, the administration's national \n     security strategies and Congress have recognized that a \n     comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national \n     power-- diplomatic, military, intelligence, development \n     assistance, economic, and law enforcement support-- was \n     needed to address the terrorist threat emanating from the \n     FATA'' and that such a strategy was also mandated by section \n     7102(b)(3) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f \n     note) and section 2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the \n     Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public \n     Law 110-53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 note).\n       (9) According to United States military sources and \n     unclassified intelligence reports, including the July 2007 \n     National Intelligence Estimate entitled, ``The Terrorist \n     Threat to the U.S. Homeland'', the Taliban, al Qaeda, and \n     their Pakistani affiliates continue to use territory in \n     Pakistan as a haven, recruiting location, and rear base for \n     violent actions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as \n     attacks globally, and pose a threat to the United States \n     homeland.\n       (10) The toll of terrorist attacks, including suicide \n     bombs, on the people of Pakistan include thousands of \n     citizens killed and wounded across the country, over 1,400 \n     military and police forces killed (including 700 since July \n     2007), and dozens of tribal, provincial, and national \n     officials targeted and killed, as well as the brazen \n     assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto while \n     campaigning in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007, and several \n     attempts on the life of President Pervaiz Musharraf, and the \n     rate of such attacks have grown considerably over the past 2 \n     years.\n       (11) The people of Pakistan and the United States share \n     many compatible goals, including--\n       (A) combating terrorism and violent radicalism, both inside \n     Pakistan and elsewhere;\n       (B) solidifying democracy and the rule of law in Pakistan;\n       (C) promoting the economic development of Pakistan, both \n     through the building of infrastructure and the facilitation \n     of increased trade;\n       (D) promoting the social and material well-being of \n     Pakistani citizens, particularly through development of such \n     basic services as public education, access to potable water, \n     and medical treatment; and\n       (E) safeguarding the peace and security of South Asia, \n     including by facilitating peaceful relations between Pakistan \n     and its neighbors.\n       (12) According to consistent opinion research, including \n     that of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (December 28, 2007) \n     and the International Republican Institute (January 29, \n     2008), many people in Pakistan have historically viewed the \n     relationship between the United States and Pakistan as a \n     transactional one, characterized by a heavy emphasis on \n     security issues with little attention to other matters of \n     great interest to citizens of Pakistan.\n       (13) The election of a civilian government in Pakistan in \n     February 2008 provides an opportunity, after nearly a decade \n     of military-dominated rule, to place relations between \n     Pakistan and the United States on a new and more stable \n     foundation.\n       (14) Both the Government of Pakistan and the United States \n     Government should seek to enhance the bilateral relationship \n     through additional multi-faceted engagement in order to \n     strengthen the foundation for a consistent and reliable long-\n     term partnership between the two countries.\n\n     SEC. 1243.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--\n       (1) recognize the bold political steps the Pakistan \n     electorate has taken during a time of heightened sensitivity \n     and tension in 2007 and 2008 to elect a new civilian \n     government;\n       (2) seize this strategic opportunity in the interests of \n     Pakistan as well as in the national security interests of the \n     United States to expand its engagement with the Government \n     and people of Pakistan in areas of particular interest and \n     importance to the people of Pakistan; and\n       (3) continue to build a responsible and reciprocal security \n     relationship taking into account the national security \n     interests of the United States as well as regional and \n     national dynamics in Pakistan to further strengthen and \n     enable the position of Pakistan as a major non-NATO ally.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5603.

SENSE OF SENATE ON LEGISLATIVE ACTION REGARDING \n                   HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW FOR DETAINEES AT \n                   GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Seven years after the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, the perpetrators of that heinous deed have yet to \n     be brought to justice.\n       (2) Policies that circumvent the requirements of the United \n     States Constitution and international treaties to which the \n     United States is a signatory have created a legal morass that \n     has undermined efforts to bring accused terrorists to \n     justice.\n       (3) On four occasions, the Supreme Court has rejected the \n     current Administration's legal rules for individuals at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere, causing years of delay \n     and uncertainty:\n       (A) In Rasul v. Bush, 542 U.S. 466 (2004), the Supreme \n     Court held that the Federal habeas corpus statute applied to \n     detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.\n       (B) In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004), the Supreme \n     Court held that a United States citizen detained as an enemy \n     combatant on United States soil must be provided a meaningful \n     opportunity to challenge the factual basis for his detention.\n       (C) In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), the Supreme \n     Court held that the military commissions established by the \n     Administration violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n     and the Geneva Conventions.\n       (D) Most recently, in Boumediene v. Bush, 128 S.Ct. 2229 \n     (2008), the Supreme Court held unconstitutional relevant \n     provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (Public \n     Law 109-366), finding that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay \n     have a right to challenge the legality of their detention \n     under the United States Constitution.\n       (4) It is important that Congress proceed in a deliberate \n     and thoughtful way to write rules for the treatment of \n     alleged terrorists that will pass constitutional muster.\n       (5) Such rules should allow the United States Government to \n     detain, interrogate, and try terrorists who harm the American \n     people or conspire to do so, while also providing procedures \n     that result in a reliable determination of whether the \n     detainee has in fact engaged in such conduct.\n       (6) Committees of Congress should continue to hold public \n     hearings, consult with national security and legal experts, \n     and take the time to write responsible, bipartisan \n     legislation regarding this complex issue as necessary.\n       (7) Federal judges in the District of Columbia have already \n     begun to consider habeas corpus petitions filed by detainees \n     at Guantanamo Bay and are well equipped to manage the pending \n     litigation. The Supreme Court, in Boumediene v. Bush, \n     expressed confidence that any remaining questions ``are \n     within the expertise and competence of the District Court to \n     address in the first instance''.\n       (8) The Federal courts have consolidated all of the habeas \n     corpus cases of Guantanamo Bay detainees in the District \n     Court for the District of Columbia, and the chief judge of \n     that court is coordinating key procedural issues in these \n     cases.\n       (9) Federal courts have a long history of considering \n     habeas corpus petitions in sensitive cases and can be trusted \n     to adjudicate these matters in a manner that does not \n     compromise national security in any respect.\n       (10) The Federal courts--particularly those of the District \n     of Columbia--have repeatedly demonstrated that they can \n     protect classified information. Federal judges responsibly \n     handled classified information in the cases of Rasul v. Bush, \n     Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, and Boumediene v. Bush, and in the review \n     process under the Detainee Treatment Act in such cases as \n     Bismullah v. Gates, 501 F.3d 178 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and Parhat \n     v. Gates, 532 F.3d 834 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Extensive experience \n     with the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) and the \n     Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) further demonstrates the \n     competence of Federal judges to handle highly sensitive \n     information in a manner that fully addresses national \n     security concerns.\n       (11) Both candidates for President of the major political \n     parties have called for significant changes to detention \n     operations at Guantanamo Bay. A new President should be \n     afforded an opportunity to review existing policies and make \n     such recommendations to Congress as he considers necessary \n     and appropriate.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the decision of the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush \n     presents complex legal and logistical issues that cannot be \n     satisfactorily resolved in the closing weeks of the 110th \n     Congress;\n       (2) Congress should enact legislation to address these \n     complex matters, as necessary, only after careful and \n     responsible deliberation;\n       (3) a hasty legislative response to the Boumediene v.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SUPPORT OF CZECH REPUBLIC \n                   AND POLAND FOR MISSILE DEFENSE EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed at the Bucharest Summit on \n     April 3, 2008, that ``[b]allistic missile proliferation poses \n     an increasing threat to Allies' forces, territory and \n     populations''.\n       (2) As part of a broad response to counter the ballistic \n     missile threat, the Heads of State and Government of NATO \n     ``recognise the substantial contribution to the protection of \n     Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by \n     the planned deployment of European-based United States \n     missile defence assets''.\n       (3) At the Bucharest Summit, the NATO Heads of State and \n     Government stated that, with respect to the planned \n     deployment of United States missile defense capability, \n     ``[w]e are exploring ways to link this capability with \n     current NATO missile defence efforts as a way to ensure that \n     it would be an integral part of any future NATO wide missile \n     defence architecture''.\n       (4) At the Bucharest Summit, the NATO Heads of State and \n     Government stated that, ``[b]earing in mind the principle of \n     the indivisibility of Allied security as well as NATO \n     solidarity, we task the Council in Permanent Session to \n     develop options for a comprehensive missile defence \n     architecture to extend coverage to all Allied territory and \n     populations not otherwise covered by the United States system \n     for review at our 2009 Summit, to inform any future political \n     decision''.\n       (5) On July 8, 2008, the United States Government and the \n     Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement on the \n     stationing of a United States radar facility in the Czech \n     Republic to track ballistic missiles.\n       (6) On August 20, 2008, the United States Government and \n     the Government of Poland signed an agreement on the \n     stationing of 10 ground-based missile defense interceptors in \n     Poland.\n       (7) Supplemental Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) \n     regarding the missile defense deployment agreements, not yet \n     signed, are required elements of any final agreements to \n     deploy the planned missile defense capabilities in the Czech \n     Republic and Poland.\n       (8) In order to take legal effect, any final bilateral \n     missile defense agreements must be submitted to and ratified \n     by the parliaments of the Czech Republic and Poland, \n     respectively.\n       (9) The deployment of the planned United States missile \n     defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland would not \n     provide protection to southeastern portions of NATO territory \n     against missile attack. Additional missile defense \n     capabilities would be required to protect these areas against \n     missile attack, including against existing short- and medium-\n     range missile threats.\n       (10) According to the Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation, the ground-based interceptor planned to be \n     deployed in Poland would require three flight tests to \n     demonstrate whether it could accomplish its mission in an \n     operationally effective manner. Such testing is not expected \n     to begin before the fall of 2009, and is unlikely to be \n     concluded before 2011.\n       (11) The Government of Iran continues to defy international \n     calls to cease its uranium enrichment program, has deployed \n     hundreds of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, and \n     continues to develop and test ballistic missiles of \n     increasing range, as well as a space launch vehicle.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the decisions by the Governments of Poland and the \n     Czech Republic to station elements of a missile defense \n     system on their territory are a clear affirmation of the \n     commitment of those governments to support the defense of \n     NATO member states, including the United States, against the \n     threat of long-range ballistic missiles;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the importance of these decisions taken by \n     the Governments of Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as \n     the statements made by NATO Heads of State and Government \n     relative to missile defense at the Bucharest Summit in April \n     2008; and\n       (B) notes the care and seriousness with which the \n     Governments of Poland and the Czech Republic have undertaken \n     their evaluation and consideration of these issues; and\n       (3) these decisions will deepen the strategic relationship \n     between the United States Government and the Governments of \n     Poland and the Czech Republic and could make a substantial \n     contribution to the collective capability of NATO to counter \n     future long-range ballistic missile threats.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to modify the requirements of section 226 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 41), or [section 232] of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5608.

THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY AUTHORITY FOR THE \n                   PERFORMANCE OF MEDICAL DISABILITY EXAMINATIONS \n                   BY CONTRACT PHYSICIANS.\n\n       Section 704(c) of the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (Public \n     Law 108-183; 117 Stat. 2651; 38 U.S.C. 5101 note) is amended \n     by striking ``December 31, 2009'' and inserting ``December \n     31, 2012''.\n         Amend the title so as to read: ``A Bill to amend title \n     38, United States Code, to improve and enhance compensation \n     and pension, housing, labor and education, and insurance \n     benefits for veterans, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on \nS. 3023, the proposed Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, as \nreported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This omnibus veterans' \nbenefits bill will provide much needed support to our Nation's \nveterans. It contains six titles and 34 provisions that are designed to \nenhance compensation, housing, labor and education, and insurance \nbenefits for veterans. A full explanation of the bill is available in \nthe committee's report accompanying this legislation, Senate Report \n110-449.\n  I believe that it is important that we view veterans' compensation, \nand indeed all benefits earned by veterans, as a continuing cost of \nwar. This legislation reflects that perspective.\n  I will highlight a few of the provisions that I have sponsored in the \nlegislation that is before us today.\n  This legislation would result in improved notices being sent to \nveterans concerning their claims for VA benefits. Following a number of \ndecisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, VA's notification letters to \nveterans about the status of their claims have become increasingly \nlong, complex, and difficult to understand. These notification letters \nmust be simplified, as veterans,\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\nVA, veterans' advocates, and outside review bodies have all \nrecommended. The notices should focus on the specific type of claim \npresented. They should use plain and ordinary language rather than \nbureaucratic jargon. Veterans should not be subjected to confusing \ninformation as they seek benefits.\n  To further improve the VA compensation system, this legislation would \nend the prohibition on judicial review in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit of matters concerning the VA rating \nschedule. VA issues regulations which are used to assign ratings to \nveterans for particular disabilities. Under current law, actions \nconcerning the rating schedule are not subject to judicial review \nunless a constitutional challenge is presented. This legislation would \namend the law to treat actions concerning the rating schedule in the \nsame manner as all other actions concerning VA regulations.\n  I expect VA to comply with all laws passed by Congress in developing \nand revising the Rating Schedule. However, justice to our Nation's \nveterans requires that actions concerning the rating schedule be \nsubject to the same judicial scrutiny as is available for the review of \nactions involving other regulations.\n  VA's home loan guaranty program may exempt homeowners from having to \nmake a down payment or secure private mortgage insurance, depending on \nthe size of the loan and the amount of the VA guaranty. In general, \neligibility is extended to veterans who served on active duty for a \nminimum of 90 days during wartime, or 181 continuous days during \npeacetime, and have a discharge other than dishonorable. Members of the \nGuard and Reserve who have never been called to active duty must serve \na total of six years in order to be eligible for the benefit. Certain \nsurviving spouses are also eligible for the housing guaranty.\n  Public Law 108-454 increased VA's maximum guaranty amount to 25 \npercent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit determined under \nsection 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act for \na single family residence, as adjusted for the year involved.\n  The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, Public Law 110-185, temporarily \nreset the maximum limits on home loans that the Federal Housing \nAdministration may insure and that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may \npurchase on the secondary market to 125 percent of metropolitan-area \nmedian home prices, but did so without reference to the VA home loan \nprogram. This had the effect of raising the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, \nand FHA limits to nearly $730,000, in the highest cost areas, while \nleaving the then-VA limit of $417,000 in place. On July 30, 2008, the \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 was signed into law as Public \nLaw 110-289. That law provided a temporary increase in the maximum \nguaranty amount for VA loans originated from July 30, 2008 through \nDecember 31, 2008 to the same level as provided in the Stimulus Act.\n  S. 3023, as amended, would extend the temporary increase in the \nmaximum guaranty amount until December 31, 2011. This would enable more \nveterans to utilize their VA benefit to purchase more costly homes.\n  The committee bill would also increase the maximum guaranty limit for \nrefinance loans and increase the percentage of an existing loan that VA \nwill refinance under the VA home loan program.\n  Under current law, the maximum VA home loan guaranty limit for most \nloans in excess of $144,000 is equal to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac \nconforming loan limit for a single family home. Public Law 110-289 set \nthis value at approximately $182,437 through the end of 2008. This \nmeans lenders offering loans of up to $729,750 will receive up to a 25 \npercent guaranty, which is typically required to place the loan on the \nsecondary market. Under current law, this does not include regular \nrefinance loans.\n  Current law limits to $36,000 the guaranty that can be used for a \nregular refinance loan. This restriction means VA will not guarantee a \nregular refinance loan over $144,000, essentially precluding a veteran \nfrom using the VA program to refinance his or her existing FHA or \nconventional loan in excess of that amount.\n  VA is also currently precluded from refinancing a loan if the \nhomeowner does not have at least 10 percent equity in his or her home.\n  The committee bill would decrease the equity requirement from 10 \npercent to 5 percent for refinancing from an FHA loan or conventional \nloan to a VA-guaranteed loan. This would allow more veterans to use \ntheir VA benefit to refinance their mortgages. Many veterans do not \nhave 10 percent equity and thus are precluded from refinancing with a \nVA-guaranteed home loan.\n  Given the anticipated number of non-VA-guaranteed adjustable rate \nmortgages that are approaching the reset time when payments are likely \nto increase, the committee believes that it is prudent to facilitate \nveterans refinancing to VA-guaranteed loans. In light of today's \nhousing and home loan crises, additional refinancing options will help \nsome veterans bridge financial gaps and allow them to stay in their \nhomes and escape possible foreclosures. These provisions would allow \nmore qualified veterans to refinance their home loans under the VA \nprogram.\n  The omnibus benefits bill would also make crucial updates to the \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, which \nprotects servicemembers' rights to return to their prior jobs with the \nsame wages and benefits. The provisions in the committee bill are \nderived from S. 2471, the proposed ``USERRA Enforcement Improvement Act \nof 2007,'' which Senator Kennedy and I introduced on December 13, 2007. \nThis legislation would ensure that federal agencies assist \nservicemembers in a more effective manner, by requiring the Department \nof Labor to investigate and refer cases in a more timely manner, and by \nrequiring reports from the Department of Labor on their compliance with \nthe deadlines.\n  Finally, the omnibus benefits bill includes a provision derived from \nS. 3000, the proposed ``Native American Veterans Access Act of 2008,'' \nwhich I introduced on May 8, 2008. This provision is intended to \nimprove VA's ability to understand and respond to the needs of Native \nAmerican veterans. While Native Americans are more likely to serve in \nuniform than the general population, many of them find cultural and \ngeographical barriers between themselves and the benefits they earned \nthrough service. In addition, those returning to traditional homelands, \nespecially reservation communities, frequently come home to dismal job \nopportunities and starved economies. The proposed bill would require a \nstudy to help us understand the employment needs of Native American \nveterans and how best to address them.\n  I thank the committee's ranking member, Senator Burr, for the \nagreements we have been able to reach. I truly appreciate his \ncooperation and that of the other members of the committee that have \naided our work. I look forward to working with all those on the \ncommittee and our colleagues in the House in order to bring this \nlegislation to final action before the end of this month.\n  I urge colleagues to support this important legislation that would \nbenefit many of this Nation's nearly 24 million veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I rise today to express my support for S. 3023, the \nVeterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008. This veterans' benefits \nomnibus bill will make a wide assortment of improvements to benefits \nprograms for veterans.\n  I commend Chairman Akaka for his efforts in crafting this committee \nbill which reflects the bipartisan work of almost every member of our \ncommittee and over 30 other Senators. The result of our work is a bill \nwith 35 provisions touching on education, vocational rehabilitation, \nemployment, housing, compensation, insurance, memorial affairs, and \nother issues.\n  Among many other valuable provisions, this bill includes an education \nbenefit that draws its inspiration from a North Carolinian who has \nbecome one of the foremost advocates of the needs of severely injured \nservicemen and women and their families. Sarah Wade, spouse of Ted \nWade, an Iraq war veteran who lost his right arm and has battled the \neffects of severe traumatic brain injury after an explosive detonated \nunder his Humvee in 2004, has\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nbeen at her husband's side as a primary caregiver from the beginning. \nShe quit her job to take care of Ted and has doggedly ensured that he \nreceives the highest quality of care. It is likely that her intensive \ninvolvement in Ted's ongoing recovery will last for several more years.\n  Sarah's effort on behalf of her husband leaves little time for \nherself. Sarah would one day like to go to school. Although VA provides \nan educational assistance benefit for the spouses of totally disabled \nveterans and servicemembers, the law requires that the benefit be used \nwithin 10 years of the date the veteran receives a total disability \nrating. For a spouse like Sarah Wade, there is next to no time to take \nadvantage of this benefit within that timeframe. The recovery period \nfor a TBI-afflicted veteran--the very period that Ted needs Sarah the \nmost--simply precludes her from pursuing that option.\n  In recognition of hundreds of spouses like Sarah, the Veterans' \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2008 would extend from 10 to 20 years the \nperiod within which certain spouses of severely disabled veterans could \nuse their education benefits. That longer window will allow Sarah and \nothers to focus on their first priority, the care of their injured \nspouses, while giving them some flexibility to pursue their educational \ngoals later on. This provision is simply the right thing to do.\n  Another provision that I would like to discuss is one that would \nrequire human resource specialists in the Federal executive branch to \nreceive training on the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \nRights Act or USERRA. This law provides a wide range of employment \nprotections to veterans, future and current members of the Armed \nForces, and Guard and Reserve members.\n  More than 60 years ago Congress recognized that those who serve our \ncountry in a time of need should be entitled to resume their civilian \njobs when they return home. After Congress passed the first law \nproviding reemployment rights to servicemen and women in 1940, \nPresident Roosevelt said these rights were part of ``the special \nbenefits which are due to the members of our armed forces--for they \n`have been compelled to make greater economic sacrifice and every other \nkind of sacrifice than the rest of us.' ''\n  As we all know, the sacrifices by this generation of servicemen and \nwomen are just as profound. In North Carolina alone, we have over 1,000 \nmembers of the Guard and Reserves currently deployed, and more than \n45,000 members of the Guard and Reserves have deployed since the \nbeginning of the War on Terror. Many left behind not only family and \nfriends, but valued civilian careers.\n  For them, the modern reemployment law, the Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act, requires that they be given \ntheir jobs back when they return home. It also requires that they \nreceive all the benefits and seniority that would have accumulated \nduring their absence.\n  While every employer should strive to meet or exceed the requirements \nof USERRA, Congress has stressed that ``the Federal Government should \nbe a model employer'' when it comes to complying with this law. In my \nview, this means the Federal Government should make sure that not a \nsingle returning servicemember is denied proper reinstatement to a \nFederal job. But unfortunately, this is not happening yet.\n  At a hearing last year, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs learned \nthat the Federal executive branch continues to violate this law. Worse, \nthese violations are often the result of lack of understanding or \nknowledge about what the law requires. In fact, the Assistant Secretary \nfor Veterans' Employment and Training of the U.S. Department of Labor \ntestified at our hearing that ``about half' of Federal USERRA cases \noccur because ``the Federal hiring manager just doesn't understand the \nlaw or the . . . regulations that spell out how to implement the law.''\n  Based on that, it seems clear that we need to do more to prevent \nthese USERRA violations from occurring in the first place. We owe \nnothing less to those who have served and sacrificed so much for our \nnation. That is why I have championed this provision to require the \nhead of each Federal executive agency to provide training for their \nhuman resources personnel on the rights, benefits, and obligations \nunder USERRA. I am very pleased that this provision was included in the \nomnibus bill and hope it will soon become law.\n  The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 also includes a \nprovision that would require VA to provide Congress with a plan for \nupdating its disability rating schedule and a timeline for when changes \nwill be made. This rating schedule--which is the cornerstone of the \nentire VA claims processing system--was developed in the early 1900s \nand about 35 percent of it has not been updated since 1945. It is \nriddled with outdated criteria that do not track with modern medicine. \nTake for example traumatic arthritis. The rating schedule requires a \nveteran to show proof of this condition through x-ray evidence. But \ndoctors today would generally diagnose the condition using more modern \ntechnology, like an MRI.\n  Even worse, experts have been telling us the rating schedule is not \nadequate for rating conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injury, which are afflicting so many of our veterans \nfrom the War on Terror. Also, experts have told us that the schedule \ndoes not adequately compensate young, severely disabled veterans; \nveterans with mental disabilities; and veterans who are unemployable.\n  To address this situation, VA has been conducting studies on the \nappropriate level of disability compensation to account for any loss of \nearning capacity and any loss of qualify of life caused by service-\nrelated disabilities. To make sure these studies don't get put on a \nshelf to collect dust--as has happened in the past--this bill would \nrequire VA to submit to Congress a report outlining the findings and \nrecommendations of those studies, a list of the actions that VA plans \nto take in response, and a timeline for when VA plans to take those \nactions. My hope is that this will finally prompt the type of complete \nupdate that the VA rating schedule has needed for so long.\n  These are only a few of the 35 items in this bill. I am confident \nthat each of the bill's provisions will improve the lives of and \nveterans, even if only in a small way. My hope is that these \nprovisions, and others, will be passed by both Houses before Congress \nleaves for the year. I ask my colleagues for their support as Chairman \nAkaka and I work to make sure that happens.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nAkaka amendment be agreed to; that the committee's substitute \namendment, as amended, be agreed to; the bill be read a third time and \npassed; the title amendment be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 87\n\n       Whereas, on November 18, 1918, in the City of Riga, the \n     members of the People's Council proclaimed Latvia a free, \n     democratic, and sovereign nation;\n       Whereas, on July 24, 1922, the United States formally \n     recognized Latvia as an independent and sovereign nation;\n       Whereas Latvia existed for 21 years as an independent and \n     sovereign nation and a fully recognized member of the League \n     of Nations;\n       Whereas Latvia maintained friendly and stable relations \n     with its neighbors, including the Soviet Union, during its \n     independence, without any border disputes;\n       Whereas Latvia concluded several peace treaties and \n     protocols with the Soviet Union, including a peace treaty \n     signed on August 11, 1920, under which the Soviet Union \n     ``unreservedly recognize[d] the independence and sovereignty \n     of the Latvian State and forever renounce[d] all sovereign \n     rights . . . over the Latvian people and territory'';\n       Whereas, despite friendly and mutually productive relations \n     between Latvia and the Soviet Union, on August 23, 1939, Nazi \n     Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop \n     Pact, which contained a secret protocol assigning Latvia, \n     Estonia, and Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence;\n       Whereas, under the cover of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, on \n     June 17, 1940, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania were forcibly \n     incorporated into the Soviet Union in violation of pre-\n     existing peace treaties;\n       Whereas the Soviet Union imposed upon the people of \n     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania a communist political system \n     that stifled civil dissent, free political expression, and \n     basic human rights;\n       Whereas the United States never recognized this illegal and \n     forcible occupation, and successive United States presidents \n     maintained continuous diplomatic relations with these \n     countries throughout the Soviet occupation, never accepting \n     them to be ``Soviet Republics'';\n       Whereas, during the 50 years of Soviet occupation of the \n     Baltic states, Congress strongly, consistently, and on a \n     bipartisan basis supported a United States policy of legal \n     non-recognition;\n       Whereas, in 1953, the congressionally-established Kersten \n     Commission investigated the incorporation of Latvia, Estonia, \n     and Lithuania into the Soviet Union and determined that the \n     Soviet Union had illegally and forcibly occupied and annexed \n     the Baltic countries;\n       Whereas, in 1982, and for the next nine years until the \n     Baltic countries regained their independence, Congress \n     annually adopted a Baltic Freedom Day resolution denouncing \n     the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and appealing for the freedom of \n     the Baltic countries;\n       Whereas, in 1991, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania regained \n     their de facto independence and were quickly recognized by \n     the United States and by almost every other country in the \n     world, including the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in 1998, the United States and the three Baltic \n     nations signed the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership, an \n     expression of the importance of the Baltic Sea region to \n     United States interests;\n       Whereas the 109th Congress resolved (S.

Res. 35 and H. \n     Res. 28) that ``it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Government of the Russian Federation should issue a clear and \n     unambiguous statement of admission and condemnation of the \n     illegal occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union from \n     1940 to 1991 of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and \n     Lithuania, the consequences of which will be a significant \n     increase in good will among the affected people'';\n       Whereas Latvia has successfully developed as a free and \n     democratic country, ensured the rule of law, and developed a \n     free market economy;\n       Whereas the Government of Latvia has constantly pursued a \n     course of integration of that country into the community of \n     free and democratic nations, becoming a full and responsible \n     member of the United Nations, the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       Whereas the people of Latvia cherish the principles of \n     political freedom, human rights, and independence; and\n       Whereas Latvia is a strong and loyal ally of the United \n     States, and the people of Latvia share common values with the \n     people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) congratulates the people of Latvia on the occasion of \n     the 90th anniversary of that country's November 18, 1918, \n     declaration of independence;\n       (2) commends the Government of Latvia for its success in \n     implementing political and economic reforms, for establishing \n     political, religious and economic freedom, and for its strong \n     commitment to human and civil rights;\n       (3) recognizes the common goals and shared values of the \n     people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the close and \n     friendly relations and ties of the three Baltic countries \n     with one other, and their tragic history in the last century \n     under the Nazi and Soviet occupations;\n       (4) calls on the President to issue a proclamation \n     congratulating the people of Latvia on the 90th anniversary \n     of the declaration of Latvia's independence on November 18, \n     1918;\n       (5) respectfully requests the President to congratulate the \n     Government of Latvia for its commitment to democracy, a free \n     market economy, human rights, the rule of law, participation \n     in a wide range of international structures, and security \n     cooperation with the United States Government; and\n       (6) calls on the President and Secretary of State to urge \n     the Government of the Russian Federation to acknowledge that \n     the Soviet occupation of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania under \n     the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and for the succeeding 51 years \n     was illegal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/16/senate-section/article/S8890-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SIGNING AUTHORITY--S. 3406\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
