Mr. President, in the past few days, we have seen a real \nmeltdown in our financial community. One major investment bank failed. \nAnother is filing for bankruptcy. As we know, Bear Stearns was propped \nup because of Government money. Lehman Brothers is being purchased by \nanother bank. It is hard to comprehend that Bear Stearns is no longer \nwhat it was. Lehman Brothers is, in effect, gone. The name may be \nsaved, but that may be all. We have other companies that we are \nwatching very closely. One of the companies was saved by a competitor, \nand the Federal Reserve is now saying they must liberalize access to \nits discount window.\n  By all accounts, this was a remarkable turn of events for Wall \nStreet, our Nation's financial markets, and the world's financial \nmarkets. When all the smoke of these major financial shakeups has \ncleared--and we don't know when that will be--our job remains the same \nas always; that is, the Members of Congress, to do everything we can to \nhelp the American people make it through these trying times.\n  What we are seeing on Wall Street today is yet more fallout from the \nBush and now McCain economic policies that have failed our country. The \nBush administration failed to police lenders and neglected to protect \nconsumers. That led to the subprime crisis and cost millions of \nAmerican families their homes and continues to wreak havoc on \nneighborhoods and financial institutions throughout America. This Bush-\nMcCain ``anything goes'' approach, which the Bush administration has \ncalled free market economics but has amounted to nothing more than \nwillful neglect for American families, has resulted in, I repeat, \nmillions of lost jobs, millions of lost homes, with an enormous price \ntag for the American taxpayer to accompany that. If there ever was a \nreminder of our country's desperate need for new economic leadership, \nwhat more do we need? This is it.\n  Today, Monday, with what happened around the financial markets to our \ngreat country, with all the bad news today, Senator John McCain said \nthe fundamentals of our economy are strong. Think about that. I don't \nknow what that means. I don't know if anyone knows what that means. For \nwhom is the economy strong? It is not strong for homeowners in Nevada. \nIt is certainly not strong for homeowners in Florida, Arizona, \nCalifornia, and most every other place in America. It is not strong for \nwage earners who are spending more of their paychecks than ever to buy \ngas to get to work, and then they have to come home at day's end. \nSchool districts are having a difficult time because busing is now an \nintegral part of a school district. Trucking companies are in desperate \nshape, all because of the high price of fuel.\n  It is not just middle-class families that are saving less and \nspending more on groceries, clothing, and health care; it is throughout \nour society. The economy certainly isn't strong for the 606,000 \nAmericans who lost their jobs this year. This is 606,000 people, and \nyou have John McCain saying the economy looks good. I really don't \nunderstand what he means, that the fundamentals are good. The economy \nis not strong for fixed-income seniors,\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\nwhich the Presiding Officer's State of Florida has more than any other \nplace in the union. Certainly, in Nevada, we are the most rapidly \ngrowing senior population. It is not strong for them or especially for \nthose in the Northeast because they have so much heating done with fuel \noil. The prices will go up by at least 50 percent--some say 75 \npercent--this year. There may be places in America where the economy is \nstrong, such as country clubs and boardrooms at firms that haven't \nfolded. For the rest of America, this economy is not strong. It will \nnot solve itself, no matter what President Bush and John McCain say. \nFixing this mess will take real leadership and a change of direction.\n  During this work period, I hope Congress will show some leadership, \nwith some direction from the President, which we don't have, by passing \nanother economic stimulus plan that creates jobs and invests in our \neconomy.\n  We have a lot to do in the next 2 weeks. That is all we have left \nuntil the due date for us to leave here. I hope we can leave here, but \nI don't know that we can. Everybody should understand that we may do \nthe unthinkable and have to have votes here on Friday and maybe even on \nMonday. We have to get essential work done.\n  The Defense authorization bill--we need to complete that legislation. \nThere will be no rollcall votes on this today. The managers have worked \nmost of Thursday and Friday. Of course, today they are available and \nhave been available to come up with an agreement on amendments before \nthe cloture vote on the bill. If the managers of the bill don't get an \nagreement on how to move forward with amendments, we will have a \ncloture vote in the morning. We have no choice. Senators have until 4 \no'clock today to file first-degree amendments to the bill.\n  This Defense authorization bill is an important piece of legislation. \nI don't know how else to phrase its importance. We know the security of \nour Nation depends on things other than this Defense authorization \nbill. We know we are importing 70 percent of our oil. That is important \nto the security of our country. For a basic understanding of how to \ntreat our military, this bill is it. These two experienced legislators \nhave worked together for decades on this committee. They have put \nforward some extremely important issues, including the pay raise for \nthe troops and so many other things, to maintain the integrity of our \nmilitary. Not to pass a Defense bill--how can we leave here and not do \nthat?\n\n  There are 51 Democratic Senators, and every one of them will vote for \nthis legislation. We need help from the other side. Now, did everyone \nhave the opportunity to offer all of the amendments they wanted? The \nanswer is yes. Did they get a chance to vote on them? No, but that is \nnot our fault or the managers' fault. I hope unanimous consent can be \nreached on a list of amendments and that we will dispose of those as \nquickly as we can. This would allow Senators to have their voices \nheard, which could perhaps allow us to pass this without another \nRepublican filibuster. We are probably at about 95 filibusters now, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Once we complete this bill, then we are going to have to move to our \nenergy legislation--first of all, the tax extenders. That is so \nimportant. We have an economy that we have talked about a little bit \ntoday, about how very shaky it is. If we extend the tax credits for \nrenewable energy, we would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. These \nare not just jobs where the Sun shines a lot; these are jobs everywhere \nin America. In my little hometown of Searchlight, NV, renewable energy \nhas hit there. There is a company that is going to put in windmills \nthere. It takes a while, with environmental impact statements, but they \nhave gotten permission in the Federal agencies to do this. That would \nhappen all over America today. But what has happened is that people who \nhave these projects are backing out of them because they don't have the \ntax credits. You cannot have people investing huge amounts of money for \na tax credit of 1 year or 6 months, and the legislation that will be \nbrought before the body will have multiyear, long-term tax credits. \nThat is what we need. That is going to happen. We have worked out an \narrangement with the Finance Committee, as I understand it, that it \nwill all be paid for, which I think will be acceptable to both \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  Then we are going to have to do the other tax extenders, with AMT and \nother problems. We cannot pay for all that. I certainly cannot tell the \nHouse of Representatives how to do business, and they don't tell us how \nto do ours, but I hope they will allow this vote on what we are going \nto send them.\n  The Presiding Officer and this Senator from Nevada served in the \nHouse of Representatives. When we served there, the leaders we had \nthere never, ever tried to pass legislation just with Democrats, even \nthough we had a significant majority when we served in the House. We \nalways looked to Tip O'Neill and Jim Wright, who were our leaders, and \nthey would go to the Republicans and try to get enough votes to pass \nit. I hope we can do it. This is passable. We need to do this on the \ntax credits and tax extenders.\n  Mr. President, I have expressed to everybody, and I say it here \ntoday, that even though I don't think there is going to be immediate \nrelief from drilling, we are going to have some drilling votes here. It \nis the consensus of the American people, and both Democrats and \nRepublicans, that we should have some drilling votes. We are going to \ndo that. Senator Bingaman came up with a proposal that he worked on for \nweeks. We will do that, and then we will move to what the Republicans \nwant. We will vote on that, and then we are going to have the \nbipartisan proposal of the Gang of 10. In the meantime, we will get \nfrom the House, I think, a bill they will pass over there dealing with \nenergy. As I understand it, it won't have any of the tax extenders on \nit, but it will have a number of important issues to people over here.\n  Then there are a lot of things we need to deal with, which I have \ntalked about briefly. I hope we can get direction from the President. \nWe can call it a stimulus bill, supplemental appropriations, emergency \nfunding--call it whatever you want, but we have real problems out there \nin our country that deserve Federal attention. We hope we can get \nsomething done there.\n\n  Then we have the continuing resolution we have to do so we can fund \nthe Government. I can only speak for myself and my counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell, will have to speak for himself, but I think it is our \ninitial hope that we can fund the Government until sometime in \nFebruary. But if not, then we will have to come back here for a lame-\nduck session. But we have to fund the Government. We tried in the past, \non one occasion, to shut down the Government, and it didn't work very \nwell. We are going to do everything we can to make sure that does not \nhappen.\n  During this period of time, we have a variety of other bipartisan \npieces of legislation that the House has passed and that we need to try \nto move forward on. We hope we can do that.\n  Again, we may have to have some votes on Friday, and hopefully not \nover the weekend, but this is important business that we need to do and \nso little time left to do it. The American people expect us to get it \ndone. Everyone should look at their schedules this weekend to see what \nwe can get done so we don't have to be here for an extended period of \ntime.\n  This Defense bill should pass, and after that, we would have to have \na very quick conference with the House. Certainly, people work on these \nbills for a long time, both the Senate managers and the House managers, \nso that can be completed.\n  As to this energy legislation, I hope the House will take what we do \nwith all the tax extenders.\n  We talked about the other business that needs to be done. There is a \nlimited number of items we need to do, but we cannot leave unless we do \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8506-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I will speak momentarily, but I wish to defer to the \ndistinguished chairman, and I will follow him with brief remarks.\n  I will continue, Mr. President. I wish to say on behalf of my staff \nand that of the distinguished chairman, we have an old saying in the \nNavy: ``All hands on deck.'' Both staffs were present throughout the \nweekend. I am pleased to advise the Chair and other Senators following \nthis proceeding that we have put together a significant package of \namendments on which we use the phrase around here ``both sides of the \naisle agreed upon.'' But I will leave it to the chairman to address \nthat issue.\n  I believe I am under the instruction of my Republican leader at this \ntime that I am not able to agree to a UC request. But I do hope that \ncan be resolved very quickly and that we can move to that package and \nreceive such other amendments as Senators may wish to call up. There \nare some 250 pending at the desk and at such time the chairman and I \nare ready to work with Members on trying to resolve those amendments or \notherwise have votes. I know a number of amendments are pending that \nwill require votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan, the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia. First, we \nhave, I think, about 50 or more amendments that our staffs have worked \nvery hard on and we have been consulted on, obviously, which we will be \nable to vote on hopefully today, if possible, and if not, as soon as we \nget clearance from Senator Warner's side, we will be happy to proceed \nwith them. We are going to keep working on additional amendments.\n  In the meantime, we are together working to try to come up with a \nunanimous consent request which can get the approval of this body. We \nneed Members to come to the floor to try to work with us on those \namendments. Where rollcalls are going to be necessary, we can fit them \nin at sometime prior, hopefully, to the vote on cloture. As the leader \nsaid, we need to have a unanimous consent agreement in hand prior to \nthat cloture vote for the sake of the body.\n  I worry a great deal about the future of our bill. I say ``our bill'' \nbecause this is a bipartisan bill. This is not a partisan committee, \nand it is not a partisan bill. I worry about what is going to happen to \nour bill if we cannot either get a unanimous consent agreement or \ncloture tomorrow--one or the other.\n  We will continue to be here this afternoon. Hopefully, colleagues \nwill come to the floor and work with us and our staffs to either work \nout amendments or, if rollcalls are necessary, to find a spot for those \nrollcalls to take place.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I begin by commending the chairman and the \nranking member on working very hard on an extremely important bill. I \nrise in my position as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee \nto ask consent that we be able to add an amendment which deals with the \nintelligence portion of the Defense authorization and appropriations \nbills that I feel must be addressed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendments and call \nup amendment No. 5387.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am not surprised. I am disappointed that \nmy effort to simply call up one of seven amendments I filed to the \nDefense authorization bill is being denied. Our very distinguished, \narticulate majority leader has said it is not his fault if people can't \nget votes. I should note that he has filled up the tree, a procedural \nmove that denies a vote on any nonmajority leader-approved amendment.\n  I now will explain why I think these provisions are vitally \nimportant. These are measures that have been dealt with and approved by \nthis body and the other body in some instances, by this body in some \ninstances, and by the Intelligence Committee in other times.\n  The amendment I tried to call up, as well as the other six I filed, \nis important not only for the intelligence community but for \ncongressional oversight as we continue to fight this war on terror.\n  Unfortunately, for reasons that make no sense to me, I have been \ninformed there is a desire not to entertain any amendments relating to \nthe intelligence community on the bill. We have seen from the 9/11 \nCommission and most other observers of the legislative process that the \none area of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, on a bipartisan basis, \nthat has not been adopted has been to combine the intelligence \nauthorization and appropriations process. I am here today to offer some \namendments that would effect that coordination.\n  I join with my other colleagues who have indicated they refuse to \nacquiesce in a UC agreement until such time as we can work out a \nreasonable accommodation. I want to see this bill passed. Obviously, it \nis critically important, but so is stopping the waste of billions of \ndollars and improving the operations of the intelligence community. It \nis a mistake, and I cannot agree to a UC agreement until we have had \nsome resolution of these questions.\n  It is certainly no surprise to the occupant of the chair, who is a \nvalued member of both the Defense authorization committee and the \nIntelligence Committee, that the intelligence community has been \nwithout essential oversight as ordinarily provided in the authorization \nprocess.\n  Our efforts in the Intelligence Committee to have a bill signed into \nlaw last year were derailed by partisan provisions that ultimately \nresulted in a Presidential veto. The same poison pills were put into \nthis year's intelligence authorization bill. So it will not move \nforward. As vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I believe it \nis time to take partisan games out of the intelligence oversight. I \nbelieve it is high time to return to congressional oversight of \nintelligence activities by the executive branch.\n  It is ironic that some of my colleagues have been so vocal, and at \ntimes biting, in their criticism of the administration's intelligence \nspending programs. Yet when we now have the opportunity to seek \ncongressional oversight over them, they seek to deny us the opportunity \nto do so. It is almost as if some would rather have a reason to \ncriticize the system rather than the opportunity to fix it.\n  I am here today to ask for the opportunity to begin to fix it. So I \nfiled these amendments--good, sound provisions that have good \nbipartisan support and I believe will improve not only our oversight \nbut the work of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Each one of these amendments was included in the Intelligence \nCommittee's 2009 authorization bill, and almost all were part of the \n2008 bill. So there are no surprises here.\n  First among them is amendment No. 5387 that authorizes funds for the \nintelligence community's budget. How much more fundamental can we get? \nThat sets out the parameters for the intelligence community, just as \nthe overall Armed Services Committee bill sets out parameters for \nappropriations by the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on defense \nissues.\n  The first amendment combines five sections from the Intelligence \nCommittee's 2009 authorization act and authorizes different types of \nfunding for the intelligence community--the National Intelligence \nProgram funds, funding of the intelligence community management \naccount, and funding the CIA's disability and retirement accounts.\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nThese are all basic budgetary authorizations on which I hope we can \nagree. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  My remaining amendments include a number of what I can call, I \nbelieve without challenge, ``good government'' provisions. These \nprovisions will ensure that the Director of National Intelligence has \nthe authority he needs to manage the intelligence community and will \nensure that American taxpayers are actually getting the best bang for \ntheir buck and not wasting billions and billions of dollars, which I \nhave addressed on the floor previously.\n  The next amendment is No. 5388. What is this good government \namendment? This amendment is aimed at discouraging cost overruns on \nintelligence satellites and other expensive intelligence programs and \nis modeled after the longstanding Nunn-McCurdy provisions that apply to \nDepartment of Defense major acquisitions.\n  Last week I stated on the floor that billions and billions and \nbillions--I won't tell you how many because it is classified--of \ndollars have been wasted on overhead programs because they were not \neffectively managed.\n  The next amendment, No. 5389, requires the DNI to conduct \nvulnerability assessments of our major systems used by the intelligence \ncommunity. This provision has been in the past two intelligence \nauthorization bills. It requires the DNI to conduct initial and \nsubsequent periodic vulnerability assessments of each intelligence \ncommunity major system. These assessments should identify system \nvulnerabilities and exploitation potentials and should make \nrecommendations for reducing risks.\n  We all know there are those who seek to do us ill who have the \nability to compromise many of our programs. Those of us who are \nfamiliar with it know how many ways this can happen. I am not going to \ngive anybody any ideas by telling them how to do it. Too many people \nalready know. If we have learned anything during this election cycle, \nit is that the American people are tired of having their money wasted. \nThey are demanding better spending habits and better accountability \nfrom their Government, which brings me to my next amendment, \naccountability reviews by the Director of National \nIntelligence. Amendment No. 5390 allows the DNI to conduct \naccountability reviews of elements of the intelligence community or \npersonnel of such element in relation to a significant failure or \ndeficiency within the intelligence community.\n\n  My amendment, agreed to by the Intelligence Committee, would \nstrengthen the DNI's authority and influence in this area, as well as \ncongressional oversight. This amendment confirms the DNI's ability to \nrecommend disciplinary action against persons within the Office of the \nDNI who have failed to measure up to expectations and are under his \njurisdiction. I believe this is a reasonable place to start.\n  The next one is a future-year budget plan, amendment No. 5391. I \nthink it is reasonable for Congress and our intelligence community to \nstop wasting billions of dollars on intelligence programs that prove \ntoo costly to complete. How does this happen? One reason is that we \nhave never required the intelligence community to show us the full cost \nof these expensive programs in the budget. My fifth amendment would \nensure that this would not happen again.\n  Now, I will tell the occupant of the chair and my fellow Intelligence \nCommittee member, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, as well as \nthe chairman of the committee who has staff who sits in as frequently \nas he can on our Intelligence Committee oversight hearings, that there \nare many wonderful programs that come to us with maybe a couple-\nhundred-million-dollar budget expenditure the first year. But when you \nlook out to the future years, that number goes up, potentially \nswallowing the entire intelligence portion of the budget.\n  I think we in Congress ought to say: Wait a minute. Before we spend \nthat first couple hundred million dollars, tell us what the cost is \ngoing to be and what it is going to take out of the budget in future \nyears to accommodate it.\n  This amendment would require the intelligence community to provide \nCongress with a future-year intelligence plan that is a 5-year budget \nand a long-term budget projection that covers 10 years beyond the \nfuture intelligence plan. These requirements would ensure that Congress \nwould not appropriate or legislate in the dark without knowing what \nthese wonderful new ideas--and there are some great ideas--are going to \ncost in the future and how we are going to pay for them.\n  Next, my final good government provision, No. 5392, requires annual \npersonnel level assessments for the intelligence community. As with \nmost all of my amendments, the provision has been included in the last \ntwo intelligence authorization bills.\n  So why the need for this amendment? These assessments will help \nCongress get a better sense of the personnel growth in the IC before we \nmark up annual authorization bills. For some time now both the Senate \nand House Intelligence Committees have been concerned with rising \npersonnel growth in the IC.\n  Finally, I have also just filed an amendment relating to a classified \ntechnology demonstration program. I talked about that last week. My \namendment, which has bipartisan support in both the House and the \nSenate and has been passed by both bodies in the past, will ensure that \nbillions of taxpayer dollars that have been wasted through poor \nmanagement and oversight will not be followed by more in the future.\n  This amendment, as I described last week, would say that before the \nNational Reconnaissance Organization embarks on spending billions of \ndollars on a program, it needs to do a demonstration program in the \nmillions of dollars category to see if all the systems work so that we \nhave a good idea before we get a system that has wasted billions and \nbillions of dollars to find out only then that it can't work.\n  I think Congress has a reasonably high expectation of the DNI and of \nhis ability to reform the intelligence community, but we cannot expect \ngreat results if we don't give the authorities and the support he needs \nto demand performance and accountability. My amendments will give him \nthese authorities and will also allow Congress to perform our real \neffective oversight duties.\n  These amendments have been vetted with the Intelligence Committees \nover the past 2 years and most were contained in the 2008 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act that passed both Houses of Congress. I believe and I \nthink my colleagues' votes over the past 2 years have shown that they \nmake sense and are reasonable.\n  If there is no consideration of including these amendments or simply \nallowing a vote on the budget amendment, which is the most important of \nall, then I am left with little choice but to continue to object to any \nUC agreements on this bill.\n  I thank my distinguished colleagues, the Chair, and the ranking \nmember, for listening to my comments, and I look forward to being able \nto work out with them a reasonable accommodation of these very \nimportant matters that I think are essential to ensuring effective \nintelligence oversight of the money that we spend in the National \nIntelligence Program.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, may I inquire what is the business before \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I have an amendment I have filed with the floor \nleadership on this bill dealing with Iran sanctions. It is called the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act for \n2008. I want to share some thoughts about this proposal with my \ncolleagues. I am fully cognizant that our friend from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, the manager of this bill, has a lot of amendments with which he \nis dealing. I don't know whether we will have a chance to actually vote \non this bill, but I want to spend a few minutes talking about the \nimportance of this amendment and its value.\n  Obviously, there is a lot going on today with the financial crisis in \nthe country. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I will have more to \nsay about that tomorrow. I have been having conversations with fellow \ncommittee members among others.\n  Today I want to talk about this issue specifically and then address \nan issue as well dealing with the devastation of Hurricanes Gustav and \nIke and Tropical Storms Fay and Hanna that ripped through the \nCaribbean.\n  We are considering, of course, the Defense authorization bill. This \nproposal, adopted and developed by the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs in conjunction with my Republican colleague and \nfriend, Richard Shelby of Alabama, former chairman of the committee, \nwould impose tough new sanctions on the Government of Iran, to \nauthorize investors to divest from companies active in Iran's energy \nsector and to combat the proliferation of black market weapons networks \noverseas.\n  I am delighted to have my colleague, Senator Shelby, as a sponsor of \nthe amendment. In my view, we need a comprehensive strategy on Iran \nthat builds our leverage within the context of a major new diplomatic \npush for meaningful negotiations.\n  Let me be clear. Sanctions against the Government of Iran are not an \nend unto themselves but, rather, one means of driving a resolution of \nthe problem of Iran's apparent nuclear ambitions. The Europeans' recent \ndecision to impose additional financial sanctions on Iran is a very \npositive development that exerts further pressure to that end. The \napproach embodied in the bill I am talking about this afternoon is \ntargeted and strategic, maximizing the economic leverage of the United \nStates, our partners and allies in Europe and elsewhere, and \ninternational investors, while avoiding the risk of a more \nindiscriminate approach.\n  The Banking Committee exercises jurisdiction over virtually all \naspects of U.S. financial and economic sanctions policy toward Iran, \nwhich can be summarized in three categories: No. 1, the U.S. trade and \ninvestment ban administered by the Treasury Department's Office of \nForeign Assets Control; No. 2, sanctions against foreign companies that \ninvest substantially in the energy sector, proceeds from which support \nIran's proliferation or terrorism-related activities; and, No. 3, \ntargeted financial measures, including freezing assets of individuals \ninvolved in that proliferation.\n  Last year, the committee conducted a hearing on the effectiveness of \nIran sanctions. Working with the administration, the Banking Committee \nacted swiftly to strengthen the U.S. trade/investment ban, and \nultimately we saw enactment in October of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Enhancement Act. This new law holds violators of U.S. \nsanctions law accountable, adding, I might add, jail time and severe \nfines against those investing in Iran or other state sponsors of \nterror.\n  Also, last year, shortly after the House of Representatives acted on \nits version of Iran-related legislation, I then asked the majority \nleader, Senator Harry Reid, to expedite Senate consideration of various \nIran-related bills. The leader, as you might expect, agreed and moved \nquickly. But we were unable to clear them completely on the other side \nof this Chamber, which I regret.\n  The Government Accountability Office then issued a report last \nDecember raising questions about whether our current sanctions regime \nagainst Iran furthers U.S. policy objectives and how they might be made \nmore effective. Among other things, that report concluded that the \nongoing illegal transshipment of sensitive dual-use technologies from \noften unwitting U.S. and other Western suppliers to countries such as \nIran--sometimes through three or four levels of suppliers--is one very \neffective way around current U.S. sanctions.\n  In recent months, the Banking Committee refined and combined in one \npackage various pieces of the Iran-related legislation, accommodating \nconcerns of Members on both sides of the political aisle and those of \nthe Bush administration. We now have a very streamlined bill that I \nhope will enjoy broad bipartisan support if I am given the opportunity \nto offer it on the Defense authorization bill. This streamlined version \nof this sanctions bill was reported out of the Banking Committee in \nJuly by a strong bipartisan vote of 19 to 2.\n  The missile tests that Iran conducted in July were provocative, and \nits persistent refusal to abide by United Nations Security Council \ndemands--despite a host of sanctions already in place--is very \ntroubling. Iran's behavior with respect to weapons proliferation, \nsupport for terrorism, destabilization of its neighbors, and threats \nagainst our allies and interests demands a very serious response.\n  We only have a few weeks remaining in this legislative session. We \nwill not return to actually legislate until late January of next year. \nI would hope we would find time, whether on this bill or some other \nvehicle, to enact, as I am confident we can, with a strong bipartisan \nvote, this Iran sanctions idea. This bill is one very important part of \nthat response.\n  I again thank Senator Shelby, my colleague, as well as other \ncommittee members, Republicans and Democrats, who worked together to \npass this legislation. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, Senator Brownback \nof Kansas, Senators Smith, Durbin, Lautenberg, and others have worked \nvery hard on the Iran issues and deserve a great deal of credit for the \nproduct we have been able to put together. I thank, as well, Senator \nObama for his critical work on this Iran divestment legislation which, \nagain, was adopted in a strong bipartisan fashion by the committee as \npart of its integrated bill.\n  Current U.N. Security Council sanctions against the Government of \nIran have been extremely important, but I think we have an obligation \nto take measures, consistent with the objectives of the U.N. sanctions, \nto increase the leverage of the United States and our allies in a much \nmore aggressive, diplomatic, and political initiative to bring Iran \nback to the table and ultimately persuade its Government to change its \nbehavior.\n  Let me describe briefly the sanctions provisions.\n  First, the bill expands the definition of ``person'' under the Iran \nSanctions Act to include financial institutions, underwriters, \nguarantors, and other business entities and extends the applicability \nof sanctions to oil and gas pipelines and tankers. It imposes a broad \nban on imports directly from Iran to the United States and exports from \nthe United States to Iran of those few items still able to be shipped \nwhile exempting food and medicines to Iran, certain informational \nmaterials, and aids to navigation designed for safe operation of \ncommercial aircraft.\n  The bill also provides for a freezing of assets of those members of \nthe diplomatic community or Iranian military who have been identified \nby the President of the United States as active in weapons \nproliferation or terrorist activity. The bill clarifies that U.S. \nentities that establish a subsidiary for the purpose of getting around \nU.S. sanctions laws can be held liable for the activities of their \nsubsidiaries. The bill also increases funding to the Office of \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence of the Treasury Department to \nensure that the international financial system is not used by those who \nsupport terrorism or engage in proliferation-sensitive activities.\n  Finally, this bill imposes new requirements that the President \nactually make a determination and report every\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\n6 months to Congress regarding the sanctionability of certain eligible \ninvestments in Iran's energy sector. This is designed to address the \nproblem of billions of dollars in oil and gas investment projects being \nsubject to sanctions--over $27 billion in eligible oil and gas \ninvestments since 1999, according to the Congressional Research \nService--but successive administrations refusing to make final \ndeterminations required by law, much less impose appropriate sanctions \non entities involved in such projects, I might add, have raised some \ncertain issues.\n  In addition to expanding U.S. sanctions on the Government of Iran, \nthis bill would also provide a simple formula for divestment from firms \nwhich invest significant amounts in Iran's energy sector with \nprovisions patterned after the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act \nthat we all voted for earlier this year.\n  The rationale for this is straightforward. Many of us believe \nAmericans should be able to divest from energy firms doing business \nwith the Iranian regime whose policies they abhor and which by their \npresence indirectly help to prop up that regime. They should be given \nthe tools they need to make socially responsible decisions, and \ninvestors who choose to divest--States, large pension and mutual funds, \nand others--should be held harmless for these decisions. Likewise, \nfirms which continue to do business in the energy sector in Iran should \nrecognize the substantial risks involved in this decision and adjust \ntheir strategies accordingly.\n  This bill is as much about enabling investors to manage risk as about \nhaving Congress set foreign policy. Make no mistake. Investing in Iran \nthese days is risky business, and investors should be fully informed of \nthose risks going in. This bill does not require divestment, it simply \npermits it, as with the Sudan legislation--if the investments in Iran's \nenergy sector are substantial and if the divestment process is crafted \nconsistent with the provisions of this bill.\n  Divestment from Iran is already well underway nationwide, prompted by \ncampaigns patterned after the South African divestment movement and \nthat involving the Sudan. Eight States of our country have already \nenacted Iran divestment legislation. Other States have enacted broader \ndivestment legislation focused on state sponsors of terrorism. Many \nmore States are considering Iran divestment measures in their State \nlegislatures or have taken steps administratively to allow for such \ndivestment.\n  Some colleges and universities have begun to divest their holdings, \nas well, and efforts are underway at many more. Large cities, nonprofit \norganizations, pension and mutual funds have joined this campaign. It \nis a campaign that enjoys, I might add, worldwide support, and that \ncould provide significant economic leverage to the diplomatic and \npolitical efforts to curtail Iran's apparent nuclear ambitions.\n\n  How would it work? First, the amendment authorizes States and \nlocalities to divest from companies involved in the energy sector in \nIran and sets universal divestment standards. Secondly, the bill allows \nmutual fund and corporate pension fund managers to cut ties with \ncompanies involved in these key sectors and offers limited protection \nfrom lawsuits for those choosing to divest or not to invest in the \nfirst place, while preserving their normal fiduciary duties. Third, \nthis bill allows State and local governments to divest their public \npension funds from businesses invested in Iran's energy sector. Fourth, \nit establishes a new mechanism for disclosure for firms divesting their \nholdings in such entities and sunsets, I might add, the divestment \nmechanism when the President of the United States certifies that Iran \nhas ceased its support for international terrorism and its support of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Let's be very clear about what this amendment achieves in terms of \ndivestment--and what it does not do. It does not outsource foreign \npolicy to State and local governments or run afoul of the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution, as some have claimed. Rather, it protects \nthe rights of investors to make socially responsible decisions--to \nrefrain from holding assets that may serve to bolster the Government of \nIran. It allows States and other investors to divest in a relatively \nuniform way, if they so choose, so they may avoid the complications of \ndiverging approaches.\n  Under this bill, States can act out of concern for the long-term \nfinancial and reputational risks posed by an affiliation with certain \ninvestments in the nation of Iran. Once identifying these specific \nrisks, States are to inform the companies with a notice detailing such \nissues--not merely based on a foreign policy concern but on the State's \nassessment of the economic risks posed by investments in firms involved \nin certain energy-related business in Iran. It thus outlines a Federal \ndivestment policy--a complicated and yet very clear path consistent \nwith U.S. unilateral and multilateral sanctions already imposed, I \nmight add--and authorizes investors to act consistently with that \npolicy, again, if they so choose.\n  Finally, and very importantly--unlike other legislation acted upon by \nCongress--the amendment I am offering provides new incentives for \ncountries to strengthen their export control systems to stop the \nillegal diversion of sensitive and dual-use technology to countries \nsuch as Iran and imposes additional licensing requirements on those who \nrefuse to cooperate.\n  As we confront the realities of a global marketplace, with \nmanufacturers assembling parts of complex machinery such as aircraft \nand computers from a supply chain spanning the globe, and as regimes \nsuch as Iran, North Korea, and Syria trawl various transshipment hubs \nfor such parts to assemble high-technology weapons, it makes sense to \naddress this problem head on.\n  We have developed a way to do this similar to an approach previously \nproposed in regulatory form by the administration, with an array of \ncarrots and, if necessary, sticks to prod unwilling countries to get \nserious about developing and implementing tough, comprehensive export \ncontrol rules and systems. This measure will strengthen antidiversion \nmeasures, and it will help countries willing to bolster their systems \nto do so and impose tighter licensing restrictions on those countries \nthat have a record of spotty enforcement or that are unwilling to \nimprove their systems.\n  I was pleased we were able to come to an agreement on this \ncomprehensive approach in the Banking Committee. I might point out that \nsimilar legislation was adopted under the leadership of Senator Max \nBaucus and Chuck Grassley at the Senate Finance Committee, also, I \nmight add, on a bipartisan basis. Much more assertive diplomacy and \nefforts to bolster our relationship with Iran's people, coupled with \ntougher financial measures such as these to increase economic pressure \nto bring the Iranian Government to the table, is the way forward for \nU.S. policy.\n  Our European and other allies continue, as I mentioned earlier, to \nwork closely with the United States to increase economic and diplomatic \npressure on Iran. I happen to believe this measure complements those \ndiplomatic efforts. It is providing the kind of tools that those who \nare responsible for the conduct of foreign policy ought to have that \nwill give them the leverage necessary to try and bring Iran back to \nthat negotiating table, back to that political table, that will allow \nus to diffuse this growing problem, this threat that we all worry \nabout, and bring us to a conclusion that will be satisfactory to us and \nto Iran, as well, I might point out. The steps contained in this bill \nare consistent with the strong international consensus that Iran's \nbehavior is unacceptable, and they are in sync with the U.N. sanctions \nand those additional sanctions imposed by our allies.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Shelby of the \nSenate Banking Committee, and the 17 other members of that committee, \nfor the adoption of this comprehensive, bipartisan proposal on Iran \nsanctions. My hope would be, as I said earlier, that we would have the \nopportunity to offer this proposal before the conclusion of this \nsession of Congress.\n  Madam President, I wish to briefly, if I could, turn to another \nsubject matter, and one that has certainly captured the attention of \nall of us in recent days; that is, of course, these tremendous storms \nthat have been raging through the Caribbean as well as, of course, the \ndevastating damage in Texas in the Galveston area, particularly. The \nsights and the pictures we\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\nare all witnessing on television and in the newspapers certainly bring \nback the dreadful memories of Katrina. These storms that have ravaged \nour country are natural disasters. Certainly our prayers and our hopes \nare with the people of the Galveston area and others who have been \nafflicted by the terrible flooding in the Midwest. We are concerned \nabout them, and we will do everything we can to help them put their \nlives back in order.\n  The devastation we have witnessed is heart-rending, and I think it is \nincumbent upon us to respond generously and speedily to help the tens \nof thousands along the Texas coast who need our help.\n  I rise also to discuss the humanitarian catastrophes inflicted \nagainst the people of the Caribbean. I chair the subcommittee on \nforeign relations that deals with Latin America, and I am particularly \ninterested, obviously, in what happens in this part of the world. I \nserved as a Peace Corps volunteer not far from the Haitian border of \nthe Dominican Republic when I left college in 1966. I served for 2 \nyears in that country, and I have gone back many times over the years \nand have maintained a close relationship. So when I see these storms \nravaging the island of Hispaniola, which includes the Dominican \nRepublic and Haiti, and roar through the island of Cuba--it has done \nsuch devastation; I am told it is the worst storm to inflict such \ndamage on that country in more than a half of century--I wish to take a \nmoment to talk about what we might do.\n  I support an amendment offered by Senator Lugar, the ranking member \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and which we have introduced \non a bipartisan basis. We hope this might be something that all of our \ncolleagues would support as well. It is to respond to the devastation \nthese storms have caused on the island of Cuba to the Cuban people.\n  Across the Caribbean, millions of people have been displaced, lost \ntheir homes, and watched helplessly as bridges and infrastructure were \nwashed out, leaving them isolated and without supplies. They face \nserious shortages of food, medicine, and hope.\n  The need in Haiti is extremely grave. USAID has undertaken an urgent \nprogram in Haiti, where hundreds of storm victims have died, thousands \nof homes have been destroyed, and untold people have been weakened by \nchronic malnutrition, lack food and water. USAID has already launched a \n$20 million program to rush assistance to the suffering people of \nHaiti, and further needs are certain to be identified there in our \nhemisphere's poorest country where the average income is something like \na few dollars a week. It is a nation that has been devastated over the \nlast number of years.\n  In Jamaica, 72 communities have been hit hard, leaving a dozen people \ndead and thousands without shelter. The U.S. Ambassador in Kingston has \ndeclared a disaster and has begun disbursing $100,000 there. USAID is \nworking with the Jamaican disaster specialists to purchase and deliver \nhundreds of thousands of dollars of supplies to communities cut off \nwhen roads were washed out. The relief supplies include hygiene kits, \nplastic sheeting, jerry cans, and blankets.\n  This very effective response brings relief to innocent victims of the \nstorms and it projects the American message of concern and hope for our \nCaribbean neighbors. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for our \nresponse to the crisis caused by the hurricanes that have battered the \nlives of the 11 million people on the island of Cuba. Evacuations of 2 \nmillion citizens helped reduce the loss of life, but the damage is \nimmense. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike destroyed 150,000 homes and \nseriously damaged 200,000 others. The United Nations estimates that \nCuba suffered between $3 billion and $4 billion in losses. Hundreds of \nthousands of victims are without shelter, fresh water, and electricity, \ndamage to agriculture is massive, food and medicine are in short \nsupply, and the need for materials to repair homes vastly overtakes \nsupply.\n  The State Department offered to disburse $100,000 in emergency funds \nthrough the U.S. Interests Section--our Embassy in Havana--which is a \nstep in the right direction, and I applaud them making that offer. In \naddition, over the weekend the State Department offered an emergency \nshipment of $5 million of assistance to Cuba. Cuban officials--in what \nI think is a very shortsighted move, in my opinion--rejected the offer, \nsaying they would not accept a handout from a country that would not \nsell the same items to them.\n  The administration has also authorized certain U.S.-based \nnongovernmental organizations, with activities the administration has \npreviously approved, to provide larger amounts of humanitarian \nassistance in Cuba, including cash donations to approved recipients for \n90 days. These Government-approved channels for assistance to \nGovernment-approved recipients are again steps in the right direction, \nbut given the devastation that has occurred, it is not hardly enough. \nThey disallow, moreover, the outpouring of assistance from Americans \nindividually who want to help directly and generously, as Americans do \nin times such as these, not just through administration-approved \nchannels.\n  Large numbers of the Cuban-American community in our country, eager \nto help family members back on the island of Cuba, are blocked from \ndoing so by tough regulations that the administration implemented in \n2004 in an effort to promote the collapse of the Cuban regime. These \nregulations dramatically and drastically impair citizens of our \ncountry--who come ethnically from the island of Cuba and who have \nfamily members there--of the ability to visit their families during \nthis time, even under extraordinary circumstances such as the death of \na loved one. The regulations drastically impair their ability to send \ncash assistance to families in the same manner as all other Caribbean, \nCentral American, and Mexican families do--families who have citizens \nin this country and have families in Jamaica and Haiti, the Dominican \nRepublic--to go there and provide assistance to them.\n  It is no secret that the U.S. embargo on Cuba has been, at least in \nmy view, a dismal failure. Rather than weaken the Cuban Government and \nforce it to change, it has only served to weaken the Cuban people and \ndeprive them of any hope at all. The administration's tougher \nregulations circumscribing Americans' right to help family and friends \nin dire need in Cuba are part of the same failed policy. Apparently, \nsome in the Bush administration believe that holding firm on embargo \npolicy--even during a humanitarian disaster--will discredit Fidel or \nRaul Castro and lead to their precipitous downfall. When human \nsuffering is as massive as we see in Cuba today after these hurricanes, \nthere is no room, in my view, for such cynicism.\n  Despite the obvious need for a total overhaul of policy toward Cuba, \nthe amendment Senator Lugar and I have introduced today addresses only \nthe immediate humanitarian crisis and only on a temporary basis. For a \nperiod of 180 days, our amendment would lift prohibitions on Americans \nwith families in Cuba to travel to the island to provide help during \nthe crisis. Secondly, only for 180 days, our proposal would ease \nrestrictions on the cash remittances by any American to Cuban people at \nthis time of extreme need--only for 180 days. Thirdly, our proposal \nwould expand the definition of gift parcels that Americans are \nauthorized to send to the Cuban people or nongovernmental organizations \nover the next 180 days to include food, medication, clothing, hygiene \nitems, and other daily necessities. Fourth, the bill would allow the \ncash sale using mechanisms similar to those already in place for the \nsale of agricultural products, of certain items Cubans need to rebuild \ntheir homes, again for a limited period of 180 days.\n  Let me be absolutely clear. These measures do not lift the embargo at \nall. They have nothing to do with the embargo per se but merely loosen \nsome of these less humane regulations implemented in 2004 in a direct \nresponse to a humanitarian crisis. Cuban Americans in this country \nought to be allowed to help their family members on the island of Cuba \nduring this time--for 180 days--to be able to send food and clothing \nand medicines, some cash remittances, or to travel there to help out, \nand they should not be banned by the United States of America.\n\n  Let me promise you something: Hugo Chavez will be filling that gap. \nWhy are we going to allow, in this hemisphere, someone in Venezuela \nwhom we abhor\n\n[[Page S8512]]\n\nto step in to provide some assistance and help when the United States \nought to be doing something, at least allowing people to step in to \nmake a difference in the lives of these people?\n  These are modest steps that allow the greatness and the generosity of \nthe American people to shine through without political or ideological \nfilters. I can think of no better way of giving the Cuban people a \nmessage of hope that we stand with them. We disagree with their \nGovernment and their Government policies, and we are not likely to \nchange that anytime soon. But we care about them and what happens to \ntheir families and their children. In a natural disaster, the worst in \n50 years, an island country 90 miles off our shore, we ought to be able \nto do a better job than sit here and lecture about geopolitics and \nallow them to go through this suffering without allowing people to help \nothers to get back on their feet again.\n  The intent of this amendment has broad support. The U.S. Conference \nof Catholic Bishops wrote:\n\n       In light of the devastation and humanitarian disaster \n     caused by recent hurricanes in Cuba and the efforts of \n     extended families, friends and organizations to reach those \n     in need, I urge you, [President Bush] to suspend--even \n     temporarily--Treasury and Commerce Department restrictions \n     and licensing requirements for humanitarian travel and \n     remittances by American citizens and assistance by not-for-\n     profit organizations. At times of crisis, there are simple \n     and basic acts of charity on which people rely.\n\n  The Catholic bishops and numerous NGOs are right, and we know it, and \nI think we should help.\n  To those who think that refusing to help will somehow serve our U.S. \nnational interests, I make just two observations. We need to be honest \nwith ourselves: To be seen as wanting the Cuban people to suffer and \nstarve--while we rush to the aid of their Caribbean neighbors--is not \ngoing to contribute to our common goal of promoting a peaceful, \ndemocratic transition, which Cuba desperately needs and deserves, and \ngood relations between our countries in the future.\n  Moreover, as we stand on the sidelines, other countries are more than \nwilling to fill that vacuum. As I mentioned a moment ago, President \nChavez of Venezuela has been most generous, according to press reports. \nRussia has sent four cargo planes with tons of emergency supplies and \nconstruction materials. China has provided over $300,000. Spain has \nalready sent planeloads of relief supplies. Brazil, Argentina, and \nMexico are offering assistance without political restrictions.\n  Senator Lugar and I believe this is a moment in which we ought to set \naside--at least for 180 days--our differences to a nation of people who \nare less than 100 miles off our shore, who have family members--many \ncourageous people who live in this country and who want to do something \nto help their family members and friends as they go through recovering \nfrom these terrible storms that have ravaged their nation. At the \nappropriate time, Senator Lugar and I wish to offer this amendment and \nurge our colleagues, whatever other differences we may have had and \nwill have on Cuban policy, this is a moment when we all ought to come \ntogether to step up and make a difference in the lives of people who, \nfrankly, could use the help.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, honest people may have differences of \nopinion as to what type of public policies to pursue to improve our \neconomy, but there should not be a difference of opinion in terms of \nthe state of the economy today, whether it is in Michigan, your State, \nwhether Vermont, my State, or any of the other 48 States. The fact is \nthat for tens and tens of millions of working families in this country, \npeople are having and experiencing great difficulty. And within that \ncontext and the context of the Wall Street Journal reporting that today \nwas a day when America's financial system was shaken to its core, and \nthe Dow Jones average went down by some 500 points, I found it rather \nstunning, if I may use that word, to hear Senator McCain state that \n``the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' In saying that he is \nsimply echoing what President Bush has been saying year after year \nafter year, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. One does try \nto get a handle on understanding what world Senator McCain and \nPresident Bush are living in when they would suggest that ``the \nfundamentals of our economy are strong.'' Clearly, they have not been \ntalking to working families around the United States of America.\n  My perception of the economy is if you get off of the country club \ncircuit, you stop talking to the millionaires and the billionaires and \nthe large campaign contributors, and you talk to ordinary working \npeople, people who own small businesses, what you find, in fact, is \nthat the middle class in our country is under more assault than has \nbeen the case since before the Great Depression.\n  The reality of American life today is that poverty is increasing. \nOver 5 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class into \npoverty. What we have all over America is families where mom and dad \nare both working and are now lining up outside emergency food shelves \nbecause the limited income they are earning is not providing enough \nmoney to provide the food they and their kids need. That does not \nsuggest to me that the fundamentals of our economy are strong.\n  Since President Bush has been in office, over 7 million Americans \nhave lost their health insurance, and the cost of health insurance has \nsoared. Approximately 20,000 Americans die every single year because \nthey can't gain access to medical care, to primary health care. We \nspend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, yet \nwe are the only nation in the industrialized world that does not \nprovide, by law, health care to all of its people. That does not \nsuggest to me that ``the fundamentals of our economy are strong.''\n  Health care is perhaps the most basic need, maybe outside of food, \noutside of shelter, that people have, and 46 million Americans are \nwithout health insurance. I don't quite understand how Senator McCain \nbelieves in that regard that ``the fundamentals of our economy are \nstrong.''\n  Since President Bush has been in office, median income for working-\nage Americans has gone down by over $2,000 after adjusting for \ninflation. Family income is going down. People are spending more for \nfood. The cost of gas, of course, is now off the wall. College \neducation costs are up. How does that sound like a situation in which \n``the fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' according to Senator \nMcCain.\n  I think the confusion in all of this is pretty easily understood. The \ntruth is ``the fundamentals of our economy are strong'' if you are \nwithin the top 1 percent of our country. If you are a millionaire or \nbillionaire, you know what, Senator McCain is right; the fundamentals \nof the economy are strong for those people.\n  If you are one of the 400 wealthiest people in our country, you \ncollectively own $1.4 trillion of America--400 families, and your \nwealth has exploded in the last 8 years. In fact, in America today, the \ntop one-tenth of 1 percent earn more income than do the bottom 50 \npercent. Within that context, certainly, if you are among the top one-\ntenth of 1 percent, we can understand why Senator McCain would suggest \nthat ``the fundamentals of our economy are strong.''\n  What frightens me is that anyone who is so removed from the economic \nreality facing the American people clearly is not going to have a \nprescription on how to address the real problems facing ordinary \nAmericans. If your diagnosis is wrong, if you are a physician and you \nmake an incorrect diagnosis, your treatment is not going to work very \nwell. If you are President of the United States, whether it is Bush or \nsomething that McCain aspires to, clearly your actions are not going to \nbe effective if you do not understand what is going on.\n  Let me, if I might, contrast what has been going on under President \nBush compared to what was going on under President Clinton. I am not \nhere to tell\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\nyou that under President Clinton everything was rosy, there were no \nproblems. That certainly was not the case, and I, personally, as an \nindependent, had some strong disagreements with the Clinton \nadministration on a number of issues, including trade. But it is \nimportant to understand, contrasting what Clinton accomplished for the \nmiddle class as opposed to what Bush did. In fact, McCain's ideas are \nto follow economically the line of action that President Bush has \nestablished over the last 8 years.\n  During the Clinton administration, over 22 million new jobs were \ncreated. Were all of those jobs great-paying jobs? No, they were not. \nBut 22 million jobs is a significant number of new jobs. Under the Bush \nadministration, less than 6 million new jobs were created--22 million \nversus 6 million.\n  During the Clinton administration, 6 million Americans were lifted \nout of poverty. They went from poverty to the middle class. That is \ngood. Under the Bush administration, the exact opposite occurred; 6 \nmillion Americans went from the middle class into poverty.\n  Under Clinton, median income went up. Under Bush, median income went \ndown.\n  I am not quite clear how our colleague, Senator McCain, believes that \n``the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' The dynamic of what is \ngoing on in this country economically is that under the Bush-McCain \neconomic policies, 99 percent of Americans have been net losers under \nPresident Bush's tax-and-spend policies. What we are seeing is a \nhistorical shift, a redistribution of wealth and income from the middle \nclass to the very wealthy. We are talking about hundreds of billions of \ndollars going out of the pockets of the middle class, ending up in the \npockets of the wealthiest 1 percent.\n  I sit on the Budget Committee. I have some sense of where this \ncountry is spending its money and where this country is not spending \nits money. I have very great concerns that 4 more years of Bush's \npolicies, in which we continue to give huge tax breaks to the \nwealthiest 1 percent, while underfunding the needs of the middle class \nand working families, while ignoring our environment, while not \ninvesting in sustainable energy, while maintaining an absurd health \ncare policy in which health care costs rise and in which more and more \npeople are underinsured--I fear that 4 more years of those policies \nwill create a situation from which the middle class of this country may \nnever recover.\n  What the American dream has always been about is that parents work \nvery hard--that was certainly the case within my family--to try to see \ntheir kids do better than they did. My parents never went to college. \nMy parents never had much money. My parents never in a million years \nwould have dreamed that their son would be a Senator. That is way \noutside their wildest dreams. They worked hard so my brother and I \ncould have a better life economically than they did.\n  What I worry about--and it is not just me, it is economists all over \nthis country who are now looking at our economy, the fact that we are \nshedding millions of good-paying, blue-collar jobs, that we are \nshedding millions of good-paying, white-collar jobs--what economists \nare now saying is that for the first time in the history of this \ncountry our kids, the young people, our grandchildren, if we do not \nreverse tack, will have a lower standard of living than their parents.\n  In other words, the American dream, which is what the middle class \nhas been all about, is now turned upside down. There are large numbers \nof working people today who are earning less money than their parents \ndid while living in less adequate housing than their parents did. It \nseems to me, if there is anything we have learned over the last 8 \nyears--in which President Bush has given an incredible amount of tax \nbreaks to people who do not need them, in which we have deregulated \nindustry, where we have ignored global warming and investing in \nsustainable energy--it seems to me, if there is anything we have \nlearned in the last 8 years, it is that this trickle-down economics of \ntax breaks for billionaires and cutting back on the needs of ordinary \npeople is not the direction in which this country should be moving.\n  Please count me in as someone who does not believe, as Senator McCain \ndoes, that ``the fundamentals of this economy are strong.'' I think the \nmiddle class is being shaken right now. People are frightened, and we \nneed a new course for this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8513-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8513-S8516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CHILD SOLDIERS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am going to make a short statement in \nreference to S. 2135. After that statement, I will ask to lay before \nthe Senate a Message from the House with respect to that.\n  I would like to say at the outset that this bill, S. 2135, is known \nas the Child Soldiers Accountability Act.\n  In January of 2007, at the beginning of this Congress, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee embarked on an experiment, establishing a new \nsubcommittee, called the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee. It was \nthe first time in the 219-year history of the Senate that a \nsubcommittee or committee focused specifically on the issue of human \nrights was formed.\n  I thank Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Judiciary \ncommittee, for giving me the opportunity to serve as the first chairman \nof the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee.\n  Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, is the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee. Senator Coburn and I disagree on many issues, but we \nhave formed an unusual partnership in this subcommittee, working across \nparty lines to address some of the most urgent human rights crises in \nthe world.\n  One of the first hearings we held focused on the scourge of child \nsoldiers.\n  We learned that up to 250,000 children currently serve as combatants, \nporters, human mine detectors and sex slaves in state-run armies, \nparamilitaries and guerilla groups around the world.\n  Under treaties that we have ratified, there is a clear legal \nprohibition on recruiting and using child soldiers. But, as we learned \nat our hearing, recruiting and using child soldiers does not violate \nU.S. criminal or immigration law.\n  Senator Coburn and I introduced the Child Soldiers Accountability Act \nto close this loophole in the law. This legislation will make it \nillegal under U.S. criminal and immigration law to recruit or use child \nsoldiers.\n  This bipartisan bill will ensure that those who recruit or use \nchildren as soldiers will not find safe haven in our country. It will \ngive the U.S. Government the tools to prosecute or deport the war \ncriminals who commit this horrible human rights abuse.\n  The Child Soldiers Accountability Act passed the Senate unanimously \nlast December. The Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives \nheld a hearing on the bill and made some thoughtful revisions. Earlier \nthis week, the House passed the legislation unanimously. Now, the \nSenate is poised to send it to President Bush for his signature.\n  I would like to thank all of my colleagues in the Senate for \nsupporting the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, especially, Senator \nCoburn, the bill's lead Republican cosponsor; Judiciary Committee \nChairman Leahy, a cosponsor who helped shepherd the bill through the \nCommittee; and Senators Russ Feingold and Sam Brownback, the bill's \nother original cosponsors\n  I would also like to thank Members of the House of Representatives \nfor their support, especially John Conyers and Lamar Smith, the \nchairman and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee; Bobby \nScott and Louie Gohmert, the chairman and ranking member of the Crime \nSubcommittee; and Zoe Lofgren and Steve King, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the House Immigration Subcommittee.\n  At our hearing on child soldiers, we heard moving testimony from a \nremarkable young man named Ismael Beah. Mr. Beah is a former child \nsoldier and author of the bestselling book ``A Long Way Gone: Memoirs \nof a Boy\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nSoldier.'' Mr. Beah said the Child Soldiers Accountability Act ``would \nset a clear example that there is no safe haven anywhere for those who \nrecruit and use children in war.'' Mr. Beah also posed a challenge to \nall of us:\n\n       When you go home tonight to your children, your cousins, \n     and your grandchildren and watch them carrying out their \n     various childhood activities, I want you to remember that at \n     that same moment, there are countless children elsewhere who \n     are being killed; injured; exposed to extreme violence; and \n     forced to serve in armed groups, including girls who are \n     raped. . . . As you watch your loved ones, those children you \n     adore most, ask yourselves whether you would want these kinds \n     of suffering for them. If you don't, then you must stop this \n     from happening to other children around the world whose lives \n     and humanity are as important and of the same value as all \n     children everywhere.\n\n  We have a moral obligation to respond to Mr. Beah's challenge. I hope \nthe Child Soldiers Accountability Act is one small step towards ending \nthe scourge of child soldiers.\n  Madam President, this narrowly tailored bipartisan legislation would \nmake it a crime and a violation of immigration law to recruit or use \nchild soldiers. Congress must ensure that perpetrators who use children \nto wage war are held accountable and do not find safe haven in our \ncountry.\n  The Child Soldiers Accountability Act passed the Senate unanimously \nin December 19, 2007. On September 8, 2008, the House passed the bill \nunanimously with modest revisions. Now the Senate is poised to pass \nthis.\n  I would like to again thank all of my colleagues in the Senate who \nhave worked with me to enact the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, \nespecially, Senator Tom Coburn, the bill's lead Republican cosponsor \nand the Ranking Member of the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee, \nwhich I chair; Senator Patrick Leahy, a cosponsor of this bill and \nChairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has been a leader on \nthis and so many other human rights issues; Senator Russell Feingold, \nand Senator Sam Brownback, the bill's other original cosponsors; and \nSenators Christopher Dodd, John Kerry, Blanche Lincoln, Barack Obama, \nand Robert Menendez, the bill's other sponsors.\n  I would also like to thank members of the House of Representatives \nwho worked diligently to revise and pass the Child Soldiers \nAccountability Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, especially \nRepresentatives John Conyers and Lamar Smith, the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the House Judiciary Committee; Representatives Bobby Scott \nand Louie Gohmert, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Crime, \nTerrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee; and Representatives Zoe \nLofgren and Steve King the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House \nImmigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International \nLaw Subcommittee.\n  Of all the unspoken casualties of war, the use of children as \nsoldiers is among the most heartbreaking and horrific. Up to 250,000 \nchildren are currently serving as soldiers around the world. State-run \narmies, paramilitaries and guerrilla groups use these girls and boys--\nsome as young as 7 or 8 years old--as combatants, porters, sex slaves, \nspies and human mine detectors. These child soldiers are denied the \nchildhood that our children and grandchildren have and to which every \nchild has an inalienable right.\n  In Burma, Chad, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda, government forces continue \nto recruit children, often through intimidation, coercion and violence. \nGovernment forces in countries such as Burundi, Colombia and the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo often use children as spies or informants. \nGovernment-backed militias in the Darfur region of Sudan, Sri Lanka and \nCote d'Ivoire use children in hostilities. Armed groups in Colombia, \nCote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo and northern Uganda \nhave raped girl soldiers and subjected them to other forms of abuse. A \nsenior officer in the Chadian National Army summed up the cold calculus \nthat drives government forces and armed groups to continue this \nabhorrent practice:\n\n       Child soldiers are ideal because they don't complain, they \n     don't expect to be paid, and if you tell them to kill, they \n     kill.\n\n  Despite all of this, there are signs that the world is beginning to \nrise to the challenge of stopping the use of children in armed \nconflict. Since 2004, there has been a decrease in the number of \nconflicts in which children are directly involved, from 27 in 2004 to \n17 by the end of 2007. More than 110 countries, including the United \nStates, have adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the \nRights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, \nan international agreement that sets the minimum age for compulsory \nrecruitment of soldiers at 18. International courts have begun \nprosecuting those who use child soldiers.\n  While these are important and positive developments, the reality is \nthat war criminals around the world continue to use children to wage \nwar with virtual impunity. The ability of international courts to \nprosecute those who recruit child soldiers is severely limited. Too \nmany perpetrators still believe they are outside the reach of the law. \nNational courts can and must play a greater role in prosecuting \nperpetrators.\n  As a nation founded upon the principle of individual freedom and a \nhistorical leader on human rights, the United States has a special \nobligation to lead the effort to end the use of child soldiers \nworldwide.\n  Unfortunately, recruiting and using child soldiers does not violate \nU.S. criminal or immigration law. As a result, war criminals who have \nforced children into combat can find safe haven in the U.S. and our \ngovernment has no power to prosecute them. In contrast, other grave \nhuman rights violations, including genocide and torture, are punishable \nunder U.S. criminal and immigration law.\n  I introduced the Child Soldiers Accountability Act to close this \nloophole. This bill will make it a crime to recruit or use persons \nunder the age of 15 as soldiers. It will also enable the government to \ndeport or deny admission to an individual who recruited or used child \nsoldiers under the age of 15.\n  Only a handful of countries have passed legislation creating criminal \npenalties for the use or recruitment of child soldiers to date. By \nenacting this legislation, the United States will lead the way towards \na future where war criminals who recruit or use child soldiers will not \nfind safe haven anywhere in the world. We will send a clear message to \nthose adults who deliberately recruit or use children to wage war that \nthere are real consequences for their actions.\n  By holding such individuals criminally responsible, our country will \nhelp to deter the recruitment and use of child soldiers. This bill will \nprovide an important new tool to the Domestic Security Section in the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division, which bears primary \nresponsibility for criminal prosecutions of human rights abusers.\n  We can help to end impunity for the recruitment and use of child \nsoldiers by deporting or denying admission to foreign perpetrators and \nworking with their home governments to ensure they will be prosecuted \nupon return. There have been only a few international and national \nprosecutions for child soldier use or recruitment to date. Under the \nChild Soldiers Accountability Act, an individual who recruited or used \nchild soldiers need not have been convicted of doing so in order to be \ndenied admission or deported. Requiring a conviction would allow those \nwho use children to wage war to benefit from the prevailing impunity \nfor this crime.\n  Recognizing that perpetrators often use drugs, threats, violence or \nother means to pressure child soldiers into committing serious human \nrights violations, including the recruitment of other children, this \nlegislation seeks to hold adults accountable for their actions and is \nnot intended to make inadmissible or deportable child soldiers who \nparticipated in the recruitment of other children. This legislation \nshould not be interpreted as placing new restrictions on or altering \nthe legal status of former child soldiers who are seeking admission to \nor are already present in the United States.\n  Former child soldiers should be treated as victims and should not be \nsubjected to punitive measures for offenses they committed while they \nwere children. Effectively rehabilitating and reintegrating child \nsoldiers into society requires extensive care and support from family \nand others. In the absence of such support, former child soldiers\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\nmay become a generation of adults that will perpetuate conflict and \nundermine security, creating unforeseen challenges that our children \nwill have to address.\n  Last month, at the Beijing Olympic Games, Lopez Lomong, who was \nabducted at the age of six to be trained as a child soldier in Sudan, \ncarried the United States flag at the opening ceremony. Mr. Lomong \nescaped the militia camp where he was held with three other boys and, \nafter ten years at a refugee camp, resettled in the United States with \na family in New York and went on to represent the United States at the \nOlympics. This incredible journey shows us how important it is to \nprovide opportunities to those children who have been recruited or used \nto serve as combatants.\n  Recruiting and using child soldiers is morally wrong and must be \nstopped. Unfortunately, neither moral suasion nor international \nagreements has brought this abhorrent practice to an end. We must end \nimpunity for this horrific crime by closing the loopholes in our laws \nand prosecuting those who use or recruit child soldiers as the war \ncriminals they are.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \npass S. 2135, the Child Soldiers Accountability Act, which will combat \nthe unconscionable practice of using children as soldiers in violent \nconflicts. I thank Senator Durbin and Senator Coburn for introducing \nthis important legislation and I am proud to be a cosponsor. I also \nthank them for their leadership on the Judiciary Committee's new \nSubcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. Their leadership in working \nwith the House sponsors to produce a consensus bill that we can all \nsupport has been critical. The United States should do all it can to \nprevent and punish this conduct, which is so contrary to our values.\n  The use of children as soldiers has been universally condemned as \nabhorrent and unacceptable. Yet over the last decade hundreds of \nthousands of children have fought and died in conflicts around the \nworld. This legislation would close the gap in our law and enable the \nU.S. Government to bring child soldier perpetrators that are found in \nour country to justice.\n  This bill creates a tough new criminal provision aimed at those who \nrecruit or conscript children under the age of 15 into armed conflict. \nIt extends U.S. jurisdiction to perpetrators of this crime who are \npresent in the United States, regardless of their nationality and where \nthe crime takes place, so that those who exploit children will not find \nthis country to be a sanctuary from prosecution. The bill also amends \nimmigration law to allow those who have used children as soldiers to be \nbarred or removed from the United States.\n  This bill is the second piece of legislation to pass both houses of \nCongress resulting from the work of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Human Rights and the Law. I was proud to work with \nSenator Durbin to create the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee. I \nam glad that the efforts Senator Durbin and I have made to make this \nsubcommittee a force for change and to bring focus on these important \nissues is resulting in legislative action, as well as providing a forum \nto put a spotlight on important issues. The aubcommittee has already \nworked to make the Genocide Accountability Act law, and it will soon \nprovide a powerful new tool in America's efforts to prevent and punish \ngenocide. The Subcommittee has made further progress with hearings and \nlegislation dealing with human trafficking and other vital issues.\n  The conduct prohibited by the Child Soldiers Accountability Act is \nappalling but happens all too often throughout the world. We should do \neverything we can to stop this offense to human rights and human \ndignity, which exacts such great costs from too many of the world's \nchildren. I commend the Senate for passing this important legislation \ntoday and I hope the President will quickly sign this legislation into \nlaw.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \na message from the House with respect to S. 2135.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the House \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 2135\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 2135) entitled \n     ``An Act to prohibit the recruitment or use of child \n     soldiers, to designate persons who recruit or use child \n     soldiers as inadmissible aliens, to allow the deportation of \n     persons who recruit or use child soldiers, and for other \n     purposes'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Today was an ominous day on Wall Street. It is my \nunderstanding that the Dow Jones Index may have lost more than 500 \npoints by the close of business. It is a day that will be remembered, \nbut it will be remembered not just for that loss but what led to it. \nThe announcement over the weekend that Lehman Brothers, one of the \npremier investment banks in the city of New York, was facing financial \ntrouble and may close was followed by the announcement that Bank of \nAmerica was going to acquire Merrill Lynch. It has been one body blow \nafter another when it comes to economic news in America--first the \nrescue of Bear Stearns, then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, where our \nFederal Government last weekend had to announce that we were coming to \ntheir rescue to keep these giants of the housing industry afloat until \nthis economy improves.\n  All of these things coming together today has obviously caused \nconcern across America. Many people have commented on the situation, \nand one of those was the Senator from Arizona, Mr. John McCain. I will \nquote what Senator McCain said today in Jacksonville, FL, about the \nproblems facing Wall Street:\n\n       You know, there has been tremendous turmoil in our \n     financial markets and Wall Street. People are frightened by \n     these investments. Our economy--I think still the \n     fundamentals of our economy are strong, but these are very, \n     very difficult times. I promise you we will never put America \n     in this position again.\n\n  This is not the first time John McCain has made a pronouncement on \nthe state of America's economy and announced it strong. And I would say \nto Senator McCain that despite his travels across the United States, he \nhas not had an opportunity to sit down with people who are trying to \nwork for a living and trying to make ends meet at home. If he did, he \nwould understand that what happened today on Wall Street, as troubling \nas it is, is merely an echo of what has happened across America among \nworking families for the last several years. We are now seeing \nunemployment rates at record levels. We are seeing mortgage \nforeclosures at historic highs. We are watching as the retirement \nsavings of workers and families across America are diminished every \nsingle day by the decline in the stock market and their investments. We \nare watching major banks across America collapse because of poor \nmanagement and poor oversight by this Government. And most of us \nbelieve it is a clear signal that we need to step up for change in the \neconomic policy in America.\n  Senator McCain clearly believes this economy is still fundamentally \nstrong. Let him tell that to a working family in Illinois, a family \nwhom I recently ran into downstate struggling to get by, their kids \nwith student loan debt; the family worried about the plant closing in \nBloomington, IL; a daughter with a college degree can find no better \njob than a bartender; a husband and father worried about where his \nkid's future is going to lead. This is the state of the economy today \nfor those who do not live in the rarified atmosphere of Washington.\n  This economy is troubling. In the State of Michigan, one out of eight \npeople is on food stamps. And to say that this is a fundamentally \nstrong economy overlooks the obvious. The Presiding Officer, from the \nState of Vermont, is a Senator who understands firsthand that in the \nNew England area, people will face heating oil costs this winter that \nwill double. For many of them, it is thousands of dollars just to keep \ntheir homes warm--one of the basic necessities of life. These are the \nrealities of life in America.\n  Those who argue the economy is strong are overlooking the obvious. \nFor many people, this economy is failing them. No matter how hard they \nwork, no matter how many hours they put in, how many jobs they have to \ntry to put together to keep their families fed, warm, and clothed, it \nbecomes impossible. As they fall further and further behind, they turn \nto Washington and say: What are you going to do about it?\n  This is the obvious question for us in Washington: Are we going to \ncontinue the Bush economic and tax policies we have seen over the last \n8 years? I certainly hope not. Look at where it has brought us. But \nSenator John McCain endorses the Bush economic policies. He will \ncontinue those policies. In fact, he will add on to them, giving tax \nbreaks to corporations such as Exxon-Mobil at a time when we need \nfundamental change in the economic policies of this country.\n  For Senator McCain to believe this is a strong economy is to overlook \nwhat is happening to real Americans, businesses, family farmers, and \nothers who are struggling to get by every day.\n  We need to promise the American people that the next 4 years won't be \nmore of the same, as Senator McCain has promised, but a real change \nhere in the economic philosophy in Washington. It has to be an economy \nthat really makes the American worker and the small business and the \nfamily farmer the central point of our economic philosophy.\n  We need a Tax Code that does not reward wealth but rewards work.\n  We need to make sure we have oversight by Federal agencies in \nWashington. The era of proclaiming that Government is the problem \nreally rings hollow when you look at the lack of Government oversight \nthat has led to so many economic failures.\n  There are times when the free market economy cannot regulate itself, \ncannot protect itself--in fact, may turn on itself if you are not \ncareful. The only chance for the consumers and workers is a government \nthat steps up, makes certain that greed does not overwhelm the basic \nfundamental principles behind a free market economy. That is what \nhappened to us in the subprime mortgage mess which has led to so many \nforeclosures across America, has led to this administration coming to \nthe rescue of major banks and financial institutions. If they have the \nright to be rescued, then they have the right to be regulated, as far \nas I am concerned.\n  As Paul Krugman said in this morning's New York Times, ``This is a \ntime for us to step up and understand there is a responsibility here in \nWashington.'' When Senator McCain does not see that, when he does not \nunderstand the economic challenges facing us, then he cannot really \npromise to bring change that we need to Washington, DC. We need to have \na government which has appropriate oversight of those financial \ninstitutions, understands that the credit market of America is no \nlonger, as Paul Krugman said, a market that is dominated by big banks \nin marble buildings but is a market that is dominated in many respects \nby investment banks that are loosely, if ever, regulated. That has to \nchange.\n  We also have to give assurance to the American people that hard work \nwill be rewarded. They have to know that if they go to work, work hard, \nbring home that paycheck, try to spend it to make sure their family is \nwell off, that at the end of the day, they can realize the American \ndream.\n  Most importantly--and Senator McCain may not agree with me on this--I \nam troubled by the fact that most Americans are now worried that their \nchildren will not be as rich as they were, that they will not have the \ncomfort many families have today. If we are going to reestablish the \nAmerican dream and really make it clear that this economy can serve \nworking families and middle-income families, then we have to get beyond \nSenator McCain's analysis that we are living in a strong economy. But, \nof course, what else could he say? He has endorsed the economic plan \nthat brought us to this moment. He is going to stick with it even if \nthe facts do not prove him right.\n  The American people have the last word on November 4, a chance to \nbring real change to this town, change to this Congress, and change to \nthe economic policies which have brought us to the sorry state we are \nin today.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8517-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8517-S8523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5369\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have an amendment I have filed to \nthe Defense authorization bill, amendment No. 5369. I would like a take \na few minutes to discuss it here today. I hope very much that this \namendment can be called up. Indeed, I hope the entire intelligence \nauthorization bill could be called up as a part of the compromise on \nthe Defense authorization.\n  Chairman Rockefeller on the Intelligence Committee has done exemplary \nwork to make sure we have a good, intense authorization bill. I hope \nvery much that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will allow \nthat to be called forward and voted on.\n  This particular amendment I want to talk about now, although it is \nsmall, is very important, and in my view it should be noncontroversial. \nThis amendment is cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Rockefeller, \nHagel, Kennedy, Feingold, Wyden, Cardin, and Dodd. I thank all of those \nSenators for their cosponsorship.\n  The amendment is simple. It holds the United States only to standards \nwe already require of our own military, only to standards we ourselves \ndemand of other nations. Put simply, the amendment would require \nAmerica's intelligence agencies to notify the International Committee \nof the Red Cross that an individual has been detained and to provide \nthe ICRC with access to that individual in a manner consistent with the \npractices of the U.S. military. These terms of access are very \nreasonable, and confidentiality by the ICRC is maintained.\n  I said this was an important amendment. Why is this important? Well, \nPresident Clinton said it well recently:\n\n       America's true strength comes from the power of our \n     example, not the example of our power.\n\n  If you really believe in our country and her virtue and in her \npromise, you understand this, and you understand what grievous and \nlasting harm America has suffered from this administration's embrace of \ntorture and from this administration's embrace of torture's handmaiden: \nsecret detention.\n  If you go down the corridors of history and you survey the evil \npractices of tyrant regimes, you find one of their most notorious \nmethods of coercion and subjugation is holding prisoners incommunicado. \nFrom the oubliettes of Bourbon, France, to Calcutta's Black Hole; from \nthe Gestapo's secret prisons to the Soviet gulags; from medieval \ndungeons to the bamboo cages of the Killing Fields, secret and \nanonymous imprisonment has always been the hallmark of the despot. Now \nthe Bush administration has stamped America with this shameful mark.\n  America long opposed disappearances and secret detentions around the \nworld as incompatible with our principles of liberty and justice. Just \nthis past March, in its 2007 Annual Human Rights Report, the U.S. \nDepartment of State criticized the Governments of North Korea, Burma, \nand Sri Lanka for engaging in ``disappearances.'' Yet, on December 8, \n2005, the Bush administration acknowledged that the ICRC did not have \naccess to detainees--to all detainees--held outside of Guantanamo. \nPresident Bush confirmed as much nearly 9 months later when he stated \npublicly that it had been ``necessary'' to move certain detainees to an \n``environment where they can be held secretly.''\n  This amendment should be unremarkable given the historic role of the \nICRC. The ICRC has been visiting detainees in connection with armed \nconflict since 1915. Last year, the ICRC visited 518,000 detainees in \n77 countries. This organization visits prisoners, in its words, ``to \nensure respect for their life, dignity and fundamental right to \njudicial guarantees.'' All these notions are part of the bedrock, as we \nknow, of our own Constitution. A seminal text on this subject, ``The \nTreatment of Prisoners Under International Law,'' describes the \nprohibition of incommunicado detention as among the most central of all \ninternational prisoner safeguards.\n  The ICRC holds this unique role in part because of the way it \nconducts its business.\n  After a visit, the ICRC reports its findings confidentially to the \ndetaining government. The ICRC has said this confidentiality is \nfundamental to its success, noting that it ``makes it easier for the \nICRC and the detaining authorities to achieve concrete progress in \ndetention places.'' Because of the ICRC's approach, this amendment \ncarefully safeguards our national security. There is even flexibility \nfor what are called ``imperative considerations of military \nnecessity.'' Notably, the ICRC has played an important role for U.S. \ntroops detained by other governments. The American Red Cross reports \nthat the ICRC visited 55 U.S. prisoners of war in Iraq during the first \ngulf war and three U.S. servicemembers in a Serbian prison during the \nKosovo conflict.\n  In World War II, in the places where the ICRC could operate, it \nprovided badly need assistance to U.S. soldiers. For example, in \nShanghai, one of the few areas the Japanese permitted ICRC access to \ndetainees, the ICRC delegate sent the U.S. prisoners of war food and \nclothing. PFC Floyd H. Comfort, a part of the Wake Island Marine \ngarrison said:\n\n       If it had not been for the International Red Cross, I guess \n     we all would have starved to death.\n\n  Respected members of our military family recognize that this \namendment would strengthen our ability to advocate for appropriate \ntreatment of Americans detained overseas. I would like to place in the \nRecord a letter from 38 retired military leaders, distinguished \ngenerals and admirals who have concluded this amendment is a ``critical \nmeasure to ensure continuing respect for the norm that [ICRC] access \nmust be provided to all captives in wartime.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 15, 2008.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Hagel,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Diane Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: As retired military leaders of the U.S. \n     Armed Forces, we write to express our strong support for \n     Amendment Number 5369 to the pending defense authorization \n     bill, originally introduced as section 323 of the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. We \n     believe this provision, which would require the intelligence \n     community to provide the International Committee of the Red \n     Cross (``Red Cross'') with notification of and access to \n     prisoners in U.S. custody in a manner consistent with the \n     practices of the Armed Forces, is a critical measure to \n     ensure continuing respect for the norm that such access must \n     be provided to all captives in wartime.\n       The U.S. military has a strong interest in all countries \n     upholding this norm. When our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \n     Marines go into battle, we owe them the assurance that, \n     should they be captured by the enemy, the United States will \n     be able to aggressively assert their rights to humane \n     treatment, to be held in recognized places of detention, and \n     to be registered with and visited by the Red Cross, which \n     can raise concerns about their treatment. This is \n     important no matter whether military or intelligence \n     agents are holding our people captive. When we violate \n     this norm ourselves, by holding prisoners in secret--``off \n     the books''--denying that they are in our custody and \n     refusing to permit the Red Cross access to them to monitor \n     their treatment, we dangerously undermine our ability to \n     demand that our enemies adhere to it, now and in future \n     wars.\n       This is not just a theoretical concern. In 1993, when U.S. \n     Warrant Officer Michael Durant was captured by forces under \n     the control of Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, the \n     United States demanded assurances that Durant's treatment be \n     consistent with the Geneva Conventions and that the Red Cross \n     be given access to Durant, who was seriously wounded, to \n     monitor that treatment. The United States asserted that it \n     would afford Somali forces the same protections. Within five \n     days, the Red Cross was permitted to visit Durant, and he was \n     subsequently released.\n       We know from painful experience that Red Cross access to \n     captured prisoners can be an important prophylactic against \n     abuse and can help to ensure that we are in compliance with \n     the laws of war in the treatment of those in our custody. \n     Confidential Red Cross reports and recommendations alert \n     military commanders to serious abuses that, left unaddressed, \n     can undermine prison discipline\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\n     and--if exposed--undermine the war effort. It was the Red \n     Cross which, according to a report by Major General George \n     Fay, notified military authorities in Iraq about the abuses \n     at Abu Ghraib, leading to some of the military's first \n     disciplinary actions against those involved.\n       The Red Cross has been visiting prisoners in armed conflict \n     situations since the height of First World War. Under U.S. \n     military policy, the Red Cross is presumptively authorized to \n     have access to prisoners. Moreover, Department of Defense \n     Directive 2310.01E, issued in September 2006, mandates that \n     the Red Cross ``be allowed to offer its services during an \n     armed conflict, however characterized, to which the United \n     States is a party.''\n       Over time, the Armed Forces have built a mutually \n     beneficial relationship with the Red Cross and have developed \n     well established practices for Red Cross notification and \n     access to prisoners. These practices are tailored to \n     accommodate the demands of battlefield intelligence gathering \n     and detention, and do not interfere with prisoner \n     interrogations.\n       Red Cross notification and access to prisoners is an \n     essential buttress to the integrity of humane treatment \n     obligations under the Geneva Conventions. We strongly support \n     Amendment Number 5369 to the pending defense authorization \n     bill and urge its adoption into law as an important step in \n     restoring the moral authority of the United States and \n     demonstrating the commitment of our Nation to treat all \n     prisoners humanely.\n           Sincerely,\n         General Joseph Hoar, USMC (Ret.); General John P.

This letter comes from battlefield warriors and \nintelligence officers who participated in every major American conflict \nfrom World War II until today. One of them, indeed, only 2\\1/2\\ years \nago, was a member of our Joint Chiefs of Staff. These flag officers go \non to say that ``when we violate this norm ourselves, by holding \nprisoners in secret--`off the books'--denying that they are in our \ncustody and refusing to permit Red Cross access to them to monitor \ntheir treatment, we dangerously undermine our ability to demand that \nour enemies adhere to it, now and in future wars.''\n  These military leaders also emphasize that the U.S. military's \npractices for ICRC notification and access to prisoners ``are tailored \nto accommodate the demands of battlefield intelligence gathering and \ndetention and do not interfere with prisoner interrogations.''\n  The ill-advised course that leads one down to darkness was famously \ndescribed by Winston Churchill. He said:\n\n       It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a \n     bit, the carpet ends. A little further on there are only \n     flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath \n     your feet.\n\n  This is the dark corridor down which a misguided administration has \nled America. The sooner we turn back, the stronger and safer America \nwill be. Remember also the Gospel according to Matthew, chapter 25, \nverses 36 to 40:\n\n       I was naked and you clothed me.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    County Payments Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, around the Halls of Congress this week are \nsome wonderful folks walking around in green shirts trying to save our \nrural schools and many rural communities across our country. These are \nfolks who come from areas such as mine where the Federal Government \nowns\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\nmuch of the land. For decades and decades, in these communities, the \nsecured money for funding schools in our State and for a variety of \nother services, such as police and essential needs for counties, has \ncome through Federal timber payments. As the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer knows, as a result of environmental law changes and other \npolicies these communities have been strapped for funds now for quite \nsome time.\n  In 2000, the distinguished Senator from Idaho Mr. Craig, and I, wrote \nlegislation that brought essential funds to these communities so they \ncould secure quality education for their students, for their families. \nBut the law expired in 2006. So we sought, then, to extend this program \non a multiyear basis. We had a vote in the Senate with overwhelming \nsupport for the legislation. Mr. President, 74 Senators voted for it, \nbut the other body was not able to pass the legislation. So at that \ntime the program was extended for just 1 year, and now it appears \nunless additional help is passed in this Congress, we are going to see \nmany of these communities simply not able to survive.\n  I have been told in my State alone two rural communities would simply \nhave to shut their doors, and we are looking at the prospect of the \nState taking over those communities.\n  The reason all those folks in the green shirts are walking the \ncorridors this week is they are making one last-ditch effort to get the \nfunding passed before these county governments have to make what are \nnot just drastic cuts to their budgets permanent but cuts that will be \nso severe, as I have indicated, the communities simply could not \nsurvive.\n  The energy tax extenders bill is the last best hope for getting this \ndone, and as a result of the exceptional work done by Chairman Baucus \nand Senator Grassley, the multiyear reauthorization of the county \npayments legislation has been included in their proposal. I think a \nnumber of colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been very \nsupportive of this effort. I particularly express my thanks to Chairman \nBaucus, the distinguished leader; Senator Reid, the chairman of the \nenergy community, and Senator Jeff Bingaman. All of them have been \nenormously helpful as we have prosecuted this cause for months on end.\n  On the Republican side, Senator Grassley has been extraordinarily \nhelpful. Senator Craig, who authored this legislation originally with \nme, has been very helpful. Senator Smith of my home State continues to \nstrongly support this effort. I am also very grateful to Senator Crapo \nfrom Idaho who continually brings up, at practically every session of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, how important it is to reauthorize this \nproposal.\n  I know in the last few weeks of our fall session it is going to be \neasy to block legislation and hard to pass it. But I am very hopeful \nthe energy tax legislation, which includes the county payments \nlegislation, which has the strong bipartisan support of Chairman Baucus \nand Ranking Member Grassley, will prevail in the Senate and will go to \nthe House of Representatives.\n  For literally decades, support from the Federal Government for these \nessential services, particularly schools in much of the country--but \nfighting meth, law enforcement, and other essential services in my \nState--have, in effect, been part of a bigger agreement with the \nFederal Government. In effect, what happened is something like 100 \nyears ago, when the National Forest System was created, the communities \nthat had largely forested areas said: We are going to offer a benefit \nto all the people of this country in terms of the National Forest \nSystem, but in return for placing these lands in public ownership, our \ncommunities would get support for essential services. For decades and \ndecades that went on, and it was quite beneficial to both sides--to the \nrural communities and to the Federal Government--and we saw in my home \nState people from all over the country come and enjoy the National \nForest System in Oregon and other communities around the United States.\n  But we saw, in the late 1970s and 1980s, because of the change in \nenvironmental policy and changes in the size of the timber cut, the \nmoney shriveled up for these rural communities. So it is essential we \npass this legislation, particularly for this multiyear purpose, because \nit is our sense that in these rural communities, they know they have to \nlook to the future for a variety of other opportunities to have family \nwage employment.\n\n  For example, in our part of the world, we hope to have a very \nsignificant job-creating program to thin out the second row of trees. \nThis is an opportunity to get merchantable timber to the mills but do \nit in a way that helps family wage employment and is good for the \nenvironment. We are going to have rural communities and folks from the \nforest product sector and environmental leaders supporting us in that \neffort. In the other body, a friend of the Presiding Officer and \nmyself, Congressman Fazio, has championed a similar effort. But to set \nin place these new programs such as thinning and biomass, where we can \ncreate clean energy from our forests, we are going to need a bit of \ntime. That is why this multiyear program is so extraordinarily \nimportant.\n  It is my view that the best opportunity we have had for some time to \nget county payments passed has come about because of the strong \nbipartisan work done in this Chamber to add county payments to the \nenergy tax legislation. It is my hope, as we did when 74 Senators came \ntogether to support the original legislation I offered in this session, \nthat, once again, we can get strong bipartisan support for county \npayments as part of the energy tax bill. If we can get it sent from the \nSenate in a timely way to the other body, I think this time it will be \npossible to thread the needle, secure the funding for our rural \ncommunities, give them the opportunity to make the transition to these \nother areas that will allow them to strengthen their economy and \nparticularly bring to our schools, to our law enforcement agencies the \ntools that are so desperately needed at this critical time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment \nNo. 5276 to the National Defense Authorization Act, an amendment that \nwould establish a government-wide Contingency Contracting Corps.\n  Through numerous hearings and investigations, the Senate Homeland \nSecurity Committee has documented many costly failures in contracting \nand acquisition management related to Federal operations following \nHurricane Katrina and in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Special Inspector \nGeneral for Iraq Reconstruction, other IGs, and the Government \nAccountability Office have also reported on serious problems in Federal \ncontracting. Many of these well-documented problems might have been \navoided or mitigated if the government had a reserve cadre of skilled \nacquisition professionals who could be dispatched to areas in urgent \nneed to assist with procurement and contract-management tasks.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 680, the Accountability in Government \nContracting Act of 2007, with Senators Lieberman, Carper, Coleman, and \nMcCaskill as original cosponsors. The Senate passed this bill \nunanimously last November 7, including a title that would establish a \ngovernment-wide Contingency Contracting Corps. Unfortunately, House \nleaders have failed to take up our unanimously passed bill.\n  Just a few days before the Senate action, the Army released the \nreport of a special commission on procurement headed by former Under \nSecretary of Defense Jacques Gansler. The Gansler Report noted that \nwhile contracting workload had increased by 350 percent since 1995, the \nArmy's contract-oversight staff had declined by almost 50 percent. The \nreport's recommendations for more people, better training, \norganizational reform, and other improvements offer us a case study of \nthe challenges facing the Federal acquisition process.\n  ``First and most important is the people,'' Dr. Gansler said while \npresenting his report. He was right, and that truth is at the core of \nthe amendment that Senator Lieberman and I now offer.\n  The need for a Contingency Contracting Corps is urgent. The Federal \nGovernment purchases more than $440 billion of goods and services each \nyear. Some of these purchases are pursuant to contracts issued under \nthe stress and urgency of military operations or an emergency response.\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\n  Purchasing on such a prodigious scale and across a vast array of \ndepartments and programs can create abundant opportunities for fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. And doing so under the stress of military or \ndisaster-recovery operations without sufficient staff skilled in \nworking in those conditions can multiply the potential for trouble.\n  Unfortunately, our government moved into the 21st century with 22 \npercent fewer Federal civilian acquisition personnel than it had at the \nstart of the 1990s. And as noted, the decline in the DOD acquisition \nworkforce was even more pronounced.\n  We have seen that the urgent demands of natural disasters, a \nterrorist attack, or active military operations can overwhelm any \nagency's acquisition workforce. This amendment would provide the \nequivalent of a rapid-reaction force or strike team to ensure that \nemergency acquisition activities are performed swiftly, effectively, \nand economically.\n  The Corps would draw on volunteers from civilian and uniformed \nFederal-acquisition professionals. It would be managed by the OFPP \nAdministrator. The Administrator would be authorized to prescribe \nadditional training and determine when the Corps would be deployed. Any \ndeployments would be made in consultation with the heads of the \naffected agencies, and in the case of military or civilian DOD \nemployees, with the concurrence of the Defense Department.\n  The Contingency Contracting Corps is not a substitute for the many \nother reforms needed to improve government-wide acquisition, but it can \nhelp our Nation deal with urgent demands by temporarily reallocating \ntrained acquisition staff from their regular duties to areas of \npressing need. The Corps would help guard against the wasteful and \nexcessive spending that too often occurs in exigent circumstances.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this much-needed, carefully \nconstructed, and bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of amendment No. 5277 to \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, an amendment that will improve \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars while promoting more transparency and \ncompetition in the procurement of goods and services by our government. \nSenator Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, joins me in sponsoring this amendment.\n  Our amendment, the Accountability in Government Contracting Act, is a \nbipartisan response to contracting problems identified by the Homeland \nSecurity Committee that pose increasing dangers of waste, fraud, and \nabuse as Federal contracting continues to grow.\n  The amendment consists of provisions that passed the Senate \nunanimously last November as part of S. 680. Many of that bill's \nprovisions were included in last year's defense authorization. The \nremaining provisions are offered in this amendment, with modifications \nbased on discussions with other members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Joining Senator Lieberman and me in this effort are Senators Coleman, \nCarper, Akaka, McCaskill, and Tester.\n  The Federal Government purchases about $440 billion in goods and \nservices each year. The rising costs of military operations, natural \ndisasters, homeland security precautions, and other vital programs will \ndrive those expenditures to even higher levels in the years ahead.\n  This prodigious level of purchasing creates abundant opportunities \nfor fraud, waste, and abuse. We have seen far too many outrageous \nfailures in government contracting, such as unusable trailers for \nhurricane victims, shoddy construction of schools and clinics in \nAfghanistan, or the installation in Iraq of showers for our troops that \npose electric-shock hazards. All of these failures and more demand \nstrong steps to protect taxpayer dollars and deliver better acquisition \noutcomes.\n  Obstacles to improvement include personnel shortages, resource \nconstraints, poor program administration, and inadequate accountability \nan transparency in the contracting process.\n  The resource challenges go far beyond funding, and start with a \nsimple lack of trained personnel. The Federal Government moved into the \n21st century with 22 percent fewer Federal civilian acquisition \npersonnel than it had at the start of the 1990s. The Department of \nDefense, which has the largest acquisition budget, has been disbursing \nenormous amounts of money to contractors since the first Gulf war, but \nsaw its acquisition workforce shrink by more than 50 percent between \n1994 and 2005.\n  Among the current, attenuated Federal acquisition workforce, nearly \n40 percent were eligible to retire at the end of the last fiscal year. \nMeanwhile, the number and scale of federal purchases continue to rise, \nmaking this human-capital crisis even more dire.\n  Other challenges to fair, effective, and open competition and \noversight include inadequate definition of requirements, overuse of \nletter contracts that fail to include all critical terms until after \nperformance is complete, excessive tiering of subcontracts, and \ninsufficient publicly available data on Federal contracts.\n  Our amendment offers sensible, practical reforms to address these \nproblems.\n  A critical feature of this legislation will help recruit, retain, and \ndevelop an adequate Federal acquisition workforce. It establishes an \nacquisition internship program that will provide professional training \nand development for careers in Federal procurement and acquisition \nmanagement to at least 200 college graduates per year. Another \nprovision would require that government chief acquisition officers have \nextensive management experience--a requirement lacking in current law.\n  Our amendment also promotes more competition for government \ncontracts--a positive step for both contractors and taxpayers.\n  Competition for government contracts helps to control costs, \nencourage innovation, and improve quality. Unfortunately, the tide has \nbeen running the wrong way. While the dollar volume of Federal \ncontracting has nearly doubled since the year 2000, fewer than half of \nall ``contract actions''--new contracts and payments against existing \ncontracts--are now subject to full and open competition, down from more \nthan three-quarters in the year 2000.\n  Our Homeland Security Committee investigations of federal contracting \nproblems in the Hurricane Katrina disaster and in our military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan have confirmed the obvious concerns \nabout this trend.\n  We need more competition, less sole-source contracting, and tougher \nmanagement of Federal contracts. Our amendment mandates enhanced \ncompetition for each task or delivery order over the simplified \nacquisition threshold.\n  It further encourages competition for those orders by requiring \nInternet postings of notices of all sole-source task-or-delivery orders \nabove the simplified acquisition threshold, within 14 business days \nafter the award.\n  Another provision takes aim at abuse of interagency and enterprise-\nwide contracts, which account for 40 percent of Federal contract \nspending. It requires the Office of Federal Procurement Policy to \nsurvey, review, and provide guidance on procedures for creating, using, \nand continuing these interagency acquisitions. This step should \neliminate some of the redundancies that have been discovered in these \ncomplex arrangements--redundancies that reduce the government's \npurchasing power and waste tax dollars.\n  I shall briefly note some other important provisions of the \namendment.\n  The amendment will rein in the practice of hastily awarding letter \ncontracts missing key terms, such as price, scope or schedule, and then \nfailing to supply those terms until the contractor delivers the good or \nservice--thereby placing all risk of failure on the government. In Iraq \nand Katrina contracting, we saw the perils of failing to supply the \n``missing term'' promptly. For example, in July 2006, the Special \nInspector General for Iraq Reconstruction identified 194 individual \ntask orders valued at $3.4 billion that were classified as \n``undefinitized contract actions.''\n  The government has allowed too much money and too many contract \nactions to linger in this status. The amendment corrects this flaw by \nrequiring clear guidance in the Federal\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\nAcquisition Regulation and strong justification for making such \ncontracts or orders.\n  Contracting for Hurricane Katrina and in Iraq has also involved \nexcessive tiering of subcontractors, driving up costs and complicating \ncontract administration. The amendment mandates regulatory guidance for \nminimizing tiering to ensure that every layer of subcontracting adds \nvalue or serves a valid purpose in meeting Federal requirements.\n  In our committee investigation of debris removal after Hurricane \nKatrina, a disaster that required clearing away nearly 100 million \ncubic yards of debris, we found that some contracts involved five or \nsix tiers of subcontractors, often with little or no apparent added \nvalue. This provision would put in place government-wide requirements \nto control this practice and its potential for wasting tax dollars.\n  Another important provision requires the OFPP to review and report on \nexisting policies and to recommend needed changes to ensure that \nFederal agencies are not contracting out essential core \nresponsibilities of government. The risks of such activity were made \nstarkly clear in our committee's recent discovery that a contractor \nwrote parts of FEMA's request for proposals for the TOPOFF 5 emergency-\nmanagement exercise and was then allowed to bid on the contract. This \nclear conflict of interest threatened both the integrity of the \ncompetitive process and objective implementation of Federal policy.\n  The amendment also restricts the de-facto outsourcing of program-\nmanagement responsibility when a large contractor becomes a ``lead \nsystems integrator'' for a multipart project and requires the OFPP to \ncraft a government-wide definition of lead systems integrators.\n  The Accountability in Government Contracting Act combines practical, \nworkable, and targeted reforms to improve a complex process that \nexpends hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars every year. As the \nSIGIR said of these proposals in a Homeland Security Committee hearing \nlast year, ``these kinds of reforms are exactly what will save taxpayer \ndollars ... and address very directly the problems that we have been \nexperiencing in contracting in Iraq.''\n  My amendment will pay recurring dividends for years to come in higher \nquality proposals, in avoidance of wasteful and excessive spending, and \nin better results for our citizens. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of section 254 of \nthe fiscal year 2009 National Defense Authorization Act. I thank \nChairman Levin and Senator Jack Reed for working with me on this piece \nof legislation which is based on recommendations of the National \nAcademy of Sciences and the Department of Defense. Critical \ntechnologies that help protect our national security are being \noutsourced to the global economy and to nations that may not have our \nbest interests at heart. One such technology is printed circuit boards, \na type of electronics technology that is integrated into every weapons \nsystem we deploy, from the F-22 to UAVs to the MRAP. For years we \nrelied on industry to maintain the technological advantage in this \ncritical area, but we now must take more action to ensure that the \nUnited States maintains and protects this capability to better ensure \nour national security.\n  Due to economic pressures, industry has increasingly outsourced the \nmanufacture of printed circuit boards, and we are in danger of losing \nthe industrial base capable of building and maintaining these \ncomponents, especially those with critical security technologies \nrequired for our military. Without this critical technology, many \ncomponents in numerous defense systems would cease to function. The \nDepartment of Defense spends roughly $500 million annually on procuring \nthese components, and it is imperative that we safeguard their future \nproduction. We cannot allow continued outsourcing to move production to \nChina and other nations. We must protect our access to critical and \nsensitive pieces of hardware that are the basis of our military \ntechnological advantage.\n  Previous Department of Defense efforts to address these issues have \nbeen incomplete, underfunded, and disjointed. It is critical that we \nestablish an executive agent to monitor and protect issues related to \nthe U.S. printed circuit board industry. Safeguarding the technology \nand manufacturing capabilities of printed circuit boards will protect \nour national interests today and in the future. Not only will this \nexecutive agent be instrumental in maintaining existing legacy systems \nbut will also ensure the military's advancement of emerging \ntechnologies are used in the next generation of military hardware. \nFailure to establish an executive agent and take aggressive action \nwould result in the eventual loss of a critical technology and the \ndiminishing capacity of our military's ability to safeguard our \nnational security. Therefore, I urge support of section 254 and of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Warner and I and our staffs and a \nnumber of other Senators have been trying to work out a unanimous \nconsent agreement that would control the continuation of the \ndeliberation and debate on this bill. We have completed a draft of a \ncomplicated unanimous consent agreement. It runs a little over two \npages. I have been able to give it to Senator Warner now. As always, he \nis very helpful and responsive and has assured me they can look at this \novernight and, in the morning, give us a response, hopefully early, as \nto whether this, or some variation of it, will be acceptable on that \nside of the aisle. I thank my friend from Virginia and assure folks \nthat even though we weren't able to get specific votes today, because \nof a previous agreement that there would be no votes today, we hope \nthat in the morning we will be able to have a roadmap for the balance \nof this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have seen earlier iterations of this. I \nwill take this up with the leadership and our colleagues early \ntomorrow, but I am not certain what time. I presume this would not \nrequire any votes in the morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that would best serve our purposes. In \nconsultation with our two staff directors and colleagues on our staff \nwho work side by side, we have now cleared--both sides--about 75 \namendments. So work has been going on throughout the day. I think we \ncan, hopefully tomorrow, share this with colleagues and get a \nresolution of the timetables to move forward on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8523-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the House of \nRepresentatives today passed the Former Vice President Protection Act, \nH.R. 5938--a bill to ensure that that former Vice Presidents and \nimmediate family members receive Secret Service protection for 6 months \nafter they leave office. I am especially pleased that this important \nlegislation, which will now be sent to the President for signature, \nincludes key provisions of the Identity Theft Enforcement and \nRestitution Act, a critical cyber crime bill I introduced last year and \nthat has twice unanimously passed the Senate in this Congress. I hope \nthat the President will promptly sign this measure into law.\n  Although the Secret Service has provided protection to former Vice \nPresidents over the last 30 years through a variety of temporary grants \nof authority, this legislation will provide clear authority for the \nSecret Service to provide such protection for the first time. The men \nand women of the Secret Service perform the very difficult job\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nof protecting our current and former leaders exceptionally well. I am \npleased that this legislation will help the Secret Service to carry out \nthis important mission.\n  This bipartisan legislation also includes important cyber crime \nprovisions--portions of the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution \nAct--to protect the privacy rights of all Americans. The anticyber \ncrime provisions in this bill are long overdue. A recent survey by the \nFederal Trade Commission found that that more than 8 million Americans \nfell victim to identity theft in 2005. In addition, a new report by the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development encourages \ndemocratic governments around the world to more aggressively fight \nidentity theft, by enacting stronger cyber crime laws and stiffening \nthe penalties to deter potential cybercriminals.\n  The key anticyber crime provisions that are included in this \nlegislation will close existing gaps in our criminal law to keep up \nwith the cunning and ingenuity of today's identity thieves. First, to \nbetter protect American consumers, the legislation provides the victims \nof identity theft with the ability to seek restitution in Federal court \nfor the loss of time and money spent restoring their credit and \nremedying the harms of identity theft, so that identity theft victims \ncan be made whole. Second, to address the increasing number of computer \nhacking crimes that involve computers located within the same State, \nthe cybercrime amendment eliminates the jurisdictional requirement that \na computer's information must be stolen through an interstate or \nforeign communication in order to federally prosecute this crime.\n  Third, this legislation also addresses the growing problem of the \nmalicious use of spyware to steal sensitive personal information, by \neliminating the requirement that the loss resulting from the damage to \na victim's computer must exceed $5,000 in order to federally prosecute \nthe offense. The bill carefully balances this necessary change with the \nlegitimate need to protect innocent actors from frivolous prosecutions, \nand clarifies that the elimination of the $5,000 threshold applies only \nto criminal cases.\n  In addition, the amendment addresses the increasing number of cyber \nattacks on multiple computers, by making it a felony to employ spyware \nor keyloggers to damage 10 or more computers, regardless of the \naggregate amount of damage caused. By making this crime a felony, the \namendment ensures that the most egregious identity thieves will not \nescape with minimal punishment under Federal cyber crime laws. The \nlegislation also strengthens the protections for American businesses, \nwhich are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves, by \nadding two new causes of action under the cyber extortion statute--\nthreatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer \nand demanding money in relation to a protected computer--so that this \nbad conduct can be federally prosecuted. And, lastly, the legislation \nadds the remedy of civil and criminal forfeiture to the arsenal of \ntools to combat cyber crime and our amendment directs the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to review its guidelines for identity theft and \ncyber crime offenses.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of \nJustice and the Secret Service in crafting these updates to our cyber \ncrime laws and the legislation added as an amendment to the Former Vice \nPresident Protection Act has the strong support of these Federal \nagencies and the support of a broad coalition of business, high tech \nand consumer groups. The bill as amended to include these critical \ncyber crime provisions is a good, bipartisan bill that will help to \nbetter protect our Nation's leaders and to better protect all Americans \nfrom the growing threat of identity theft and other cyber crimes.\n  I thank Senator Specter for his hard work on this legislation. I also \nthank Senators Biden and Hatch and the bipartisan coalition of Senators \nwho have joined with us to ensure its passage. In addition, I thank \nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Conyers and Congressman Bobby Scott \nfor their assistance in enacting this bill. I also thank Majority \nLeader Reid, House Majority Leader Hoyer and House Majority Whip \nClyburn for their leadership in advancing this legislation. Lastly, I \nthank the many high tech, business and consumer organizations who have \nworked so hard to enact this legislation to better protect the privacy \nand security of American consumers and American businesses. I encourage \nthe President to promptly sign this important criminal legislation into \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8524-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8524-S8525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MUNIR SAID THALIB\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week marked the fourth anniversary \nof the tragic death of Munir Said Thalib, one of Indonesia's leading \nhuman rights defenders. Munir was powerful voice who brought attention \nto the human rights violations committed by Indonesia's military in \nEast Timor, Papua, and Aceh Province during and after the rule of \nPresident Suharto. He founded the Commission for Disappearances and \nVictims of Violence (Kontras) and championed accountability and justice \non behalf of the victims of ``disappearances'' during the final days of \nthe regime in the late 1990s. Munir, 37, was poisoned with arsenic \nwhile traveling from Jakarta to Amsterdam to study international \nhumanitarian law.\n  Munir as a singular figure who inspired crowds with his impassioned \npleas for nonviolence, worked with progressive elements in the military \neven while challenging army abuses, and made a point of using himself \nas an example to inspire others. By refusing to show fear in the face \nof threats and intimidation, including several attempts on his life, he \nserved as a model for those otherwise afraid to stand up to human \nrights violators.\n  Now, 4 years after Munir's untimely death, there is promise that \nthose responsible for his murder will be brought to justice. Despite \ndelays and setbacks, two of those charged have now been convicted, but \nthose who planned the assassination remained at large. Now, 3 years \nafter a fact-finding team established by current President Yudhoyono \ndiscovered evidence of involvement by officials of the State \nIntelligence Agency, a retired general and former senior intelligence \nofficer is on trial for his alleged role in the crime. This trial is an \nopportunity for Munir's friends and family, for the Indonesian \nGovernment, and for the citizens of Indonesia, to obtain a fair \naccounting of the facts and application of the law. I note with \nappreciation the work of the investigators in the case so far and \nconvey my strongest support for a fair, timely and transparent process \nand a just outcome for all concerned.\n  President Yudhoyono has called the case a test for Indonesia, and \nMunir's supporters similarly argue that ``justice for Munir is justice \nfor all.'' The willingness of the government to investigate the role of \nsenior staff at the State Intelligence Agency is a significant step \nforward, and I hope it is an indication of increased accountability \nmore generally. Those who committed human rights abuses must be \nidentified and brought to justice, both to provide a sense of closure \nfor victims who suffered these atrocities as well as to set the \nimportant precedent that human and political rights play an important \nrole in today's Indonesia. I encourage the Indonesian Government to \nundertake similar investigations for other crimes, and urge them to do \nso in a timely and fair manner.\n  The decision to undertake this trial is an important indicator of the \ngovernment's commitment to address ongoing human rights abuses, and to \nprotect human rights activists. I am hopeful this will be the beginning \nof a more systematic process that prioritizes basic human rights and \nthe rule of law and recognizes that Indonesia has yet to deal \neffectively with past human rights violations in Aceh, East Timor, \nPapua, Jakarta, and elsewhere. I hope the resolution of Munir's case \nwill be a blow against impunity and provide an opportunity to promote \nmuch-needed military and intelligence reform. Indonesia has made \npositive reforms since the end of the Suharto regime, but must continue \nto develop proper mechanisms for accountability, to ensure that such \nhuman rights abuses are not repeated.\n  Indonesia continues to be an important ally of the United States and \nwe must work toward a strong and effective partnership, particularly as \nwe\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nseek to combat extremism around the globe. It is in the national \ninterest of both countries for Indonesia to successfully complete its \nprocess of reform and democratization. However, this strengthening \nrelationship must not come at the expense of a principled stance on \nhuman rights and accountability. As we commemorate Munir's death, we \nmust remember that part of this commemoration includes addressing the \ncontinuing legacy of Indonesia's recent authoritarian past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8525-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8525-S8526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Soaring gasoline prices are putting a tighter and tighter \n     pinch on our pocket book for transportation needs. We've \n     taken many steps to reduce the cost of fuel including \n     reducing the way we drive as well as where and how often we \n     drive. Savings from these steps, however, have not caused a \n     reduction in our fuel costs. Rather the cost of fuel has \n     jumped so rapidly, that these efficiencies are almost \n     invisible.\n       We have an older home which needs a new roof but the cost \n     of composition shingles has risen so significantly that other \n     areas of our budget, if possible, will have to make up the \n     difference. The aging process bringing the shingles to the \n     end of their life is not slowing so a replacement delay is \n     not possible. Working against these circumstances is the \n     escalating price of petroleum products.\n       The price of products we purchase from the grocery store \n     has risen in correlation with fuel costs. Our food budget is \n     being strained to the limit because the cost of \n     transportation to deliver the products to the grocery story \n     is much more.\n       We have been advised by government in some communities that \n     the cost of public services, e.g. law enforcement and fire \n     protection will have to be decreased or curtailed because of \n     the extreme jump in the cost of gasoline. We envision our \n     property as well as persons becoming less safe.\n       We are thankful there are security regulations in place \n     that prevent investors from being ripped off by unscrupulous \n     people. At the same time, we are extremely concerned that in \n     today's world speculators in commodities can manipulate the \n     market. Why cannot the US Government take action immediately \n     to bring control to such activity? Wouldn't this be a good \n     place to start and one where something could happen quickly?\n       We were citizens of Washington State several decades ago \n     when a governmental entity, Washington Public Power and \n     Supply System (WPPSS) attempted to construct nuclear power \n     plants according to the wishes of the citizens. We watched \n     millions and millions of hard-earned public dollars go down \n     the drain as environmentalists' voices were given audience \n     and commitments. We literally witnessed the promise of \n     nuclear energy disappear. One of us was employed in State \n     Government. One of our sons is now employed in a nuclear \n     energy support position and we have an in-depth understanding \n     of the benefits as well as risks. The fear tactics used by \n     environmentalists (not facts and data) drove the actions of \n     government.\n       We have a sleeping giant available in nuclear energy and \n     facts and data, not emotions needs to govern our elected \n     officials' decisions. The problems with energy are not new \n     and have been spoken of frequently since we were born in the \n     late 30's and early 40's. We would hope our Senators and \n     members of Congress would wake up and do that which is best \n     for today and tomorrow.\n       In a short 9.3 year period, the cost of regular grade \n     gasoline has risen from $0.899 per gallon to $4.079 today. \n     That is a 430% increase in cost. At the beginning of this \n     period, we had time to make changes but have squandered them \n     away with political posturing and contention.\n       Let us do something now. Now does not mean never or \n     whenever. It means Never Override Wisdom. Help Please. Do \n     something now.\n     Keith and Patricia, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share a little about how \n     the high fuel prices are affecting my family. I have the \n     great opportunity to work as a teacher in the public school \n     setting and to work on the family farm in the summer. I have \n     experienced higher prices for fuel and everything else that \n     is needed (i.e. food, clothes, etc.) over the past year. When \n     everything is going up but our paychecks it makes it \n     difficult to raise a family. While already living with \n     limited means, it is hard to cut back the necessities when \n     all we are there aren't many. The family farm is also \n     suffering. My father-in-law is considering selling a portion \n     of the land to pay for overhead costs of running the rest of \n     the lawn. He may also have to lease the ground out as he can \n     no longer afford the expenses that go along with the small \n     operation. This farm has been in the family for over 75 \n     years. My wife struggles with her part time job because as \n     she goes to work for several hours a day, one hour of the day \n     goes to pay the fuel to get there.\n       I guess that I could go on and on about how we are all \n     struggling because the high cost of energy; fuel for cars, \n     propane for heat, electricity, higher food cost, etc... but I \n     guess that I would like to share my thoughts on our \n     dependence on foreign energy sources and the hold these \n     entities have on us. I believe that we have been blessed in \n     our country with the resources that we need. More and more of \n     our jobs are being outsourced to other countries and we are \n     buying more of their products. Because we have these oil \n     reserves that we are not accessing because a minority \n     squeaked and got the grease, there is a serious problem. The \n     USA is known for high standards in both safety and \n     environmental protection for anything that we do. If a few \n     Caribou have their grazing area slightly interrupted because \n     of an oil well, it is okay. They will adapt and everything \n     will be okay. Conservation and Protection is very important. \n     I believe that our God has given us this great land for our \n     use. We must be careful and use it wisely, not foolishly. I \n     believe that our current practices are foolish. We have made \n     ourselves a target and it is hurting us all. Our country is \n     so far in debt and our dollar is worth less and less. This \n     has to change. Even if the use of our own oil is temporary, I \n     believe that it will send the message to the oil cartel that \n     we are not solely dependant on them.\n       I also believe that we need to stop the large oil companies \n     from hindering our development of technologies of alternate \n     fuel sources and different engines. With all our knowledge \n     today, why has the internal combustion engine, basically, not \n     changed in all that time. We hear of Hydrogen Fuel Cells, \n     Electric Cars, BioFuel, etc... but somehow these ideas are \n     not making it full time the consumer. Things have got to get \n     better. I shutter to think that it is going to get worse for \n     it gets better.\n     Kevin, Georgetown.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for being an advocate for Idahoans in Washington. \n     As you know, those of us in sparsely populated states often \n     feel disenfranchised and like our voices are not heard, even \n     that our votes are for naught. I, for one, am grateful that \n     you are a strong voice for Idaho.\n       You asked for stories of how the high cost of energy is \n     impacting our lives. My story will not have the power of \n     those who must drive long distances to work or those who are \n     engaged in providing our nation with food and who find their \n     very livelihood threatened. I am a widow; I lost my husband a \n     year ago. The last year has been lonely and bleak in many \n     ways, and I miss my husband more than I can express. Our \n     children all live far away--the closest is in Portland, \n     Oregon, one in Houston, another in London, England, another \n     in California. While I do have a few family members here in \n     Idaho Falls, including my sister who lives with me, but my \n     children are who are my greatest comfort since the death of \n     my husband. They cannot afford to travel to see me. And now I \n     cannot travel to see them, nor can my sister see her \n     grandchildren in Boise very often because we cannot afford \n     the gas. In fact, I have not left the city limits of Idaho \n     Falls since Thanksgiving because we simply cannot afford to \n     travel.\n       My house is all electric--a change we made in the 1970s due \n     to the oil embargo. My heat bills were close to $300 a month \n     during this very long and very cold winter we just had. As a \n     disabled widow living on a fixed income, this increase was a \n     burden, to say the least. And I know the city of Idaho Falls \n     is preparing to increase our utility bills. I cannot even \n     imagine what really poor people are doing, but if the prices \n     go up, we will have people right here in Bonneville County \n     who will freeze to death. And I am sick at heart thinking of \n     what the next winters brings when I think of gas and \n     electricity and food even for my small household.\n       The cost of everything has gone up, food prices are \n     skyrocketing, and the trickle-down will be a burden of those \n     of us in the middle and lower classes. When people cannot pay \n     their bills or pay for the basic necessities of life they \n     become desperate. And we all know the most dangerous thing in \n     the world is not a fanatic, but someone who is desperate.\n       Please help us, Sen. Crapo; please plead our cause and the \n     cause of this nation before Congress. This is not about \n     Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives. This is \n     about the people who elected them becoming desperate with no \n     end in sight. Please tell them we need responsible \n     representatives, not posturing demigods out to line their \n     pockets and further their own agendas. I pray for the day \n     that we can tell the oil producing nations (except for those \n     in North\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\n     America) to go to hell, that we will no longer need their \n     oil. It is time this nation ceased being a hostage to those \n     who would destroy us. Enough is enough.\n       I am sorry this is so rambling and poorly expressed. But \n     Sen. Crapo, I know you're a good man and that you truly speak \n     for us in honesty and dignity. Thank you for letting me say \n     my piece. God Bless you and your staff.\n     Stella, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for providing a convenient avenue for the public \n     to hear your personal view on this important issue and for \n     giving the opportunity to let our opinions also be heard. It \n     is comforting to know that the people's representative is at \n     least attempting to represent the people. Here's my take on \n     the situation:\n       I own a '98 Honda Civic--hardly a gas-guzzler. I recently \n     paid my car off, but now my gas payments are equal to what my \n     monthly payments used to be. I pay more for gas each month \n     than I do for car insurance. I live like the majority of \n     Idahoans probably do: I drive to work and school during the \n     week; I go to church and visit family on the weekend. I make \n     a modest living and drive a modest car, and yet I am paying \n     premium prices for regular gasoline. I feel the pain at the \n     gas pump, at the grocery store, and in my wallet.\n       Fundamentally, I see two sides of the solution to our \n     problem--the domestic side and the foreign side. Domestically \n     we should be producing and refining more of our own oil. We \n     know where to find it. It is in ANWR, it is off-shore, and it \n     is in many other places that should be made available to ``We \n     the People''. (It is our country, after all.) It is possible \n     to safely and responsibly recover and refine our own oil. We \n     the People need to provide incentives to American companies \n     for oil exploration and recovery. We need to make it possible \n     for American companies to build new oil refineries. All this \n     needs to happen while simultaneously discouraging the \n     formation of monopolies as we continue to build the \n     national oil industry. We should also continue to \n     encourage private research and development of new energy \n     sources by American companies. We should not be waiting \n     for the world's answer to oil to come from Europe or \n     Japan. America leads the world in power and in ideas; we \n     should also lead the world in energy. That is energy \n     independence.\n       The foreign answer is a lot more complicated, but it has a \n     lot to do with the notion of free trade (and it applies to \n     more than just the trade of oil). If an oil producing nation \n     pays its employees slave wages while US companies must pay \n     union wages, is it free trade? No. If they fail to comply \n     with environmental standards to which US companies are bound, \n     is it free trade? No. If the nation is a known sponsor or \n     sympathizer of terrorism or drug trafficking, is it free \n     trade? No. If they deny basic human rights to women, \n     children, a certain race/nationality, or a specific religion, \n     is it free trade? No. If we believe these are basic standards \n     of civilization for our own people, how can we support \n     governments that clearly do not abide by the same standards, \n     and yet still call it free trade? In good conscience, we \n     clearly cannot. So what do we do? Impose tariffs or embargos? \n     Maybe. How about trade incentives for like-minded countries? \n     Like I said, it is complicated. The answer may be that we \n     just work to set things right one step at a time, and \n     continue to move forward. We know oil is more than likely \n     just a temporary solution to our energy needs, and we know we \n     would like to achieve energy independence, so if We the \n     People are all united in our determination to approach that \n     goal, the solution may become clear.\n     Craig, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am responding to your newsletter soliciting stories of \n     how high petroleum prices and energy costs impact average \n     Idaho citizens and families like mine. Please read my story.\n       I am a husband and father of six children. This escalation \n     of energy costs has a huge impact upon us. Gas is up past \n     $4.10 per gallon. I commute from Meridian to Boise 5 days a \n     week. My daily fluctuating 8-10 hour work schedule does not \n     allow for carpooling or Commuteride or bus. So public \n     transportation does not help me in the least. And there are \n     many Idahoans where public transportation is just impractical \n     with our many work schedules. I may do errands to or from \n     work as I pass by a store on my way to eliminate an extra car \n     trip. We also travel to our church in Nampa twice each \n     Sunday. My wife drives her minivan to grocery shop, take kids \n     to music lessons, dentist, eye doctor, little league games, \n     the library, etc. and as much as possible she combine trips \n     to conserve fuel. We may eat out as a family once a month.\n       In addition to soaring gas prices, Idaho Power was approved \n     for another 6% hike for electrical rates. Intermountain Gas \n     also recently implemented a similar rate hike. My property \n     taxes in Meridian went up 40% per year in 2006 and 2007.\n       Senator, we are financially squeezed in so many ways it \n     would seem unbelievable if it weren't true. We grow a few \n     vegetables in our small garden. We buy goods in bulk when we \n     can. We use coupons and watch for the best sales. We do not \n     have cable TV or high-speed internet. My wife cuts everyone's \n     hair but her own. We live very frugally and frankly we are \n     just getting by. But let me also say, by God's grace, we are \n     a happy family.\n       I look at the stimulus money we received as a way to pay \n     off some credit card debt we've accumulated. We have little \n     savings with the poor economy. So with the stimulus money \n     we'll buy gas, put food on the table, pay for the roof over \n     our head, buy the kids some clothes we could not get at the \n     local thrift store. Maybe have some money left over to go out \n     to dinner once or twice or see a movie in a theater for the \n     first time this year. It certainly cannot be used for many \n     luxuries as our buying power is shrinking day-by-day due to \n     the high cost of energy driving up the cost of everything \n     from food and fuel to goods and services.\n       Senator, I am sad to say, you and your colleagues in the \n     House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, are for the \n     most part responsible for America's poor economic condition \n     especially as it relates to energy costs. You have the \n     influence and power to make positive changes but you thus far \n     have refused to do anything but blame the energy companies \n     and demand that automakers manufacture cars that nobody wants \n     to buy. Stop blaming energy producing companies for high \n     energy costs when it is largely the fault of Congress for \n     overregulation, high taxation, and prevention of domestic \n     acquisition!\n       Why don't you actually do something to end this crisis? You \n     proffer wind and solar power which are currently very \n     inefficient, expensive and are decades away from having any \n     real impact on our plight. You fund public transportation \n     that only benefits the very urban areas. You subsidize \n     burning our food supply (corn)--which drives up food prices--\n     to produce ethanol which creates more pollution due to energy \n     used in its production and its inefficiency in our automobile \n     engines. You allow our economic policy to be controlled by \n     the Marxist groups in our country, i.e. environmentalists, \n     liberal special interest groups, and the political media that \n     have no other desire than to turn our wonderful democracy \n     backward (economically) that it may become the utopian \n     socialist state they idolize.\n       You asked for my solutions to help the American people out \n     of this crisis. Please note that my suggestions, unlike those \n     typical of Congress, will not cost the American taxpayers \n     anything. They are as follows:\n       1. The President needs to address the American people and \n     declare an Economic State of Emergency and by Executive Order \n     mandate immediate and drastic measures to increase domestic \n     fuel production (oil, natural gas, coal).\n       2. Drill for oil in the USA now! Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, \n     off-shore, anywhere there are great reserves of oil and \n     natural gas. We can drill in more efficient and \n     environmentally friendly ways than any other nation. We do \n     not need to fund private companies to produce more energy, \n     just get out of their way and allow them to do it! Net charge \n     to taxpayers: $0.\n       3. Fast track building of oil refineries. Eliminate years \n     of red tape. Look at converting existing moth-balled military \n     installations near ports and energy sources. Just permit \n     private companies to do it. Net charge to taxpayers: $0.\n       4. Mandate a single environmental friendly blend of \n     gasoline for all of the USA. Eliminate the six summer/winter \n     blends of fuel for different US regions which create \n     artificial shortages and inflate prices due to limited \n     refining capacities and inability to legally use particular \n     blends outside EPA specified areas. Just have all the states \n     use the one blend that works the best. Net charge to \n     taxpayers: $0.\n       5. Stop mandating burning our food for fuel! Corn used for \n     ethanol is driving up the cost of everything we eat just as \n     fast as oil prices drive up the cost of transporting them. \n     Congress is to blame for this! This year, for the first time \n     in history, the USA will import wheat to feed its citizens. \n     This is an outrage! Do not continue to subsidize ethanol! Net \n     charge to taxpayers: $0.\n       6. Stop wasting taxpayer money by buying carbon credits for \n     the federal government. Ridiculous waste of taxpayer money! \n     Need I say more? Net charge to taxpayers: $0.\n       7. Remove the pending phase-out of (inexpensive) \n     incandescent bulbs in favor of the costly and toxic \n     fluorescent bulbs. That phase-out appeared in the last so-\n     called ``energy bill.'' Net charge to taxpayers: $0.\n       8. Do not increase taxes on oil companies. Taxes have never \n     produced one drop of oil. Stop punishing the companies that \n     make our economy possible. Remember your history? American \n     ingenuity coupled with cheap, abundant energy resources built \n     this country! Net cost to taxpayers: $0.\n       9. Denounce those who would legislate based on the man-made \n     global warming environmental hoax. Every government mandated \n     policy that flows from this unproven, unscientific, misguided \n     environmental ``religion'' drags the economy down further. \n     The latest word from the scientific community is the globe is \n     now cooling. Go figure! Net cost to taxpayers: $0.\n       If we work together, we can rebuild America into the strong \n     nation it once was by putting it back on the road to energy \n     independence. But Congress must be willing to act now; by \n     swallowing its collective pride and by removing obstacles \n     that hinder our potential for economic success from becoming \n     reality.\n                                                  Vance, Meridian.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8527-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   CONGRATULATING HAWAII'S 2008 LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

The team is led by manager Timo Donahue and coaches Kiha \nAkau and Gregg Tsugawa.\n  Waipio went undefeated in the Little League World Series Tournament, \nbeating seven U.S. teams to get into the U.S. Championship game. Hawaii \nbeat a spirited team from Lake Charles, LA, 7 to 5, in an exciting, \ncome-from-behind victory, to advance to the World Championship game.\n  I am proud of their impressive victory but more so of the humility \nand sportsmanship that the team from Waipio displayed as they won with \naloha. I recognize the sacrifices made by the coaches, family members, \nand friends, who worked hard to help these youngsters follow their \ndreams. I applaud them all and wish them the best in future endeavors, \nboth on the field and off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8527-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MISSISSIPPI RIVER PARKWAY COMMISSION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, when I visit eastern Iowa, I often \ndrive along the Mississippi River. And there, on any given day, one can \nvisit this area and marvel at the sight of the mighty Mississippi River \nwinding its way south from Lake Itaska in Minnesota toward the Gulf of \nMexico--a total distance of over 2,500 miles. From this vantage point, \nhigh above the river, you see pleasure boaters and fishermen spending \nthe day on the water. You can see river barges carrying Iowa corn and \nsoybeans to far away markets. And most importantly, you see that this \nis a national treasure that needs to be protected and preserved for all \ngenerations to come.\n  The Mississippi Parkway Commission was created in 1938 in order to \ndevelop and oversee what was at that time called the Mississippi River \nParkway. The Parkway Commission is the only organization connecting all \n10 States bordering the Mississippi River, with a mission devoted to \npromoting, preserving, and enhancing the resources of the Mississippi \nRiver Valley, and to developing the amenities of the Great River Road.\n  This year, 10 States, including my home State of Iowa, will celebrate \nthe 70th anniversary of the Mississippi River Parkway Commission and \nthe Great River Road. Among the many accomplishments of the commision \nof the past 70 years are the development of a Great River Road \nInterpretive Center Network, a consumer Web site, and National Scenic \nByway designation for the majority of the Great River Road. In carrying \nout its duties, the commission has partnered with a number of Federal \nagencies, including the National Forest Service, the National Park \nService, the Federal Highway Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  On the occasion of its anniversary, I wish to congratulate the \nMississippi River Parkway Commission, as well as the commission's new \nnational Pilot, Patsi Ramicitti from Bettendorf, IA. I am pleased that \nPatsi's energy and dedication to advancing one of the region's most \nvital assets are being recognized. May her efforts and those of all \npast, present and future members of the commission continue to \nstrengthen the knowledge of and access to the incredible natural \nresources offered by the mighty Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8527-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANCES LANDERS\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I would \nlike to recognize remarkable contributions of 91-year-old Frances \nLanders of El Dorado, AR. At a time when most people consider \nretirement, Frances dedicated the past 30 years of her life to making \neducation accessible to the children of Haiti. Through her selfless \nyears of service, Frances' work and formation of the Haiti Education \nFoundation have opened educational doors of opportunity for hundreds of \nchildren who otherwise might never have learned to read.\n  Frances visited Haiti this past April to say her goodbyes, for this \nwas most likely her last visit. She first came to Haiti in 1977 as a \nmedical volunteer with her late husband Dr. Gardner Landers, an \nophthalmologist, to help people with cataract problems. Dr. and Mrs. \nLanders began making two trips a year, providing surgery and eyeglasses \nto the Haitian people. During these visits, she met Father Jean-Wilfrid \nAlbert, a chaplain of the mission hospital. Through Father Albert and \nher numerous mission trips, Frances discovered that many villages had \nno school and most citizens were illiterate. Impassioned to make a \ndifference, Frances returned to Arkansas and began raising money. \nThrough her dedication, perseverance and conviction, she soon launched \none school, and over time, many others followed.\n  Because of her establishment of the Haiti Education Foundation, there \nare now 40 primary schools and 10 secondary schools, which are \ncurrently educating more than 11,000 Haitian children. Through \ndonations and scholarships, the foundation provides schooling, hot \nlunches, shoes, school uniforms, textbooks, Creole bibles, milk, and \ngoats for families. These schools set the foundation for students to \nenroll in universities and pursue careers that allow them to break past \npoverty barriers.\n  Ms. Landers continues to raise awareness and funding to ensure the \nfoundation's success. She has lived in service to the people of Haiti \nand is an extraordinary example of what can be achieved when committed \nto a worthwhile endeavor. Today, I honor and thank Frances Landers for \nher continual interest in others and inspiring those around her to do \nthe same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8527-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8527-S8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING SOJOURNER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the \nexceptional educators at Sojourner Elementary School of Milwaukie, OR. \nLast week, Intel Corporation named Sojourner the ``Star Innovator'' \namong six winners of the 2008 Intel Schools of Distinction Awards and \namong hundreds of applicants who entered the competition.\n  Intel Corporation chose Sojourner Elementary because of its \ngroundbreaking teaching strategies in mathematics and the marked \nimprovement of its young math students. Oregon State Assessment data \nindicate that mathematics achievement at Sojourner has steadily \nimproved over the past 4 years. Sojourner uses an innovative ``team \nteaching'' approach. At each level, at least one teacher completes \nadditional coursework and training in mathematics. This ongoing \nprofessional development has resulted in teachers specializing in \ncontent and academic knowledge in mathematics.\n  Increasingly, technology is playing an important role in the \nclassroom, and teachers at Sojourner are using it effectively to excite \nand engage students. Computers at Sojourner are equipped with the \nsoftware necessary to complete computer-based units from the school's \nmath curriculum, and teachers are trained to implement these units. \nWith Intel's Star Innovator award, Sojourner Elementary will receive \nadditional funds, products, and services to continue its unique \nprogram.\n  Sojourner also involves parents in the learning process, a proven \nstrategy for improving the performance of young students. Newsletters \nproduced at each level inform parents as to the\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nspecific content in class so that parents can provide appropriate \nsupport at home. All families have math ``kits'' at home so that \nstudents can continue to develop ideas at the conceptual level. \nFamilies also have access to the district Web site, where the online \nStudent Learning Center provides valuable resources for practice \nactivities at a variety of levels.\n  In the field of education, there is no single path to success. That \nis why it is important to highlight those programs like Sojourner's \nthat are successful and reward their efforts. Intel's work in promoting \nmathematics and science education comes at a critical time when America \nneeds more engineers and more mathematicians to stay competitive in a \nglobalizing economy. I am grateful to the teachers at Sojourner \nElementary who have worked so hard to set a new standard in math \neducation and that Intel has taken on the responsibility of awarding \nthese remarkable achievements. Our Nation benefits tremendously from \nsharing these best practices, and I am proud to honor the exceptional \nwork that Sojourner Elementary is doing to educate our Nation's \nchildren and the future leaders of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8528-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8528-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8528-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DORGAN, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with \n     amendments:\n       S. 1255.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 3488. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a tax credit for qualified donations of employee services; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Serve America \nAct of 2008. I, along with my good friend, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, have introduced this legislation in hopes that it will \nexpand service opportunities for people throughout our country. I am \npleased to report that it also has the support of Senators McCain, \nObama, Cochran, and Dodd.\n  For some time I have supported the idea of encouraging our people to \ngive 2-years of volunteer service over the course of their lives. In \naddition, I have long believed that community and faith-based \norganizations are doing most of the best work at addressing the needs \nof our people. And, I might add, they do it at a fraction of what it \nwould cost the Federal Government to do similar work. These are the \nreasons Senator Kennedy and I have drafted and introduced the Save \nAmerica Act.\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\n  This bill does many things. Most apparently, it creates new national \nservice corps that will enlist the help of our people to address \nspecific areas of national need, including education, energy \nefficiency, access to health care, economic opportunity for the \ndisadvantaged and disaster relief. It also encourages individuals and \nnonprofit groups to come up with new and innovative ways to encourage \nvolunteerism and to use the help of volunteers effectively. In \naddition, it enlists the help of the private sector in addressing \nimportant needs in our Nation and community.\n  There are a number of provisions in this bill that I believe will be \nof interest particularly to those of us we ascribe to conservative \nprinciples. For example, it will benefit thousands of faith-based and \nreligious organizations throughout the country--they are eligible to \nparticipate in virtually every new program in the bill. It also \npreserves a very significant role for State governments at every step. \nLike many of my colleagues, I would like to see individuals, churches \nand communities do more and have the Government do less. While this \nbill does create new Government programs, the programs are specifically \ndesigned to foster this type of volunteer spirit and alleviate the need \nfor bloated Government programs throughout Washington to accomplish the \nsame goals.\n  Senator Kennedy and I are committed to ensuring that this bill \nreceives broad, bipartisan support, not only among those in Congress, \nbut among the American people as well. Toward that end, Senator Kennedy \nand I have agreed that, when this bill is considered in the HELP \nCommittee, which is chaired by the gentleman from Massachusetts, we \nwill work with Members of both parties to offset the spending in this \nbill and ensure that it is budget neutral. I think we have all heard \nthe cries from our constituents for more fiscal responsibility and \ndiscipline in Congress. While this bill does authorize some spending, \nour commitment to offset these costs will ensure that it will not add \nto the Federal deficit.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have also introduced the Incentive to Serve Tax \nAct as a companion piece to the Serve America Act. This bill would \nprovide tax incentives to encourage companies to ``donate'' their \nemployees' time to charitable service through employer-directed \nprojects. Specifically, the bill would provide companies a tax credit \nequal to 25 percent of the compensation paid to an employee who \nperforms at least 160 hours of a specified charitable service.\n  For example, one company presently has a program to provide \nmanagerial and educational workers to an underdeveloped school system. \nThis tax incentive would encourage this company to provide even more \nsuch service and encourage other companies to utilize their employees \nwith various skills and knowledge to target specific areas that need to \nbe addressed in the communities where those workers live and work. By \ndoing so, everyone benefits.\n  These two bills, I believe, represent efforts that all Members can \nget behind. As we saw at the Service Nation Summit last night, the \nPresidential candidates from both parties have expressed their support \nfor this bill and for expanding service opportunities nationwide. \nIndeed, I think that they both recognize that an investment in the \ngenerosity and ingenuity of the American people is a pretty safe bet. I \nencourage all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               September 11, 2008.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Orrin: Thank you for all of your work on the Serve \n     America Act and your continued leadership on service issues. \n     I am thrilled to be a partner with you on this critical \n     legislation to expand domestic and international service \n     opportunities for Americans of all ages.\n       I'm confident that together we will win broad, bipartisan \n     support for this legislation in the new Congress. I am \n     grateful for your commitment to work together to ensure the \n     necessary funding to implement these initiatives and existing \n     service programs. I am committed to working with you to \n     achieve these goals while working within budget constraints \n     and ensuring that all the spending in the bill is paid for \n     with adequate offsets. It will require that the new \n     Administration and new Congress make tough choices, but I \n     think we can both agree that the benefits that will flow to \n     those volunteering and those served will be worth it.\n       I am sorry that I cannot join you in New York for the \n     National Summit and as always you'll represent our cause \n     well. I look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure \n     that all Americans have the opportunity to serve their \n     communities and the nation, while tackling some of the \n     greatest challenges of our day.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8531-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 659--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, AS ALCOHOL AND \n                      DRUG ADDICTION RECOVERY DAY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mrs. Clinton) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

and\n       Whereas, according to data provided by the Government of \n     Sudan to the United Nations, arms sales from China to the \n     Government of Sudan have increased dramatically since the \n     late 1990s, and from 2004 through 2006, China supplied \n     approximately 90 percent of small arms imported into Sudan: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should seek a peaceful resolution to \n     the conflict in Darfur and should continue to pursue a \n     political solution as well as the immediate and unfettered \n     deployment of the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations-\n     African Union Mission in Darfur, without regard to the \n     country of origin of those forces;\n       (2) the United States supports United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005), imposing an \n     arms embargo on all belligerents in Darfur, and supports \n     consistent enforcement of the embargo;\n       (3) taken together, the obligation imposed by the United \n     Nations on all member states to ``take the necessary measures \n     to prevent the sale or supply'' of arms to belligerents \n     operating in Darfur, the well-documented existence of arms in \n     Darfur that were transferred from China and Russia, and the \n     insistence of the Government of Sudan that it will not abide \n     by the embargo, lead to the conclusion that continued sale of \n     arms to Sudan under these circumstances violates the United \n     Nations arms embargo imposed by Security Council Resolutions \n     1556 and 1591;\n       (4) all United Nations member states should immediately \n     cease all arms sales to the Government of Sudan, until the \n     conflict in Darfur, and the armed conflict related to the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement, have been peacefully resolved; \n     and\n       (5) the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations should use the voice and vote of the United \n     States in the United Nations Security Council to seek an \n     expansion of the arms embargo imposed by Security Council \n     Resolutions 1556 and 1591 to cover all of Sudan, with an \n     appropriate exception for non-lethal assistance to the \n     Government of Southern Sudan.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a \nresolution calling for a stop to the illegal flow of arms into Sudan \nand an expansion of the United Nations embargo on arms sales to Sudan.\n  I am happy we have a number of cosponsors of this legislation--as a \nmatter of fact, Senators Inhofe, Brownback, Casey, Clinton, Dole, \nDurbin, Feingold, Hatch, Isakson, Kerry, Lieberman, Martinez, Menendez, \nSnowe, and Boxer.\n  You can see with Senators spanning the breadth and depth of the \nSenate, they are recognizing this is one of the most important issues \nfacing planet Earth at this time in trying to stop the genocide in \nDarfur. Last July 14, the Chief Prosecutor of the International \nCriminal Court in The Hague requested a warrant for the arrest of \nSudan's President Bashir on the charges of genocide, war crimes, and \ncrimes against humanity.\n  In part, it was because of his arming the jingaweit militias in \nDarfur. Our colleagues certainly are urging the prosecution of Bashir \nfor these crimes. But it is now time for the international community \nand the Congress to take further action in order to prevent the \ncontinued export of arms to the regime, the Sudan regime in Khartoum.\n  This resolution is a call to action to stop the steady stream of arms \ngoing from countries such as China and Russia into Darfur. The \nloopholes in the current UN arms regime are recognized as the main \ncause for the continued violence and the killings there. Two UN arms \nembargoes are currently in place prohibiting the Government of Sudan \nfrom moving arms into Darfur except with the advance approval of the UN \nmonitoring body.\n  The embargoes also require foreign nations to take measures to ensure \nthey do not militarily assist anyone in the conflict in Darfur. Yet \nthose embargoes are impossible to enforce since the Government of Sudan \ncan still receive as many weapons as it wants, as long as the \ngovernment in Khartoum promises that the arms are not going to be used \nin Darfur, which, of course, it makes those promises and then \ncompletely ignores them.\n  As Sudan's main weapons suppliers, China and Russia, they turn a \nblind eye to the fact that the weapons they sold are being used to kill \nthe innocent civilians in Darfur, and the weapons continue to flow into \nthe country.\n  Now, remember, earlier in the year, China had shipped a huge weapons \ncache to the regime in Zimbabwe. But fortunately the ship was turned \naway by the dockworkers in South Africa. In the case of Sudan, however, \nthe Chinese arms reached their final destination.\n  According to the United Nations, China supplies approximately 90 \npercent of Sudan's imports of small arms today. Expanding the present \nembargo would help us prohibit China and Russia from selling to Sudan \nregardless of where those arms were used in the country.\n  In the October 2007 report, the U.N. panel of experts cited numerous \ninstances in which the Government of Sudan had egregiously violated the \nobligations under international law. Likewise, Amnesty International \nhas reported that Chinese and Russian weapons are used extensively in \nDarfur.\n  This year, the BBC aired a long expose on the arms flow into Sudan, \nand that BBC expose proved that Chinese weapons have been transferred \nto Darfur since the arms embargo was imposed by the United Nations \nresolution.\n  So how much more proof do we need? I tried to go to the Sudan last \nyear, but the Government of Sudan denied me a visa. So I had to go in \nthrough the back door by going into Chad and going to the border there. \nAs I traveled along that border of Chad and the Sudan, I saw there the \nsqualid refugee camps where 400,000 of those people who had fled Darfur \nhad taken refuge from the killings and the violence.\n  By the way, the killings and the violence did not stop once they were \nin the refugee camps in Chad. Since 2003, the conflict in Darfur has \nkilled at least an unbelievable 300,000 people, and it has displaced \nmore than 2.5 million.\n  They know the horrors of war, hunger, and, unfortunately the women \nknow the horrors of rape. And the attacks on the refugee camps \ncontinue.\n  As a matter of fact, the men in the refugee camps make the women go \nout to collect the firewood. Anytime they go outside of the perimeter \nof the refugee camp, they are subject to being attacked and raped.\n  Governments, religious leaders, human rights activists, and \nnongovernmental organizations have issued calls to end the genocide. \nThe people of Darfur, nevertheless, remain vulnerable to daily attacks \nby these militias, armed with Chinese and Russian firearms, and they \ncontinue to suffer.\n  We have been putting the spotlight on Darfur for several years now \nand nothing gets done. The Government of Sudan makes promises, the \nUnited Nations tries to do things, and nothing gets done. Resolutions \nand envoys have\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\nthus far failed to stop countries from funneling the arms into Darfur.\n  At the upcoming session of the United Nations General Assembly, we \nnow have another opportunity to name and shame the perpetrators and to \nhalt the immoral export of weapons to the killing fields.\n  That is what this resolution is about. It pledges to continue United \nStates support for a political solution in Darfur, and it calls for the \nimmediate and unfettered deployment of a United Nations-African Union \npeacekeeping force, without regard to the country of origin of those \nforces.\n  It calls for the immediate end of arms sales to the Government of \nSudan from all U.N. member states. That will continue until the \nconflict in Darfur has been resolved. This resolution calls for the use \nof the voice and vote of the United States in the Security Council in \norder to expand that embargo to cover all of the arms going into the \nSudan except for an appropriate exception for the nonlethal assistance \nto the Government of southern Sudan. At this upcoming 63rd U.N. General \nAssembly, when it opens next week, the U.S. must support this expanded \nembargo that will try to bring some sense into the madness that is over \nthere. If the U.N. Security Council were to strengthen the embargo \nregime, it would send a strong signal to the Sudanese Government that \ntheir support in the international community is shifting.\n  It is going to be this Senator's great privilege, as one of two \nSenators representing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to \nrepresent the Senate at the United Nations General Assembly. I plan to \nbring up this issue over and over again to the U.N. delegates I meet. I \nhope the Senate will see fit to support this effort by passing this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/15/senate-section/article/S8533-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 661--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                      SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Wicker) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 661\n\n       Whereas spina bifida is the most common, permanently \n     disabling birth defect;\n       Whereas spina bifida occurs during the first month of \n     pregnancy and leaves a permanent opening in the spinal column \n     that subsequently impacts nearly every organ system;\n       Whereas an estimated 70,000 to 130,000 people in the United \n     States currently live with spina bifida;\n       Whereas all women of childbearing age are at risk of having \n     a spina bifida affected pregnancy;\n       Whereas an estimated 70 percent of neural tube defects such \n     as spina bifida can be prevented if a woman consumes adequate \n     amounts of folic acid, which is found in most over-the-\n     counter multivitamins and foods rich in folate such as \n     spinach, prior to becoming pregnant;\n       Whereas Hispanic women are at the highest risk, between 1.5 \n     and 2 times higher than non-Hispanic whites, of delivering a \n     baby with spina bifida or another neural tube defect, yet are \n     the least likely to consume sufficient amounts of folic acid \n     prior to becoming pregnant;\n       Whereas people with spina bifida face unprecedented medical \n     complications associated with aging because people with spina \n     bifida are living longer than people with spina bifida in \n     previous generations lived and care for spina bifida is \n     complex and involves myriad clinical specialists;\n       Whereas a 2005 nationwide survey of spina bifida clinics \n     revealed that the current system of care serving people with \n     spina bifida does not fully meet current or anticipated needs \n     and physicians have little evidence-based research about \n     spina bifida on which to build neurological, orthopedic, or \n     urologic treatment regimens and interventions;\n       Whereas the National Spina Bifida Program, administered by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exists to \n     improve the health, well being, and overall quality of life \n     for the individuals and families affected by spina bifida \n     through numerous programmatic components, including the \n     National Spina Bifida Patient Registry and critical quality \n     of life research in spina bifida;\n       Whereas the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry helps to \n     improve the quality of care, to reduce morbidity and \n     mortality from spina bifida, and to increase the efficiency \n     of, and decrease the cost of, care by supporting the \n     collection of longitudinal treatment data, developing quality \n     measures and treatment standards of care and best practices, \n     identifying centers of excellence in spina bifida, evaluating \n     the clinical and cost effectiveness of the treatment of spina \n     bifida, and exchanging evidence-based information among \n     health care providers across the country; and\n       Whereas October has been designated as ``National Spina \n     Bifida Awareness Month'' to increase awareness of spina \n     bifida, of ways to prevent spina bifida, and of the need for \n     increased funding to support improving evidence-based \n     research and enhancing the quality of life of those living \n     with spina bifida: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Spina Bifida \n     Awareness Month and of national organizations working for \n     people with spina bifida;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of--\n       (A) highlighting the occurrence of spina bifida;\n       (B) recognizing the struggles and successes of people who \n     live with spina bifida;

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that 56,300 individuals were newly infected with HIV \n     in 2006;\n       Whereas approximately 25 percent of individuals with HIV \n     are unaware that they are infected;\n       Whereas the estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention utilizes a new methodology that has resulted in \n     more accurate estimates of new infections than the previous \n     methodology;\n       Whereas previous estimates of HIV infection rates \n     undercounted the rate of infection by 40 percent;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n     determined that the leading transmission category of HIV \n     infection is male-to-male sexual contact, followed by \n     heterosexual contact and injection drug use;\n       Whereas the 2000 United States Census noted that African \n     Americans account for approximately 13 percent of the \n     population of the United States, but in 2006 African \n     Americans accounted for 46 percent of HIV diagnoses;\n       Whereas, of the estimated 18,849 people under the age of 25 \n     who were diagnosed with HIV between 2001 and 2005, more than \n     60 percent were African American;\n       Whereas the rate of AIDS diagnoses for African-American \n     adults and adolescents is 10 times higher than that of their \n     White counterparts and the rate of diagnoses for Black women \n     is nearly 23 times the rate for White women;\n       Whereas, in 2006, Black women accounted for 61 percent of \n     new HIV infections among women and had an infection rate that \n     was almost 15 times higher than that of White women;\n       Whereas AIDS is the leading cause of death for Black women \n     between the ages of 25

focus \n     countries served by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS \n     Relief;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note \n     that socioeconomic issues impact the rates of HIV infection \n     among Blacks, and studies have found an association between \n     higher AIDS incidence and lower incomes;\n       Whereas, in 2006, Hispanics accounted for 18 percent of new \n     HIV/AIDS diagnoses, but account for approximately 15 percent \n     of the overall population, according to the Bureau of the \n     Census;\n       Whereas, in 2005, HIV/AIDS was the fourth leading cause of \n     death among Hispanic men and women between the ages of 35 and \n     44;\n       Whereas, in 2006, Hispanic women were 5 times more likely \n     to have AIDS than non-Hispanic White women;\n       Whereas, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, funding \n     for domestic HIV prevention programs was decreased by more\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n     than $40,000,000 in the 5-year period beginning with fiscal \n     year 2003 and ending with fiscal year 2008, despite the \n     evidence that HIV infections continue to increase in at-risk \n     communities;\n       Whereas, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the \n     President's fiscal year 2009 budget requests a decrease of \n     $15,700,000 for the Minority AIDS Initiative, despite the \n     fact that HIV has a disproportionate impact on African \n     Americans and other racial and ethnic minority populations;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are \n     engaging in outreach programs to increase HIV testing in \n     jurisdictions with the highest AIDS case rates among African \n     Americans, and those outreach programs are expected to \n     identify approximately 20,000 previously undiagnosed cases;\n       Whereas, despite those efforts, the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention have noted that ``new

EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to ensure that \n     small business concerns owned by women receive a full and \n     fair opportunity to compete for Federal contracts.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As a result of discrimination and barriers they have \n     faced, businesses owned and controlled by women are \n     underrepresented in our national economy.\n       (2) Relevant evidence includes the following:\n       (A) Numerous disparity studies conducted in every region of \n     the Nation showing disparities in the utilization of women-\n     owned businesses in Federal, State, and local government \n     contracting despite their availability in relevant markets \n     and industries.\n       (B) A recent RAND study showing that women-owned businesses \n     were underutilized in Federal contracting in as many as 87 \n     percent of the industries in the North American Industry \n     Classification System codes.\n       (C) Census data showing that despite the fact that women-\n     owned companies represent 30.4 percent of all privately-held \n     firms in the Nation, they only generate approximately 4.2 \n     percent of the gross domestic product of the United States.\n       (D) According to the Federal Procurement Data System, the \n     portion of Federal contracts awarded to women-owned business \n     has never exceeded 3.41 percent despite the fact that there \n     has been a Federal contracting goal for women of 5 percent \n     since 1994.\n       (E) Women's access to capital is important for the economy \n     and social welfare, but this access continues to be limited. \n     Of women owning larger businesses, 56 percent use commercial \n     credit. However, these statistics lag behind men's access. \n     For example, 71 percent of large male-owned businesses use \n     credit.\n       (F) Reports from women owners of businesses that they are \n     subject to stereotypes about their suspected lack of \n     competence and higher performance standards than white men. \n     Those reports also show that women-owned businesses encounter \n     discrimination in obtaining loans and surety bonds, receiving \n     price quotes from suppliers, working with trade unions, \n     obtaining public and private sector prime contracts and \n     subcontracts, and being paid promptly.\n       (3) Businesses owned and controlled by women make \n     exceedingly important contributions to the economy of the \n     Nation, and promoting women's business opportunities is a \n     valuable and necessary way to maintain a well functioning \n     society and is in the national interest.\n       (c) Authority.--Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 637(m)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraphs (1) through (4) and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `contracting officer' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 27(f)(5) of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 423(f)(5));\n       ``(B) the term `covered industry' means an industry in \n     North American Industry Classification System code 11 \n     (Forestry), 21 (Mining), 22 (Utilities), 23 (Construction), \n     31 (Manufacturing), 32 (Manufacturing), 33 (Manufacturing), \n     42 (Wholesale Trade), 44 (Retail Trade), 45 (Retail Trade), \n     48 (Transportation), 49 (Transportation), 51 (Information), \n     52 (Finance and Insurance), 53 (Real Estate and Rental and \n     Leasing), 54 (Professional, Scientific, and Technical \n     Services), 56 (Administrative and Support, Waste Management, \n     and Remediation Services), 61 (Education Services), 62 \n     (Health Care and Social Assistance), 71 (Arts, Entertainment, \n     and Recreation), 72 (Accommodation and Food Services), or 81 \n     (Other Services), or any successor to such codes;

Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Reed) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 3001, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2009 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1041. SENSE OF SENATE ON IRAQ AND THE NEED FOR AN \n                   EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN TO \n                   ADDRESS THE TERRORIST THREAT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Armed Forces have performed \n     brilliantly in Iraq and Afghanistan and have worked \n     tirelessly to carry out the missions they were given. The \n     families of those in the Armed Forces have provided strong \n     support and contributed to the success of the Armed Forces.\n       (2) The cost of the war in Iraq is enormous, more than \n     $600,000,000,000 since 2003.\n       (3) More than 4,000 Americans have died in Iraq, and more \n     than 30,000 have been wounded.\n       (4) Multiple and extended deployments have overstreched the \n     military and depleted equipment, leading the Army Vice Chief \n     of Staff to say in April 2008 that ``Today our Army is out of \n     balance. The current demand for forces in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan exceeds our sustainable supply of soldiers, of \n     units and equipment, and limits our ability to provide ready \n     forces for other contingencies. Our readiness, quite frankly, \n     is being consumed as fast as we can build it''.\n       (5) In his address to the Nation on January 10, 2007, the \n     President announced the surge of five United States combat \n     brigades consisting of approximately 30,000 additional United \n     States combat troops.\n       (6) The President stated that the surge would create a \n     situation where ``the (Iraqi) government will have the \n     breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical \n     areas'' and ``reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make \n     reconciliation possible''.\n       (7) The President described Iraq's commitment as follows: \n     ``To establish its authority, the Iraqi government plans to \n     take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces \n     by November (2007). To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in \n     the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share \n     oil revenues among all Iraqis. To show that it is committed \n     to delivering a better life, the Iraqi government will spend \n     $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and \n     infrastructure projects that will create new jobs. To empower \n     local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later \n     this year (2007). And to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their \n     nation's political life, the government will reform de-\n     Baathification laws, and establish a fair process for \n     considering amendments to Iraq's constitution''.\n       (8) A number of factors led to the decrease in violence in \n     Iraq. Increased numbers of United States Armed Forces \n     deployed to Iraq, the use of enhanced United States special \n     operations, the emergence of the Anbar Awakening starting in \n     2006, the 2007 and 2008 ceasefires of the Jaysh al-Mahdi, and \n     the improved capability of the Iraqi Army produced tangible \n     improvements in the security situation in Iraq.\n       (9) The Government of Iraq has not reached the political \n     accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge. The \n     Government of Iraq has still not enacted an oil revenue \n     sharing law, enacted a provincial election law necessary for \n     regional elections, considered changes to its constitution, \n     completed steps to disband and integrate militias, or \n     adequately dealt with the enormous number of refugees and \n     internally displaced citizens.\n       (10) Preserving the hard-fought gains of United States \n     troops in Iraq depends upon compromise and accommodation \n     among the Iraqi political leaders and an increase in \n     governmental capacity by the Government of Iraq.\n       (11) The open-ended commitment of United States forces to \n     Iraq takes the pressure off the Iraq leaders to take the \n     political steps essential to ending the conflict.\n       (12) The United States is spending an average of \n     $10,000,000,000 per month while the Iraqi government is \n     projected to achieve a budget surplus of $79,000,000,000 by \n     the end of this year.\n       (13) To date, United States taxpayers have paid \n     approximately $48,000,000,000 for stabilization and \n     reconstructions activities in Iraq.\n       (14) Iraq's overall rate of budget execution has declined \n     in each of the last three years, from 73 percent in 2005 to \n     65 percent in 2007. The Government of Iraq spent only 28 \n     percent of its $12,200,000,000 capital investment budget in \n     2007. Furthermore, the rate of execution for budgeted capital \n     investments by Iraq's central ministries decreased from 14 \n     percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2007.\n       (15) The United States Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, \n     who previously served as United States Ambassador to \n     Pakistan, testified before Congress on April 8, 2008, that al \n     Qaeda poses a greater strategic threat in the Afghanistan-\n     Pakistan border area than in Iraq.\n       (16) Afghanistan and Pakistan are the central front in the \n     fight against terrorism.\n       (17) Al Qaeda has regrouped in Pakistan. According to the \n     July 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, al Qaeda, ``has \n     protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack \n     capability, including: a safehaven in the Pakistan Federally \n     Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), operational lieutenants, \n     and its top leadership. . . As a result, we judge that the \n     United States currently is in a heightened threat \n     environment''.\n       (18) The Taliban has surged in Afghanistan and violence is \n     increasing. June was the second deadliest month in \n     Afghanistan since the war began, with 23 American deaths from \n     hostilities, compared with 22 in Iraq. Improvised explosive \n     device attacks have risen sharply, reaching a high of 2,615 \n     in 2007, up from 1,931 in 2006.\n       (19) Poppy fields in Afghanistan produce 93 percent of the \n     world's opium, which is used by the Taliban to finance the \n     insurgency.\n       (20) Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff, said on August 28, 2008, that there is a ``very \n     real, urgent requirement'' for more troops in Afghanistan.\n       (21) Admiral Michael Mullen cautioned on September 10, 2008 \n     the United States was ``running out of time'' in Afghanistan. \n     . . and ``I'm not convinced we are winning it in Afghanistan. \n     I am convinced we can''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to honor the exemplary service, commend the bravery, \n     and recognize the successes of the men and women of the \n     United States Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and thank \n     their families for their sacrifices; and\n       (2) that the President of the United States should promptly \n     promulgate and implement a strategy which--\n       (A) resets and rebuilds the United States Armed forces to \n     confront national security challenges around the world, \n     including Afghanistan;\n       (B) will promote success in Iraq by redeploying United \n     States combat troops from Iraq in a deliberate manner on a \n     timeline that is militarily sound within the context of all \n     threats facing the nation and ensures the safety of our \n     forces, and will help pressure the Iraqis to take control and \n     responsibility for their country and make the difficult \n     decisions to resolve the political differences between Iraqi \n     factions; and\n       (C) will succeed in the central front in the global war on \n     terror, specifically in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and will \n     capture or kill Usama bin Laden and the senior Al Qaeda \n     leadership.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5523.

DESIGNATION OF USS CONSTITUTION AS AMERICA'S SHIP \n                   OF STATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 3rd Congress authorized, in the Act entitled ``An \n     Act to Provide a Naval Armament'', approved on March 27, 1794 \n     (1 Stat. 350, Chap. XII), the construction of six frigates as \n     the first ships to be built for the United States Navy.\n       (2) One of the six frigates was built in Boston between \n     1794 and 1797, and is the only one of the original six ships \n     to survive.\n       (3) President George Washington named this frigate \n     ``Constitution'' to represent the Nation's founding document.\n       (4) President Thomas Jefferson, asserting the right of the \n     United States to trade on the high seas, dispatched the \n     frigate CONSTITUTION in 1803 as the flagship of the \n     Mediterranean Squadron to end the depredations of the Barbary \n     States against United States ships and shipping, which led to \n     a treaty being signed with the Bashaw of Tripoli in the \n     Captain's cabin aboard the frigate CONSTITUTION on June 4, \n     1805.\n       (5) The frigate CONSTITUTION, with her defeat of HMS \n     GUERRIERE, secured the first major victory by the young \n     United States Navy against the Royal Navy during the War of \n     1812, gaining in the process the nickname ``Old Ironsides'', \n     which she has proudly carried since.\n       (6) Congress awarded gold medals to four of the ship's \n     commanding officers (Preble, Hull, Stewart, and Bainbridge), \n     a record unmatched by any other United States Navy vessel.\n       (7) The frigate CONSTITUTION emerged from the War of 1812 \n     undefeated, having secured victories over three additional \n     ships of the Royal Navy.\n       (8) As early as May 1815, the frigate CONSTITUTION had \n     already been adopted as a symbol of the young Republic, as \n     attested by the [Washington] National Intelligencer which \n     proclaimed, ``Let us keep `Old Ironsides' at home. She has, \n     literally become the Nation's Ship . . . and should thus be \n     preserved . . . in honorable pomp, as a glorious Monument of \n     her own, and our other Naval Victories.''.\n       (9) Rumors in 1830 that ``Old Ironsides,'' an aging \n     frigate, was about to be scrapped resulted in a public uproar \n     demanding that the ship be restored and preserved, spurred by \n     Oliver Wendell Holmes' immortal poem ``Old Ironsides''.\n       (10) ``Old Ironsides'' circumnavigated the world between \n     1844 and 1846, showing the American flag as she searched for \n     future coaling stations that would eventually fuel the steam-\n     powered navy of the United States.\n       (11) The first Pope to set foot on United States sovereign \n     territory was Pius IX onboard the frigate Constitution in \n     1849.\n       (12) ``Old Ironsides'' helped evacuate the United States \n     Naval Academy from Annapolis, Maryland, to Newport, Rhode \n     Island, in 1860 to prevent this esteemed ship from falling \n     into Confederate hands.\n       (13) Congressman John F. ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald \n     introduced legislation in 1896 to return ``Old Ironsides'' \n     from the Portsmouth (New Hampshire) Naval Shipyard, where she \n     was moored pier side and largely forgotten, to Boston for her \n     100th birthday.\n       (14) Thousands of school children contributed pennies \n     between 1925 an 1927 to help fund a much needed restoration \n     for ``Old Ironsides''.\n       (15) Between 1931 and 1934, more than 4,500,000 Americans \n     gained inspiration, at the depth of the Great Depression, by \n     going aboard ``Old Ironsides'' as she was towed to 76 ports \n     on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts.\n       (16) The 83rd Congress enacted the Act of July 23, 1954 (68 \n     Stat. 527, chapter 565), which directed the Secretary of the \n     Navy to transfer to the States and appropriate commissions \n     four other historic ships then on the Navy inventory, and to \n     repair and equip USS CONSTITUTION, as much as practicable, to \n     her original condition, but not for active service.\n       (17) Queen Elizabeth II paid a formal visit to USS \n     CONSTITUTION in 1976, at the start of her state visit marking \n     the Bicentennial of the United States.\n       (18) The USS CONSTITUTION, in celebration of her \n     bicentennial, returned to sea under sail on July 21, 1997 for \n     the first time since 1881, proudly setting sails purchased by \n     the contributions of thousands of pennies given by school \n     children across the United States.\n       (19) The USS CONSTITUTION is the oldest commissioned \n     warship afloat in the world.\n       (20) The USS CONSTITUTION is a National Historic Landmark.\n       (21) The USS CONSTITUTION continues to perform official, \n     ceremonial duties, including in recent years hosting a \n     congressional dinner honoring the late Senator John Chafee of \n     Rhode Island, a special salute for the dedication of the John \n     Moakley Federal Courthouse, a luncheon honoring British \n     Ambassador Sir David Manning, and a special underway \n     demonstration during which 60 Medal of Honor recipients each \n     received a personal Medal of Honor flag.\n       (22) The USS CONSTITUTION celebrated on October 21, 2007, \n     the 210th anniversary of her launching.\n       (23) The USS CONSTITUTION will remain a commissioned ship \n     in the United States Navy, with the Navy retaining control of \n     the ship, its material condition, and its employment.\n       (24) The USS CONSTITUTION'S primary mission will remain \n     education and public outreach, and any Ship of State \n     functions will be an adjunct to the ship's primary mission.\n       (b) Designation as America's Ship of State.--\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\n       (1) In general.--The USS Constitution is hereby designated \n     as ``America's Ship of State''.\n       (2) References.--The USS Constitution may be known or \n     referred to as ``America's Ship of State''.\n       (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President, Vice President, executive branch officials, \n     and members of Congress should utilize the USS CONSTITUTION \n     for the conducting of pertinent matters of state, such as \n     hosting visiting heads of state, signing legislation relating \n     to the Armed Forces, and signing maritime related treaties.\n       (4) Fee or reimbursement structure for non-department of \n     the navy use.--The Secretary of the Navy shall determine an \n     appropriate fee or reimbursement structure for any non-\n     Department of the Navy entities using the USS CONSTITUTION \n     for Ship of State purposes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5527.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SUPPORT OF CZECH REPUBLIC \n                   AND POLAND FOR NATO MISSILE DEFENSE EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed at the Bucharest Summit on \n     April 3, 2008, that ``[b]allistic missile proliferation poses \n     an increasing threat to Allies' forces, territory and \n     populations''.\n       (2) As part of a broad response to counter the ballistic \n     missile threat, the Heads of State and Government of NATO \n     ``recognise the substantial contribution to the protection of \n     Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by \n     the planned deployment of European-based United States \n     missile defence assets''.\n       (3) On July 8, 2008, the United States Government and the \n     Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement on the \n     stationing of a United States radar facility in the Czech \n     Republic to track ballistic missiles.\n       (4) On August 20, 2008, the United States Government and \n     the Government of Poland signed an agreement on the \n     stationing of 10 ground-based missile defense interceptors to \n     defend NATO territory and populations from Iranian ballistic \n     missiles.\n       (5) The United States radar facility in the Czech Republic \n     and the United States ground-based ballistic missile defense \n     interceptor facility in Poland will become part of a future \n     NATO-wide missile defense architecture.\n       (6) The Government of Iran continues to defy international \n     calls to cease its nuclear weapons program and continues to \n     develop and test longer-range ballistic missiles and space \n     launch vehicles.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the decision by the Governments of Poland and the Czech \n     Republic to station elements of a missile defense system on \n     their territory is a clear affirmation of the commitment of \n     those governments to support the defense of Europe and the \n     United States against the threat of certain long-range \n     ballistic missiles;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the importance of these decisions taken by \n     the Governments of Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as \n     the decision by NATO to support missile defense at the \n     Bucharest Summit in April 2008; and\n       (B) notes the care and seriousness with which these \n     governments have undertaken their evaluation and \n     consideration of these issues;\n       (3) these decisions will deepen the strategic relationship \n     between these governments and make a substantial contribution \n     to the collective capability of NATO to counter existing and \n     future ballistic missile threats;\n       (4) these decisions by the Governments of Poland and the \n     Czech Republic--\n       (A) are a clear indication of their commitment to uphold \n     their independence and sovereignty; and\n       (B) demonstrate their determination to play a positive role \n     in the defense of freedom; and\n       (5) in light of all these circumstances, the United States \n     Government should fully fund and proceed with the deployment \n     of a missile defense system in Europe as soon as technically \n     feasible, which program will provide additional protection \n     for the United States and Europe against certain long-range \n     ballistic missile threats.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5537.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SUPPORT OF CZECH REPUBLIC \n                   AND POLAND FOR MISSILE DEFENSE EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed at the Bucharest Summit on \n     April 3, 2008, that ``[b]allistic missile proliferation poses \n     an increasing threat to Allies' forces, territory and \n     populations''.\n       (2) As part of a broad response to counter the ballistic \n     missile threat, the Heads of State and Government of NATO \n     ``recognise the substantial contribution to the protection of \n     Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by \n     the planned deployment of European-based United States \n     missile defence assets''.\n       (3) At the Bucharest Summit, the NATO Heads of State and \n     Government stated that, with respect to the planned \n     deployment of United States missile defense capability, \n     ``[w]e are exploring ways to link this capability with \n     current NATO missile defence efforts as a way to ensure that \n     it would be an integral part of any future NATO wide missile \n     defence architecture''.\n       (4) At the Bucharest Summit, the NATO Heads of State and \n     Government stated that, ``[b]earing in mind the principle of \n     the indivisibility of Allied security as well as NATO \n     solidarity, we task the Council in Permanent Session to \n     develop options for a comprehensive missile defence \n     architecture to extend coverage to all Allied territory and \n     populations not otherwise covered by the United States system \n     for review at our 2009 Summit, to inform any future political \n     decision''.\n       (5) On July 8, 2008, the United States Government and the \n     Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement on the \n     stationing of a United States radar facility in the Czech \n     Republic to track ballistic missiles.\n       (6) On August 20, 2008, the United States Government and \n     the Government of Poland signed an agreement on the \n     stationing of 10 ground-based missile defense interceptors in \n     Poland.\n       (7) Supplemental Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) \n     regarding the missile defense deployment agreements, not yet \n     signed, are required elements of any final agreements to \n     deploy the planned missile defense capabilities in the Czech \n     Republic and Poland.\n       (8) In order to take legal effect, any final bilateral \n     missile defense agreements must be submitted to and ratified \n     by the parliaments of the Czech Republic and Poland, \n     respectively.\n       (9) The deployment of the planned United States missile \n     defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland would not \n     provide protection to southeastern portions of NATO territory \n     against missile attack. Additional missile defense \n     capabilities would be required to protect these areas against \n     missile attack, including against existing short- and medium-\n     range missile threats.\n       (10) According to the Director of Operational Test and \n     Evaluation, the ground-based interceptor planned to be \n     deployed in Poland would require three flight tests to \n     demonstrate whether it could accomplish its mission in an \n     operationally effective manner. Such testing is not expected \n     to begin before the fall of 2009, and is unlikely to be \n     concluded before 2011.\n       (11) The Government of Iran continues to defy international \n     calls to cease its uranium enrichment program, has deployed \n     hundreds of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, and \n     continues to develop and test ballistic missiles of \n     increasing range, as well as a space launch vehicle.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the decisions by the Governments of Poland and the \n     Czech Republic to station elements of a missile defense \n     system on their territory are a clear affirmation of the \n     commitment of those governments to support the defense of \n     NATO, including the United States, against the threat of \n     long-range ballistic missiles;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the importance of these decisions taken by \n     the Governments of Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as \n     the statements made by NATO Heads of State and Government \n     relative to missile defense at the Bucharest Summit in April \n     2008; and\n       (B) notes the care and seriousness with which the \n     Governments of Poland and the Czech Republic have undertaken \n     their evaluation and consideration of these issues; and\n       (3) these decisions will deepen the strategic relationship \n     between the United States Government and the Governments of \n     Poland and the Czech Republic and make a substantial\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\n     contribution to the collective capability of NATO to counter \n     future long-range ballistic missile threats.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to modify the requirements of section 226 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 41), or [section 232] of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 5563.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Enhanced Partnership \n     with Pakistan Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 1242. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The people of Pakistan and the United States have a \n     long history of friendship and comity, and the vital \n     interests of both nations are well-served by strengthening \n     and deepening this friendship.\n       (2) In February 2008, the people of Pakistan elected a \n     civilian government, reversing months of political tension \n     and intrigue, as well as mounting popular concern over \n     governance and their own democratic reform and political \n     development.\n       (3) A democratic, moderate, modernizing Pakistan would \n     represent the wishes of that country's populace, and serve as \n     a model to other countries around the world.\n       (4) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, \n     and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al \n     Qaeda and the Taliban.\n       (5) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several \n     thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security \n     forces of Pakistan over the past 6 years.\n       (6) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, more \n     al Qaeda terrorist suspects have been apprehended in Pakistan \n     than in any other country, including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, \n     Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi.\n       (7) Despite the sacrifices and cooperation of the security \n     forces of Pakistan, the top leadership of al Qaeda, as well \n     as the leadership and rank-and-file of affiliated terrorist \n     groups, are believed to use Pakistan's Federally Administered \n     Tribal Areas (FATA) as a haven and a base from which to \n     organize terrorist actions in Pakistan and with global reach.\n       (8) According to a Government Accountability Office Report, \n     (GAO-08-622), ``since 2003, the administration's national \n     security strategies and Congress have recognized that a \n     comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national \n     power--diplomatic, military, intelligence, development \n     assistance, economic, and law enforcement support-- was \n     needed to address the terrorist threat emanating from the \n     FATA'' and that such a strategy was also mandated by section \n     7102(b)(3) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 22 U.S.C. 2656f \n     note) and section 2042(b)(2) of the Implementing the \n     Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (Public \n     Law 110-53; 22 U.S.C. 2375 note).\n       (9) According to United States military sources and \n     unclassified intelligence reports, including the July 2007 \n     National Intelligence Estimate entitled, ``The Terrorist \n     Threat to the U.S. Homeland'', the Taliban, al Qaeda, and \n     their Pakistani affiliates continue to use territory in \n     Pakistan as a haven, recruiting location, and rear base for \n     violent actions in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as \n     attacks globally, and pose a threat to the United States \n     homeland.\n       (10) The toll of terrorist attacks, including suicide \n     bombs, on the people of Pakistan include thousands of \n     citizens killed and wounded across the country, over 1,400 \n     military and police forces killed (including 700 since July \n     2007), and dozens of tribal, provincial, and national \n     officials targeted and killed, as well as the brazen \n     assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto while \n     campaigning in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007, and several \n     attempts on the life of President Pervaiz Musharraf, and the \n     rate of such attacks have grown considerably over the past 2 \n     years.\n       (11) The people of Pakistan and the United States share \n     many compatible goals, including--\n       (A) combating terrorism and violent radicalism, both inside \n     Pakistan and elsewhere;\n       (B) solidifying democracy and the rule of law in Pakistan;\n       (C) promoting the economic development of Pakistan, both \n     through the building of infrastructure and the facilitation \n     of increased trade;\n       (D) promoting the social and material well-being of \n     Pakistani citizens, particularly through development of such \n     basic services as public education, access to potable water, \n     and medical treatment; and\n       (E) safeguarding the peace and security of South Asia, \n     including by facilitating peaceful relations between Pakistan \n     and its neighbors.\n       (12) According to consistent opinion research, including \n     that of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (December 28, 2007) \n     and the International Republican Institute (January 29, \n     2008), many people in Pakistan have historically viewed the \n     relationship between the United States and Pakistan as a \n     transactional one, characterized by a heavy emphasis on \n     security issues with little attention to other matters of \n     great interest to citizens of Pakistan.\n       (13) The election of a civilian government in Pakistan in \n     February 2008 provides an opportunity, after nearly a decade \n     of military-dominated rule, to place relations between \n     Pakistan and the United States on a new and more stable \n     foundation.\n       (14) Both the Government of Pakistan and the United States \n     Government should seek to enhance the bilateral relationship \n     through additional multi-faceted engagement in order to \n     strengthen the foundation for a consistent and reliable long-\n     term partnership between the two countries.\n\n     SEC. 1243.

ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY PROHIBITIONS ON \n                   ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN BENEFICIARY FEES FOR \n                   MILITARY HEALTH CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the uniformed services and their \n     families endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current Global War on Terrorism, but also during the wars of \n     the last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) The demands and sacrifices are such that few Americans \n     are willing to bear or accept them for a multi-decade career.\n       (4) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     extraordinary retirement benefits that a grateful Nation \n     provides for those who choose to subordinate much of their \n     personal life to the national interest for so many years.\n       (5) Many private sector firms are curtailing health \n     benefits and shifting significantly higher costs to their \n     employees, and one effect of such curtailment is that retired \n     members of the uniformed services are turning for health care \n     services to the Department of Defense, and its TRICARE \n     program, for the health care benefits in retirement that they \n     earned by their service in uniform.\n       (6) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, a \n     large part of those efforts has been devoted to shifting a \n     larger share of the costs of benefits under that program to \n     retired members of the uniformed services.\n       (7) The cumulative increase in enrollment fees, \n     deductibles, and copayments being proposed by the Department \n     of Defense for health care benefits under the TRICARE program \n     far exceeds the percentage increase in military retired pay \n     since such fees, deductibles, and copayments were first \n     required on the part of retired members of the uniformed \n     services.\n       (8) Proposals of the Department of Defense for increases in \n     the enrollment fees, deductibles, and copayments of retired \n     members of the uniformed services who are participants in the \n     TRICARE program fail to recognize adequately that such \n     members paid the equivalent of enormous in-kind premiums for \n     health care in retirement through their extended sacrifices \n     by service in uniform.\n       (9) Some of the Nation's health care providers refuse to \n     accept participants in the TRICARE program as patients \n     because that program pays them significantly less than \n     commercial insurance programs, and imposes unique \n     administrative requirements, for health care services.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have a \n     committed obligation to provide health care benefits to \n     retired members of the uniformed services that exceeds the \n     obligation of corporate employers to provide health care \n     benefits to their employees;

The Category Four storm displaced over 400,000 Cubans \n     and damaged or destroyed 130,000 homes and caused severe \n     damage to infrastructure.\n       (2) Hurricane Ike, which made landfall on Cuba on September \n     7, 2008, forced the evacuation of over 2,500,000 Cubans, \n     damaged an additional 100,000 structures, and damaged local \n     infrastructure.\n       (3) The number of Cubans left homeless is expected to reach \n     100,000, and the total economic losses of Hurricanes Gustav \n     and Ike are expected to reach upwards of $10,000,000,000, \n     with serious damage done to the island's agricultural \n     industry.\n       (4) In the wake of past natural disasters, the United \n     States eased restrictions to mobilize the generous spirit of \n     many thousands of Americans by allowing humanitarian aid \n     originating from the United States to be transported directly \n     to Cuba to the benefit of the Cuban people.\n       (5) Allowing the people of the United States to assist the \n     Cuban people in reclaiming their lives and livelihoods \n     following a major natural disaster just 90 miles from the \n     United States is an important aspect of United States \n     national security and defense policy.\n\n            PART I--TRAVEL, REMITTANCES, AND RELIEF PACKAGES\n\n     SEC. 1251.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Afghan Freedom Support \n     and Security Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 1242. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 6 years after the liberation of Afghanistan \n     from the Taliban, who provided Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda \n     with a safe haven for planning the attacks of September 11, \n     2001, Afghanistan remains highly unstable and the government \n     of President Hamid Karzai remains subject to attacks from \n     remnants of the Taliban who have regrouped in the region with \n     other insurgent groups, including foreign fighters associated \n     with Al-Qaeda.\n       (2) The Government of Afghanistan supports the continued \n     deployment of international forces to supplement its own \n     nascent national security forces and North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) forces, which took over international \n     stability operations for the entire country through the \n     International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) on October 5, \n     2006.\n       (3) An insurgency that began in a relatively weak position \n     at the end of 2005 has expanded to pose a serious threat to \n     the Government of Afghanistan and the international NATO/ISAF \n     and Operation Enduring Freedom forces, whose casualties have \n     mounted significantly during 2008, while civilian casualties \n     have also increased substantially in Afghanistan, resulting \n     in significant popular disenchantment and concern about the \n     prospects of peace and stability in the near future.\n       (4) Despite the establishment of a constitution and a \n     constitutionally-elected government in Afghanistan, the \n     failure to build the core institutions of the state and the \n     market has resulted in opportunities for massive corruption \n     and the mounting loss of trust of the Afghan people in their \n     government.\n       (5) A Government Accountability Office report released on \n     June 18, 2008 (GAO-08-883T) indicates that ``although the \n     [Afghan National Police] has reportedly grown in number since \n     2005, after an investment of nearly $6 billion, no Afghan \n     police unit (0 of 433) is assessed by Defense as fully \n     capable of performing its mission''.\n       (6) The failure of the current counter-narcotics strategy \n     for Afghanistan has diminished Afghan political will to take \n     on the increasingly powerful drug interests in the country. \n     The lack of significant results is due to--\n       (A) the failure to have in place in Afghanistan the \n     essential institutional elements necessary to arrest and \n     prosecute mid- and high-level drug traffickers and enablers; \n     and\n       (B) the lack of economic mechanisms, such as finance \n     facilities and services and adequate land rights, to enable \n     Afghan farmers to develop alternatives to opium production.\n       (7) The violence and instability in Afghanistan is further \n     exacerbated by corruption and the flourishing trade in opium \n     and opium-related products, which--\n       (A) has reached record levels;\n       (B) fuels local militias;\n       (C) corrupts the national and local governments; and\n       (D) provides funding for insurgent and terrorist groups.\n       (8) The failure of the Government of Afghanistan to reform \n     the judicial sector has allowed the Taliban to offer its \n     version of dispute settlement and to operate among ordinary \n     citizens.\n       (9) The Bonn Agreement--\n       (A) provided legitimacy and initial stability in \n     Afghanistan between late 2001 and 2006;\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\n       (B) enabled the drafting of a new constitution, the first \n     directly elected President in the history of Afghanistan, and \n     a sitting National Parliament.\n       (10) The Bonn Agreement also provided the political \n     platform through which a series of benchmarks were set. These \n     benchmarks were met against a carefully sequenced timeline \n     for a narrow list of institutional priorities upon which the \n     Afghan Government, Afghan citizens, and their international \n     supporters could collaborate. The National Health System, the \n     Afghan National Army, the National Solidarity Program, the \n     National Telecommunications program, and the National \n     Transportation System provided a clear framework for the \n     establishment and coordination of goals, tasks, benchmarks, \n     and allocation of responsibilities.\n       (11) On February 1, 2006, the Government of Afghanistan and \n     the international community issued the Afghanistan Compact, \n     which sets forth both the international community``s \n     commitment to Afghanistan and Afghanistan''s commitment to \n     state-building and reform.\n       (12) The Afghanistan Compact, which is supported by the \n     Afghan National Development Strategy--\n       (A) provides the core framework for building an effective, \n     accountable state in Afghanistan;\n       (B) sets goals and standards for improvements in security, \n     governance, and development;\n       (C) includes measures for reducing the narcotics economy, \n     promoting regional cooperation, and making aid more \n     effective, particularly at the local and provincial levels; \n     and\n       (D) established a mechanism to monitor Afghanistan and the \n     international community's adherence to the time lines, goals, \n     and objectives set forth in the document.\n\n     SEC. 1243. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) following the liberation of Afghanistan from the \n     Taliban in 2001, the Federal Government underestimated--\n       (A) the nature of the challenge in Afghanistan;\n       (B) the time horizon for restoring political and economic \n     stability in Afghanistan; and\n       (C) the type of resources required to help ensure a stable \n     Afghanistan with effective and accountable state institutions \n     and developing economic opportunities;\n       (2) the international community must--\n       (A) provide appropriate and forthright expectations of the \n     long and challenging commitment necessary for success in \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (B) accurately estimate the nature of the resources \n     required;\n       (3) Afghanistan remains a country of paramount importance \n     to our national security and building Afghanistan into an \n     effective state with political and economic stability is a \n     goal that the United States shares with the Government of \n     Afghanistan and its citizens;\n       (4) the region in which Afghanistan is situated is of \n     paramount importance to the national security of the United \n     States and our diplomatic initiatives and foreign policy in \n     this region must be harmonized and coherent across the \n     region;\n       (5) the most important partners in the security, stability, \n     and development of Afghanistan are the people of that \n     country, who should remain a prime focus of our efforts to \n     build their sustained capacity to govern;\n       (6) long-term, consistent, and coordinated international \n     support and assistance is required in Afghanistan to secure, \n     stabilize, and develop the country so that it is capable of \n     sustaining good governance and becoming a responsible and \n     valued partner in the international community;\n       (7) setting appropriate expectations in Afghanistan and in \n     donor and partner capitals is essential to effective and \n     responsible foreign assistance policy; and understanding the \n     necessity for long-term engagement in such situations will \n     prevent short term, unsustainable outcomes;\n       (8) Afghanistan and its neighbors have a mutual \n     responsibility to ensure that their territories are not the \n     source, and their policies are not complicit in, the \n     destabilization or deprivation of other countries in the \n     region;\n       (9) the challenges Afghanistan faces stem more from weak \n     governance than from a strong enemy and can be overcome by \n     the unity and resolve of the Afghan people and the \n     international community;\n       (10) American academic and policy institutions and several \n     respected outside organizations have conducted significant \n     close and prolonged studies of the Afghanistan situation, \n     generating reports and comprehensive reviews of post-conflict \n     reconstruction, counter-narcotics, economic development, \n     security force training, and counter-insurgency efforts that \n     warrant review and consideration by United States policy \n     makers to develop a more responsive United States strategy to \n     address the crisis in Afghanistan;\n       (11) despite some delays in its deployment, the Afghan \n     National Army (ANA), which is an essential element in the \n     stability of Afghanistan in a volatile region, must continue \n     to be properly trained and equipped to achieve effective and \n     independent operational capability;\n       (12) the security of Afghanistan is closely intertwined \n     with those of its regional neighbors;\n       (13) success in Afghanistan, both economic and political, \n     will be dependent on security and stability in the region; \n     and\n       (14) it is essential that United States policy be \n     harmonized and complementary across the region.\n\n     SEC. 1244. DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to render appropriate, long-term assistance to \n     Afghanistan in a consistent and coordinated fashion with \n     willing and responsible partners in the international \n     community;\n       (2) to ensure that our foreign policy in this region is \n     responsive to and in partnership with the people of \n     Afghanistan;\n       (3) to harmonize its assistance efforts in Afghanistan and \n     neighboring countries across--\n       (A) all associated Federal agencies; and\n       (B) to the maximum extent possible, with congruent \n     international partner assistance efforts; and\n       (4) to regularly, comprehensively, and openly review \n     stabilization, reconstruction and development efforts in \n     Afghanistan to ensure flexibility and the most effective \n     utilization of resources toward specific, tangible outcomes.\n\n     SEC. 1245. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--Except as \n     otherwise provided, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (D) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Government of afghanistan.--The term ``Government of \n     Afghanistan'' includes--\n       (A) the government of any political subdivision of \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (B) any agency or instrumentality of the Government of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (3) International security assistance force; isaf.--The \n     terms ``International Security Assistance Force'' and \n     ``ISAF'' means the international security assistance force \n     established to assist in the maintenance of security in \n     Afghanistan pursuant to United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1386 (2001), as amended by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 1413 (2002), 1444 (2002), 1510 (2003), \n     1563 (2004), 1623 (2005), and 1707 (2006).\n\n     SEC. 1246.
