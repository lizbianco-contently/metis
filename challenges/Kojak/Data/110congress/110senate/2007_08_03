DeGIUSTI, TO BE A UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Timothy D. DeGiusti, of \nOklahoma, to be a United States District Judge for the Western District \nof Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senators from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this morning, as I do every morning, I was \ntaking my aggressive walk around the Capitol. I walked in front of the \nU.S. Supreme Court, and I looked up at the eight pillars facing west, \nand I said audibly, ``Help is on its way,'' in the form of a young \njurist from Oklahoma named Tim DeGiusti.\n  I pause for a moment to thank, certainly, Senator Specter for his \nhelp. I single out Senator Leahy, who gave me his word a long time ago \nthat this would happen before the August recess. I say the same thing \nabout the majority leader, Senator Reid. I thank him for his \nassistance.\n  I know my junior Senator would like to say a couple of words and will \ntalk about the qualifications of this man. He has highest ratings in \neverything. He has strong support from Democrats--our Democratic \nGovernor, and my predecessor here, David Boren, a Democrat.\n  On a personal note, 41 years ago, I was elected to the State house of \nrepresentatives with a very bright guy named Ralph Thompson. He ended \nup being one of the most renowned Federal district judges in the \nhistory of Oklahoma. He and his family are watching us right now from a \nreunion in Ohio. I only suggest, through the Chair, that Ralph Thompson \nand his wife Barbara had three beautiful little girls. His daughter \nElaine married Tim DeGiusti. So there is a connection there. You have a \ngreat jurist in Ralph\n\n[[Page S10850]]\n\nThompson, and then you have the next generation, his son-in-law, Tim \nDeGiusti, whose nomination is before us now.\n  I am so honored to have the opportunity to call for this vote in a \nfew minutes for Tim DeGiusti to be a Federal district court judge in \nOklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am proud to support the nomination of \nTimothy DeGiusti to be a Federal judge in the Western District of \nOklahoma.\n  Timothy brings impeccable credentials to the table and a solid \nrespect for the rule of law.\n  Timothy appreciates and understands that a Federal judge's role is \nnot to write the law from the bench but to apply the law as Congress \nand the President set out.\n  At his hearing he said it's important for judges to not wish they \nwere legislators when deciding a statute.\n  At his hearing, Timothy also talked about the importance of judicial \nintegrity and the need for judges to act fairly in court so as to not \nerode public confidence in the rule of law which is the bedrock of \nAmerican law.\n  Timothy brings a unique perspective to the bench as a veteran \nmilitary lawyer. His expertise in military and intelligence issues will \nbe especially need in this ongoing war on terror.\n  There is support of his nomination from prominent Democrats in the \nState, including former U.S. Senator David Boren, current Democratic \nGovernor Brad Henry, former Democratic Attorney General Mike Turpen, \nand former Democratic State Senate Majority Leader Stratton Taylor.\n  Mr. President, again, this is a gentleman of extreme experience, \nintellectual honesty, and absolute character. I am proud that he will \nbe making decisions on the Federal bench in the Western District of \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nInhofe, has talked to me about this nominee several times. I am glad he \nis on the floor with me. He would corral me on the floor, in the \ncorridors, in the Senate elevators, and everywhere else. I am glad we \nare going through with this nomination.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield. I have talked \nabout the Senator's cooperation. When I was elected 12 years ago, Henry \nBellman, a good friend of his, said, ``Become a good friend of Pat \nLeahy. He keeps his word.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Henry Bellman was one of the finest men I \nhave ever served with. I valued his friendship too. We traveled to \nVermont and we traveled out to his home and elsewhere.\n  Today as we head into the August recess, the Senate considers another \nnomination for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, Timothy D. \nDeGiusti for the Western District of Oklahoma, a well-qualified nominee \nwith the support of both home State Senators.\n  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 26 nominations for lifetime appointments this year, 4 \nmore than were confirmed in all of 2005 with a Republican chairman and \nRepublican majority and 9 more than were confirmed during the entire \n1996 session. The Judiciary Committee has reported out 31 lifetime \nappointments to the Federal courts since January of this year.\n  It is a little known fact that during the Bush Presidency, more \ncircuit judges, more district judges and more total judges have been \nconfirmed, in less time, while I served as Judiciary chairman than \nduring the longer tenures of either of the two Republican chairmen \nworking with Republican Senate majorities.\n  Taking into account today's confirmation, the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts lists 49 judicial vacancies. The President has sent \nus only 25 nominations for these 49 remaining vacancies. Twenty-four of \nthese remaining vacancies--almost half--have no nominee. Of the 17 \nvacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial \nemergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 8 of them, \nalmost half. Of the 16 circuit court vacancies, exactly half are \nwithout a nominee. If the President had worked with the Senators from \nMichigan, Rhode Island, Maryland, California and New Jersey, we could \nbe in position to make even more progress. And of the 24 vacancies \nwithout any nominee, the President has violated the timeline he set for \nhimself at least 13 times--13 have been vacant without so much as a \nnominee for more than 180 days. The number of violations may in fact be \nmuch higher since the President said he would nominate within 180 days \nof receiving notice that there would be a vacancy or intended \nretirement rather than from the vacancy itself. We conservatively \nestimate that he also violated his own rule 11 times in connection with \nthe nominations he has made. That would mean that with respect to the \n49 vacancies, the President is out of compliance with his own rule \nalmost half of the time.\n  Timothy D. DeGiusti is a partner at the law firm of Holladay, Chilton \n& DeGiusti, PLLC in Oklahoma City, OK. He previously served 3 years in \nthe U.S. Army as a military prosecutor and legal adviser for the Judge \nAdvocate General Corp. Before that he was in private practice and \ntaught as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Oklahoma \nCollege of Law. Mr. DeGiusti graduated from the University of Oklahoma \nand the University of Oklahoma College of Law.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n\n                Updating the Freedom of Information Law\n\n  Mr. President, I have some good news. We are reaching an agreement \nthat should clear the way for Senate passage of the Openness Promotes \nEffectiveness in Our National Government Act, the OPEN Government Act, \nS. 849, which is a mouthful. That means we will have a much needed \nupdate of the Freedom of Information Act.\n  This is comprehensive legislation which Senator Cornyn and I \nintroduced earlier this year. A lot of people have not sat by idly \nwhile there has been obstruction on this floor. They have pushed for it \nand demanded it. I think of all of the editorial writers and letter \nwriters who said: Let's do this. I will speak further if we do pass it.\n  Every administration, Democratic or Republican, will tell you all the \nthings they do right. Most administrations don't want to talk about the \nthings that don't go right. It is usually the press and public \ncitizens, individuals, who find things out through FOIA.\n  Open government and transparent decisionmaking are bedrock American \nvalues. For more than four decades, FOIA has translated those great \nvalues into practice by guaranteeing access to government information. \nJust recently, we witnessed the effectiveness of FOIA in shedding light \non the chronic abuse of National Security Letters, NSLs, at the FBI. \nThis disclosure of government documents obtained under FOIA showed the \nFBI reported an intentional and willful violation of the laws governing \nNSLs to the President's Intelligence Oversight Board just before the \n2004 election, contrary to the impression created by testimony of \nAttorney General Gonzales.\n  Although FOIA continues to demonstrate its great value in shedding \nlight on bad government policies and abuses, this open government law \nis being hampered by excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance. Today, \nAmericans who seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain \nit than during any other time in FOIA's 40-plus year history. According \nto the National Security Archive, an independent research institute, \nthe oldest outstanding FOIA requests date back to 1989, before the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. In fact, more than a year after the \nPresident's FOIA executive order to improve agency FOIA performance, \nFOIA backlogs are at an all-time high. According to a recent report by \nthe Government Accountability Office, federal agencies had 43 percent \nmore FOIA requests pending and outstanding in 2006 than in 2002. In \naddition, the percentage of FOIA requestors who obtained at least some \nof the information that they requested from the Government declined by \n31 percent in 2006, according to a study by the Coalition of \nJournalists for Open Government. As the first major reform to FOIA in \nmore than a decade, the OPEN Government Act would help to reverse these \ntroubling trends and help to begin to restore the public's trust in \ntheir government. This bill also improves transparency in the Federal \nGovernment's FOIA process by:\n\n[[Page S10851]]\n\n  Restoring meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA;\n  Imposing real consequences on Federal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-\nday statutory deadline;\n  Clarifying that FOIA applies to government records held by outside \nprivate contractors;\n  Establishing a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies; and\n  Creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and Federal \nagencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation.\n  Let me also be clear about what this bill does not do. This bill does \nnot harm or impede in any way the Government's ability to withhold or \nprotect classified information. Classified, national security and \nhomeland security-related information are all expressly exempt from \nFOIA's public disclosure mandate and this bill does nothing to alter \nthese important exemptions. Senator Cornyn and I have been proposing an \namendment to our own bill that would preserve the right of federal \nagencies to assert these and other FOIA exemptions, even if agencies \nmiss the 20-day statutory deadline under FOIA.\n  The OPEN Government Act is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 14 \nSenators, including the bill's lead Republican cosponsor, Senator \nCornyn. This bill is also endorsed by more than 115 business, public \ninterest, and news organizations from across the political and \nideological spectrum, including the American Library Association, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, the \nRepublican Liberty Caucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and \nthe Vermont Press Association. I thank all of the cosponsors of this \nbill for their commitment to open government. I also thank the many \norganizations that have endorsed the OPEN Government Act for their \nsupport of this legislation.\n  I especially want to thank the concerned citizens who have not sat \nidly by while some have sought to delay and obstruct Senate \nconsideration of this measure. Instead, knowing the importance of this \nmeasure to the American people's right to know, they have demanded \naction and refuse to take no for an answer. That is what led to this \nbreakthrough and to the commitment of Senate opponents of our FOIA bill \nto come around.\n  The OPEN Government Act is a good-government bill that Democrats and \nRepublicans, alike, can and should work together to enact. For more \nthan 2 years, I have worked on a bipartisan basis to pass this \nlegislation and I remain committed to work with any Senator, from \neither party, who is serious about restoring transparency, trust and \naccountability to our government. Open government should not be a \nDemocratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American issue and an \nAmerican value.\n  I am glad to announce to today that with Senator Cornyn's help we \nhave come to an understanding with Senators Kyl and Bennett that should \nlead to Senate passage before the August recess.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent USA Today editorial entitled, \n``Our view on your right to know: Endless delays mar requests for \ngovernment information,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [From USA Today]\n\n    Our View on Your Right To Know: Endless Delays Mar Requests for \n                         Government Information\n\n       Federal agencies are supposed to respond to requests for \n     information within 20 business days. In some cases, 20 years \n     has been more like it. A sampling of pending queries:\n       In 1987, lawyers for the Church of Scientology asked the \n     State Department for information about whether the department \n     had been gathering information about the church or about \n     ``cults.''\n       In 1988, steelmaker USX Corp. requested government data on \n     the steel industry in Luxembourg.\n       And in 1989, the Armenian Assembly of America sought \n     documents on the Armenian genocide that occurred more than 70 \n     years earlier during World War I.\n       What these queries have in common is that they are among \n     thousands of requests that have been sandbagged, stonewalled \n     or lost by government agencies.\n       Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act in 1966 to \n     give citizens and taxpayers access to government-held records \n     that they've paid to have gathered. But 40 years later, \n     scores of agencies still can't--or won't--get it right.\n       Compliance with the 20-day deadline is ``an exception \n     rather than a standard practice,'' according to a report this \n     month from the Knight Foundation and the National Security \n     Archive watchdog group.\n       Twelve agencies, ranging from the Defense Department to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, have backlogs of 10 years or \n     more. Only one-fifth of federal agencies are in compliance \n     with a 10-year-old law that was supposed to put so much \n     government information on the Internet that most FOIA \n     requests would no longer be needed.\n       Long-overdue reforms that sailed through the House in March \n     with a wide bipartisan majority have been stalled in the \n     Senate--largely because of opposition from Sen. Jon Kyl, R-\n     Ariz.--despite a unanimously favorable vote by the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       The ugly reality is that the freedom-of-information law has \n     been sabotaged for years by politicians and bureaucrats \n     trying to make it hard, if not impossible, for citizens to \n     obtain information to which they're entitled.\n       The pending reforms would restore meaningful deadlines for \n     agency action and impose serious consequences on agencies \n     that miss those deadlines. The bill also would establish a \n     freedom-of-information hotline to enable citizens to track \n     the status of their requests. And it seeks to repeal a \n     perverse incentive that encourages agencies to delay \n     compliance with information requests until just before a \n     court decision that is going to be favorable to the \n     requester.\n       Of the more than 500,000 freedom-of-information requests \n     filed every year, over 90% are from private citizens, \n     businesses or state and local agencies seeking information \n     that's important to them and that in most cases they are \n     entitled to.\n       Critics of the legislation object to getting tough on \n     agencies that flout the law and claim that some of the \n     proposed reforms would force the disclosure of sensitive \n     information. If so, these are issues that should be thrashed \n     out in Congress, not used as a club to stall consideration of \n     this long-overdue legislation. The public's right to know is \n     too important to remain on hold.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I express my deep concern about the \ndeveloping trends in drug abuse among our kids. As cochairman of the \nSenate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I am often confronted \nwith reports about the latest drug trends, but recently I have become \nmore alarmed with what these reports contain. Drug dealers are \nbeginning to market their deadly substances to an increasingly younger \ncrowd so they can become hooked at a younger age.\n  Young people are the most at-risk populations we have in drug abuse, \nwhich is why it is disturbing to see highly addictive drugs such as \nmeth, heroin, even prescription pain killers, antidepressants, and \nsteroids marketed and distributed in new ways--with an emphasis upon \nnew ways--to get a greater number of very young people, particularly \nelementary children, addicted. I want Congress and the American people \nto know what is going on with our kids and what we need to do to stop \nthese very dangerous trends.\n  We have things such as candy-flavored methamphetamine. It is one of \nthe biggest and latest gimmicks that drug dealers use to lure our kids \ninto addiction. Flavors such as strawberry, known as ``Strawberry \nQuick,'' and chocolate are clearly being used to make methamphetamine \nseem less harmful and more appealing. This type of meth is also being \nmarketed in smaller amounts, making it cheaper--because money is an \nissue--and, hence, more accessible to children. At least eight States \nhave reported cases of candy-flavored meth, and many law enforcement \nofficials are expecting Strawberry Quick to infiltrate their States in \nthe near future.\n  What is even more disturbing is that many kids may not realize they \nare using a deadly substance. In fact, that is the motivation behind \nthe drug dealers and distributors. According to my colleague Senator \nFeinstein, some kids reported that they thought Strawberry Quick was an \nenergy drink and were misled by drug dealers into trying meth for the \nfirst time.\n  Methamphetamine abuse has reached epidemic proportions, and the fact \nthat drug dealers are trying to get children addicted at such a young \nage underscores the importance of taking quick action to eliminate this \ndanger. That is why I joined my colleague Senator Feinstein in \nintroducing the Saving Kids From Dangerous Drugs Act. This legislation \nwill double the Federal criminal penalties for drug dealers who flavor \nor disguise illegal drugs to make them more appealing to people under \nage 21, and it will triple the penalties for repeat offenders. I hope \nmy colleagues will take a look at this piece of legislation and join \nSenator Feinstein and me in passing this legislation soon, because we \nhave to end the practice of purposefully altering illegal drugs to make \nthem more appealing to young people in order to get more people hooked \nat a very early age.\n  The ongoing revelations of widespread steroid abuse in professional \nsports, along with the recent suicide of World Wrestling Entertainment \nsuperstar Chris Benoit, highlight a disturbing trend in sports and the \nentertainment world, and it has a lasting impact upon our kids. It is \nalleged that Benoit killed his wife and 7-year-old son in what is \ncommonly called a ``roid rage,'' which is caused by a chemical \nimbalance in the brain brought on by steroid abuse. If this is proven \ntrue, it will be yet another tragic tale of the destructive nature of \nsteroids.\n  What is even more tragic is the fact that steroid abuse among high \nschoolers has been rising. The 2006 Monitoring the Future Survey, a \nstudy done annually to monitor drug abuse among middle and senior high \nschool students, shows that the percentage of 12th graders who have \nadmitted trying steroids has increased dramatically. Kids look up to \nthese athletes and performers as role models. We know that. When they \nsee their heroes using these terrible substances, they get the \nimpression that it is okay to use steroids.\n  Steroids are also marketed to kids. Students who participate in \nsports are facing enormous pressure to perform at high levels, and we \nare seeing more and more teens turn to steroids to gain an athletic \nadvantage. You can find Web sites encouraging teens to buy substances \ncalled DHEA, which has been declared a steroid by the U.S. Anti-Doping \nAgency, as a new way to bulk up. The major sports leagues, with the \nexception of Major League Baseball, have banned DHEA, even though it \nremains legal in this country. Though DHEA is used as a legitimate \nsupplement for thousands of people, teens are using it as an \nalternative to illegal steroids.\n  I introduced a bill earlier this year that would reinstate the ban \nthat was imposed on DHEA in the 1980s, but I think we can find a way to \nkeep minors from obtaining this substance while allowing adults to use \nthe drug legitimately. GNC, the world's leading dietary supplement \nprovider, has a policy not to sell DHEA to anyone under 18, and for \ngood reason. We need to pass that legislation as soon as we can.\n  We should also take note of one of the fastest emerging drug trends \namong kids today--the abuse of prescription drugs. Most people don't \neven realize that their medicine cabinets can contain drugs just as \npowerful, just as addictive as meth and heroin. Because they are \nprescribed by a doctor, and millions of people use them, kids think \nanti-anxiety drugs such as Xanax and pain killers such as Vicodin and \nOxyContin are harmless. Several examples of abuse occur every day when \nkids come home from school and take a pill to relax. But eventually one \npill is not enough to make them feel better. Soon these kids take more \npills and try different mixtures until they can obtain a sufficient \nhigh, and that is often with deadly results.\n\n  What is so troubling about this is a significant number of teens are \nexperimenting with prescription drugs. According to a 2005 study \nconducted by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, one in five teens \nhas admitted using pain killers to get high, and the organization \nreports it is even getting worse. The 2006 Monitoring the Future Survey \nshows that the abuse of prescription drugs has doubled since 2002. \nAccess to these drugs is widespread. Not only can teens obtain these \ndrugs from home or in school, they can also get them on line and \nthrough ``pharm parties.''\n  Law enforcement officials have increasingly broken up pharm parties \nwhere teens grab prescription drugs from home and pass them around to \nfriends. These drugs are often pooled in large bowls and young people \ntake a pill or two, but they have no idea what pill they are taking. \nThere are hundreds of Internet video clips where teens appear strung \nout on pills and alcohol as a result of pharm parties. We need to do a \nbetter job as parents and legislators to educate and prevent these \nfast-growing trends from reaching epidemic proportions. We have to \neducate the public about the proper ways to dispose of old medicines, \nand we need to help law enforcement deal with the large amount of \nillegal purchases at online pharmacies.\n  Another sad trend is taking hold in Dallas, TX, where earlier this \nsummer a 17-year-old high school student became the 23rd victim of a \ndrug called ``cheese.'' ``Cheese heroin'' is a mixture of black tar \nheroin and Tylenol PM that is usually smoked or snorted and often very \ndeadly. Because it resembles actual cheese and can be purchased for as \nlittle as $2 a hit, more kids in the Dallas area have been trying the \nnew drug with terrible results. Though cheese heroin has only been seen \nin the Dallas area, don't think for a second it is going to stay in the \nDallas area. Cheese heroin is cheap and being marketed solely to \nchildren.\n  Law enforcement officials will be the first to tell you that the new \ndrugs tend to emerge in the larger cities and then move out to the \nsuburbs. We should all be concerned about the drug trend in Dallas, \nbecause the sooner we can stem it, the better we can prevent it from \nspreading across the country.\n  The good news is that the people in the Dallas community are not \ntaking this new drug lightly. We have school\n\n[[Page S10853]]\n\nofficials and police who have been holding assemblies, lectures, PTA \nmeetings, and classroom discussions to get the word out about cheese \nheroin.\n  A public service announcement, made in Dallas by local students, is \ncurrently airing throughout the area, and a hotline number has been \ntaking a large number of calls for those seeking assistance to keep \ntheir loved ones from succumbing to this cheese heroin. Hopefully, \ntheir efforts will stop cheese in its tracks and maybe protect the rest \nof us around the country.\n  The Greater Dallas Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse established a \ntask force that is responsible for this effort. The key to this task \nforce's success is that it incorporates all sectors of the Dallas \ncommunity. Engaging and involving all sectors of our local communities \nis one of the best solutions to keeping our children from abusing \ndrugs. That is why I formed, about 10 years ago, an organization called \nthe Face It Together Coalition--we call it FIT for short--in my effort \nto combat drug abuse in my own State of Iowa. My goal with Face It \nTogether is to bring to the same table parents, educators, businesses, \nreligious leaders, law enforcement officials, health care providers, \nyouth groups, and members of the media to promote new ways of thinking \nabout how to reach and educate Iowans about the dangers of drug abuse. \nWith everyone working together, we will make a difference in our \ncommunities. Moreover, together we can build healthy children, healthy \nfamilies, healthy communities, and a healthy future.\n  In closing, I believe we have a moral obligation to ensure that our \nyoung people have a chance to grow up without being accosted by drug \ndealers at every turn, and particularly when they are in elementary \nschool. We need as a country to create a strong moral context to help \nour kids know how to make the right choices. Research has shown time \nand again that if you can keep a child drug free until the age of 20, \nchances are very slim that they will ever try or become addicted. That \nis the task we face. We owe it to ourselves and the future of our \ncountry to protect our kids from drugs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, consistent with our policy of going back \nand forth across the aisle, I ask unanimous consent following the \nremarks of the Senator from Ohio, that I be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes and that I be followed by the junior Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nleadership on drug abuse issues that he has shown for so long in this \ninstitution. We are all appreciative, in Ohio and Iowa and Oklahoma and \neverywhere else in this country.\n  We have heard a litany of stories in the last year or so about the \nsteady stream of dangerous imports, especially from China. We have seen \ncontaminated seafood, we have seen defective tires from China, we have \nseen dangerous ingredients in toothpaste and vitamins and pet food. In \nthe last 24 hours, we have seen a continued problem with a huge number \nof toys being recalled that were painted with lead-based paint. Lead \npaint has been abandoned for almost three decades in this country. We \nknow that lead in paint is a potentially terrible thing for children in \nterms of the development of their brain, especially for young children.\n  In USA Today this week is an article that sums up what we have \nallowed to happen, and why this is no surprise, as we have built this \ntrade relationship with China. I would like to read a couple of \nparagraphs. We went from barely a $10 billion trade deficit with China \nin 1992, the year I ran for the House of Representatives, which has \ngrown by a factor of almost 25, to $250 billion today. At the same time \nwe were buying so much from China, we understood China is a country \nwith no real rules, no environmental laws that are enforced well, few \nfood safety, toy safety, worker safety rules and regulations. As a \nresult, it should come as no shock to Americans that so many of these \nproducts imported from China are defective or dangerous. Let me read \nthis:\n\n       Nearly all the recent alarms raised about Chinese products \n     point fingers solely at the Chinese, neglecting entirely how \n     China's success as an exporter is, in large part, the product \n     of roughly a trillion dollars of foreign investment and \n     limitless expertise that floods into the country in order to \n     escape some standard or other at home.\n       First, of course, are labor standards. Chinese factory \n     workers earn roughly 65 cents an hour, about \\1/40\\ what \n     their American, Western European and Japanese counterparts \n     do. Export companies--and the long chain of companies that \n     supply them--commonly save money by subjecting [Chinese] \n     workers to cramped dorms, long work weeks and often brutal \n     shop bosses, which would be utterly illegal in the United \n     States workplaces.\n\n  American business knows what it is doing, as it has offshored its \njobs to China and offshored so many American jobs to China, so much of \nits work to China. Unfortunately, so much of what has happened is due \nto trade law and tax law. In essence, we are encouraging our businesses \nto outsource because of the incentives we provided them in the rules \nthat have been written by the global economy, by U.S. trade law, by tax \nlaw. We can continue that or we have a choice. We can do something very \ndifferent. What we offer this week is very different.\n  Congresswoman Schakowsky in the House, with Congresswoman Sutton from \nOhio and several other Members of Congress, Tim Ryan, also from Ohio \nand in the Senate, Senators Durbin and Obama from Illinois, are \noffering legislation to set up what we call Patriot Corporations. Those \nare companies that play by the rules, they hire American workers, do \nmost of their production in the United States, they pay their taxes. As \nI said, they do most of their production in the United States. They \nprovide pensions and they provide health care for their workers. Those \ncompanies that do that should be rewarded. We will designate them \n``Patriot Corporations.'' They will get a lower tax rate and they also \nwill have a better opportunity to get Government contracts.\n  Instead of going the way we have gone; that is, giving all kinds of \nincentives for American corporations to outsource jobs, giving all \nkinds of incentives for those companies to move overseas and avoid \ntaxes--instead of allowing that, we, instead, should offer to American \ncompanies that play by the rules, those companies, again, that provide \ndecent health care, pensions for their workers, do their manufacturing \nand work in the United States--we should reward them with the \ndesignation of ``Patriot Corporation.'' Those companies that are loyal \nto their workers, loyal to their communities and loyal to their Nation \nshould be rewarded. We should be loyal to them.\n  That is the choice we face, continuing this outsourcing tax and trade \npolicy that costs us jobs, and we end up bringing in all kinds of \nunsafe products--whether they are food products at our breakfast table, \nwhether they are toys that can potentially hurt our children. We have \nthat choice; we either continue this policy or we designate \ncorporations that play by the rules as Patriot Corporations.\n  As I said, if they are loyal to their workers and loyal to their \ncommunities and loyal to our Nation, we as a government should be loyal \nto them and treat them accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DeGIUSTI\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this morning we did a great thing in the \nconfirmation of Tim DeGiusti to the Federal court. Understandably, we \nare short of time this morning because of what is happening at the \nWhite House, but let me finalize a couple of ideas and some comments I \nwas going to make.\n  First, when you have someone who has the highest rating, whether it \nis from Martin Dale Hubbell or the American Bar Association, which this \ncandidate did and does, and he also as a military lawyer is familiar \nwith courts-martial procedures--there are a lot of people out there \nwith these qualifications. This individual goes far beyond that. It is \ninteresting that\n\n[[Page S10854]]\n\nwhile he is a Republican, our Democratic Governor in Oklahoma, Gov. \nBrad Henry, is a very strong supporter of this now-confirmed nominee. \nAlso, my predecessor, David Boren, who is now President of the \nUniversity of Oklahoma, was a very strong supporter of this individual. \nI quoted him a few times during this process, as to how outstanding \nthis candidate is.\n  I would like to share an experience I had 41 years ago. A man named \nRalph Thompson, who is currently a senior status Federal judge in \nOklahoma in the same Western District in which his son-in-law has been \nconfirmed this morning, and I, and another person named David Boren, 41 \nyears ago, were elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives. I \nremember it so well because in February of 1967, 40 years ago this \nyear, we all three came to Washington, DC, for the first time. That is, \nState legislators Ralph Thompson, Dave Boren, and of course myself. \nDavid Boren's father was a Congressman so he had a pretty good entree \ninto the Capitol. I remember so well the three of us were walking \naround the Capitol at night--my first time ever being in the Capitol \narea of Washington. I remember, after walking through Statuary Hall and \nall these great features we have in our Capitol, that we kind of \nprofessed to each other, we decided one day--Ralph Thompson and David \nBoren and I--we said we would like to be Members of the Congress, \neither in the House or in the Senate. But Ralph Thompson said: Or a \njudge in the U.S. district court.\n\n  As it turned out, David Boren was a Member of the Senate; I am a \nMember of the Senate; and Ralph Thompson became--I believe he will go \ndown in history as maybe being the outstanding Federal district judge \nin the history of Oklahoma. I have heard so many people talk about \nthat.\n  I knew Ralph so well at that time--keep in mind, this is 40 years \nago--and his beautiful wife Barbara, whom I might add has been Mother \nof the Year and received every possible honor you could have. Lisa, \nMaria and Elaine--they cranked out three little girls, and Elaine was \nthe girl who later married Timothy DeGiusti. Get the connection? You \nhave a great judge and then you have a son-in-law who is going into the \nsame Western District of Oklahoma to replace him. It is an unusual \nsituation. But this is one of these wonderful things that can happen in \nthis country of ours. I am so happy this is behind us now and it \nhappened prior to the August recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10854-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10854-S10855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me mention something else I think is \ncritical. I have heard ugly rumors that the President of the United \nStates might end up vetoing what we call the WRDA bill, the Water \nResources Development Act. Let me say I don't understand. I am coming \nfrom a conservative perspective. I am ranked by the American \nConservative Union, No. 1 out of 100 most conservative Member. Yet I am \nsaying to you there are two things we ought to be spending money on in \nthis country. One is national defense and the other is infrastructure.\n  We have a crisis in our infrastructure. The big bill on \ntransportation infrastructure we passed a year ago is going to do \nnothing more than maintain what we have now, and it is anticipated in \n20 years we will increase our traffic by 50 percent. What are we going \nto do?\n  The same thing is true with the Water Resources Development Act. We \nhave not had a reauthorization in 7 years. It should happen every other \nyear.\n  When you say I don't care if this thing is $10 billion or $20 \nbillion, the amount is not significant because it is not spending \nmoney, it is authorizing. If we authorize something--hopefully, we will \npass this bill today. If we authorize something, it may never be \nappropriated or it may be appropriated 10 years down the road. So it \ndoes not have any remote effect on the budget today.\n  I think it is dishonest for people to say this is somehow a spending \nbill and therefore we should vote against it. That is not true at all. \nI have the history of this body right here in my hand, and I have given \nseveral presentations on this recently. I say to my friend from \nMontana, who is new in this Chamber, this discussion has been going on \nbetween appropriators and authorizers since 1816.\n  In 1867, they realized they needed to segregate the functions of \nauthorization and appropriations so they established the appropriators, \nthe Appropriations Committee. That was a good thing. But what happened \non that, which has been the case for a long time, the appropriators \nslowly took over a little bit at a time so they ended up authorizing \ntheir own appropriations. That is what we don't want.\n  Let me give an example. In the Senate Armed Services Committee, on \nwhich I am honored to sit, we go through all types of items, such as \nmissile defense, as an example. We will have the boost phase and the \nmidcourse phase and the terminal phase and we will have maybe two \nsystems on each one. They are not redundant, but there are many people \nwho say: Wait a minute. Maybe we should do away with that system \nbecause we can save this much money.\n  But take the midcourse. We had the Aegis System and then we had the \nTHAAD system in the terminal phase. These are not redundant because \nthey take care of an incoming missile from different areas with \ndifferent technologies. You would not know that if you are just an \nappropriator because you don't have the staff to go in and study and \nget into the details. But we authorize, in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, because we do have that expertise.\n  I say the same thing is true in my other committee that I used to \nchair. It was the Environment and Public Works Committee. As it applies \nto this particular bill, the WRDA bill--we have a set of criteria and \nevaluated equally all these projects. There will be many projects that \nhave been authorized that I will come on the floor and oppose \nvigorously when appropriations time comes. But at least we will know \nthey have gone through a process and they meet certain criteria. That \nis what is important. If you take that away, that is the first line of \ndefense, doing away with superfluous types of earmarking.\n  This is the only part of that system that offers discipline in the \nwhole appropriations process. That is what this is all about. That is \nwhy the WRDA bill is so significant. Yet people who are liberal, \nconservatives, Democrats, Republicans who come together and realize we \nhave an infrastructure in this country that has been sadly neglected, \nand we are going to have to do something about it, our opportunity will \nbe today and I hope we can do the responsible thing and pass it.\n  Then, during the August recess, you are going to hear this person, \nwho is rated the most conservative Member of this body, out talking all \nover the Nation why this is the conservative approach to logically \nauthorize these projects and then determine which ones are worthwhile.\n  At least we know these have met a certain criteria.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am so pleased that my ranking member, Senator Inhofe, \nthe distinguished ranking member--and was the distinguished chair of \nthe EPW Committee--has taken to the floor to state the case.\n  You know, we fight so much, debate so much about so many issues, but \nthis is one, I would say to my friend, where we have come together \nbecause we recognize that to have a great country, you have to have \ninfrastructure that is capable, that is going to meet the needs of our \npeople.\n  I would say to my friend, is it not true that even though you and I \nmight not agree with every single project--as my friend pointed out, \nthis is the authorizing bill, and we did have criteria here. We did \nwork with Members. I would say to my friend, isn't it true that we were \nthe first committee that actually followed the ethics rules that were \nnot even law? We filled out our conflict of interest forms, we \npresented the bill, and this bill was 7 years in the making.\n  I just want to say to my friend, when he goes home and when he speaks \nabout this, does he expect to have a good, receptive audience? I think \nmy friend will. As I go to California, I am going to do the same thing.\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\n  Many people will call us the odd couple because we do not agree on \neverything. But on this one, is it not true that we see eye to eye?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is. Reclaiming my time, I think you are being very \ngenerous when you say we don't always agree on every issue. In fact, \nthere are no two people who probably disagree more. That tells you \nsomething. That tells you we have to do this. This is something this \ncountry cannot do without.\n  Let me give you an example. I spent several years as the mayor of a \nmajor city, Tulsa, OK. The greatest problem we had was not crime in the \nstreets, it was not prostitution, it was unfunded mandates. Now, what \nwe do in this is go back to some of these small communities and say: We \nhave mandated that in your drinking water system, your wastewater \nsystem, you do these things. And we should be responsible for helping \nyou to comply with these mandates. It is very important.\n  There is a group called Citizens Against Government Waste. I have \nright here--and I am going to submit this as part of the Record. For 16 \nyears prior to right now, they have identified 76,000 projects they \nthought were--that fall into this category of being earmarks.\n  Do you know the interesting thing about this, I ask my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer. It is interesting that all of these \nprojects, with very few exceptions, were not authorized.\n  Now, if you look at what the Congressional Research Service comes up \nwith, around 115,000, those include the ones that were authorized. So \nthat tells you where the problem is. The problem is not in projects \nthat were authorized, it is in projects that are not authorized. That \nis why we are doing the responsible thing today. I am hoping there is \nno one on either side who will hold up this bill because we have to \nkeep moving with it before the recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Before I get into my remarks, I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma and the Senator from California for the leadership they have \nshown on the WRDA bill.\n  I couldn't agree more; infrastructure is critically important to this \ncountry. Infrastructure that revolves around our water resources may be \nthe most important infrastructure we have. And to invest in that is \ntruly a good investment that benefits our kids and grandkids and \ngenerations thereafter.\n  So thank you both for your work on this bill and, hopefully, it can \nbe passed with a good, healthy vote coming out of this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10855-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10855-S10856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to share some news from my home \nState. I am anxiously following the wildfires burning across Montana. \nOver the last few weeks, tens of thousands of acres of the Treasure \nState have burned. In fact, the top four fires in the West are burning \nin Montana. Hundreds of folks have been evacuated from their homes. \nInterestingly enough, today, August 3rd, is traditionally only the \nthird day of the wildfire season. Times are changing.\n  This past weekend I had the opportunity to visit the front lines of \ntwo Montana wildfires, which tell two different fire policy stories. \nOne thing they have clearly got in common: fine, hardworking men and \nwomen toughing it out in grueling conditions to protect each other and \nthe public from harm's way. In my State, we are also relying on the \nhardworking folks in the Montana National Guard. As of today, about 130 \nguardsmen and women have been called to help fight Montana's fires. \nSome of these folks cancelled summer plans to answer the call to help. \nThey are working alongside other firefighters to do dangerous, hot, \ndirty work to protect Montana's people and property.\n  To all wildland firefighters across this country, I say thank you. We \nowe them all respect and gratitude. We also owe them policies that will \nbest benefit the landscape they are working so hard to protect.\n  The two fires I visited both started the same week, in late June. \nThat is really early for Montana. Both are burning in the Bob Marshall \nWilderness, a spectacular place where the Rocky Mountains spill onto \nthe plains. The Ahorn fire was 15,000 acres when I visited. It is now \nover 40,000 acres, burning 30 miles west of the ranching and farming \ncommunity of Augusta.\n  The Forest Service is concerned because the Ahorn fire is big and \nunwieldy. It is burning near a ``fire exclusion'' area, an area that \nthe Forest Service has not allowed fire to burn over the years in order \nto protect seasonal cabins on private land east near the forest \nboundary. As a result of the fuels that built up over the years due to \nsuppressing fire, the Ahorn fire is going to do pretty much what the \nfire wants to do. The Forest Service threw $1 million at it when it \nfirst took off, and that ``didn't make a dent,'' according to the fire \nofficials. The agency says it will not be successful in controlling the \nperimeter of the fire, though it probably will be successful at \nprotecting those cabins.\n  This has nothing to do with the agency's abilities. It has everything \nto do with fires that burn hotter and harder now because of a hotter \nclimate and denser forests. To date, the Ahorn fire has cost nearly $5 \nmillion.\n  Last Saturday, I also got a chance to see the Fool Creek fire. That \nfire was 6,200 acres when I saw it. Today it is about 22,000 acres. The \nFool Creek fire is burning west of Choteau, another ranching and \nfarming community. The Forest Service has been managing the Fool Creek \nfire as a ``Wildland Fire Use For Resource Benefit,'' which means fire \nbosses have been mostly allowing it to burn for the benefit of the \nforest. So far, it has been a lot more manageable because it is moving \nin and around lands that burned in 1988 and in 2000. It is still hot \nand dry out there and the fire made a big run yesterday, but all told, \nthe fire has been easier to manage than Ahorn. To date, the Fool Creek \nfire has cost $1.3 million. That is four times less than the cost of \nfighting the Ahorn fire, with similar outcomes.\n  It is not very popular to tell the American people that the Forest \nService is letting the woods burn. But what we have learned in the last \n20 years is: sometimes, it is the right thing to do.\n  We have another problem in my home State, and that's the holdover \nfrom longstanding fights on how to manage our forests. We will never \nget back to the timber harvest levels of the 1970s, nor should we. But \nthe pendulum has swung too far, and now we are too often fighting in \nthe courts about cutting down trees. Quite frankly, we don't have \nenough people working out in the woods. That is a problem economically \nand ecologically. Throw in climate change, thousands of acres of dead, \ndry beetle-infested trees, and lots of new houses popping up on the \nedges of our national forests, and we have a perfect storm brewing.\n  I don't think it is a coincidence that, with all the fuel buildup in \nour forests and the hottest summer on record, we're in the middle of a \nwhopper of a fire season. Climatologists tell me that this is becoming \nthe new norm. This is what we can continue to expect. Which means we \nhave to get even smarter about when to fight wildfire, and where, and \nhow best to stretch every dollar spent on battling them. And we have to \nget serious about supporting the Forest Service as it reduces fuels in \nthe forests.\n  With the Forest Service spending 45 percent of its budget on fire \nsuppression, it barely has the time or the resources to restore our \nforests to health. With firefighting costs predicted to go even higher, \ncreating a trust fund for fire management makes a great deal of sense \nto me. It is something we have to do in order to ensure that funds will \nbe available to do the work of restoring health to our forests. Because \nwhen we restore our forests, we will make them more resilient to fire. \nThis is something we have to do, and we have to do it fast, especially \naround our Western towns and communities.\n  This issue won't go away when fire season comes to an end. The \nconversation will continue with my colleagues here in Washington and \nwith all folks in. Montana. We'll be talking about fire and forest \nhealth and the opportunities they provide us. They are connected, and \nthey are connected to Montana's well-being and economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while the Senator from Montana is still on \nthe Senate floor, let me, first of all, thank\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\nhim for his comments, to which I subscribe. We have a problem \nthroughout the Western United States with forest fires, not easily \nunderstood by those who don't experience the kind of hot, dry \nconditions we do in the summer with our forests.\n  People don't think there are forests in my State of Arizona. There \nare. In fact, about 5 years ago, we had a fire which burned an area--\nand this is big Ponderosa Pine country--burned an area almost the size \nof the State of Rhode Island.\n  Now, in Arizona and Montana, you can do that. But just think about \nthat if it were in your State. One of the problems is, we have found \nthat the Healthy Forest Act that we passed about 3 years ago, which was \ndesigned to limit litigation, has not done as good a job as we had \nhoped.\n  I think we need to revisit that in addition to providing more \nfunding. I will conclude this point by saying that one of the best \nsummers of my life was spent in the State of Montana in Glacier \nNational Park helping to put out forest fires in that beautiful place.\n  I hope all of us can join together in an appropriate way to advance \nthe cause about which the Senator from Montana was speaking.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I think communication \nand trust is critical if we are going to address the issues in our \nforests today. I think if we can develop good communication with all \nparties involved, we will help move our forests to a healthier level.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10856-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10856-S10857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly to the issue, which, \nfrankly, is keeping us in session right now, and explain a little bit \nabout what is happening. Everyone in this body understands and agrees \nthat we have an emergency on our hands that deals with our intelligence \ncollection, and we need to address that emergency legislatively.\n  But there is a disagreement on exactly how to do that. We must \nresolve that disagreement before we leave here. We will be taking a \nmonth back in our home States visiting with constituents. When we come \nback we will be right on the anniversary of 9/11. There are ways that \nwe can prevent another 9/11 by good intelligence collection as to \nwarnings that might tell us what we need to do to prevent such an \nattack, but we cannot do that the way the law is currently written.\n  Obviously, this debate cannot get into a great deal of detail. But, \nsuffice it to say, when the law relating to intelligence collection was \nwritten, it was written with a different kind of technology in mind. \nTechnology has evolved over the years. In fact, it has evolved quite \nrapidly, and it is a simple fact that today's law does not match \ntoday's technology. It does not permit the kind of intelligence \ncollection that we can and should be doing.\n  Without, again, getting into details as to how much collection is \nbeing lost, it is fair to say that a significant amount, a significant \npercentage of intelligence that we could be collecting, we are not \ncollecting, simply because of what is, in effect, an old-fashioned law, \na law that can be changed, should be changed.\n  The kind of collection we are talking about is precisely the kind of \ninformation we need that can give us warning of an impending attack. I \nthink it is also fair to say, without getting into detail, that at this \ntime we are seeing increasing evidence of efforts on the part of our \nenemies--I am speaking specifically of groups such as al-Qaida--to find \na way to attack the American homeland.\n  Given this increased effort on their part--and I would also suggest \ncapability on their part--given that we know what they intend to do, \nand given that we know there is a great deal of intelligence out there \nwe are not collecting simply because of an outmoded law, it is \nincumbent upon us to act and to act now.\n  We cannot leave to go back to our home States for a month without \nresolving this issue because of the nature of the threat and the fact \nthat an entire month will have elapsed not being able to collect \ninformation that we deem vital to be able to give us the kind of \nwarning that we need.\n  Now, there have been negotiations going on, not only in the \nIntelligence Committee but with leadership and, primarily Admiral \nMcConnell, who is the Director of National Intelligence, who has \nbrought this matter to our attention. But those negotiations have not \nresulted in an agreement we can pass in the House and the Senate before \nwe leave. Time is running out. We will wait as long as it takes to \nresolve this problem. Anything less would be a dereliction of our duty.\n  I will just conclude by saying this: Prior to 9/11, Senator Feinstein \nand I, as the chairman and ranking member of the Terrorism Subcommittee \nof the Judiciary Committee, predicted there would be a massive kind of \nattack on the United States by terrorists if we did not make \nsubstantial changes in the law, on which we had held hearings. We had \nput legislation in the hopper, and I urged our colleagues to take \naction on the legislation. They did not do so.\n  Two days after 9/11, we stood on the floor of the Senate and finally \ngot agreement on some of these elements of legislation, some of which \nbecame part of the PATRIOT Act, some of which were part of the Tools to \nFight Terrorism Act.\n  Let's do not let that happen again. The warnings are there. We have \nto be prepared to deal with them. We cannot leave without changing the \nlaw to fit the technology that currently exists, and we will not permit \nthis situation to erode to the point where we have to accept something \nthat is not adequate or we have delay in getting the job done before we \nleave.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield for \na question?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Isn't it the view of the Senator from Arizona--given \nthe wide respect across this body and in the House as well that Admiral \nMcConnell enjoys--that we should accept his judgment as to what is \nneeded to solve this problem? Is he not, in the view of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the expert on this subject? And is it not clear to \neveryone that his primary motivation is not to get into a political \nfight but to protect the homeland from another attack?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as usual, the minority leader has made an \nextraordinarily important point.\n  Admiral McConnell enjoys the confidence, I am sure, of every one of \nthe Members of this body. When he briefed all of us about the problem, \nI did not see a dissenting voice in the classified briefing about the \nfact that we had to quickly do something to solve this problem.\n  I think everyone recognizes that he not only has the expertise but \nthe motivation--only one motivation--to protect the American people. I \ndo not think there is a political bone in his body. As a result, for \nanybody here in the Congress to play politics with the issue, to not \naccept the judgment of a man who is so widely respected and so properly \nmotivated in this regard, would not only be a dereliction of duty but \nwould, frankly, set up a potential threat to the United States from \nwhich we might not recover.\n  What I might do is just close my remarks and turn the floor over to \nthe minority leader. I also know the Senator from New Mexico wants to \nmake some comments. But perhaps he would allow the leader to make some \ncomments.\n  I just want to make this point. Winston Churchill said after World \nWar II that no war could have been more easily prevented. We all \nunderstand what he was talking about. The threat was there. The people \nwho were going to cause the problem--Adolf Hitler, Nazi Germany--were \nclear in their intentions, but people did not act on the knowledge they \nhad.\n  Mr. President, I submit the same thing is true here. If there is, God \nforbid, an attack on our homeland, I cannot imagine something that \ncould have been more easily prevented by the kind of change we can make \nin this body today to ensure that the law that governs this \nintelligence collection keeps up with the technology.\n  It is up to us to take the good judgment of people such as Admiral \nMcConnell, as the minority leader has said, and move on with this and \nnot allow a\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\nsituation to develop where we would leave for the month of August not \nhaving solved this important problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the solution to this problem is at the \ndesk. The senior Senator from Missouri, the vice chair of the \nIntelligence Committee, and I placed a bill on the calendar earlier \nthis week that Admiral McConnell has certified would give him and our \nintelligence community the ability to protect the homeland.\n  As Senator Bond and I pointed out earlier this week, this measure \nwhich is at the desk, which could be taken up and passed by the Senate \nat any time, would give the intelligence community what it needs before \nwe go off for a month, leaving America without this additional \nprotection. This would be a solution to the problem.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has pleaded with us in person \nabout this issue which involves--as we all now know full well, whether \nwe are on the Intelligence Committee or not--a glitch in the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, commonly referred to around here \nas FISA, that is causing our intelligence community to miss \nsignificant, actionable intelligence.\n  Now, the principle behind the FISA law is the same today as it was 30 \nyears ago. It is the principle that foreign terrorists are a \nlegitimate--I repeat, legitimate--target for electronic surveillance. \nBut because of changes in the way terrorists communicate, U.S. \nintelligence personnel are no longer able to act on this commonsense \nprinciple with the speed and the flexibility the law was originally \nmeant to give them.\n  In a significant number of cases, our intelligence professionals are \nnow in the position of having to obtain court orders to collect foreign \nintelligence concerning foreign targets overseas in another country. \nThis is absolutely absurd and completely unacceptable. We have never \nbelieved the targeting of a foreign terrorist overseas should require a \nFISA warrant. Let me say that again. We are talking about terrorists \noverseas. Yet that is the outrageous situation we find ourselves in \ntoday. It would be even more outrageous not to correct this glaring \nproblem immediately before we leave town. And we will. We will be here \nas long as it takes to get this right.\n\n  Congress created FISA in 1978 because it believed the terrorist \nthreat was real. That belief has been tragically confirmed since the \nlaw was created. Intelligence officials remind us repeatedly that the \nthreat remains real. An unclassified version of the recent National \nIntelligence Estimate tells us that al-Qaida is reconstituting itself \nand that its lethal intent is just as strong today as it was on the \nmorning of September 11, 2001.\n  The legislation could not be more urgent. While the administration \nsubmitted FISA modernization language months ago--this has been \nlanguishing for months--the only legislation before us is S. 1927, the \nMcConnell-Bond bill, a bill specifically requested by the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  We know this bill provides our intelligence community with the \nnecessary tools to protect our homeland. We know if we pass this \nmeasure, the President will sign it into law. We know we have a duty to \npass it today to protect the American people. So why wait? Why wait? \nThis job must be done, and done now.\n  The recent National Intelligence Estimate on terrorism contained a \nfinding that cooperation on the part of our allies may wane as 9/11 \nbecomes a more distant memory and perceptions of the threat tend to \nrecede. Has that memory faded so greatly in our own minds that we would \nleave for an August recess without taking the reasonable step of \nrevising this law? I certainly hope not. It would be completely \nunacceptable. The intelligence community assures us that al-Qaida is \nnot taking an August break.\n  The principle behind our electronic surveillance has not changed \nsince 1978. But the terrorist threat has. As we have tried to adapt to \nthis asymmetrical threat, the terrorists have adapted too--by using \nincreasingly modern and increasingly lethal tools and technologies \nagainst us. They have used planes and, if they get their wish, they \nwill use chemical and even nuclear weapons. They have killed our \ncitizens and our soldiers by the thousands. And they have shown their \nintent to continue to kill on an even larger scale.\n  We must not let these enemies of America exploit a weakness that we \ncan identify. We understand this weakness exists, and we need to fix \nit. Didn't we learn this lesson after 9/11? Some have blamed our \nfailure to prevent those attacks on a failure of imagination. Some have \nsaid it was because we did not connect the dots. Well, we will never be \nable to connect the dots if we cannot collect them. Failure to pass \nthis legislation would suggest an indifference on the part of Congress \nabout our ability to connect those very dots.\n  Mr. President, I hope everybody understands the threat is real; the \nthreat is urgent. We must not, we will not, leave for recess until we \npass this urgent and necessary law.\n  Senator Bond and I and others will have more to say about this issue \nduring the course of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10857-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10857-S10858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a very few minutes to \ncomment on the action of the Senate last night in passing and sending \nto the President the America COMPETES Act.\n  With the passage of the conference report, I hope we will begin a \nlong-term commitment by the Congress and by the executive branch to \nensure our Nation continues to lead the world in innovation and \neconomic competitiveness.\n  I will put in the record a full statement of the history that has led \nus to this point of hard work that has gone on by many in the Senate, \nin the House of Representatives, as well as in the private sector.\n  Yesterday, the House voted 357 to 57 to pass the conference report \nand in doing so affirmed that on large issues such as these we can work \nin a bipartisan way for the benefit of our Nation. Then, later last \nnight, the Senate passed the conference report by unanimous consent.\n  This bill has been more than 2 years in the making. One primary \nimpetus was in May of 2005, when Senator Alexander and I asked the \nNational Academies of Science to report on steps the Congress could \ntake to keep the United States competitive in a rapidly changing global \nenvironment. That report, entitled, ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm,'' was spearheaded by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed \nMartin. It was released in October of 2005 and received significant \nattention in the U.S. media. The report clearly tapped into an \nincreasing concern among many Americans about the challenges we face in \ncompeting against the rising national economies of countries such as \nIndia and China.\n  In January of 2006, Senator Domenici, Senator Alexander, and I, along \nwith 67 other cosponsors, introduced the Protecting America's \nCompetitiveness Edge Act, or PACE Act. This bill reflected the \nrecommendations of the Augustine commission and covered a wide array of \ntopics related to competitiveness, including increasing funding for \nresearch and education and other provisions designed to encourage a \nclimate of entrepreneurship and innovation.\n  On a separate track, in December 2004, the Council on Competitiveness \nreleased their report entitled, ``Innovate America.'' Based upon that \nreport, Senators Ensign and Lieberman introduced S. 2802, entitled the \nAmerican Innovation Act of 2006.\n  That summer, Senator Frist asked the authors of both bills and other \ninterested Members, including the chairman of HELP, Senator Enzi and \nRanking Member Kennedy, to draft a comprehensive Senate bill which was \nintroduced in the Senate as S. 3936, the National Competitiveness and \nInnovation Act. S. 3936 was introduced in the final days of the 109th \nCongress as a Fist-Reid bill.\n  Continuing this bipartisan effort in the 110th Congress, Senators \nAlexander, Domenici, and I introduced S. 761, the America COMPETES Act, \nwhich was taken up by the Senate and passed 88 to 8 in April of this \nyear, with Senators Reid and McConnell as the lead sponsors.\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\n  Meanwhile, similar efforts were going on in the House with the House \nScience Committee. The conference report that is on its way to the \nPresident is a result of bipartisan, bicameral compromise and \ncooperation.\n  Reconciling the House and Senate bills started before Memorial Day \nand involved the Senate Committees on Commerce, HELP, and Energy. In \nthe House, it involved the Committees on Science and Education and \nLabor. All in all, it took the efforts of over 70 staff to complete \nthis legislation. I want to thank the members of these committees for \ntheir bipartisan effort and long-term vision on keeping our Nation \ncompetitive.\n  I want to thank in particular the staff of these committees, all of \nwhom put in long, hard hours, in many cases juggling the demands of \nother bills that their committee had on the floor. In the Senate, once \nthings got underway 2 years ago, the process by which we operated was \ncompletely transparent--there was never a meeting held that did not \ninclude staff from both sides of the aisle. There was a remarkable lack \nof acrimony, and a striking absence of partisanship. I could not be \nmore proud of this process and the staff that undertook it, and I think \nthe conference report we passed last night reflects that process. It \nshould serve as a model for the way this body should operate.\n  Mr. President, let me quote from the ``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm''--\n\n       Without a renewed effort to bolster the foundations of \n     competitiveness, we can expect to lose our privileged \n     position. For the first time in generations, the nation's \n     children could face poorer prospects than their parents and \n     grandparents did. We owe the current prosperity, security, \n     and good health to investments of the past generations, and \n     we are obliged to renew those commitments in education, \n     research, and innovation policies to ensure that the American \n     people continue to benefit from the remarkable opportunities \n     provided by the rapid development of the global economy and \n     its not inconsiderable underpinning in science and \n     technology.\n\n  This legislation represents that much-needed renewed commitment to \nbolstering our national competitiveness\n  Much of the good work that was contained in the legislation was a \nresult of the report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which was \nissued by the Academies of Science at the urging of several of us in \nthe Senate. This report set out specific actions that needed to be \ntaken by this country in order to keep our economy competitive in the \nworld. Clearly, most of those recommendations have been adopted, and \nnow they have been legislated into law as part of this America COMPETES \nAct.\n  I thank my colleagues--Senator Alexander, of course, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Ensign, Senator Lieberman, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nEnzi, Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens. A great many people in the \nSenate had a major part in this legislation. I thank them.\n  I also want to particularly thank the staff. The hard work that went \ninto this legislation was truly extraordinary. There were numerous \nstaff from both sides of the aisle who worked very hard to make this \neffort a success.\n  From the Commerce Committee: Beth Bacon, Jeff Bingham, Jean Toal-\nEisen, Christine Kurth, Chan Lieu, Jason Mulvihill, Floyd Deschamps, \nand H.J. Derr; from the HELP Committee: Beth Buehlman, David Cleary, \nAnne Clough, David Gruenbaum, Lindsay Hunsicker, David Johns, Carmel \nMartin, Roberto Rodriguez, Missy Rohrbach, Ilyse Schuman, and Emma \nVadehra; from my personal staff: Michael Yudin, who does the work in \nour office on education issues, was an essential part of the effort \nfrom the very beginning and made enormous contributions to the \neducation sections of the report; Melanie Roberts, an AAAS policy \nfellow in my office, did as well, worked hard; from the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee: Bob Simon, our staff director; Mia \nBennett; Kathryn Clay; Sam Fowler; Amanda Kelly; Judy Pensabene, who is \nthe committee counsel for Senator Domenici; and Matt Zedler; on Senator \nAlexander's staff: Matt Sonnesyn and Jack Wells are the two with whom I \nam most familiar who have worked so hard; from Senator Lieberman's \nstaff: Craig Robinson, Colleen Shogan, and Rachel Sotsky.\n  I also want to acknowledge the great work done by our leadership \nstaff: Jason Unger and Mark Wetjen on Senator Reid's staff, and by \nLibby Jarvis on Senator McConnell's staff. Let me express my special \nthanks to the Senate Legislative Counsel's Office for their tireless \nwork in getting this legislation ready so it could be completed before \nthe August recess: Liz King coordinated the conference efforts with the \nutmost patience; John Baggaley, Gary Endicott, Gary Koster, Amy Gaynor, \nand Kristin Romero.\n\n  Finally, let me mention John Epstein in my own office and who works \non the Energy Committee staff. I am convinced that if it were not for \nJohn's tireless efforts to move this legislation forward and his \nunfailing commitment to a collegial, bipartisan process, the bill would \nnot have been able to be passed in this timeframe. I am extremely \ngrateful to him for his persistence and integrity throughout the \nprocess. Also, let me particularly thank Trudy Vincent, my legislative \ndirector, for the great work she did on this legislation from its \ninception to its completion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I hope I have the attention of all of my colleagues because I believe \nwe have an opportunity--we have an absolute necessity--to pass the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act modifications prior to leaving \nfor the August recess. It is absolutely critical for our national \nsecurity that we change the law which currently, by its application, is \ndenying our intelligence community a very significant portion of the \nsignals intelligence they could collect on al-Qaida and other terrorist \nsources who may well be planning another 9/11 attack on the United \nStates.\n  It has been publicly disclosed that al-Qaida's discussions are more \nactive now than they had been since 2001 and even more since 2001, but \nwe are, because of the application of this law, partially deaf to those \ncommunications. If we are to protect our homeland, the people of \nAmerica, as well as our troops in the field, we have to collect better \nintelligence because that is our only significant weapon to fend off \nthe attacks of those, through their misguided ideas, who want to \ninspire terror and kill as many Americans as possible.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, whom I believe \nthe people in this body have come to know and respect, told us in April \nthat it was urgent that we reform the FISA law. He sent us a proposal \non April 27. He appeared before our committee in open hearings on May 1 \nand discussed at length the challenges and the threat we face and the \nneed for revision of the FISA law. I had hoped we would move on that at \nthe time, but some wanted to get more Department of Justice opinions. \nNothing happened. I offered my version. My version, on behalf of \nRepublican members, drew no response.\n  The DNI, Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, came \nbefore a session of the entire Senate in S-407, our classified security \narea, a month ago, and he told us about the need to reform the law and \nto reform the law now. A significant number--not a majority--of this \nbody was there, but everybody who heard him speak recognized the \nabsolute, compelling necessity to move. Since time was running out, he \noffered a slimmed-down proposal.\n  There are a number of things which need to be done with respect to \nFISA that can wait, and to accommodate the concerns of some on the \nother side of the aisle, he agreed to hold off dealing with issues such \nas carrier liability and streamlining FISA. But he presented to us a \nmeasure that he said was critically important, that must be passed so \nwe don't remain deaf during August to discussions of threats being \ncarried on by al-Qaida and others seeking to do us harm.\n  As a result of the submission he made, we had another hearing for all \nMembers of the Senate on Tuesday night, and at that Tuesday night \nsession, several Democratic chairmen raised concerns with him about his \nproposal and their desire to have a different form. I was not privy to \ntheir\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\nnegotiations, but through the good efforts of Director McConnell, I \nfound out what they were proposing, and it was obvious to me, as it was \nclear to Director McConnell, that this would not allow him to do what \nhe needed to do and would not allow NSA to move forward on collection \nof vital information needed for his job to keep America safe.\n  The next day, the admiral modified his original proposal to take into \naccount some of the reasonable concerns the Democrats raised, things he \nthought he could live with. Leader McConnell and I introduced that on \nWednesday evening. Since that time, there have been several more \niterations coming from Democratic staff and some Democratic chairmen \nthat have been presented to Director McConnell. He has reviewed them, \nand they do not meet the needs. He has responded to them, to try to \nfind ways to accommodate them, and he has not been able to accommodate \nthem.\n  The admiral now is traveling and out of contact. He said that given \nthe lateness of the hour and the fact that this is such a critical \nissue, the negotiations are over, and he said he would make one more \naccommodation to meet concerns of the majority party. So he has agreed \nthat he would support and urge the President to sign the McConnell-Bond \nmeasure introduced on Wednesday night, with one accommodation; that is, \nto add a 6-month sunset to provisions of the law allowing the \noperations to continue under the orders put forward at that time.\n  It will be my intent, after discussions with the leaders, to attempt \nto call this measure up so we can go to work on it and get it done, to \nkeep our country safe and to allow us to come back after the recess and \nwork on other portions of the FISA law that may be necessary and I \nthink are very necessary. But right now, to keep the country safe, we \nneed to pass this measure.\n  The Director of National Intelligence said----\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I wish to ask the Senator about really the guts of \nwhat we are talking about because I want to make sure the American \npeople thoroughly understand this. The FISA law is the law that deals \nwith the collection of intelligence by our intelligence gatherers \nthrough the airways and through any other means we can seek to gather \nthat information, whether it is e-mails, telephone calls, or whatever.\n\n  Is it correct that right now our intelligence community is telling us \nthey are not just handicapped but they are hamstrung and they do not \nhave the ability because of the delay of this body and of the House of \nRepresentatives in passing this legislation which would give them the \ntools with which to go out into the bad guys' territory and collect \ninformation on those bad guys about what they are saying relative to \npotential attacks against Americans?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia--and a valuable \nmember of the Intelligence Committee--is precisely right. What we have \nbefore us is what is absolutely necessary to keep our country safe. He \nasked for the basic provisions.\n  Basically, what Senator McConnell has proposed--which is not a \nRepublican proposal, it is not a Democratic proposal, it is the \nproposal of Admiral McConnell as the Director of National \nIntelligence--is that the Government, the intelligence community, can \nlisten in on communications from foreign sources, foreign intelligence, \nof somebody located overseas. If they find a suspect in the United \nStates--and we call that a U.S. person--then any collection has to go \nbefore the FISA Court, which was established in 1978, before any \ncollection can start against that target. It allows the Attorney \nGeneral, with the Director of National Intelligence, to authorize that \ncollection.\n  Now, the DNI's proposal has made a number of accommodations to the \npoints raised by our Democratic chairmen at that Tuesday night meeting. \nIt includes having the FISA Court review the procedures to ensure that \nthe targets of our collection without a warrant are overseas. I don't \nthink court review is necessary, but it is an added layer of protection \nthat several key Democratic chairmen wanted.\n  I have been to NSA. I have seen how the procedures are so carefully \nmonitored, with layers of oversight, supervision, reviews of attorneys, \nreviews of the inspector general, to make sure that the only \nintelligence they are collecting without a warrant is where the target \nis a person reasonably believed to be outside the United States.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, is it not true that prior to September \n11, certain of the September 11 hijackers were inside the United States \nand communicating outside the United States to the leaders of al-Qaida, \nwho were giving them instructions, who were sending them money, and who \nwere providing them the details of the circumstances leading up to the \nevents of September 11? We did not have the capability at that time of \nintercepting those conversations because we did not have this \nparticular program in place. Therefore, is it not true that we missed \nsome of the intercepts of correspondence between the September 11 \nhijackers and their leadership overseas?\n  Is it not true that following September 11, the very essence of the \nprogram we are talking about now that the DNI says he needs, it was in \nplace following September 11, but because of circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, it is now not in place? Isn't it true that what he is asking \nfor is the ability to gather information from any prospective terrorist \nwho we know may have the ability and the intent to attack Americans, \neither on foreign soil or on domestic soil, and that what is sought to \nbe done here is not to intercept conversations between Americans, not \nto intercept conversations even between terrorists who are in America, \nbut what the DNI needs is the ability to intercept conversations coming \nout of areas such as Pakistan and Waziristan?\n  Potential terrorists or actual terrorists who reside in the United \nStates, much like happened prior to September 11--and we are about to \nget out of here for a month--we know this is a time when the Director \nand the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security have said it \nis a high threat month. Would the Senator not agree that it is \nimperative that we give the intelligence community the ability to \nlisten to those terrorists' conversations, which may include--and I \nemphasize ``may'' because this is a moving target--may include \nlistening in on the planning of potential activity inside the United \nStates?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes \nto answer the questions that have been raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Georgia for a \nvery fine statement.\n  I don't remember all of the questions, but I do remember his last \nquestion, which was, is it imperative for national security that we \nadopt this now. The Senator is correct. We were unable to accept \ncommunications prior to September 11, 2001. After that tragedy \noccurred, the President instituted a program, which he revealed several \nyears later, to intercept foreign calls from al-Qaida coming into the \nUnited States and, because of concerns and questions raised in \noversight, the President put the program to intercept foreign \nintelligence under the FISA Court. Now, at this point, because of the \nchange in technology since the time FISA was adopted in 1978, \ninadvertently the new technology being used comes under FISA and \nprevents, in many instances, the collection of information on a foreign \ntarget.\n  The foreign targets are the ones, as the Senator from Georgia so \ncorrectly pointed out, who were giving information, and still give \ninformation and direction and strategic operations, to terrorists who \nmay well be in the United States. Yes, it is vitally important that we \nchange this now. I hope my colleagues will review this and that we can \nget a large, bipartisan majority. This is not a Republican proposal. I \ntried my Republican proposal and didn't get a majority to support that. \nThere are Democratic proposals and, to the extent they can be \naccommodated by the DNI and allow him to take the collections he needs \nagainst foreign\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\ntargets, without a warrant--unless we can change the law, he will be \ndeaf and we will be endangered in August and thereafter.\n  Regarding the question my colleague from Georgia raised about \nterrorists communicating in the United States, if there is collection, \nif we have intelligence that there are terrorists communicating in the \nUnited States--they would be non-U.S. persons--we would still have to \ngo to the FISA Court to get an order before anybody can collect on \nthem. If a U.S. person receives a call, the U.S. person's participation \nis what they call minimized and it is put aside. That person does not \nbecome a target if he or she is a U.S. person, unless and until there \nis a FISA Court order included.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Will the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. First, I thank the Senator for his great leadership. \nThe Senator said we have worked on this in a bipartisan way in the \nIntelligence Committee since April. The Senator and Senator McConnell \nhave proposed a fix to this particular issue that now is before the \nSenate. Is it not true that everybody on this side of the aisle is \nprepared to vote for that, vote their conscience on it, whatever it may \nbe, and that we expect a number of Senators from the other side will \nalso be supportive of that? Are we ready to vote on this, to give the \nDNI the authority he has asked for?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. I have a very important message from the DNI:\n\n       We understand that the FISA court judges urgently support a \n     more appropriate alignment of the court's caseload and \n     jurisdiction away from the focus on non-U.S. persons \n     operating outside of the United States. The judges have \n     clearly expressed both frustration with the fact that so much \n     of their docket is consumed by applications that focus on \n     foreign targets and involve minimal privacy interests of \n     Americans.\n\n  That is the end of the statement that has been communicated to us by \nelectronics from the DNI--that FISA Court judges have asked today that \nwe pass a law that gets them out of the business of overseeing foreign \ntarget collection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the Senator from North Dakota be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object. May I ask the Senator from \nMissouri, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, a quick \nand simple question prior to that? It won't take more than 2 minutes to \ndeal with.\n  Mr. HATCH. We only have about 8 minutes to go, but that is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator from Missouri if he could give his \nestimate of how much of a diminution of the ability of the intelligence \ncommunity occurs if we do not pass adequate FISA authorization? Would \nit be a 30-percent reduction in their ability, or is it 20 percent? Can \nthe Senator give a ballpark figure?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I am \nnot at liberty to disclose the amount, but it is very significant. I \ncannot give him the percentages, but it is more significant than the \nSenator has suggested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I add to that that it is very significant. \nWe do know that.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for his remarks \nbecause he is a leader in this area and certainly has no higher \ninterest than protecting our country and our citizens.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as Congress prepares to adjourn for the \ntraditional August recess, I want to draw continued emphasis to a \nsignificant issue: FISA modernization.\n  I am greatly encouraged by the bipartisan negotiations concerning \nthis topic. However, I remain troubled about the possibility of \nadjournment without resolution of this vital initiative. It is very--\nsimple passing a bill with limited FISA modernization will contribute \nto a safer America. If passing this bill means we must delay our \nrecess, then we must do it. We should be able to get together today, \nthough.\n  Do you think al-Qaida takes a recess? It is essential that we not \nadjourn until we send an appropriate bill to the President.\n  While some issues that we debate in Congress necessitate that we \npersuade Members of a pressing need, this is not one of them. Every \nSenator in the 110th Congress knows that the current FISA statute has \nloopholes which are putting our country at increased risk.\n  How should we tackle this issue? I suggest we take a logical and \nsound approach: Identify the problem, discuss and debate solutions, \nimplement the solution. In this case, we have identified the problem.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has not been changed to \nreflect the vast technological changes that have occurred since this \nlaw was passed in 1978. Since the law has not been appropriately \nmodified, our Nation is missing potentially valuable intelligence that \nis essential to protect our country. Getting this intelligence is \nessential for our safety. It is about getting the enemy's secrets--\ntheir plans and intentions--without them knowing we've got them.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, has done a \ntremendous job in explaining the exceptional problems that our \nintelligence community continues to encounter based on antiquated \nsections of the law. When the United States Director of National \nIntelligence says our country is at risk, I hope we are listening. Let \nme read a quote that Director McConnell recently stated:\n\n       Many Americans would be surprised at just what the current \n     law requires. To state the facts plainly: In a significant \n     number of cases, our intelligence agencies must obtain a \n     court order to monitor the communications of foreigners \n     suspected of terrorist activity who are physically located in \n     foreign countries. We are in this situation because the law \n     simply has not kept pace with technology.\n\n  This is a powerful statement that Director McConnell gives. However, \nI must disagree with one thing he says. I don't think most Americans \nwould be ``surprised'' by what our current law requires, I think most \nAmericans would be outraged by what our current law requires. A \nterrorist in Afghanistan speaks with a terrorist in Iraq, and U.S. \nintelligence agencies need a court order to listen to this \nconversation?\n  This is absurd.\n  We need to bring FISA back to its original intent to protect the \nrights and privacy of American individuals while allowing us to monitor \nforeign individuals outside of the United States.\n  The President of the United States has also recognized the perilous \nsituation in which we find ourselves. In his radio address last \nweekend, he stated that ``Our intelligence community warns that under \nthe current statute, we are missing a significant amount of foreign \nintelligence that we should be collecting to protect our country.''\n  Let's look closely at this. Our intelligence community is saying that \nwe are missing a significant amount of foreign intelligence. Why are we \nmissing this intelligence? Is it because we don't know how to get it?\n  No.\n  Is it because we don't have the ability or funds to get it?\n  No.\n  Is it because terrorist groups have technology that we can't exploit?\n  No.\n  It is because a law passed in 1978 has not been appropriately amended \nto conform with the technological advances that we have seen since that \ntime. Why are we handcuffing ourselves?\n  I believe most Americans would look at this situation and simply \nshake their heads.\n  If we know we have a problem, and we know how to fix it, why don't \nwe? Is the excuse that we might not have enough time before recess?\n  Of course we have time.\n  We'll make time.\n  It is outrageous that we would even consider a recess while this \nproblem and other loopholes of the FISA law remain intact.\n  If we can't get this done, why are we here? It is no wonder that the \napproval ratings for Congress are approaching all time lows.\n  Quite simply, we have a problem, but we know how to fix it. I note \nthat Senator Bond has introduced a straight\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\nforward measure which we can pass today.\n  This bill will put the tools back in the hands of the people who work \ntirelessly in providing a safe environment for American families \nthroughout this great country.\n  This amendment of FISA simply returns the law to its original intent, \nwhich is twofold: first, allowing surveillance of foreign targets, who \nwere never underprotected under FISA; and second, guaranteeing the \nprivacy and rights of U.S. persons, who remain protected.\n  It is time to address this situation. I would ask my colleagues to \njoin me in pledging to pass legislation in this area before we recess. \nThis is not about partisan politics.\n  This is about protecting Americans. We are all painfully aware of the \ncontinued dangers that our country continues to face at the hands of \norganized groups and dedicated individuals who desire nothing more than \nthe collapse of our country as a superpower.\n  This is not a case of the boy who cried wolf. We know the threats are \nout there. However, each day that passes creates emotional distance \nbetween the nightmares of September 11, and each new day provides \nopportunities to heal.\n  We don't have to live our lives in fear, but we have to acknowledge \nthat the world changed that day. Rather than obsessing over news \nreports, let's enjoy the tremendous opportunities that the greatest \nNation on Earth provides.\n  And let's ensure that all of the dedicated and noble professionals \nwho play a part in ensuring our liberty and safety are not hampered by \nnonpartisan problems that we have the ability to fix.\n  We always hear that the terrorists have an asymmetrical advantage \nover us: They do not operate as nation-states, and some of them are \nwilling to die as suicide bombers.\n  But we have a massive asymmetrical advantage over them: Our \ntechnological prowess.\n  Are we to compromise one of our greatest strengths, when that \nstrength is essential, effective and lawful?\n  I remind my colleagues that even though we will return to our States \nfor the recess, our enemies and their threats don't go away. They don't \nadjust their schedules to fit ours.\n  Make no mistake, inaction on our part needlessly subjects every \nAmerican to increased danger. We need to act.\n  We have two options: Cut into August recess if necessary to provide \nsafety to Americans, or go home and leave this vulnerability intact.\n  The answer is an easy one: Let's ensure that our defenders have all \nof the tools they need for our continued safety, no matter how long it \ntakes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in pledging to pass FISA \nmodernization legislation before our recess. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Rockefeller-Levin bill is the \nbill of the Director of National Intelligence, who was appointed by the \nPresident to be in charge and make all decisions with respect to this \nmatter. In the statement DNI McConnell put out at 4:39 this evening, he \nsaid:\n\n       I urge Members of Congress to support the legislation I \n     provided last evening to modify FISA and equip our \n     intelligence community with the tools we need to protect our \n     Nation.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe DNI's full statement at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. He is talking about our bill, the bill I am now \ntalking about. The Rockefeller-Levin bill is the bill the DNI is \nreferring to in his statement. I am not shy about saying that; I am \nproud of it. The bill he provided to us last evening--that is our bill, \nnot the other one, our bill--is not the Bond bill that was filed 2 days \nago. It is our bill.\n  Our bill takes the DNI's preferred bill and modifies it in a limited \nnumber of ways to make it stronger without in any way diminishing the \nfundamental intelligence authorities the DNI needs. Our bill includes a \nsunset provision of 6 months, the same sunset provision or period that \nis contained in the Bond bill, I might add, and we are told that the \nDNI accepted. In fact, he has told us specifically he accepts it.\n  Our modified DNI bill--Director of National Intelligence--would allow \nour intelligence community to begin the surveillance of terrorist \nsuspects, targets located overseas, immediately upon the signing of the \nbill, even if those targeted calls enter the United States. In other \nwords, you start immediately in the collection. Why is this? Because \nthe collection is not complete. We are not going in all\n\n[[Page S10862]]\n\nplaces we should be, and that is the national requirement because of \nvarious warnings that have been issued. So there is no delay--immediate \ncollection--provided there has been a determination by the Attorney \nGeneral and the DNI that the target is foreign.\n  The only requirement in this bill on the collection is the \nrequirement that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court must be \npresented, for its review and approval, the Attorney General's \nguidelines on how the determination is to be made that targets of \nsurveillance are overseas. So the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence \nCourt remains very much a part of our bill, the bill the DNI prefers. \nThis process of court review and authorization of procedures--not \nindividual targeting determinations but a straightforward review that \nthe procedures are reasonable--is at the heart of both the DNI's bill \nand ours.\n  While the DNI proposal of last night sets forth a 90-day period \nduring which this intelligence collection can take place before the \ncourt needs to issue another authorizing of the collection, our bill \nmodifies the time involved in this process--we thought that was too \nlong--which we believe will be relatively straightforward and \nnoncontroversial, so that the application, including the guidelines, is \nsubmitted to the FISA Court within 10 days after surveillance begins \nand that the court must act within 30 days, which the court could then \nextend if additional time is, in fact, needed.\n  All during this 30-day period of application submission and court \nreview, the collection against foreign targets continues. I keep making \nthat point because it was very hard for people to come to terms with \nthat. This is not case-by-case review. Methods are established, \nauthority is given, and collections can continue.\n  Moreover, once the court approves the guidelines, the Attorney \nGeneral is not required to return to the court for further approval for \nthe remainder of the 6-month period of this legislation.\n  This process provides minimal and yet essential oversight while not \ninhibiting or delaying the intelligence collection from proceeding. The \nRockefeller-Levin bill accepts the DNI-requested authority to proceed \nduring this FISA Court review.\n  The Bond bill, on the other hand--and I greatly respect and have \nstrong affection for my vice chairman, but we have competing bills, and \nlet the difference be known. The Bond bill, on the other hand, provides \na weak and practically nonexistent court review of the procedures for \nhow to determine that a target is foreign and not American. The Bond \nbill would not require the Attorney General to submit the application \nand guidelines in the FISA Court until 4 months into the 6-month life \nof the bill, and then the Bond bill would not require court approval \nuntil 6 months has gone by.\n  In other words, under the Bond bill, court approval of these simple \nand straightforward guidelines on how the Attorney General would \ndetermine whether a target is indeed foreign, guidelines that DNI has \ntold me personally exist already--let me repeat, guidelines that he has \nsaid exist already--the guidelines that would have to exist before \ncollection could begin in the first place for the surveillance to be \nlegal under the Bond bill.\n  These guidelines would not have to be submitted until 4 months into \nthe 6-month life of the bill and would not have to be approved by the \ncourt until the last day that the law would be in effect.\n  Is that meaningful court review over what is a straightforward matter \nof court review and can easily be handled within 30 days? It is, of \ncourse, not, and is, frankly, a farce.\n  The Rockefeller-Levin modified DNI bill makes sure the Attorney \nGeneral has guidelines in place to address the concerns of many, \nincluding our intelligence officials, that surveillance of foreign \ntargets not inadvertently result in the reverse targeting of Americans \nand their communications based on innocent communications swept up \nbetween Americans and individuals overseas. Our modified DNI bill also \nstates right up front that a court order is not required for the \nsurveillance of foreign-to-foreign communications, even if the \ninterception of the communication occurs in the United States.\n  The DNI and others have made a huge point about keeping the \nsurveillance of foreign-to-foreign communications outside the FISA \nprocess, and I agree. The Rockefeller-Bond bill made clear that this is \nthe case.\n  I could spend additional time explaining why the Bond bill falls \nshort of the bill that the DNI asked us to pass, in public, earlier \nthis evening. I could spend additional time explaining the merits and \nprotections contained in our bill. But time has run out.\n  Before us now is a very simple question, and I say this with some \nheat: Will the Senate pass a bill that the DNI wants, a bill that gives \nhim the collection tool he needs for the next 6 months, and then we \nreview the whole process again, a bill which both Republicans and \nDemocrats can support and can rally around, to clearly demonstrate that \nwe put national security above politics and that we are ready to break \nwith the partisan gridlock of the past and produce results, results \nwhich give all Americans some comfort that we have our priorities \nstraight? And we do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Rockefeller-Levin modified DNI \nbill, and I close, with some lack of subtlety, with the words of the \nDNI earlier this day:\n\n       I urge Members of Congress to support legislation I \n     provided last evening to modified FISA and equip our \n     intelligence community with the tools we need to protect our \n     Nation.\n\n  That is our bill; not their bill--our bill. Passage of the \nRockefeller-Levin bill--not the Bond amendment, our bill--would give \nthe DNI the tools he needs with the necessary court review and \noversight as we continue over the next 6 months on more legislation to \nreform FISA.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            Director of National Intelligence,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2007.\n\n             Statement by Director of National Intelligence\n\n     Subject: Modernization of the Foreign Intelligence \n         Surveillance Act (FISA)\n       I greatly appreciate the significant time many Members of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives have taken to \n     discuss with me the urgent need to modernize FISA. I also \n     appreciate the bipartisan support for ensuring the \n     Intelligence Community can effectively collect the necessary \n     intelligence to protect our country from attack. In view of \n     the significance of this issue, its impact on the \n     Intelligence Community's ability to be effective and the \n     continuing dialogue to come to closure on an effective bill, \n     it is important for me to discuss the essential provisions \n     needed by the Intelligence Community.\n       We must urgently close the gap in our current ability to \n     effectively collect foreign intelligence. The current FISA \n     law does not allow us to be effective. Modernizing this law \n     is essential for the Intelligence Community to be able to \n     provide warning of threats to the country.\n\n\n                        Critical Changes Needed\n\n       First, the Intelligence Community should not be required to \n     obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign \n     intelligence from foreign targets located overseas. Simply \n     due to technology changes since 1978, court approval should \n     not now be required for gathering intelligence from \n     foreigners located overseas. This was not deemed appropriate \n     in 1978 and it is not appropriate today.\n       Second, those who assist the Government in protecting us \n     from harm must be protected from liability. This includes \n     those who are alleged to have assisted the Government after \n     September 11, 2001 and have helped keep the country sate. I \n     understand the leadership in Congress is not able to address \n     before the August recess the issue of liability protection \n     for those who are alleged to have helped the country stay \n     safe after September 11, 2001. However, I appreciate the \n     commitment of the congressional leadership to address this \n     particular issue immediately upon the return of Congress in \n     September 2007.\n\n\n         Provisions that Harm Intelligence Community Operations\n\n       The Intelligence Community should not be restricted to \n     effective collection of only certain categories of foreign \n     intelligence when the targets are located overseas. We must \n     ensure that the Intelligence Community can be effective \n     against all who seek to do us harm.\n       The bill must not require court approval before urgently \n     needed intelligence collection can begin against a foreign \n     target located overseas. The delays of a court process that \n     requires judicial determinations in advance to gather vital \n     intelligence from foreign targets overseas can in some cases \n     prevent the rapid gathering of intelligence necessary to \n     provide warning of threats to the country. This process would \n     also require in practice that we continue to divert scarce \n     intelligence experts to compiling these court submissions. \n     Similarly, critical intelligence gathering on foreign targets \n     should not be halted while court review is pending.\n       However, to acknowledge the interests of all, I could agree \n     to a procedure that provides for court review--after needed \n     collection has begun--of our procedures for gathering foreign \n     intelligence through classified\n\n[[Page S10863]]\n\n     methods directed at foreigners located overseas. While I \n     would strongly prefer not to engage in such a process, I am \n     prepared to take these additional steps to keep the \n     confidence of Members of Congress and the American people \n     that our processes have been subject to court review and \n     approval.\n       I appreciate the President's and the congressional \n     leadership's commitment to provide the Intelligence Community \n     the necessary tools to protect our country and keep us safe \n     from those who seek us harm. My most solemn duty is to \n     protect America, provide warning, and ensure that our \n     Intelligence Community acts within our Constitution and laws.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my distinguished friend leaves the \nfloor, I just spoke with Senator Leahy. He does not want his name as a \nsponsor. He is supportive of the deal, but he thinks it should be \nRockefeller-Levin.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. First, before my \ngood friend, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee leaves the \nfloor, through the Chair, may I address the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. The Director of National Intelligence is \nsitting right off the floor here, and he has not seen--he has just seen \nyour bill. He does not support it. I ask if the chairman of the Intel \nCommittee would step outside and talk to the Director of National \nIntelligence to see whether, in fact, he does or does not support the \nRockefeller bill or the bill that we introduced on behalf of the DNI, \nwhich is now pending as amendment No. 1927.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Has the distinguished vice chairman asked me a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes. Would you be willing to step off the floor to ask the \nDNI?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I don't need to. The head of National Intelligence \nhas made it very clear and has issued a public statement that he \nsupports our bill. He says:\n\n       I reviewed the proposal that the House of Representatives \n     is expected to vote on this afternoon to modify the Foreign \n     Intelligence [et cetera]. The House proposal is unacceptable, \n     and I strongly oppose it. [et cetera] I urge Members of the \n     Senate to support. . . .\n\n  Mr. BOND. I, at this time, reclaim my time and thank the chairman for \nhis answer. Let me tell you, none of us have seen this bill that is a \ntotal new draft of the measure until just a few minutes ago, and we are \nabsolutely stunned that this bill adds new burdens to the already \noverburdened process of collecting against foreign targets. This bill \nsays it can only apply to communications between foreign persons \nwithout a court order. You can't tell if it is a communication between \nforeign persons when you target a foreign source because you don't know \nwith whom that person is communicating. That is why there are so many \nburdens now on the FISA Court.\n  The DNI has said explicitly--he has told us that he opposes the \nRockefeller-Levin bill. The DNI has stated that the bill that Senator \nMcConnell and I offered, S. 1927, which we filed on Wednesday night, is \nthe bill that he supports.\n  Any one of my colleagues who wants to, I invite them to step out this \nnortheast door and talk directly with Admiral McConnell because I think \nit is extremely important that you find out what his position truly is.\n  Let me be clear: The bill that was introduced by Senator McConnell \nand me was the bill that Admiral McConnell had modified after having \ncomments to which he listened from several Democratic chairmen on \nTuesday evening. He added the provisions for court review--they are \ncourt reviews within 120 days, 4 months--that would be adapted to the \nnew requirements in FISA that did not exist before that will take some \ntime to get together. And it also included a provision that there would \nbe, in addition to that--that there would be the DNI who would be one \nof the people making the certifications--two things that were \nrequested.\n  There is one other modification that I will ask unanimous consent to \nmake, or offer an amendment to make, when we prepare to debate on the \nbills, and that is to include a 6-month sunset so we will have the \nopportunity to review this bill.\n  With that, I will have more to say about that later, but the DNI \nexplicitly will tell anybody who steps outside that he does not support \nthis bill.\n  It is in the bill, excuse me.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader. But with that, I will \nyield the floor and allow other Members to communicate.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Does the vice chairman yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. May I make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have before us two pieces of \nlegislation; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Chair please state who the sponsors are of the \ntwo individual pieces of legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 2011 is sponsored by Senator Levin and \nSenator Rockefeller; S. 1927 is sponsored by Senator McConnell and \nSenator Bond.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Is Senator Levin ready to speak? Is Senator Feingold ready \nto speak? No.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to add a dimension to this debate, \nand that is that I have had the privilege of knowing Admiral McConnell \nfor some years. He does not have a scintilla of politics. He left a \nvery lucrative position in the private sector to once again join and \nserve as a public servant. Thus far, I think all of us would say he has \nhandled this challenging new office, Director of National Intelligence, \nwith great distinction.\n  How well I remember just a week or so ago, I say to my distinguished \ncolleague from Missouri, when he came up in S-407 and spoke to some 30 \nor so--more than that, close to 40 Senators, bipartisan--and Senator \nafter Senator got up and complimented him on his very straightforward \nmanner of delivery. Without hesitation he called the situations that \nwere before him in question as he saw them. He communicated publicly \nwith the Senate, expressing on the second of August his views of what \nhe believed should be in those revisions that should be made by the \nCongress.\n  I find this procedure very disturbing. It is essential for the United \nStates of America to continue to obtain the intelligence under this \nprogram. There is every desire to make sure that we will comply with \nthe law, but the law does need some revision. It is incumbent upon this \nbody and, hopefully, the House of Representatives to resolve this \nsituation before we go into the August recess, because it is our own \nsecurity that will suffer unless we follow the advice of this very \ndistinguished public servant who only wishes to do what is best in the \ninterests of the United States and the people of our country and our \ntroops serving abroad, our troops serving wherever they are in the \nworld.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's hard work. It has \nbeen a very difficult time to get here. I especially wish to extend my \nappreciation to Senators Rockefeller, Levin, Leahy, Feingold, Durbin, \nMikulski, Feinstein, Nelson, and I am sure I have missed some people, \nbut those are the ones whom I have heard from recently--and certainly \nSheldon Whitehouse, who put in the graveyard shifts.\n  I wish to say, before I turn to my prepared remarks, I too have the \ngreatest admiration for Admiral McConnell, but I have to say, I am \nconcerned that we have Admiral McConnell here checking on us. I mean, \nhe should not be--``do you want to go ask him how he feels about this \nlegislation?''\n  I can't appreciate that. I think it is wrong that this man whom we \nput in this very important position is here roaming the halls finding \nout how we are going to vote, sending Senators out to find out how he \nfeels about it?\n  Mr. BOND. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will in a minute.\n  Because he supports the legislation offered by my friends Senators \nMcConnell and Bond and does not support\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\nthis does not mean this is bad legislation.\n  I will be happy to respond to a question. If you can use your time, \nthat would be great.\n  Mr. BOND. Very quickly. Does the distinguished majority leader know \nthat Admiral McConnell is here because three of his members \nspecifically asked that he come over and comment on these bills, and at \ntheir request we invited him to come here to respond to their \nquestions?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that. I misunderstood. I thought he was \nwaiting in the hall to answer questions. You asked one Senator if he \nwanted to go ask him how he felt about the legislation. I think that is \ninappropriate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for another question? I also note \nin here S. 1927 basically gives a great deal----\n  Mr. REID. I have the greatest respect for my friend. I wish to get my \nstatement out while I have time. We are on a very limited timeframe. I \nknow the Senator knows the details of it, but I have a few things I \nwish to say.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I could I wish to make one comment \nabout the issue the Senator raised about Admiral McConnell.\n  The last time we checked, there are 100 Senators elected to enact \npublic policy. The notion that somebody who was confirmed by the Senate \nto execute these policies is a person who should be able to veto what \nwe do here on the basis that he has a distinguished background is \nsomewhat questionable.\n  That discounts the qualities of every Member of this body, that \ndiscounts the qualities of every hard-working staff member who knows \nthe law and has good ideas about what this public policy should be.\n  I voted for Admiral McConnell. I respect him. The day we start \ndeferring to someone who is not an elected Member of this body, or \nhiding behind him when you do not have the arguments to justify your \nposition is a sad day for the Senate. We make the policy, not the \nexecutive branch.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I may have to use a little bit of leader \ntime because our time is fast ending. So I will do that as quickly as I \ncan.\n  Mr. President, as we know from the briefings we have received from \nthe Director of National Intelligence, the FISA law needs to be \nupdated. But I underscore and certainly want to be made part of the \nstatements made by my friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  Our intelligence community professionals are currently lacking, we \nare told, critical information and tools they need to protect this \nNation from terrorism.\n  My goal, when I learned about the intelligence communities' concerns, \nwas to pass the legislation that addresses DNI's legitimate concerns, \nasserts our oversight responsibility, protects the rights of American \ncitizens, and is temporary in duration.\n  I believe the legislation offered by Senators Rockefeller and Levin \nachieves each of these goals, gives the communities all the tools they \nneed, but at the same time it makes the independent FISA Court, not the \nAttorney General, the overseer of the methods and procedures used for \ncollecting foreign intelligence.\n  Democrats and Republicans want to aggressively pursue al-Qaida and \nother terrorist organizations and other terrorists. This bill does \nthat, but not at the cost of targeting American citizens without court \nauthorization. We have had many conversations in the last several days \nwith Admiral McConnell. I can say with great confidence that this \nlegislation provides him with everything he asked for in these \ndiscussions, everything.\n  He told us he wanted the tool to collect foreign-to-foreign \nintelligence communications without a warrant. He got it. He told us he \nwanted the ability to compel compliance from communications providers \nwith liability protection. He got it.\n  He told us he wanted the ability to collect all foreign intelligence \ninformation, not just intelligence related to terrorism. He got it. He \ntold us he wanted the ability to temporarily begin the collection of \nintelligence without seeking a court order. He even got that.\n  In fact, the legislation was provided by the administration to \nAdmiral McConnell, and that legislation, he said in a statement today, \nhe strongly supports--which we have heard--served as the starting point \nfor the Levin-Rockefeller legislation. That is what we have before us; \nit is a modified McConnell amendment.\n  What we have before us tonight, with very modest edits, is Admiral \nMcConnell's proposal, what he told us he wanted, and what he gave us in \nwriting.\n  I would hope it receives the broad support of the Senate. The Bond \nlegislation, on the other hand, is not something I can support. It \nauthorizes, in my opinion, warrantless searches of Americans' phone \ncalls, e-mails, homes, offices and personal records and for however \nlong it is appealed to the court of review and the Supreme Court takes. \nThis process could take months or indeed years.\n\n  Even worse, the search does not have to be directed abroad, just \nconcerning a person abroad, any search, any search inside the United \nStates, the Government can claim to be concerning al-Qaida is \nauthorized. I do not believe that is the right way, the strong way or \nthe Constitutional way to fight the war on terrorism. I urge all \nMembers to support the Rockefeller-Levin bill.\n  It does everything that Admiral McConnell has requested. It strikes \nthe right balance between protecting the American people from terrorism \nand preserving their Constitutional fundamental rights.\n  Let the record be clear: Every Senator here tonight is patriotic and \nwants to get rid of these bad people and find out everything they are \ntalking about, in a way that is in keeping with our Constitution. I \nappreciate the service of my friend from Missouri. He has been a \nvaliant member of that committee and does a good job.\n  So let's not question tonight, and I hope I have not done that, \nanyone's patriotism or what they are trying to do. What we are trying \nto do is the right thing. But I believe the best way to go is by \nsupporting the second vote, which will be Levin-Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 7 minutes to Senator Levin, 5 minutes for Senator \nFeingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to read the key section of our bill. \nIt says that:\n\n       A court order is not required for the acquisition of the \n     contents of any communication between persons that are not \n     located in the United States, for the purpose of collecting \n     foreign intelligence information without respect to whether \n     the communication passes through the United States, or the \n     surveillance device is located within the United States.\n\n  That is the heart of the matter. That is what Admiral McConnell has \nrequested. That is what both bills provide, both bills cure the problem \nthat exists. There is a problem. We have to cure it. Our bill, in \naddition to the Bond bill, both bills do that.\n  Now, what are the major differences between the bills? What Admiral \nMcConnell has indicated to us in a statement:\n\n       The intelligence community should not be required to obtain \n     court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence, \n     from foreign targets, located overseas.\n\n  That is in both bills. Except our bill is limited to foreign targets \nlimited overseas, unlike the Bond bill, which does not have that key \nlimitation and which, it seems to me, very clearly applies to U.S. \ncitizens overseas. Our bill does not.\n  Now, if there is an incidental access to U.S. citizens, we obviously \nwill permit that. That is not the problem. It is called minimization. \nWe do not try to affect that. But the key difference between the \nRockefeller-Levin bill and the Bond bill is that we carry out what \nAdmiral McConnell has said repeatedly, not just in the statement I read \nbut also in newspaper articles that he has written in the Washington \nPost.\n  What does he say there? He says that: In a significant number of \ncases, our intelligence agencies must obtain a court order to monitor \nthe communications of foreigners suspected of terrorist activities who \nare physically located in foreign countries.\n  Now, our bill does that. But what does the Bond bill do? The Bond \nbill\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\ngoes beyond that. In its first section it says:\n\n       Nothing in the definition of electronic surveillance under \n     section 101(f) shall be construed to encompass surveillance \n     directed at a person reasonably believed to be located \n     outside of the United States.\n\n  Any person. Does not say a foreign person. Admiral McConnell has been \nvery precise. We have all heard him over and over again. He has been \nprecise in his written statements, he has been precise orally. They \nwant access, and we have to give them access.\n  When foreign persons communicate with foreign persons, even though, \nas our bill says, the communications might be routed through the United \nStates, that is the problem that must be cured. It is cured in both \nbills. But we avoid doing, in our bill, what the Bond bill does, which \nis to say, as it very explicitly does: That if surveillance is directed \nat a person, which means any person--it could be a U.S. person, \nreasonably believed to be located outside of the United States--then it \nis permitted, it is authorized, in that first section of the Bond bill, \n105(a). That is one of the critical differences, the most important \ndifference, between Rockefeller-Levin, which does what the Admiral says \nwe must do, find a way with the new technology where calls may be \nrouted through the United States, to get to those communications by \nforeign persons to foreign persons.\n  We must do that to defend the country. We must do it. We do it. But \nwe avoid doing what Admiral McConnell says he does not want to do, \nwhich is to get to the communications of Americans.\n  There you have to go for a warrant. That is what he says we should \ncontinue to do. He says it eloquently, in writing and orally. We \nprotect that very vital interest.\n  There are a number of other differences. To give you one: What the \nBond bill does is it says that: In terms of reviewing and auditing, the \nway this works, the audit will be carried out by the Attorney General \nof the United States, in effect auditing his own work, reviewing his \nown work.\n  On a semiannual basis, it says in section 4, the Attorney General \nshall inform the Select Committee, et cetera. The Attorney General \nshall give us a report concerning acquisitions--that is the \nintercepts--during the previous 6-month period. Each report shall \ninclude--then it describes all of the reports--a description of any \nincidents of noncompliance with a directive issued by the Attorney \nGeneral and the Director of National Intelligence; incidents of \nnoncompliance by a specified person to whom the Attorney General and \nDirector of National Intelligence--so the Attorney General, under the \nBond provision, is reporting to Congress about his own activities. What \nkind of an independent report is that?\n  So in the Rockefeller-Levin bill, we do not say to the Attorney \nGeneral: Report on your own activities. We say to the inspector \ngenerals, three of them, they all have access here and all have a role: \nWe want the independent assessment from you. We want a report to \nCongress not by an Attorney General reporting on his own activities but \nby the inspectors general who have that independence, which is so \ncritically important.\n  I understand my time is up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  May I say first that I regret this debate is happening at all. I \nregret the news coverage of this discussion. I wish this had been able \nto be settled among Members of both parties in both Houses and the \nexecutive branch. If not, I wish we were debating this in executive \nsession. Why do I regret this debate is occurring? Because we are at \nwar. We were attacked on September 11, 2001 by a brutal, inhumane enemy \nwho killed 3,000 Americans and intends to do so again. They tell us \nrepeatedly. This is about gathering intelligence on that enemy.\n  I regret we are having this debate. I regret all the publicity, \nbecause I fear they will learn something indirectly about the methods \nof intelligence we have. But here we are.\n  I want to explain why I will vote for the McConnell-Bond proposal. I \nam because we are at war. I am because it has been publicly suggested \nthere is increased terrorist activity. We have seen the Web site of \nthreats against the United States, suggesting even threats against the \nCapitol, the citadel of our democracy, by these extremist Islamist \nterrorists. Admiral McConnell, whom everyone says they respect--I \nrespect him; I trust him--says to us--and I will be as vague as I need \nto be and want to be--he is missing for a reason a tool he needs to \nadequately gather intelligence on the terrorist threat. He has told us \nwhat he needs to close that gap. I think we are beyond the point of \ndebating what might be a better way to do this. I feel that \nparticularly because Senator Bond has added the 6-month sunset.\n  We have a crisis. We are at war. The enemy is plotting to attack us. \nThis proposal will allow us to gather intelligence information on that \nenemy we otherwise would not gather. This is not the time for striving \nfor legislative perfection. We have the 6 months after this is adopted \nto work together to try to do something everyone believes is more \nappropriate. Concerns have been expressed about American citizens, \nagain being as vague as we all ought to be. The fact is, we have been \ntold authoritatively that these acts of surveillance will only touch \nAmerican citizens coincidentally, and an infinitesimally small number. \nSo you have to balance. What are your concerns about that, a program \nrun by Admiral McConnell and an extraordinary staff at the NSA who work \nfor us? These are our soldiers in the war against terrorism. I want to \ngive them the power and authority they need to find out what our enemy \nis doing so we can stop them before they attack us.\n  With all respect to my colleagues, I plead with everyone, let us not \nstrive for perfection. Let us put national security first. Let us \nunderstand if this passes, as I pray it will, and the President signs \nit, as I know he will if it passes both Houses, we are going to have 6 \nmonths to reason together to find something better. If we leave \nWashington for August recess without closing this gap in our Nation's \nintelligence capabilities at a time of war, it will be quite simply a \ndereliction of duty by this Congress. It will be a failure to uphold \nour constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense.\n  I appeal to my friends on both sides of the aisle, let's do what we \nneed to do now. Let's do what Admiral Mike McConnell, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, tells us he needs to provide intelligence to our \nGovernment to enable our Government to protect us from terrorists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from Wisconsin 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was yielded 5 minutes. You have 8 \nminutes left.\n  Mr. REID. Would you mind going next, Senator Bond? You have 16 \nminutes and we have 8.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield to the Senator from California 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield her 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me respond to what the Senator from Connecticut \nindicated. In times of war, we don't give up our responsibility in the \nSenate to review and make laws. The notion that we simply defer this to \nthe Director of National Intelligence and whatever he says is an \nabdication of our duties, especially in times of war. In fact, let's \nremember why this is here. The Senator regrets we are debating this and \nsome of these very important matters that are generally kept secret are \nbeing discussed. I agree. But why are they secret? Because the \nadministration was conducting an illegal wiretapping program and \nsomebody inappropriately blew the lid on that. That wasn't the doing of \nanybody in this body. That was due to the incompetence and \ninappropriate conduct of this administration in the first place. That \nis why we are here with this kind of debate, not because of anything \nanybody did here.\n  By the way, this horrible conflict we have with those who attacked us \non 9/11, this conflict is something we all\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\nagree on. Not a single Senator doesn't think we should be able to get \nat these foreign calls. Not a single Senator doesn't want to give the \nadmiral what he has asked for that is reasonable. We simply want \nprotection for the civil liberties of people who have done absolutely \nnothing wrong.\n  Let's be sure what this debate is about. I thank the majority leader \nand Senator Rockefeller, Senator Levin, Senator Leahy, and especially \nSenator Whitehouse, who put tremendous effort into this, for trying to \nmake this as good as possible.\n  I am going to vote for the Rockefeller-Leahy-Levin bill. I am \nconcerned we are moving too fast and that we have not necessarily come \nup with the right answer to the problem we all recognize exists. But I \nam prepared to vote for this because I think it is at least a \nreasonable approach for addressing legitimate problems without unduly \ncompromising the civil liberties of Americans. I do so with great \nreluctance, with the expectation that this is an experiment with a \nshort expiration date, an experiment we can assess and modify as we \nmove forward.\n  But we cannot pass the Bond-McConnell proposal. This bill would go \nway too far. It would permit the Government, with no court oversight \nwhatsoever, to intercept the communications of calls to and from the \nUnited States, as long as it is directed at a person--any person, not a \nsuspected terrorist--reasonably believed to be outside the United \nStates. That means giving free rein to the Government to wiretap \nanyone, including U.S. citizens who live overseas, servicemembers such \nas those in Iraq, journalists reporting from overseas, or even Members \nof Congress who are overseas and can call home to the United States. \nThis is without any court oversight whatsoever. That is unacceptable.\n  It goes far beyond the identified problem of foreign-to-foreign \ncommunications that we all agree on. It goes far, far beyond the public \ndescriptions of the President's warrantless wiretapping program. What \nlittle judicial review the bill does provide is essentially \nmeaningless. The FISA Court would decide only whether the Government \ncertification that it has put reasonable procedures in place to direct \nsurveillance against people reasonably believed to be abroad is \n``clearly erroneous.'' That is basically a standard that is nothing \nmore than a rubberstamp. It ignores the real issue which is protecting \nthe rights of Americans who may be calling or e-mailing friends, \nfamily, or business partners overseas and who have done absolutely \nnothing wrong.\n  Let me point out that the so-called court review in the Bond bill \nwill never happen, because the court only has to rule within 180 days \nof enactment, and there is now a sunset on the bill after 180 days.\n  A 6-month sunset does not justify voting for this bad version of the \nbill. We can't just suspend the Constitution for 6 months.\n  I strongly oppose the Bond bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose \nit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is general agreement on both sides \nof the aisle that we have a foreign intelligence surveillance problem \nthat should be addressed. The difference between us is that on this \nside of the aisle we have consistently been willing to work \ncooperatively to solve the problem.\n  There is a model. In 1976, we faced a similar problem. The Senate \nSelect Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to \nIntelligence Activities, known as the Church Committee, had found \ndisturbing abuses of electronic surveillance. Congress and the \nadministration set out to pass a law to prevent such abuses in the \nfuture, while still protecting our national security.\n  In 1976, I was the principal sponsor of the original bill that became \nFISA. When my colleagues and I first introduced the bill, we had a \nDemocratic Congress, a Republican President, Gerald Ford, and a \nRepublican Attorney General, Ed Levi. Attorney General Levi understood \nthe need for Congress and the executive branch to work together. \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee went down to the Justice Department \nat least four times to meet on the bill. There were discussions with \nHenry Kissinger, Don Rumsfeld, Brent Scowcroft, and George Bush among \nothers.\n  We worked responsibly and cooperatively to develop legislation to \nprotect our civil liberties and ensure that the Nation could use \nnecessary surveillance. In the end, Attorney General Levi praised the \nbipartisan spirit of cooperation that characterized the negotiations \nand produced a good bill. That administration recognized the importance \nof working with Congress. The final bill was passed by the Senate by a \nvote of 95 to 1.\n  As this history demonstrates, our Nation is strongest when we work \ntogether for our national security. Unfortunately, the current \nadministration has chosen a very different course. President Bush has \nrefused all along to consult Congress on the development and \nimplementation of its surveillance program, and now we find that it \nviolated the law.\n  This is not an argument for granting expanded discretion to the \nadministration. There is simply no basis for trusting this \nadministration to respect the privacy of the American people. Nor do we \nhave any confidence in the administration's competence to adopt a \nlawful and effective program.\n  When Attorney General Gonzales appeared before the Judiciary \nCommittee in February 2006, I questioned him about FISA and the \nrecently revealed warrantless eavesdropping program. I offered to work \nwith him then. In fact, I asked him why he had not approached Congress \nsooner, given Attorney General Levi's success and given the cost of \ngetting it wrong. He answered: ``We did not think we needed to, quite \nfrankly.''\n  Well, we now know that wasn't true. I pointed out to the Attorney \nGeneral at the time the benefit of having consensus on this issue and \nthe importance of fostering a cooperative atmosphere. His answer to me \nwas: ``I do not think that we are wrong on this.'' But they were wrong, \nwhich is why we are debating this issue at the eleventh hour today.\n  I told him then that the administration was sending the wrong message \nto the courts, that they were jeopardizing our ability to convict \nterrorists by using these illegal intelligence methods. The Attorney \nGeneral said:\n  That is the last thing we want to do. We believe this program is \nlawful.\n  He was wrong again. The program is not lawful and administration \nneeds Congress to fix it.\n  I did not stand alone on these issues. I had the support of many of \nmy colleagues on the committee on both sides of the aisle. Yet the \nrecord is clear that the Attorney General repeatedly rebuffed our \nefforts to work with the Administration to get this legislation right \nthe first time.\n  Instead, the Attorney General and the President have consistently \nrejected congressional input and oversight. They have repeatedly \ndemanded that Congress rubberstamp their decisions and trust their \ndiscretion. We have seen where that leads, and we owe the Nation a \nbetter approach.\n  We should pass legislation today that closes the gap in current law \nand preserves the critical role of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court in protecting our civil liberties.\n  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues, instead of using this \nopportunity to work together to safeguard the Nation, would prefer to \npass yet another partisan assault on the rule of law and American civil \nliberties. They insist on diminishing the role of the FISA Court and \nincreasing the unsupervised discretion of the Attorney General and the \nDirector of National Intelligence. They want to trust Alberto Gonzales \nto ensure that the Government does not listen to the phone calls and \nread the e-mails of Americans without justification. We need to \nmodernize FISA, not undermine it. Their proposal clearly contradicts \nthe fundamental purpose of the initial legislation.\n  This administration railroaded us into war in Iraq, railroaded us \ninto passing the PATRIOT Act and the Military Commissions Act and now \nit wants to railroad us into amending FISA without the time or \ninformation to consider the need properly.\n  We take a backseat to no one in wanting to keep our America safe. We \nknow that our families, our friends, and our communities are at stake. \nWe want to give our intelligence agencies the tools they need, but \nthere is a right\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\nway and a wrong way to do it. This eleventh-hour grandstanding by \nadministration is the wrong way to do it.\n  We should remember how we reached this point. For 4 straight years, \nthe Bush administration recklessly conducted warrantless surveillance \nin violation of FISA. The President acknowledged this surveillance only \nafter it was reported in the press. Until January of this year, the \nadministration refused to bring its surveillance program under the \noversight of the FISA Court, despite the clear statutory requirement to \ndo so.\n  The FISA Court has now reviewed the surveillance and has issued a \nruling. It has declared that a significant aspect of the President's \nwarantless surveillance program, in operation for 4 years without any \noversight, violates the law and cannot continue. Without bipartisan \ncongressional pressure to force that review, these and other despicable \nviolations of the rule of law would have gone on and on. Even today, \nthe Attorney General continues to mislead Congress on basic information \nabout the program, and he refuses to provide the legal justifications \non which he relied.\n  Now, after the FISA Court's clear ruling, the administration is \nurgently demanding that we correct their mistake. We can do that. We \ncan reach the appropriate balance between modernizing the legislation \nto protect our national security and maintaining its basic protection \nof civil liberties. If the administration and its allies are serious \nabout effectively protecting the country from terrorist threats, and \ndoing so under the rule of law, they should support such legislation.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S10867, August 3, 2007 the Record reads: . . . demanding \nthat we correct their . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . demanding \nthat we correct their mistake. We can do that. We can reach the \nappropriate balance between modernizing the legislation to protect \nour national security and maintaining its basic protection of \ncivil liberties. If the administration and its allies are serious \nabout effectively protecting the country from terrorist threats, \nand doing so under the rule of law, they should support such \nlegislation.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Rockefeller-Levin bill might not be \nprecisely the bill I would have written to fix the problem, but it is a \nresponsible and targeted fix to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, FISA, problem that has been identified. It is an appropriate \nresponse to the need expressed by Director of National Intelligence \nMcConnell regarding our foreign intelligence collection overseas. In \naddition, it tries to preserve some balance and some protections for \nthe civil liberties of Americans by keeping the FISA Court involved \nwhen there are significant communications to and from the United \nStates.\n  I have been briefed by the DNI and his staff and met with him several \ntimes recently about a problem that our intelligence agencies are \nhaving in collecting information from overseas. I have said that I am \nwilling to fix this problem, and I am. I have proposed ways to fix this \nidentified problem. It might not be everything he would like, his wish \nlist, but it solves his problem. The Congress has shown that it is \nwilling and able to reform FISA when changes are needed. We have done \nso many times since FISA was first passed in 1978 and at least half a \ndozen times since September 11, 2001. I believe such a targeted, \nresponsible fix is justified.\n  To achieve that fix, I would vote for Rockefeller-Levin. We could \nenact the needed change immediately. As I have indicated, it is not \neverything that I would have wanted or drafted precisely as I would \nhave written it. But it does the job and achieves a better balance than \nany viable alternative. I have worked with Senator Rockefeller for \nweeks on this matter and appreciate his leadership on this matter, as \nwell as that of Senator Levin.\n  The problem our intelligence agencies are having is with targeting \ncommunications overseas. We want them to be able to intercept calls \nbetween two people overseas with a minimum of difficulty. Obviously, \nthe situation is complicated when people overseas might be talking to \npeople here in the United States. These calls could be innocent \nconversations of businesspeople, tourists, our troops overseas to their \nfamilies, or to other friends or family in the United States. We should \nwant to give the Government great flexibility to listen to foreign-to-\nforeign calls, while still protecting privacy of innocent Americans by \nmaking sure the Government gets warrants when they are involved.\n  The Rockefeller-Levin bill accomplishes both of these things. It \nprovides a very flexible standard up front for the Government--it is \nonly required to go to the court for approval of procedures for how it \nwill know that the targets are, in fact, overseas. There is no case-by-\ncase application and approval of warrants for these overseas targets. \nThere is even an initial emergency provision that would allow the \nGovernment to start these interceptions before the court has done \nanything.\n  To protect Americans, the House bill requires the Government to have \nguidelines--and show them to the Congress--for how it will determine \nwhen a target is having regular communications with the United States. \nThen they need to go back to the regular FISA procedures and show \nprobable cause. Also, the Department of Justice inspector general must \ndo an audit of the conduct under this bill to see how much information \nabout people in the United States is being collected and must provide \nthat audit to the court and Congress. Because this process has been so \nexpedited and the issues involved are so significant, the bill would \nsunset in 180 days, so the Congress and the administration will have an \nopportunity to review it and act in a more deliberative way on these \nimportant issues.\n  Some things were added here that I might not have done. It now \napplies to all foreign intelligence targets, not just those involving \ninternational terrorism. It also does not require the court to \nreview and approve the guidelines for handling significant \ncommunications with the United States, only the Congress sees this. \nThese aspects trouble me. They are significant. The Director of \nNational Intelligence has said that with these changes, the bill solves \nhis problems and would significantly enhance our national security. \nThis bill should resolve the matter, but this administration does not \nknow how to take ``yes'' for an answer.\n\n  Regrettably, what has come over from the administration and has been \nintroduced here by Senator Bond and Senator McConnell goes far beyond \nwhat the DNI said he needs and I fear would be very harmful to the \ncivil liberties of Americans. The bill the administration has proposed \nis a vast rewrite of the FISA law that undercuts the purposes of that \nact in significant ways. What the administration has done is leverage a \nfixable problem into passage of a wish list of ways to give the \nAttorney General and through him the White House virtual unfettered \nauthority to conduct surveillance. It would take away any meaningful \nrole for the FISA Court for calls between overseas and the United \nStates. In fact, because it is not restricted to terrorism but involves \nany foreign intelligence, the administration's bill gives them far \ngreater authority than they had claimed in their secret, warrantless \nsurveillance program.\n  This bill allows Attorney General Gonzales to order surveillance. \nThis Attorney General is in charge of decisions about when to conduct \nsurveillance and can instruct the court to enforce those decisions. In \neffect, the only role for the court under this bill is as an \nenforcement agent--it is to rubberstamp the Attorney General's \ndecisions and use its authority to order telephone companies to comply. \nThe court would be stripped of its authority to serve as a check and to \nprotect the privacy of people within the United States. Their bill \nlikewise requires no review or audit by the Justice Department or \nanyone else about the number of U.S. communications that are being \ngathered by these orders.\n  I believe it is important to solve the problem our intelligence \nagencies are having right now. It is also essential to preserve the \ncritical role of the FISA Court in protecting civil liberties of \nAmericans. The House bill will do both of these things better than its \nalternatives.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe we need a short-term and long-\nterm fix for FISA. It is important to extend the program now and then \nfinish the job in the weeks and months ahead. Updating FISA has to be \ndone in a meticulous way. The real work will come in the near future \nwhen there is time to debate how to update this important tool that we \nneed to protect the American people\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, Senate Democrats offered \nthe Bush administration the tools needed to fight international \nterrorism while upholding the very liberties that our enemies seek to \ndestroy. That is why I support S. 2011, the Rockefeller-Levin Protect \nAmerica Act.\n  The Rockefeller-Levin bill strengthens our ability to protect \nAmericans, while ensuring this authority doesn't undermine our \nfreedoms. Rockefeller-Levin gives the Director of National Intelligence \nthe authority to obtain all essential intelligence information while \npreserving a role for the independent FISA Court to oversee his methods \nand protect our constitutional liberties.\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\n  To simply legitimize the Bush administration's warrantless wiretap \nprogram and provide unchecked authority to invade the personal privacy \nof all Americans is the wrong message to send to our citizens and the \nworld.\n  Our Constitution provides for a separation of powers to protect our \nNation and our way of life, and I, for one, do not believe we can \nundermine the liberty our troops have fought for generations to \nensure.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak directly to the \nAmerican people to tell them that this Senator understands the risks \nthat our country faces and I will do everything in my power to protect \nthem from a terrorist attack.\n  We have a President whose words do not match his actions and who \ncontinues to accuse Democrats of being weak on terrorism and unwilling \nto do what it takes to secure our nation.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  New Jersey was hit on September 11th we lost 700 people on that \nfateful day. Not a day goes by when I don't think about it. And it is \nlargely that day that brought me back to this Chamber.\n  My State is ripe with targets for terrorists, from its ports to its \nchemical plants and it has the most dangerous 2 miles for terrorism \nwithin it borders. So President Bush please don't lecture me on \nterrorism.\n  Instead of rhetoric, the Senate has been acting to defend our \nhomeland. Just last month we passed a bill to fund our homeland \nsecurity needs next year. It would put $38 billion into making our \nhomeland safer and more secure.\n  What does the President do? He says he will veto it. Why? Because he \nthinks it costs too much. It costs too much? How do you measure the \ncost of protecting us from terror?\n  And President Bush is accusing others of being weak on homeland \nsecurity?\n  The President is upset because Congress plans to put $2 billion more \ninto homeland security than he thinks we should do. That is less money \nfor a year of homeland security than we spend in one week in Iraq. This \nis a critical bill, and the President should have his pen ready to sign \nit, not continue to shortcut security for millions of people within our \nborders and within our homeland.\n  On Wednesday night, we saw a terrible incident when a bridge \ncollapsed in Minnesota, causing fear, death, and injury. It brought to \nlight the serious infrastructure needs of our country. What does \nPresident Bush do the next morning? He played raw politics and accused \nCongress of not working hard enough to fund our transportation needs. \nAgain, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has passed a transportation bill \nthat is ready to go the Senate floor. It includes $5 billion for bridge \nreplacement and rehabilitation across the Nation a full $1 billion \nincrease over last year's amount. Guess what. The President is \nthreatening to veto that one as well. Why? Again he thinks it costs too \nmuch to protect people domestically.\n  And now the administration is telling us there are gaps in our \nability to gather intelligence about terrorists. So we are trying to \nmake changes to the law dealing with the surveillance of emails and \nphone calls to make sure we protect the American people. And we must \nmake those necessary changes, even if we stay here through the month of \nAugust to do so. But we must do so in a way that balances our national \nsecurity with our fundamental civil rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. When she completes her statement, we have 2 or 3 minutes \nleft; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I remember well the day I saw the \nletter from Admiral McConnell. I believe the day was July 24. That is \nnot a long time ago. But it was a kind of wake-up call to us. Because \nwhat that letter says in essence is he believes the United States is \nvulnerable, and he believes we need to move quickly to change FISA.\n  From an intelligence point of view, many of us believe the chatter is \nup. It is not necessarily well defined, but during the 9/11 period, \nthis is clearly a period of heightened vulnerability. Therefore, what \nAdmiral McConnell wants to do is be able to better collect foreign \nintelligence. I very much respect what has happened. I respect the bill \nthat was put together on the Democratic side, and I respect the bill \nthat was put together on the Republican side, which is the McConnell \nbill on that side.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin might be interested to know that some of \nus just met with Admiral McConnell, particularly to discuss Senator \nFeingold's concern. There is a different point of view. A U.S. citizen \nin Europe is, in fact, covered. A U.S. citizen in Europe, the \nminimization under certain specific laws, not FISA, but precisely 12333 \npoint something, which I cannot remember at the present time, comes \ninto play. That U.S. citizen is subject to a warrant from the court.\n  This is a temporary bill. It is to fill a gap. The court has done \nsomething which has said that what has existed for decades with respect \nto the collection of foreign intelligence now cannot exist under the \npresent law, and we need to change that law.\n  It is my intention to vote for both bills. The reason I will vote for \nboth bills is to see that some bill acquires the 60 votes to get passed \ntonight. We are going out of session. There is no time. I think this is \nunfortunate. I received the Democratic bill about 20 minutes ago. I \nwent into the leader's office, tried to sit down and get briefed. Up to \nthis point I still don't understand it. I spent all afternoon on the \nMcConnell bill. I am just beginning to understand the subtleties in it \nand the other laws that come into play.\n  This is not going to be an easy vote for anyone. But what we have to \nthink of right now is, on a temporary basis, how do we best protect the \npeople of the United States against a terrible attack.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know Members are working in good faith \nto try and resolve this controversy. I decided to go directly to the \nsource, the Director of National Intelligence, right off the floor here \ntonight monitoring the debates. I asked him what the difference was \nbetween the Rockefeller-Levin proposal and the Bond-McConnell proposal. \nHe said to me the Rockefeller-Levin proposal has, in his view, \nunrealistic timelines. It creates situations of delay, and it creates \nother structural problems with regard to monitoring foreign-to-foreign \ncommunications which should not be the subject of lengthy court \nproceedings that are otherwise necessary to monitor domestic \ncommunications. The Director of National Intelligence, who is \nnonpartisan, an individual experienced in military matters and \nintelligence-gathering matters--I don't know any better source to go to \nwho would give me an objective rendition of the differences between \nthese two bills.\n  I hope colleagues will support the McConnell-Bond alternative as one \nthat would be superior to the Rockefeller-Levin proposal and one more \nlikely to protect the American people against terrorist attacks by \nthose who want to do us harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. All right. Mr. President, first, I want to make a point \nclear. I had referred earlier to comments made by my good friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who thought the \nbill they introduced was a bill that Admiral McConnell had supported. \nAdmiral McConnell has just released a statement saying that he \nappreciates the efforts to address critical gaps in our current \nintelligence capabilities: I cannot support the proposal. It creates \nsignificant uncertainty in an area where certainty is paramount in \norder to protect the country. I must have certainty\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\nin order to protect the Nation from attacks that are being planned \ntoday to inflict mass casualties.\n  Really, there are a number of problems with the bill that has been \npresented on the other side. But the main problem is it says you do not \nneed a court order to collect on communications between persons who are \nnot located within the United States, and the rest of the collections \nare required to have a court order.\n  Now, this morning, I read on the Senate floor a declassified summary \nof an order issued by the FISA Court saying this provision, this \nstatute, FISA, must be amended because due to uncertainties and \ntechnological changes, they are spending so much time having to work on \norders for collection involving the foreign targets--foreign targets \nwhose impact on the privacy rights of Americans is minimal.\n  Why is that a problem? The problem is, you do not know--if you are \ntargeting a foreigner--whether that foreigner is going to call or \ncommunicate with another foreigner. If you do not, under the bill \nprovided by Rockefeller and Levin, you would have to get a court order. \nYou would have to get a court order if you could not prove the person \nthey were communicating with was not in the United States. And you \ncannot do that. That is an impossibility. That is an impossibility. You \ncannot have an order that tells you they are going to be foreign \ncommunications only because you do not know until you intercept the \ncommunication to where it is going.\n  Now, there are a number of other questions about the bill. I just \nhave to say the concerns that have been raised--and they are legitimate \nprivacy concerns--are addressed by minimalization procedures. Under \nwhat is called the McConnell-Bond bill--which was requested by Admiral \nMcConnell, who modified his original proposal--under that bill, if an \nAmerican citizen is caught in a communication from an al-Qaida target \nor another foreign target, then that person's participation is \nminimized. And if it is not foreign intelligence, that is completely \ndumped.\n  Under our bill, like under the previous FISA provisions, you cannot \ntarget an American citizen or a U.S. person, including people here on \ngreen cards and here in the country, without getting a court order. \nThat is what the FISA Court was set up to do--just to protect people in \nthe United States.\n  There are protections for the U.S. persons who are caught, \nincidentally, and they are minimized. Their names are not even \nidentified unless there is evidence of terrorist activities.\n  Now, the measure we have provided, the McConnell-Bond bill, S. 1927, \nis one which does meet the needs that were identified by the FISA Court \nand by Director McConnell to clear up the backlog because there is a \nhuge backlog they cannot work through. The FISA Court is overburdened. \nThey cannot work through and issue the orders because of the tremendous \namount of paperwork.\n  So we must do this now. We must do this tonight to give the \nintelligence communities the powers they need to collect information at \na time when the threat is heightened. If we do not do that, we are in \ngreat danger.\n  We have to do other things, and we will come back and revisit the \nother things, such as dealing with carrier liability and streamlining \nthe process. Those we must do. That is why we included the sunset at a \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, both bills in front of us allow \nforeign-to-foreign intelligence collection without a court order. What \nis going to surprise you is, neither bill protects an American citizen \nabroad from being collected upon. Neither bill does. That protection \ncomes in the President's Executive order.\n  What we are going to do, hopefully, is pass one of these bills \ntonight, which is a temporary measure that will get us past this \nproblem of the increased traffic that is out there and the concern of \nan attack. Then, with cool deliberation, we are going to have to \naddress the problem that is omitted in both bills.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention because of that to vote for both of \nthe bills this evening, hoping and praying that one will pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member and the \nminority leader for the introduction of this bill.\n  It looks to me, Mr. President, like we have boiled this down to a \nspecific issue of both bills saying they cover foreign-to-foreign \nsurveillance. The problem is, when NSA has its eyes and its ears out on \nthe wire, NSA does not know who an individual, who is in a foreign \ncountry, is calling--whether they are calling somebody foreign or \nwhether they are calling somebody domestically.\n  So if they know somebody is a foreign caller, it is imperative we \nprovide our intelligence gatherers with the opportunity to discover the \nconversations that are taking place between that foreign caller and \nwhomever they may be calling, if--and only if--it involves potential \nterrorist activity. And we are not going to be listening in to any \nforeign caller unless we know they are a member of al-Qaida under \ncurrent law.\n  So the clear difference in these two bills is this: The bill offered \nby Senator McConnell and Senator Bond says, very clearly, that NSA will \nhave the tools necessary to listen to any conversation from a foreign \nal-Qaida member to a callee anywhere, whether it is foreign or \ndomestic, versus the bill offered by the Democrats that may say you can \nhave a foreign-to-foreign intercept, but the problem is there is no \nclarity in the Democratic proposal as to who the callee is.\n  So it is pretty clear, if we are going to give the NSA the \nopportunity to protect Americans, we have to pass the bill of Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Bond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, to state the obvious: This is a very \ntroublesome way to legislate. We have been looking at this issue for \nmore than a year. Senator Feinstein introduced legislation, and so did \nI. And it comes down to the last minute. We have waited in the Chamber \nall day.\n  I have just talked to the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral \nMcConnell, who says only the Bond bill is acceptable for our security \ninterests. I heard it from him personally. The President is reportedly \nprepared to sign only the Bond bill.\n  I have just had a hurried conversation with the senior Senator from \nMichigan, who has handled the negotiations on the Rockefeller bill. He \nhas stipulated three points of concern which I think could be ironed \nout, Director McConnell says in the course of a couple of hours. But we \nare not having the couple of hours. Perhaps if both bills fail, we will \nbe back to try this again tomorrow.\n  But as I listened to what Senator Levin has had to say: It would be \nbetter if in one spot it said ``foreign persons''--but I believe that \nis the intent, although it is not really explicit--I think it would be \npreferable if the Attorney General was not making the certification--a \npoint I have made repeatedly--and there is an element of delay.\n  So to say it is not a perfect bill is again to state the obvious. But \nI think it is time we have to act and, therefore, I am going to support \nthe Bond bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, leaving me with 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our first goal as members of Congress is \nto protect and safeguard the American people against terrorist attacks. \nI take\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\nmy oath to do so very seriously. That is why I support reform of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As we approach the anniversary \nof September 11, this is a time for more intense vigilance. Real \nthreats to our country remain.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, every day I see how \nterrorists want to harm the American people. Terrorists still have a \npredatory intent to harm the United States. Reforming FISA today \nprovides the intelligence community the tools it needs to disrupt \nongoing terrorist operations against the United States.\n  We have two proposals to consider tonight. Both are temporary ways \nahead. Each proposal takes important steps to secure the safety of our \ncountry by reforming this important law. The Rockefeller-Levin proposal \nis desirable, while the McConnell proposal is acceptable.\n  Each proposal provides the intelligence community the key tools it \nneeds to disrupt terrorist plans and intentions, while retaining the \nlegal safeguards that protect the rights of every American.\n  These proposals are consistent with the principles that the Director \nof National Intelligence requested to improve the FISA process: enhance \nintelligence collection against terrorist operatives communicating to \neach other overseas--foreign to foreign; provide legal safeguards to \nprotect the rights of American citizens--consistent with law, a warrant \nis still required to monitor communications of American citizens inside \nthe United States--provide prospective liability protection to private-\nsector companies assisting our efforts in keeping this country safe.\n  These proposals are time limited. A more comprehensive and permanent \nsolution is necessary. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I \nwill work with my colleagues on a more comprehensive and permanent \nsolution to reforming FISA.\n  Al-Qaida continues to want to inflict damage on our country. This \nproposal gives important tools to the intelligence community to disrupt \nthe terrorists' plans and intentions, while safeguarding the rights and \ncivil liberties of American citizens.\n  When it comes to protecting America, we don't belong to a political \nparty) we belong to the red, white, and blue party. We are Americans \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I am a member of the Intelligence Committee, and like \nall Members, I take my oath to defend this country against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic, very seriously. Real threats to our country \nremain. As we approach the anniversary of September 11, this is a time \nfor more vigilance.\n  We have two proposals tonight. The Rockefeller-Levin proposal is the \nmost desirable, while the McConnell proposal is also acceptable. These \nproposals are consistent with the principles that the DNI requested to \nimprove the FISA process.\n  It enhances intel collection against terrorist operatives \ncommunicating overseas foreign to foreign. At the same time, it does \nprovide legal safeguards to protect the rights of Americans, consistent \nwith law. A warrant is still required. I think it is time to vote. I \nthink it is time to protect America.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield Senator Whitehouse 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the question we face fundamentally \nhere is, are we a nation under the rule of law? A nation of laws or a \nnation of men? We have heard wonderful things said about Admiral \nMcConnell tonight, and I share this body's admiration for Admiral \nMcConnell. But we are not here judging him, we are here judging a piece \nof legislation.\n  The piece of legislation that we are asked to judge puts exclusive \nrights in the Presidency to determine what gets collected against \nAmericans overseas and what gets collected against Americans in this \ncountry who have communications from overseas that are intercepted. And \nit allows that determination to be made, as was just said, pursuant to \na Presidential Executive order.\n  We are a nation of separated powers. We established the FISA Court to \nhave this authority. The court should oversee those processes. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time on this side to \nthe distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is one thing I think virtually \neverybody in the room will agree with, and that is that we can't leave \nhere without a bill signed into law by the President of the United \nStates. There is only one of these proposals before us that he will \nsign. He indicated earlier today that he will only sign a bill that \nAdmiral McConnell, whom we all profess to greatly respect, believes \nwill get the job done, at least for the next 6 months. There is one \nproposal which does that, and only one.\n  So if we don't want to be back here tomorrow and next week still \ndealing with this problem--and I think we certainly agree we cannot \nleave town without addressing it--there is only one way to get a \nPresidential signature, and that is for the Bond-McConnell proposal, \nupon which we will vote in a moment, to get 60 votes. That is the only \nway to get the job done. There may be merit in both proposals, but that \nis not the way Admiral McConnell sees it. He enjoys widespread respect \nthroughout this body. If we want to get the job done and get the \nPresident's signature, the Bond-McConnell proposal is the one that \nshould be supported.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back any remaining time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is there any time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). There is no time remaining.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. \nHarkin), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), and the Senator from Washington (Mrs. \nMurray), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Harkin) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Lott), the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar), and the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) would have voted \n``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota is here. I \nwill yield to her if she wishes to proceed first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I think everyone in this Chamber and \nthe country and the world is aware of the tragedy that befell our State \na few days ago. This is a bridge that is not just in my backyard, it is \nactually in my front yard. It is only 8 blocks away. It is one of the \nmost well-traveled bridges in our State.\n  Senator Coleman and I were on the ground and saw the great damage \nyesterday. When I looked down and saw that miracle bus on the precipice \nand I thought about the fear in the eyes of those little children as \nthey watched as the concrete and the road basically fell down below \nthem, I couldn't even imagine what they went through.\n  But then I met the heroes, the people who dove in the water over and \nover again looking for survivors. The death toll would have been so \nmuch worse if our community had not come together--the police, fire \npersonnel, emergency personnel, and ordinary citizens--to save the \nlives of our people.\n  Today we thank our colleagues because it is good news that they stood \nby us in a bipartisan way to help the people of our State. The vote is \ngood news at the close of a week that has brought so much heartbreak to \nour State. This was, as I said, the most heavily traveled bridge in our \nState, and our people and our businesses depend on it.\n  Today in the Senate, as well as in the House of Representatives, the \nCongress voted to give us the opportunity to access the funds we are \ngoing to need to repair this bridge.\n  There was also a focus on transit money, which is so important. The \nday we got into Minnesota, only 12 hours after this happened, our State \nhad already put on 25 extra buses. They had billboards showing people \nthe routes to go. It was an absolutely extraordinary effort. They were \nprepared. But I don't think anyone, in any State, can ever be prepared \nfor a tragedy such as this.\n  I thank all my colleagues at the close of a very long week for their \nwords of support. Our thoughts and our prayers are with the victims and \nwith their families. Today, the Congress stood tall and proud and came \nimmediately to their aid.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota has described \nthe spirit of a people confronted with great tragedy. It was horrible \nto be there by that bridge and see those cars, some in the water, \nothers that had burst on fire--a tractor trailer--to see a school bus \non the precipice. I think it had dropped 20 feet. Had it gone a little \nfurther to the side, it would gone over the edge. Had it gone a little \nfurther forward, it would have been caught between crashing portions of \nsteel and concrete. Had it gone another distance, it would have been in \nthe water. Yet every one of those 60 kids walked away.\n  We saw tragedy. There are those who have lost their lives and \nsuffered great pain, but we also saw miracles. We saw the reaction of a \ncommunity that came together at every level--the first responders, the \ncitizens who came together to jump in the water to try and help folks \nwho were in situations that were hard to understand.\n  In addition to that, when Senator Klobuchar and I got there early in \nthe morning, we sat in on a briefing with the Governor and the mayor \nand the first responders, the county commissioners, city council \nmembers--some Democrats, some Republicans. It didn't matter.\n  I sat there as a former mayor remembering what it was like on 9/11, \nremembering how unprepared we were on 9/11. And after 9/11, as a city, \nwe tried to take stock and recognize that our first responders weren't \ntied into what was going on at hospitals, and various police and fire \nfrom different communities could not communicate. What we did is we \nwent about the process of training and training and training, preparing \nand preparing and preparing, and it came together. I watched in the \ncity of Minneapolis, and as a former mayor I took pride in the way the \npeople responded.\n  I think the Nation saw it, I think the world saw it, and it made me \nproud to represent Minnesota.\n  I say that because I saw the same spirit in the Senate tonight. The \npeople in Minneapolis have some great needs. My colleague in the House, \nCongressman Oberstar, put forth a plan that would provide authorization \nto rebuild the bridge. There was also provided some extra money on the \ntable to deal with some very immediate needs.\n  I was there when the Secretary of Transportation made the pledge that \n``we are going to be there to help,'' and we had some challenges then \nin moving that forward. There were some technical issues. But what I \nfound along the way was my colleagues on both sides of the aisle simply \nsaid, how can we help? How can we get this done? The chairman of the \nBudget Committee a little while ago discovered there was one minor \ntechnical issue. He said, we are going to take care of this.\n  I got a call today from the director of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Administrator. I got a call yesterday from the head of the \nSBA. At the scene yesterday we had the head of the Transportation \nSafety Board. We had the Secretary of Transportation, the highway \nadministrator. They were all there. Everyone had come together. And on \nthe floor of the Senate I saw that tonight, that spirit, and I simply \nsay thank you to my colleagues. On behalf of the people of Minnesota \nand the\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\npeople of Minneapolis, I say thank you for the support you have shown \nand the spirit in which you have come together.\n  At times, there is so much rancor in our Nation today--this partisan \ndivide. It is so uplifting to be in this Chamber to see my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle come together, and so I say thank you.\n  Let me end by asking that we not forget there has been a great \ntragedy; that lives have been lost. Let us keep the families of those \nwho have lost loved ones in our prayers. Let us make sure we continue \nin the effort to ensure that the resources are there to rebuild, and \nlet us do it quickly. Let us do those things to expedite the process. \nThis is a major thoroughfare, a major piece of the transportation \nsystem in the State of Minnesota. We need to get the money back to \nMinnesota and get the people on the ground who can get the work done.\n  We can do it, and we can do it quickly. We will rebuild this bridge, \nwe will rebuild quickly, we will find out what caused this terrible, \nterrible tragedy, and we will keep those who have suffered loss in our \nprayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n\n         Extension of Temporary Protective Status for Liberians\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me first begin by commending Senators \nColeman and Klobuchar for their very aggressive and appropriate \nresponse to a crisis in their home State of Minnesota. We were proud, \nall of us, to join with the Senators in helping their people in the \nface of great need.\n  This is interesting, because I rise for the moment to speak about \nanother measure which both Senator Coleman and Senator Klobuchar have \njoined with me as cosponsors of, and that is the temporary protective \nstatus for Liberians. The Presiding Officer, Senator Whitehouse, is \nalso a cosponsor, along with Senators Kerry and Leahy. It is a \nbipartisan measure. It is in response to a situation where there are \nthousands of Liberians here legally, but they are in danger of being \ndeported because their status could change by October 1.\n  The House of Representatives earlier this week passed unanimously by \nvoice vote H.R. 3123, which would extend for 1 year their temporary \nprotected status. In fact, the minority leader, Mr. Blunt, was the key \nleader in this effort, along with our colleague from Rhode Island, \nCongressman Patrick Kennedy, and I again thank Senators Coleman and \nKlobuchar, and all the cosponsors.\n  The Liberian individuals we are talking about were in the United \nStates in the late 1980s and early 1990s when a brutal civil war broke \nout in Liberia. They could not go home, and this country granted them \nprotective status. That status, in one form or another, has been \ncontinued for now almost 15, 16 years. There are many families of \nLiberians in this country whose children are American citizens--in \nfact, who are about on the verge of college or even older.\n\n  Today, Liberia has made some progress. It has a democratically \nelected president. She is a remarkable woman, leading her nation. But, \nstill, it is not a country that is ready to accept individuals who are \nin the United States, who are part of our community, who have American \nchildren, and who are contributing to our communities. We should, I \nthink, give them the opportunity to make a choice of whether they \nshould stay here or go back to their homeland of Liberia.\n  Every year they face a precipice that comes on October 1, when they \nworry whether their status will be extended; when they worry whether \nthey will have to leave children behind, give up their jobs, leave \ntheir community and be lifted up, literally, to go back to a country \nwhich is, quite frankly, not ready to accept them and to use their \ntalents. So each year we have been able to, either through \nadministrative decision or through our efforts here, extend their stay. \nI urge that my colleagues consider taking up H.R. 3123, and I requested \non behalf of my cosponsors a unanimous consent to do that. I am told \nthat on the Democratic side there were no objections, but, apparently, \nthere are some objections on the other side. I want to make it clear to \nall my colleagues I will renew this request time and time again when we \nreturn in September.\n  We have to act before October 1. It would be unfair, unjust, and \nunwise not to grant this exemption. It was accepted on a bipartisan \nbasis overwhelmingly in the other body, and I think we should do the \nsame here in the Senate. I urge any of my colleagues who have \nquestions--and I think at this juncture there are many who might have \nlegitimate questions--please, I would be happy to answer them. I would \nbe happy to respond. I believe I can make a compelling case that in \nterms of fairness, in terms of equity, in terms of recognizing what \nthese individuals have done to contribute to communities all across \nthis country, they should be granted at least 1 more year. This is not \na permanent adjustment, this is an additional year.\n  Let me stress one thing also. We have had a great deal of discussion \nin this Congress about immigration. These individuals are legally here \nin the United States, and they have been given the opportunity to work, \nthey pay taxes, and they are not qualified for any social benefits. I \nam very proud of Rhode Island because we have a large community, \nrelatively speaking, and they have become extraordinarily productive \nmembers of our community. So I feel very strongly, and I know my \ncolleague, the Presiding Officer, does, that we are going to do all we \ncan over the several weeks before October 1 to make sure this is \nadopted; that we follow the other body in doing so. I don't want anyone \nto mistake my objection to other provisions that are going forward. I \nam sincerely committed to getting this done. I hope we get it done, and \nI thank the Presiding Officer for his cosponsorship and leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island has been so \npersuasive in his argument, I ask that he add me as a cosponsor to the \nbill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10874-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10874-S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

For \nnearly 2 years, the Senator from Nebraska and I, Senator Hagel, have \nbeen working on this bill, along with the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, Felix Rohatyn, who has been very involved in the \nissues of New York City, and our former Senate colleagues Warren Rudman \nand Bob Kerrey.\n  The numbers are staggering. There are some 160,000 bridges of the \n900,000 in our country that are deficient, to put it mildly. We saw \nwhat happened in Minnesota. There are 614 transit systems in deep need \nof repair. One-third of all our highways are in need of significant \nrepair and improvement. The water systems and wastewater systems in the \nUnited States are, on average, almost 100 years old. Clearly, the \nability of our appropriations process to maintain the needed \ninfrastructure for our country is inadequate. We all know that. So we \nhave spent time over the last 2, 2\\1/2\\ years working with people on \nWall Street and others to come up with ideas on how we might attract \ncapital to the area of infrastructure development.\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\n  Ironically, we had talked about delaying this announcement until \nSeptember, but at the suggestion of Senator Hagel, we decided Wednesday \nmorning to make the announcement before we left for the August break. I \nthink we had four members of the press in the gallery to cover the \ninitial announcement of this year-and-a-half long effort. And of course \nby 5 or 6 o'clock that afternoon, we had heard the news of what \nhappened in Minneapolis, which heightened the country's awareness of a \nproblem that was well-known to those of us looking into this over the \nyears.\n  This should never have happened in the United States. We have been \nsuccessful over the years because we have understood the relationship \nof strong infrastructure systems, wastewater treatment systems, \nhighways, bridges, and transit systems, to our ability to grow \neconomically. Of course, some of the major efforts that have increased \nthe prosperity of our country have been big ideas in infrastructure. \nCertainly the interstate highway system, under Dwight Eisenhower, is a \nclassic example of a project that dramatically improved the economy of \nour Nation more than 50 years ago.\n  At any rate, there are a number of examples, and I hope my colleagues \nwill look at this critically important legislation we have presented \nfor their consideration. We look forward to further examining how \nbetter to deal with the large problems facing us when we reconvene this \nfall. As many of my colleagues may know, a $1 billion investment, \nwhether public or private money, would generate as many as 40,000 jobs. \nSo, in addition to addressing major deficiencies in our infrastructure, \nit will also spur economic development and provide needed work for \nthose in the construction fields and trades.\n  Again, this is an important issue, and one that is unfortunately \nreceiving more attention than it would otherwise, except for the \ntragedy in Minnesota. In my home State of Connecticut, we went through \na similar tragedy, as my colleague from Rhode Island may recall, on \nRoute 95 along the Mianus River, the corridor running through his State \nand mine, down to Florida. A whole section of that road in western \nConnecticut collapsed. Four people lost their lives on that day when \nthe Mianus River bridge fell. So we relate to and understand what has \nhappened in Minnesota.\n  Again, our invitation is to take a look at this. It is an idea, a big \nidea, a large idea, creatively financed to be able to do something \nserious about this growing problem. It is a problem we are going to be \nhearing more and more about if we fail to take the necessary steps to \nimprove this infrastructure. We must work to construct what needs to be \nconstructed and put our feet back on the ground.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I am going to make some unanimous consent requests here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10875-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 327\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, 7 months ago I opened this session by \nreminding myself and my colleagues that\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\nthe work we do and the way we do it will be judged not only by the \nvoters but by history.\n  Future generations are not likely to remember our names, but they \nwill inherit the laws that we pass, the problems we ignore, and the \nsolutions we leave behind. So I rise tonight to take stock of how we \nhave done, to offer an honest assessment of our work, and to propose a \ncourse of correction.\n  When the gavel fell in January, a new party had taken over. It had a \nsimple six-point plan of action involving a list of items that were \nthought to have popular support. As the majority whip put it last fall, \nDemocrats did not want to overpromise, so they came up with a list that \nwas concise, understandable, and attainable.\n  He added that if the Democrats were fortunate enough to win the \nmajority, they would be judged primarily on their ability to deliver on \nthose six legislative goals. So by the majority's own standard, our \nreport card should begin with a so-called 6 for '06. They have had more \nthan a half a year to enact them, and so it is fair to ask: How have \nthey done?\n  We started with lobby reform. As an early gesture of the \nbipartisanship I hoped would mark this session, I cosponsored the bill \nalong with the majority leader. But less than 2 weeks into the session, \nthe majority decided to cut off debate. It forced an early vote on an \nunfinished bill, and it failed. After Republicans were allowed to add a \nvital amendment that protected the grassroots organizations from \nburdensome oversight, we voted again, and the bill passed easily 96 to \n2.\n  Minimum wage was next. Republicans supported an increase that \nincluded tax relief for the business owners who would have to pay for \nit. At first the majority balked. They wanted a bill without any tax \nrelief, without any Republican input. It failed. But when they finally \nagreed to cooperate by including tax relief for small businesses, the \nbill sailed through by a vote of 94 to 3. Four weeks, two \naccomplishments, a good start.\n  Then we turned to the 9/11 bill, and here the tide began to turn. \nRepublicans supported this bill from the start. We saw it as a welcome \nopportunity to strengthen security, but the majority rejected our \nefforts to improve it with amendments, and then weakened the bill by \ninserting a dangerous provision at the insistence of their labor union \nsupporters.\n  They wanted to give airport security workers at U.S. airports veto \npower over the Government's rapid response plan to a terrorist attack. \nIt was an absurd request.\n  Congress rejected a similar provision 5 years earlier on the grounds \nthat it threatened national security. The President promised to veto it \nthis time around as well. The bill ended up passing the Senate, and the \nprovision was ultimately stripped in conference. But by refusing input \nat the start, both parties would have to wait until just last week to \nfinish this important bill, and the centerpiece of the Democratic plan \nfor improving national security would sit on the shelf literally for \nmonths.\n  Now, there is a pattern here. When the majority has agreed to let \nRepublicans participate and shape legislation, we have achieved good \nbipartisan results. When they have blocked that cooperation, they have \nfailed. But just like a fly that keeps slamming its head into the same \nwindowpane trying to get outside, the Democratic majority has spent \nmost of the year since those small, early gestures at cooperation \ntrying and failing to advance its agenda by insisting on the path of \npolitical advantage.\n  The problem took root early on. Soon after the 9/11 bill came the \nfirst attempt to set a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. \nOur Democratic friends knew it had no chance of passing the Senate, let \nalone being signed into law.\n  Two weeks earlier, they had forced a vote on the Petraeus plan for \nsecuring Baghdad and lost. The President had made clear his opposition \nto timelines, and Republicans insisted that Congress should not be in \nthe business of literally micromanaging a war.\n  Yet our friends on the other side persisted anyway, and the first \ntimeline vote failed. It was followed by 14 more political messaging \nvotes on the war, votes that promised to have no practical impact on \nour military conduct. The Senate would spend 2 months debating \nlegislation that in every case was bound to fail. For the entire spring \nand summer, the majority insisted on political votes, culminating in \nthe theatrical crescendo of an all-night debate that even Democrats \nadmitted was a stunt.\n  What seems to have happened here is that at some point in February, \nafter the minimum wage vote, the political left put a hand on the \nsteering wheel, and the unfortunate result was that nearly 5 months \nwould pass before a single item on the 6 for '06 agenda would become \nlaw, and even that had to be tacked on to a must-pass emergency \nspending bill that the Democrats had been slow-rolling for months.\n\n  Now it was during those early months that an alternative, harder \nedged, 6 for '06 agenda seemed to emerge. Indeed, the biggest Senate \nfights this year have not been over the original 6 for '06 at all. They \nrevolved around the policy proposals of the far left. Fortunately, \nRepublicans have held together to keep these bad ideas from becoming \nlaw.\n  For example, they wanted to eliminate secret ballot elections from \nunion drives. They wanted to spend valuable floor time on a nonbinding \nresolution about the Attorney General, despite weeks of print and \ntelevision interviews on the topic already.\n  They wanted to revive the so-called fairness doctrine, a kind of \nFederal speech code that was abolished more than two decades ago \nbecause it violates the first amendment. They even proposed closing the \nterrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and sending the inmates \nto the States.\n  Then there were the politically motivated investigations which, \nbetween the House and Senate, break down to about six hearings a day \nsince the first day of the session. Some seemed to see a plot being \nhatched behind every filing cabinet in Washington. Others seem ready to \nhold a White House sofa in contempt for bad fabric. And, of course, \nthere was the endless political grandstanding on Iraq that I have \nalready mentioned.\n  Now, predictably, this alternative agenda went nowhere. In the effort \nto get both, they ended up with neither. Editorial writers started to \ngrumble about the lack of achievement. The public took note, too, \nsending the new Congress's approval ratings to new subterranean lows.\n  The lesson that emerged was clear. Politics yields headlines; \ncooperation yields results.\n  Republicans warned the other side about the consequences of \nunilateralism early on. We argued for months that the majority had been \nengaged in a months-long power play by invoking cloture with \nastonishing frequency. My staff commissioned a CRS study on the issue \nand found that the majority was on pace to shatter the record for \ncloture filings in a single Congress.\n  Yet the cloture stories that started to appear argued that record \ncloture filings were somehow the fault of the Republicans, as if we had \nforced the majority to try to cut off debate. This was classic spin, as \nanyone who has been in the Senate for more than a week will tell you. \nThe majority knows that more than 40 cloture votes in 6 months is not a \nsign of minority obstruction. It is a sign of a majority that does not \nlike the rules.\n  The opportunity costs of this failed strategy have been immense. \nBecause it has refused to cooperate with the other side, the majority \nhasn't brought a single piece of legislation to the floor that would \nreduce the income tax burden on working Americans. The Senate has not \ndone a thing to address entitlements, despite a looming financial \ncatastrophe. It has done nothing to address the rising cost of health \ncare. Only 1 appropriations bill out of 12 has passed the Senate, and \nnone has been signed into law.\n  On the first day of the session, the majority whip said the American \npeople had put Democrats in the majority to find solutions, not to play \nto a draw with nothing to show for it. Yet at times over the last 7 \nmonths those words have seemed quaint. The Democratic majority had the \nright idea early on. It made an early mistake, in my opinion, by \nsuccumbing to a round-the-clock political campaign. As any sailor \nknows, a small deviation at the\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\nstart takes you far off course over time.\n\n  Over the last week, we have seen some conspicuous signs of bipartisan \ncooperation, including tonight, when the majority chose the road of \ncooperation to fix a gap in our national intelligence before we left \nfor the August recess. Americans are grateful to the majority for \njoining us on this critical issue. Under the leadership of my friend \nthe majority leader, Congress has acted on the sound principle that \ncooperation is a better recipe for success than confrontation and \npolitical theater. All of us should be glad about that.\n  We have seen that we can accomplish good things by working together \nand cooperating on legislation that Americans support. Politics \ncertainly has its place, but it doesn't steer this ship, at least it \nshouldn't. There is simply too much to be done, and we have seen the \nresults when it does.\n  So I would not offer a grade for this Congress. Others have already \ndone that. But I will say that at the beginning of this session, I \nstaked my party to a pledge: When faced with an urgent issue, we would \nact. When faced with a problem, we would seek solutions, not mere \npolitical advantage. That pledge still stands. We have seen what we can \ndo. We have actually seen it tonight. And we have reason to hope we \nwill see it still.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10877-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week the Iraqi people celebrated a very \nrare triumph, they won a soccer game. But their celebration had nothing \nto do with decreased violence, improved distribution of water, \nelectricity or other basic necessities or, of course, political \nreconciliation. It was a soccer game. Iraqis were celebrating their \nvictory in the Asian Cup soccer championship, as well they should. But \neven during this rare moment of joy, political realities could not be \nignored. After his game-winning shot, team captain Younis Mahmoud told \nreporters he would not be returning to his home country, and he hoped \nthat the American forces would leave Iraq quickly.\n  The setting, a great victory for the Iraqi soccer team. Their hero, \ntheir captain, says: I am not going home. I am not returning to Iraq, \nand I want the Americans out.\n  His words reflect the overwhelming sentiment of the Iraqi people \nwhose hopes he carried on his shoulders. A recent poll showed that 70 \npercent of Iraqis think American forces make them less safe.\n  President Bush said 2 weeks ago, the war in Iraq has invited guests, \nand we would leave if asked. They are asking, we are not going.\n  Yesterday was a day without water in Baghdad. It was 115 degrees. \nThere was no water because there was insufficient electric generation \nfor water filtration and distribution of water. This was the sixth day \nin a row with virtually no water in the capital city, this huge \nmetropolitan area, no water. People are drinking water when they can, \nbut it is contaminated, and they are getting sick. Four dead American \nsoldiers yesterday.\n  Meanwhile new evidence emerges by the day. Prime Minister al-Maliki \nis utterly failing to achieve the political reconciliation the country \nso desperately needs. Even worse, there is no evidence he is even \ntrying.\n  Next month the administration will deliver a progress report on Iraq \nto us, the Congress of the United States. We, of course, will take that \nreport seriously, but it has been clear for some time that this war and \nPresident Bush's troop escalation is a tragic failure. General \nPetraeus, whom we hear so much about, has said time and time again, the \nwar cannot be won militarily. Many of our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have said for months that September would be the turning \npoint, that in September, if meaningful progress has not been made, \nthey will finally work with us to reach a responsible end to the war.\n  When we come back in September, the eyes of the world will be on \nthose Republicans who made September their month to draw a line in the \nsand. I hope they would back their words up with action. Democrats have \ndone everything we can do. All Democrats, we have done everything we \ncan do. We need some help from the Republicans to change the course of \nthat intractable civil war, costing the American people about $350 to \n$360 million every day. We need to finally take a stand together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to deliver a responsible end to the war that \nthe American people demand and deserve and turn our military focus to \nthe grave and growing threats we face throughout the world that have \nbeen ignored by this administration for far too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10877-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10877-S10878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the distinguished Republican \nleader, came to the floor, talked about a number of things tonight. I \nwish to approach things in a little different direction. I wish to talk \nabout what we have accomplished in these short 7 months. We have worked \nhard. We have worked long, hard hours, something that hasn't been done \nfor a long time in this body. Let's talk about the bills we have sent \nto the President of the United States that we have passed.\n  Minimum wage. We hear a lot about minimum wage, but minimum wage is \nnot for kids flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. Sixty percent of the \npeople who draw the minimum wage are women. For over half those women, \nthat is the only money they get for themselves and their families.\n  I am glad we passed the minimum wage. After 10 years, we have given \nthis legislation the attention it deserves. It is an issue that deals \nwith women. It does. But also it is an issue that deals with people of \ncolor. The majority of the people who draw the minimum wage are people \nof color. We did the right thing. It is important legislation, and it \nis now the law.\n  A short time ago, we finished a vote on terrorism. On 9/11, it was an \nact of terror that killed over 3,000 Americans. President Bush went to \nGround Zero on a number of occasions, but it was thought we should take \na look at what really happened on 9/11. What could we do to better \nprepare for similar attacks? What went wrong? Why weren't we prepared?\n  So we asked--we Democrats asked--for months and months--that went \nwell into more than 2 years--why don't we have an investigation to find \nout what went wrong? This was fought by the President. Finally, after \nan outcry from the survivors of the 9/11 victims and people all over \nthis country, we were able to get a bipartisan commission to study 9/\n11. Even though the President opposed it, we finally were able to get \nthis done.\n  They recommended we do certain things to make us safer. They made \ntheir recommendations, sent them to the White House, sent them to \nCongress, and we begged the President to implement these \nrecommendations. They were not implemented. The 9/11 Commissioners came \nback and graded the President on how he had done--Fs and Ds on \neverything.\n  This Congress, in these short 7 months, has passed legislation that \nimplements the 9/11 Commission recommendations. There was a signing \nceremony today at the White House. That is now the law. It is going to \nmake our country much safer. The problem is, it is 3 years behind \nschedule.\n  We, as Democrats, recognize we had elections last November. There was \ntremendous turnover. People never believed Democrats would take control \nof the Senate. There was some talk they would take over the House. The \nSenate was never thought to be a body that we would take over. We did.\n  Why did we take over the Senate? We have nine new Democratic \nSenators, one of whom is presiding over the Senate tonight. Those nine \nDemocratic Senators campaigned on a number of issues. But the one issue \nthey campaigned on all over this country is to do something about the \nculture of corruption in Washington.\n  Why were the nine new Democrats concerned? For the first time in 131 \nyears, someone working in the White House was indicted. Scooter Libby \nhas\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nnow been convicted and pardoned by the President. Mr. Safavian was \nappointed by the President to take care of Government contracts. He was \na dishonest man. He had sweetheart deals with other people, including \nJack Abramoff. He was led away from his office in handcuffs and is now \nin prison.\n  In the House of Representatives--controlled by the Republicans--the \nformer majority leader of the House of Representatives was convicted \nthree times of ethics violations. They changed the rules for him. He \nwas indicted twice in Texas for crimes. Those are still going forward. \nA number of Members of the House of Representatives are now in jail; \nHouse staff in jail.\n  The K Street Project. What was the K Street Project? What it was: If \nyou were a lobbyist downtown, you had to do what DeLay and the boys in \nthe House wanted you to do or you could not get a job down there. They \nhad to approve who was hired on K Street. That is what we call the \n``lobbyist fiefdom.''\n  So there was a reason the nine new Democratic Senators wanted us to \nmove forward quickly on ethics and lobbying reform. S. 1, the first \nbill we did--the most important bill is listed No. 1--was ethics and \nlobbying reform; and we passed it. It has been passed. It is the most \nsweeping ethics and lobbying reform in the history of our country.\n  I have said publicly, I say again in front of one of the nine new \nDemocratic Senators, thank you for bringing to Washington a new \nculture. Yesterday, when that passed, we are in that new culture now.\n  We have sent to the President benchmarks to measure progress in Iraq. \nWe sent to the President and funded mine-resistant combat vehicles. We \nsent to the President legislation giving the National Guard the \nequipment they need. The President went to the gulf--Katrina--and \nlooked at it 22 times, I am told. But he would not give them any money. \nWe forced the President to take what we wanted to give him in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill--$7 billion. And we got that to the \ngulf victims.\n  We got disaster relief for small businesses and farms--3 years \noverdue. Wildfires are burning in the West as we speak. In Nevada, last \nweek, we had 20 fires burning at the same time. We have one fire we \nshare with the State of Idaho that is approaching a million acres \nburning. We got wildfire relief.\n\n  We were able to pass a law preserving the U.S. attorneys' \nindependence. Why did we do it? Well, they were firing U.S. attorneys. \nThe Presiding Officer was a U.S. attorney. There is an old saying in \nthe law: What are you trying to do, make a Federal case out of it? Why \ndid we say that? Because U.S. attorneys make cases you cannot beat most \nof the time.\n  But these U.S. attorneys, under this administration--under this \ncorrupt administration--had to do what this administration wanted them \nto do or they had to go look for a new job. We do not know the full \nextent of what U.S. attorneys did because of political pressure from \nKarl Rove and others at the White House. I do not know if we will ever \nknow. We know some of it.\n  What else have we passed? A pay raise for our troops, making college \neducation more affordable. We passed in our reconciliation bill the \nmost significant change in college education since the GI Bill of \nRights. We passed CAFE standards, raising the fuel efficiency of \nvehicles for the first time in 25 years.\n  We passed, recently--first of all, in the supplemental appropriations \nbill, we funded SCHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, until \nthe 1st of October. And here, yesterday, we passed health insurance for \nchildren. The Wounded Warriors legislation passed; a balanced budget \nwith pay as you go. What does that mean? We passed a budget. The \nRepublicans, for 3 years they had a majority of 55 to 45, and they \ncould not pass a budget. We did it with a majority of 1--50 to 49. It \nis balanced, it is pay as you go. The Republicans, in the past, ran up \nthese astronomical debts for our country, and did it with red ink.\n  We do not do that. We gave middle-class tax cuts, extended the child \ntax cut, gave tax relief for small businesses, funded women's health. \nWe expanded eligibility for Head Start.\n  We had 94 hearings addressing the conduct of the war, and it is so \nimportant we have done that. As a result, we were able to take a look \nat the scandals that took place at Walter Reed, where our veterans were \nbeing neglected. We have things in progress we have passed and are \nwaiting for conference reports to come back.\n  We are going to try--we tried to pass it tonight. There was an \nobjection to reauthorizing the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, WRDA, \nWater Resources Development Act. We passed the competitive legislation \nthat some say is some of the most important legislation passed in this \nbody in decades, making this country more competitive educationally and \nin the business world.\n  The President has vetoed important legislation--stem cell research. \nGiving hope to millions of Americans has been vetoed by the President. \nThe President vetoed timelines for bringing our troops home from Iraq.\n  And then, of course, we had a number of things blocked by \nobstructionism of the Republicans--lower priced prescription drugs. We \nwere prevented from being able to vote because we could not get 60 \nvotes, with the obstructionism of the Republicans on the ability of \nMedicare to negotiate for lower priced drugs. Insurance companies can \ndo it, HMOs can do it but not Medicare. That is wrong, and we have been \nblocked from doing that.\n  We were even stopped from doing an Intelligence authorization bill. \nIt is hard to comprehend, but that is true. This country is at war with \nthe terrorists, but they have prevented us from doing an Intelligence \nauthorization bill; there are a number of agencies in this country that \nhandle our intelligence, our spying, and they stopped us from updating \nwhat they need to be able to do.\n  They twice filibustered antisurge legislation in Iraq, forced 45 \ncloture votes.\n  So, Mr. President, we have had a very productive 7 months. I hope we \ncan come back and do more. I have been very happy with the last month \nor so. It appears bipartisanship is breaking out all over. I hope that \ncan continue. As I said yesterday, when we do something good, there is \na lot of credit to go around. When we do not do anything, there is a \nlot of blame to go around.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10878-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THANKING STAFF\n\n  Mr. REID.

Hazel will retire on August 3 from the \nSenate after 28 years of faithful and successful service.\n  For a staff member, Hazel has the unusual distinction of having \nserved everyone in the Senate--Members, officers, staff, the Capitol \nPolice and the Architect of the Capitol, and all their constituencies \nfrom her office in the Sergeant-at-Arms Printing, Graphics and Direct \nMail, PG, branch. In her role as manager of that department, Hazel \nhas supported the people and processes which yield the many excellent \nprinted products we rely on to inform, persuade and delight. Franked \nmail, floor charts, posters, the beautiful ``Welcome to Washington'' \nbooks we give to visitors, photocopying, and flag packaging are a few \nmajor services provided by Hazel's department, and there are many more. \nThe extremely high quality of PG products testifies to Hazel's \ndevotion to excellence, to the Senate, and to the employees who work \nwith her.\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\n  Communication with each other and with our constituents is elemental \nto Senate business and Hazel's group is an essential communication hub \nhere. They are our partners in governance and under Hazel's leadership \nhave performed admirably. We thank Hazel for her leadership and wish \nher a healthy and happy retirement.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to join the majority leader and \nassociate myself with his remarks regarding the contributions of Hazel \nGetty to the operation of the U.S. Senate. Hazel has overseen a \nremarkable advance in the technological capabilities of the Sergeant at \nArms' Printing, Graphics and Direct Mail branch. We will all miss \nHazel's excellent leadership and gentle nature. We wish her all the \nbest in this next chapter of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPLAUDING EDMONSON COUNTY, KENTUCKY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the patriotism \nand service of the residents of Edmonson County in my home State of \nKentucky. Earlier this week, the local Bowling Green, KY, newspaper, \nthe Daily News, published an article entitled ``Edmonson Leads U.S. in \nArmy Recruitment.'' Edmonson County, located in the central part of the \nState, has the highest percentage of Army recruits in the country--\nquite an accomplishment, and a wonderful symbol of patriotism and sense \nof service that is evident not just in Edmonson County, but throughout \nthe Commonwealth. According to the Army, Edmonson County ``produced the \nmost enlistments for the Regular Army, Non-Prior Service'' as compared \nto the total national population of 15-24 year olds.\n  Kentucky has a proud military heritage. The Bluegrass State is home \nto widely recognized military installations such as Fort Knox and Fort \nCampbell. Our Guard and Reserve units continue to proudly serve on the \nfront lines of the global war on terror. The people of Edmonson County \nare carrying on Kentucky's longstanding history of service and are \nproving their dedication and support as the United States continues to \nfight the terrorism. I am proud to represent such loyal and selfless \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the entire Senate join me in expressing \ngreat admiration and gratitude to the people of Edmonson County, KY, \nfor their patriotism and service. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle from the Daily News be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Bowling Green Daily News, July 29, 2007]\n\n                Edmonson Leads U.S. in Army Recruitment\n\n                         (By Ameerah Cetawayo)\n\n       Edmonson County, the home of nationally known Mammoth Cave \n     National Park, made headlines recently for another reason--\n     having the highest percentage of Army recruits in the \n     country.\n       For every 1,000 young people in the county, about 11 of \n     them decided to join the military in 2006.\n       For a county of about 12,000 people, the statistics magnify \n     patriotic values, as well as the notion that more people from \n     Edmonson County are leaving for Bowling Green and surrounding \n     areas, according to leaders in the educational and business \n     community.\n       According to military data analyzed by the National \n     Priorities Project, a nonprofit research organization, \n     Kentucky ranked 27th in the nation for the percentage of Army \n     recruits.\n       The Army recruited 990 people from the commonwealth last \n     year, about a 3 percent increase from 2005, according to NPP.\n       Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Defense said the \n     Army failed to meet its goal of 8,400 recruits for June by \n     about 16 percent, with only 7,031 nationwide joining.\n       Brian Alexander, principal of Edmonson County High School, \n     said having options for college is one explanation for why \n     Edmonson County ranked high. Alexander said the latest \n     graduating class of a little over 100 earned $250,000 in \n     scholarships.\n       ``Our kids are looking for opportunities. Right now, the \n     military offers substantial financial opportunity to allow \n     young men and women to pursue post-secondary careers,'' \n     Alexander said, adding that joining the military also gives \n     young people the opportunity to see different parts of the \n     world.\n       Take a look at Edmonson County's courthouse in Brownsville \n     and it's easy to see that military organizations are very \n     active in the area, according to Edmonson County Schools \n     Superintendent Patrick Waddell.\n       ``One of the biggest reasons we probably have ranked high \n     in that area is we're a very patriotic county,'' he said. \n     ``The different services of the military are very active in \n     the county. They do a lot of programs that are \n     extracurricular activities in the middle school and high \n     school.''\n       Waddell also said the percentage who go to college or a \n     technical or trade school would be about the same as other \n     districts.\n       ``Being proud of your community and proud of your county \n     and being proud of America, that's a very positive attribute \n     of Edmonson County,'' Waddell said.\n       Sarah Childress, executive director of the Edmonson County \n     Chamber of Commerce, said small-town values are alive and \n     well in Edmonson County.\n       ``I'm not saying things are different here, but it may have \n     something to do with the way young people have been raised, \n     to have that instilled in them at a young age, to want to \n     serve their country,'' Childress said.\n       The appearance of a lesser amount of opportunities in \n     Edmonson County may be a small factor also, she said.\n       ``Anyone can go to Bowling Green, Louisville and Nashville \n     and find a good job and commute. They can move if they \n     want,'' Childress said. ``We don't have a lot of industry \n     here.''\n       The biggest employer in Edmonson County is the board of \n     education, followed by the county's highway department and \n     local banks, Childress said.\n       ``There is something out there for everybody, and Bowling \n     Green is growing so much and moving even closer to southern \n     Edmonson County,'' he said. ``There is so much industry going \n     on in Bowling Green there is plenty out there for \n     everybody.''\n       Other recruiting and retention statistics for the active \n     and reserve components last month showed:\n       The Navy finished with 3,999 recruits. Its goal was 3,924. \n     The Marine Corps exceeded its goal by recruiting 4,113 new \n     Marines; its goal was 3,742. The Air Force met its goal of \n     2,233 recruits.\n       Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force met or exceeded \n     overall active duty retention missions.\n       Five of the six reserve components met or exceeded their \n     Reserve forces recruiting goals in June. The Air National \n     Guard was the only reserve component to miss its goal, \n     finishing at 75 percent with 779 of its goal of 1,036. The \n     Army National Guard recruited 5,342 soldiers surpassing its \n     goal of 5,338. The Army Reserve and Navy Reserve finished at \n     108 percent of their goals with 5,255 and 1,013 recruits, \n     respectively.\n       The Marine Corps Reserve recruited 1,078 Marines, \n     surpassing its goal of 986 at 109 percent. The Air Force \n     Reserve met its goal of 597 recruits.\n       Reserve forces retention numbers show Army National Guard \n     retention was 107 percent of the cumulative goal of 26,405, \n     and Air National Guard retention was 98 percent of its \n     cumulative goal of 8,430. Both the Army and Air Guard are \n     currently at 101 percent and 99 percent of their end \n     strength, respectively. Losses in all reserve components for \n     May are well within acceptable limits, according to the \n     DOD.--Source: U.S. Department of Defense\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10879-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10879-S10881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SMALL BUSINESS CHILDREN'S HEALTH EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the 17th century English writer, Izaak \nWalton, said--\n\n       Look to your health; and if you have it, praise God, and \n     value it next to a good conscience; for health is . . . a \n     blessing that money can't buy.\n\n  Today in America, good health is not free. And for many working \npeople, the cost and accessibility of quality health care has become \nprohibitive.\n  A decade ago, the Congress and President Clinton made a major \ndownpayment on improving our health care delivery system.\n  Their new approach was aimed at a gap between children of very low-\nincome families who were covered under Medicaid and children of middle- \nand upper-income families who could fortunately afford private \ninsurance, usually through their employers.\n  But between the two, millions of children whose families neither \nqualify for Medicaid nor can afford private insurance are uninsured.\n  So in 1997, the Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to fill that void.\n  When President Clinton signed that legislation into law, he said--\n\n       [The program] strengthens our families by extending health \n     insurance coverage to up to 5 million children. By investing \n     $24 billion, we will be able to provide quality medical care \n     for these children--everything from regular check-ups to \n     major surgery.\n       I want every child in America to grow up healthy and \n     strong, and this investment takes a major step toward that \n     goal.\n\n  Today, 10 years later, the Children's Health Insurance Program has \nbeen a smashing success by any measure.\n  With this innovative program, the number of uninsured children of \nworking families has dropped by almost 35 percent.\n  Today, 6.6 million children have insurance thanks to this outstanding \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\n  Many of these kids are now getting regular checkups. They are \nbenefiting from preventive medicine. And their primary care comes from \na family doctor, not from an expensive and inefficient emergency room.\n  Examples of this program's success can be found in every State.\n  Since 1998, Terry Rasner of Reno, NV, has helped children in Nevada \nenroll in Nevada Check Up, which is the Nevada Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  In a 2001 profile, Terry told of a father trying to care for his \ndaughters, ages 2 and 3, both in need of medical attention.\n  With Terry's help, the father's application for coverage of his \ndaughters was approved within 2 weeks. At the girls' first doctor's \nappointment, one was diagnosed with a severe heart condition and was \nimmediately scheduled for surgery.\n  Terry recalled the father telling her staff that this program--funded \nfederally and put into action locally--had literally saved this little \ngirl's life.\n  And Terry remembered the joy they all shared--the father, the girls \nand the program staff.\n  But Terry was quick to point out in a recent email that this story is \njust one example.\n  She went on to write:\n\n       There are many stories of children as old as 11 and 12 who \n     were finally able to visit a dentist for the first time in \n     their lives.\n       Stories of families who finally felt whole because they \n     could access affordable medical and dental care for their \n     children.\n       School nurses who were acutely involved in supporting and \n     promoting this program from the outset because they were on \n     the frontlines of failed programs--or no programs at all--to \n     address the medical and dental needs of children of low-\n     income working families.\n       One child in particular was so bad off, he was unable to \n     eat and chew food due to the dramatic decay and gum morbidity \n     in his mouth. Imagine, children for the first time in their \n     lives actually getting to see a doctor or dentist that their \n     parents were able to afford.\n\n  Stories like this--examples of the Children's Health Program saving \nlives--are being told across America, and the statistics bear that out.\n  Study after study shows that: kids enrolled in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program are much more likely to have regular doctor and \ndental care; they report lower rates of unmet need for care; the \nquality of care they receive is far better than it was before; school \nperformance improves; the plan is helping to close the disparity in \ncare for minority children; and it has become a major source of care \nfor rural children.\n  So, Mr. President, there is no doubt--no question at all--that the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is good for kids, good for families \nand good for America.\n  Today before us is legislation to reauthorize and improve the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  This bill maintains coverage for the 6.6 million children currently \nenrolled and adds an additional 3.3 million low-income, uninsured \nchildren.\n  It also improves the program by curbing coverage of adults in the \nprogram and targeting the lowest income-eligible families as new \nenrollees.\n  As good as this bill is, I would have preferred a more robust \nreauthorization.\n  I think we should provide coverage for even more low-income children, \nas we hoped to do in the Budget Resolution.\n  But we all know that legislating is the art of compromise.\n  I understand that some of my colleagues balked at a larger bill, and \nwhile I am disappointed, I am satisfied that this bipartisan compromise \nwill be a positive step toward better health care for those who need it \nmost.\n  There is a rival bill that is called the CHIP alternative bill. But \nthis bill is no alternative.\n  It will leave many families without any options for coverage. It will \nturn back the clock on all the progress the program has made over the \npast 10 years. It is not worthy of our support.\n  Some of my colleagues share my feelings that we could have done more. \nStill others feel this bill is too generous in that it provides \ncoverage for too many uninsured children.\n  But the bill before us now has broad support, and back in 2004, \nduring his reelection campaign, President Bush shared the goals that \nthis bill achieves.\n  He said during the campaign--\n\n       In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for government health insurance programs. We will not allow a \n     lack of attention, or information, to stand between these \n     children and the health care they need.\n\n  Now, just 3 years later, President Bush seems to be singing a \ndifferent tune. He is now threatening to veto this legislation for what \nhe calls ``philosophical reasons.''\n  What is the impact of this legislation?\n  A ``no'' vote denies the most vulnerable children in our society the \nchance to live healthy lives.\n  A ``yes'' vote gives 10 million children the protection of health \ncare and all the opportunities of a healthy, well-cared-for life.\n  I can't imagine any of my colleagues--or the President--telling a \nchild: You can't have health coverage. You have to stop seeing your \ndoctor. If you get sick, your parents will have to take you to the \nemergency room.\n  If that were to happen--if the Congress were to reject the program or \nPresident Bush were to veto it for so-called philosophical reasons--\nthey would be putting the health of millions of children at risk.\n  But I am hopeful that will not happen. This bill was forged through \nbipartisanship and a genuine pursuit of common ground.\n  I so appreciate the work of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley of the Finance Committee, along with Senators Rockefeller and \nHatch.\n  Their efforts were rewarded in the Finance Committee with an \noverwhelming 17-to-4 vote in favor of the bill, and I am hopeful that \nwe will mirror that here on the Senate floor.\n  All too often, we hear about what Government can't do. The Children's \nHealth Insurance Program is a stellar example of what it can.\n  This program is Government at its best: lending a helping hand, \nproviding a safety net to children who need a boost to reach their full \npotential.\n  I couldn't be prouder to support this outstanding program, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to do the same.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last night, the Senate voted to \nreauthorize the vitally important State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP. The legislation, approved by a vote of 68 to 31, \ndemonstrates the Democratic majority's commitment to expanding this \nsuccessful health insurance program and made a loud and clear statement \nregarding the importance of children's health as a national priority. \nDuring debate on this bill, I offered an amendment to add $15 billion \nin additional funding to cover over a million additional low-income \nchildren. Unfortunately this amendment was not adopted, however I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for voting to include as part of H.R 976 the \nSmall Business Children's Health Education Act, which I introduced in \nJune with Senators Snowe and Levin. This amendment directs the Federal \nGovernment to make a concerted effort to reach out to small business \nowners and employees to enroll eligible children in SCHIP.\n  In February of 2007, the Urban Institute reported that among those \neligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, children \nwhose families are self-employed or who work for small business \nconcerns are far less likely to be enrolled. Specifically, one out of \nevery four eligible children with parents who work for a small business \nor who are self employed are not enrolled. This statistic compares with \njust one out of every 10 eligible children whose parents work for a \nlarge firm.\n  We need to do a better job of informing and educating America's small \nbusiness owners and employees of the options that may be available for \ncovering uninsured children. To that effect, the Small Business \nChildren's Health Education Act creates an intergovernmental task \nforce, consisting of the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \nSecretary of Labor and the Secretary of Treasury, to conduct a campaign \nto enroll kids of small business employees who are eligible for SCHIP \nand Medicaid but are not currently enrolled. To educate America's small \nbusinesses on the availability of SCHIP and Medicaid, the task force is \nauthorized to\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nmake use of the Small Business Administration's business partners, \nincluding the Service Corps of Retired Executives, the Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, Certified Development Companies, and Women's \nBusiness Centers, and is authorized to enter into memoranda of \nunderstanding with chambers of commerce across the country.\n  Additionally, the Small Business Administration is directed to post \nSCHIP and Medicaid eligibility criteria and enrollment information on \nits website, and to report back to the Senate and House Committees on \nSmall Business regarding the status and successes of the task force's \nefforts to enroll eligible kids.\n  I would like to thank Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Grassley for their work to include this amendment in the SCHIP \nReauthorization Act. I look forward to working with our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives to send the President a bill that goes a \nlong way toward what should be our unified goal: to cover every child \nin America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10881-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10881-S10883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the folowing statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.)\n\n                                  FISA\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from the \nvotes related to the reauthorization of FISA. I strongly support the \ncritical efforts to protect our national security and, as I have \nrepeatedly stated in the past, I want the Federal Government to do all \nthat it can to aggressively pursue al-Qaida and other terrorist \norganizations. I believe the legislation developed by Senators \nRockefeller and Levin achieves these goals without targeting American \ncitizens without court authorization. I believe the approach by \nSenators Rockefeller and Levin will give the intelligence community all \nthe tools it needs to protect our national security while maintaining \nthe independence of the FISA Court. This legislation will give the \nintelligence community the tools they need to collect foreign-to-\nforeign intelligence communications. It will compel compliance from \ncommunications providers. It will allow the intelligence community to \ncollect all foreign intelligence information. I hope my colleagues \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last night, the Senate was able to \nsuccessfully pass the reauthorization of a popular program that has \nreduced the number of uninsured children in our country by over 6 \nmillion. The Children's Health Insurance Program has helped lower the \nrate of uninsured low-income children by one-third since its enactment \nin 1997. That is a huge accomplishment, and has helped address a \nproblem in our country that is unacceptable--the millions of families \nlacking insurance. Moreover, while the bill has a pricetag of roughly \n$40 billion over 10 years, it is fully offset and would cover over 3 \nmillion more children. This program, according to CBO and numerous \neconomists, is the most efficient method of getting health care \ninsurance to low-income kids and parents, and that means CHIP provides \nthe best coverage available for low-income families.\n  In my home state of Wisconsin, CHIP is known as BadgerCare and it \nprovides health insurance for over 67,000 families. My State has done \nan incredible job of covering uninsured families, and the positive \neffects of this program are felt at schools, in the workforce, and at \nhome. This bill helps support Wisconsin's efforts and provides low-\nincome children in my State with better access to preventive care, \nprimary care, and affordable care. The end result is healthier \nfamilies. BadgerCare is vital to the well-being of many families in \nWisconsin and I am very pleased that this bill supports the program in \nmy State, including Wisconsin's choice to cover parents of CHIP and \nMedicaid children.\n  The ability to cover adults in CHIP continues to be a priority for \nStates like Wisconsin. Many States extend coverage to low-income adults \nand parents of children enrolled in SCHIP. This coverage has been given \nprior Federal approval--including in the Bush administration--and has \nsignificantly lowered the rate of uninsurance in our states. Wisconsin \nprovides family-based coverage, which is an important determinant in \nchildren's coverage and use of services.\n  We know from numerous reports that when we cover parents, we bring \nmore uninsured children into the program as well. States like Wisconsin \nhave proven this time and again. No child is left off the rolls because \na parent is covered. Covering parents means covering more kids--bottom \nline. Wisconsin chose to cover parents because research shows that it \nis the best way to bring low-income children into BadgerCare. This \nchoice was wisely supported by this administration this May as CMS \napproved parent coverage in BadgerCare for another 3 years. Despite all \nthe evidence and the widespread support for this policy, a number of \nSenators wanted to remove all adults from the CHIP program.\n  I worked with the Senate Finance Committee and a number of other \nSenators who represent States like Wisconsin on an agreement that will \nallow our States to keep families in the CHIP program. I am grateful to \nmy colleagues Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller for working with \nme to help Wisconsin keep parents on the rolls while also bringing \nadditional tens of millions of dollars to the State. The agreement \nreflected in this bill ensures that Wisconsin will not have to drop a \nsingle person from the insurance rolls, and will even be able to expand \ncoverage to more people in the State. I am happy to support this \nagreement regarding parents today.\n  We also have a moral obligation to provide assistance to the very \npoor, even if they do not have children. When we talk about childless \nadults in CHIP, we are talking about the very poorest of the poor. Most \nof the childless adults in the program live well below 100 percent of \nFederal poverty. An adult at 50 percent of the Federal poverty level \nmust attempt to survive on less than $500 per month. This is not enough \nto afford adequate food and shelter, let alone health insurance, in any \nState. We all know a single visit to the emergency room can cost more \nthan someone in this situation makes in a year. Providing coverage to \nchildless adults increases their ability to see a doctor when a problem \nis small, at a significantly lower cost than if care is delayed, the \nproblem is exacerbated, and the result is an emergency room visit. \nCovering poor individuals helps to curb the cost of health care and \nhealth insurance for all of us, because we all bear emergency room \ncosts through higher hospital and physician charges and then through \nincreased health insurance premiums.\n  I strongly believe we should continue to cover current populations. \nCHIP has allowed states to mold the program to meet their specific \nneeds, and while we may not all agree with what each State chooses to \ndo, we should respect that decision. Additionally, we should never \nimpose policies on States that would result in a higher number of \nuninsured for the State. It is bad policy, and it's the wrong thing to \ndo.\n  Another issue critical to children's health is to ensure that \nunnecessary or burdensome barriers to enrollment are removed. The \nonerous citizenship documentation requirements established in the 2005 \nDeficit Reduction Act, DRA, are keeping hundreds of thousands of \neligible beneficiaries from the health care they need. This provision \nhas created a serious new roadblock to coverage. As a result of the \nprovision, which requires U.S. citizens to document their citizenship \nand identity when they apply for Medicaid or renew their coverage, a \ngrowing number of States are reporting a drop in Medicaid enrollment, \nparticularly among children, but also among pregnant women and low-\nincome parents. Health care coverage is being delayed or denied for \ntens of thousands of children who are clearly citizens and eligible for \nMedicaid but who cannot produce the limited forms of documentation \nprescribed by the regulations. These children are having to go without \nnecessary medical care, essential medicines and therapies. In addition, \ncommunity health centers are reporting a decline in the number of \nMedicaid patients due to the documentation requirements and are faced \nwith treating more uninsured patients as a result.\n  In Wisconsin, more than 26,000 individuals--half of whom were \nchildren under age 16--lost Medicaid or were denied coverage solely \nbecause they could not satisfy the federal documentation requirements. \nAbout two-\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\nthirds of these people are known by the state to be U.S. citizens; most \nof the remainder are likely to be citizens as well, but have yet to \nprove it.\n\n  A study of 300 community health centers, conducted by George \nWashington University, found that the citizenship documentation \nrequirements have caused a nationwide disruption in Medicaid coverage. \nResearchers estimate a loss of coverage for as many as 319,500 health \ncenter patients, which will result in an immediate financial loss of up \nto $85 million in Medicaid revenues. The loss of revenue hampers the \nability of safety net providers to adequately respond to the medical \nneeds of the communities they serve.\n  In addition to consequences suffered by eligible U.S. citizens, \nstates have reported incurring substantial new administrative costs \nassociated with implementing the requirement. They have had to hire \nadditional staff, retool computer systems, and pay to obtain birth \nrecords. States are also reporting that the extra workload imposed by \nthe new requirement is diverting time and attention that could be \ndevoted to helping more eligible children secure and retain health \ncoverage.\n  States are in the best position to decide if a documentation \nrequirement is needed and, if so, to determine the most effective and \nreasonable ways to implement it. States that do not find it necessary \nto require such documentation could return to the procedures they used \nprior to the DRA and avoid the considerable administrative and \nfinancial burdens associated with implementing the DRA requirement. \nMost importantly, these states could avoid creating obstacles to \nMedicaid coverage for eligible U.S. citizens.\n  Despite significant support for allowing states to determine the best \nway to document citizenship, that complete fix is not included in the \nunderlying bill. The restrictions are eased, and this is an important \nfirst step, but I hope we can continue to move forward on this issue \nand return this requirement to a State option. I am pleased that this \nis done in the CHIP reauthorization in the House version of this \nlegislation, and I hope that as we continue to work to support \nchildren's health care, we will also work to remove barriers to \nenrollment that are preventing our children from receiving the care \nthey need.\n  In addition to these issues that we considered in the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization, I would like to talk about \nthe bigger picture of health care reform. There is a crisis facing our \ncountry, a crisis that directly affects the lives of over 45 million \npeople in the United States, and that indirectly affects many more. The \ncrisis is the lack of universal health insurance in America. It is \nconsistently the number one issue that I hear about in Wisconsin, and \nit is the No. 1 issue for many Americans. Nevertheless, the issue has \nbeen largely ignored in the Halls of Congress. We sit idle, locked in a \nstalemate, refusing to give this life-threatening problem its due \nattention. We need a way to break that deadlock, and that is why last \nApril, I introduced a bill with the Senator from South Carolina, \nLindsey Graham, that will do just that the State-Based Health Care \nReform Act.\n  Senator Graham and I are from opposite ends of the political \nspectrum, we are from different areas of the country, and we have \ndifferent views on health care. But we agree that something needs to be \ndone about health care in our country. In short, our bill establishes a \npilot project to provide States with the resources needed to implement \nuniversal health care reform. The bill does not dictate what kind of \nreform the States should implement, it just provides an incentive for \naction, provided the States meet certain minimum coverage and low-\nincome requirements.\n  Even though Senator Graham and I support different methods of health \ncare reform, we both agree that this legislation presents a viable \nsolution to the logjam preventing reform.\n  This bipartisan legislation harnesses the talent and ingenuity of \nAmericans to come up with new solutions. This approach takes advantage \nof America's greatest resources--the mind power and creativity of the \nAmerican people--to move our country toward the goal of a working \nhealth care system with universal coverage. With help from the Federal \nGovernment, States will be able to try new ways of covering all their \nresidents, and our political logjam around health care will begin to \nloosen.\n  We are fortunate to live in a country that has been abundantly \nblessed with democracy and wealth, and yet there are those in our \nsociety whose daily health struggles overshadow these blessings. Over \nthe past few days, my colleagues have shared tragic stories of children \nwho have suffered as a result of being uninsured, and we have listened \nto the heartwarming stories of families who have--quite literally--been \nsaved by the Children's Health Insurance Program. The Children's Health \nInsurance Program reauthorization marks an important leap forward in \ngetting coverage to those who need it. I was pleased to support this \nbill's final passage, and I look forward to the day that everyone in \nour country has access to the basic right of health care.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am in strong support of H.R. 976, the \nSmall Business Tax Relief Act. There are few more important issues \nfacing the Senate than the health and well-being of our nation's \nchildren. The vote to pass this legislation is a vote for children. It \nis a vote to do what's right for our nation's youth.\n  As the father of two young daughters, I know the importance of having \nthe peace of mind to know that if one of them gets sick they have the \nhealth insurance coverage that will provide for them if they break a \nbone or get a cold. For millions of parents, every slight sniffle or \naching tooth could mean the difference between paying the rent or \npaying for medical care.\n  It is our national shame that nine million children wake up every day \nlacking any form of health insurance. For their parents, the lack of \naccess to health insurance means a regular check up is sidelined, a \ndental exam goes unscheduled, or an early diagnosis of a chronic \ncondition such as asthma or diabetes is postponed. For families, such \ndelays in access to proper health care set the stage for children to \ngrow up underperforming in school, developing preventable or treatable \nconditions, or worse, permanent disability or even premature death.\n  The lack of health insurance goes beyond poor health outcomes. Health \ninsurance is inextricably linked with alleviating child poverty. Low-\nincome families without insurance often get stuck in an endless cycle \nof medical debt. Personal debt due to medical expenses is a primary \ncause of bankruptcy filings in this country. Parents already struggling \nto make ends meet should not have to choose between buying medication \nfor their children and putting food on the table.\n  I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee \nfor working so hard to put together a bill that will benefit the lives \nof millions of children and their families. Through their leadership \nand that of Senators Hatch, Rockefeller, Kennedy and many others, since \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program was first enacted, the number \nof uninsured children has decreased by one-third. The bill passed by \nthe Senate is an important vote for children. Although I supported \nefforts to broaden the bill to cover an additional one million \nuninsured children, the bill passed by the Senate is a tremendous \ninvestment in the health and future of our children.\n  Specifically, this bill continues providing coverage for 6.6 million \nchildren currently enrolled in CHIP and provides coverage for 3.2 \nmillion children who are currently uninsured today. It will reduce the \nnumber of uninsured children by one third over the next 5 years.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, our CHIP program, commonly known as \nHUSKY B, has brought affordable health insurance to more than 130,000 \nchildren in working families since its inception in 1998. H.R. 976 is \nessential to states like Connecticut so that they may continue to \noperate programs like HUSKY B and build on their proven success to \ninsure even more children.\n  I am additionally very pleased that my Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act amendment was included in the final SCHIP bill. This \namendment provides up to 6 months of Family and Medical Leave Act, \nFMLA, leave for family members of military personnel who suffer from a \ncombat-related injury or illness. FMLA currently allows three months of \nunpaid leave. Fourteen\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\nyears ago, FMLA declared the principle that workers should never be \nforced to choose between the jobs they need and the families they love. \nIn the years since its passage, more than 50 million Americans have \ntaken advantage of its provisions to care for a sick love one, or \nrecover from illness themselves, or welcome a new baby into the family.\n  Mr. President, if ordinary Americans deserve those rights, how much \nmore do they apply to those who risk their lives in the service of our \ncountry? Soldiers who have been wounded in our service deserve \neverything America can give to speed their recoveries--but most of all, \nthey deserve the care of their closest loved ones. Given the severity \nof their injuries, and our debt of gratitude, our servicemembers need \nmore. That is exactly what is offered in the Support for Injured \nServicemembers Act.\n  Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services \nDonna Shalala have been instrumental in this effort as well, through \ntheir thoughtfulness and work on the President's Commission on Care for \nAmerica's Returning Wounded Warriors. It's not surprising that the \nCommission found that family members play a critical role in the \nrecovery of our wounded servicemembers. The commitment shown by the \nfamilies and friends of our troops is truly inspiring. According to the \nCommission's report, 33 percent of active duty servicemembers report \nthat a family member or close friend relocated for extended periods of \ntime to help their recoveries. It also points out that 21 percent of \nactive duty servicemembers say that their friends or family members \ngave up jobs to find the time.\n  I am pleased that Senator Clinton is the lead co-sponsor of my \namendment. FMLA was the very first bill that President Clinton signed \ninto law, and I am grateful that his wife, Senator Clinton, continues \nto support the principles that I have been fighting for over 20 years. \nI am pleased that Senators Dole, Graham, Kennedy, Chambliss, Reed, \nMikulski, Murray, Salazar, Lieberman, Menendez, Brown, Nelson of \nNebraska, and Cardin are co-sponsoring this amendment. I thank Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley for accepting this important amendment and \nappreciate the support of all of my colleagues in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I am troubled by the comments from the Bush \nadministration about this bill. It is a bill to help children and an \noverwhelming majority of members on both sides of the aisle have voted \nto support that goal. The CHIP Program is a model of success and this \nbill provides sustainable and predictable health care coverage for low \nincome children regardless of their health status. One day soon, the \nPresident will make a decision on whether to sign CHIP reauthorization \ninto law. At that moment, all Americans will know whether the President \nstands for children or would rather stand in the way of children's \naccess to critically needed health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10883-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BRITISH PETROLEUM REFINERY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the proposed \nexpansion of a British Petroleum refinery in Whiting, IN. BP Amoco has \nrequested, and received, a permit to increase the pollution it dumps \ninto Lake Michigan.\n  Under this new permit, BP's expanded facility will release 54 percent \nmore ammonia and 35 percent more suspended solids which contain heavy \nmetals, including mercury, into Lake Michigan. Expanding refinery \ncapacity is an important goal and a project with many benefits, but we \nshouldn't do this at the expense of one of our most precious natural \nresources.\n  Congress passed the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the \nintegrity of our Nation's waters. The express goal of the law is to \nreduce the amount of pollutants entering the Nation's waterways. The \nClean Water Act went so far as to set a very specific target of \nreaching zero pollutants going into the waters by 1985. Zero \ndischarges. We certainly have not met that target.\n  But we have been trying to move toward it. Now, BP wants to increase \nits pollution into Lake Michigan. BP has spent millions and millions of \ndollars to ``green'' its image. This company has effectively changed \nits name from ``British Petroleum'' to ``Beyond Petroleum.''\n  Yet with this ``green'' image, BP turns around and asks for a permit \nto dramatically increase the amount of pollutants it dumps into Lake \nMichigan. BP has worked very hard to make the American public think \nthat the company is an environmental steward, that it is a responsible \nand sustainable company. And it does have some very good initiatives, \nbut BP stands to lose this image by insisting on dumping more pollution \ninto Lake Michigan.\n  A Chicago Sun Times article this week referred to BP as ``Big \nPolluters.'' I don't think that is what the company wants.\n  The CEO of BP met with me last week. I asked him to take another look \nat the technology that is currently available to decrease the amount of \nammonia and total suspended solids that will be introduced into Lake \nMichigan. I encouraged BP to find a better solution.\n  I am calling on BP to live up the standard it has set for itself as a \ncorporate steward of the environment and to stop any additional \npollution from being discharged into Lake Michigan.\n  The Great Lakes are a tremendous and valuable resource. The lakes are \na largely closed ecosystem that has a very long water retention time. \nIt takes 106 years for water to be completely flushed through Lake \nMichigan. Pollutants that are introduced into the lake are likely to \nstay there for a long time.\n  The Great Lakes contain more than 20 percent of the Earth's surface \nfresh water and are a necessary drinking water source for nearly 40 \nmillion Americans. Increasing pollution going into the Lakes should \nworry us all. Twenty-five percent of the U.S. and Canadian populations \nare within the watershed of the Great Lakes.\n  Congress appreciates the value of this resource. More than 30 Federal \nlaws have been enacted that specifically focused on restoring the Great \nLakes basin.\n  Government at all levels is working to prevent industrial pollution, \nsewage discharges, invasive species and water diversion. These efforts \nare to ensure that future generations will enjoy the beauty of our \nmagnificent Great Lakes.\n  Dumping more pollution into one of our most important sources of \nfresh water is a bad idea. The people in my State recognize that. They \nare willing to forgo the modest increase in refinery expansion to \nprotect Lake Michigan.\n  At a time when fresh water sources are threatened here and around the \nglobe, we should demand more especially from corporate leaders who \nflash public relations campaigns about moving ``beyond petroleum.'' BP \nis not a struggling small business. In the past three years, BP \nCorporation has earned net profits of over $60 billion. If anyone has \nthe resources to find alternatives, it is BP Amoco.\n  We respectfully ask BP to live up to the image it has worked so hard \nto create and use some of the resources they have to prevent additional \npollution from entering our drinking water. Please protect our natural \nresource, don't degrade it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10883-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10883-S10885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify my support for S. \n558, the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007. This bipartisan legislation \nintroduced by Senators Domenici and Kennedy, seeks to provide parity \nbetween health insurance coverage of mental health benefits and \nbenefits for medical and surgical services. I join my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, in establishing for the \nrecord today the reasons for our joint support for this bill. I also \nthank Chairman Kennedy and Senator Domenici for joining us in this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague Senator Casey. Mr. President, as a \ncosponsor of S. 558, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up this \nimportant legislation. I thank Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nHELP, Committee Chairman Kennedy, Senator Domenici, who along with HELP \nCommittee Ranking Member Enzi and others, have worked to establish \nmental health parity for millions of American citizens.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania and appreciate \ntheir dedication to and support for the cause of mental health parity. \nI\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\nwelcome this opportunity to discuss this critical legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with Senator Kennedy and look forward to \nSenate action on S. 558.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 amends \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, and the Public \nHealth Service Act to require a group health plan that provides both \nmedical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits to ensure \nthat: (1) the financial requirements applicable to such mental health \nbenefits are no more restrictive than those of substantially all \nmedical and surgical benefits covered by the plan, including \ndeductibles and copayments; and (2) the treatment limitations \napplicable to such mental health benefits are no more restrictive than \nthose applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits \ncovered by the plan, including limits on the frequency of treatments or \nsimilar limits on the scope or duration of treatment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In 1989, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State \nlegislature passed a bill, Pennsylvania Act 106, which requires all \ncommercial group health insurance plans and health maintenance \norganization's to provide a full continuum of addiction treatment \nincluding detoxification, residential rehabilitation, and outpatient/\npartial hospitalization. The only lawful prerequisite to this treatment \nand to coverage is certification to need and referral from a licensed \nphysician or psychologist. Such certifications and referrals in all \ninstances control the nature and duration of treatment. I support \nexisting Pennsylvania law and, before agreeing to support S. 558, \nassured myself that S. 558 will not serve to supplant greater \nPennsylvania protections for those seeking treatment for substance \nabuse.\n  Mr. CASEY. I join my esteemed colleague in having assured myself that \nS. 558 will not serve to preempt in any way the services and benefits \nprovided to the citizens of Pennsylvania by Pennsylvania Act 106. I \nknow that our offices have collaborated extensively in this analysis \nand have consulted with HELP Committee staff and Senator Domenici's \nstaff, and that our views are borne out by extensive legal and \nscholarly analysis of the preemptive provisions of S. 558.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I can assure the Senators from Pennsylvania that we have \nlabored to ensure that S. 558 will serve only to benefit States and the \ncoverage that citizens receive.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank Chairman Kennedy and Senator Domenici, and I note \nin particular that Professor Mila Kofman, Associate Research Professor, \nHealth Policy Institute, Georgetown University, wrote to Senator \nSpecter and myself on August 2, 2007, extolling the benefits of S. 558. \nI ask unanimous consent to print in the Record Professor Kofman's \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             Georgetown University\n\n\n                                      Health Policy Institute,\n\n                                                   August 3, 2007.\n     Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington DC.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Casey and Senator Specter: This is a response \n     to a request for an analysis of the preemption provisions in \n     the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 (S. 558 as amended 8/3/\n     07 Managers' Amendment).\n       The changes made to the preemption section in S. 558 mean \n     that the current HIPAA federal floor standard would apply to \n     the new Mental Health Parity law (just like it applies to the \n     current law passed in 1996).\n       This would mean that more protective (of consumers) state \n     insurance laws would apply to insurers that sell coverage to \n     employers. This bill would also mean new federal protections \n     for people in self-insured ERISA plans.\n       This would be a tremendous victory for patients who need \n     coverage for mental health services. This approach continues \n     the public policy established in 1996 in HIPAA--an approach \n     that allows states to be more protective of consumers while \n     setting a federal minimum set of protections for workers and \n     their families.\n       While not every word or phrase is perfect (meaning not 100% \n     litigation proof), using the current HIPAA preemption \n     standard would certainly make it difficult to win a case that \n     seeks to challenge more protective state insurance law.\n       If enacted, this bill would provide much needed minimum \n     protections for people in self-insured ERISA plans who \n     currently are not protected by states because of ERISA \n     preemption. It also raises the bar for insured products.\n       If you have additional questions, please contact me at 202-\n     784-4580.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Mila Kofman, J.D.,\n                                     Associate Research Professor.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. In the letter, Professor Kofman writes:\n\n       The changes made to the preemption section in S. 558 mean \n     that the current HIPAA federal floor standard would apply to \n     the new Mental Health Parity law (just like it applies to the \n     current law passed in 1996).\n       This would mean that more protective (of consumers) state \n     insurance laws would apply to insurers that sell coverage to \n     employers.

It also raises the bar for insured products.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER For the purpose of further clarifying congressional \nintent of S. 558 and its application to state law and specifically \nPennsylvania Act 106, will the senior Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico yield for questions from Senator \nCasey and myself?\n  Mr. KENNEDY I will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI As will I.\n  Mr. SPECTER I thank Chairman Kennedy and Senator Domenici. Why \ndoesn't the Mental Health Parity Act have its own preemption provision?\n  Mr. KENNEDY It is our intention to establish a Federal floor and not \na Federal standard or Federal caps. Thus, we decided to use the \nalready-existing language and standard found within part 7 of ERISA, \nwhich is where the current mental health parity law already resides, \nand where S. 558 will be codified. This law contains the narrowest \npossible preemption language, and is meant to preempt only those state \nlaws that are less beneficial to consumers and insured, from the \nstandpoint of the consumer and insured, than this new Federal law.\n  Mr. CASEY The Health Insurance and Portability Accountability Act, \nHIPAA, preemption standard that will apply prevents State laws that \n``prevent the application of requirements of this part,'' which refers \nto part 7 of ERISA. Do the medical management provisions of section \n712A(b) constitute ``requirements of this part'' that might preempt \nState laws under this standard?\n  Mr. DOMENICI No. Section 712A(b) says that managed care plans ``shall \nnot be prohibited from'' carrying out certain activities. It does not \nrequire them to do so, and this is not a ``requirement of this part.'' \nThis section recognizes that plans have flexibility. It is not our \nintention to preempt any State laws that regulate, limit, or even \nprohibit entirely the medical management of benefits. That is one of \nthe reasons we are using a preemption standard--the existing HIPAA \nstandard that so clearly does not preempt such a law.\n  Mr. SPECTER Would a State law that establishes a physician or \npsychologist's certification, as the only lawful prerequisite to \nmanaged care coverage of a particular treatment, be preempted?\n  Mr. KENNEDY Such a law is not preempted, and it is not our intention \nto preempt any such law.\n  Mr. CASEY What about a State law requiring insurers or managed care \ncompanies to cover an entire continuum of care?\n  Mr. DOMENICI Mr. President, it is my understanding that such a law \nwould not be preempted. S. 558 is a Federal floor, and nothing in such \na State law Senator Casey describes would prevent the application of \nany requirements of part 7 of ERISA.\n  Mr. SPECTER Would State laws that place coverage decisions squarely \nin the hands of treating clinicians be preempted?\n  Mr. KENNEDY Absolutely not.\n  Mr. CASEY Focusing specifically on Pennsylvania, as you may be aware, \nthe citizens of Pennsylvania just received a significant court victory \nfrom the Commonwealth Court, upholding a Pennsylvania law that was \npreviously mentioned here, Pennsylvania Act 106.\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nThat State law and the recent decision in The Insurance Federation of \nPennsylvania, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Insurance \nDepartment, removes managed care barriers to addiction treatment. What \neffect will S. 558 have on that State law, or on State efforts to \nenforce that law or to find remedies for violations of that law?\n  Mr. KENNEDY This bill would have no effect upon that law.\n  Mr. CASEY Would any State laws be preempted?\n  Mr. DOMENICI Yes, State law requirements that would prevent the \napplication of a requirement of S. 558 by, for example, endorsing a \nless consumer-friendly level of coverage or benefits. For example, a \nState law that prohibited an insurance company from selling policies \nproviding for full parity in coverage for mental health services and \nmedical/surgical services would be preempted.\n  Mr. CASEY Would the current legislation, S. 558, have any effect on \nany provisions of Pennsylvania Act 106, or on any State efforts to \nenforce provisions of that law or to find remedies for violations of \nany provisions of that law?\n  Mr. KENNEDY It would have no effect. Pennsylvania's Act 106 is an \nexample of the kind of consumer protection law that is not preempted by \nthe federal floor created in S. 558.\n  Mr. SPECTER I appreciate this discussion with my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Chairman Kennedy and Senator Domenici. I thank Chairman \nKennedy, Ranking Member Enzi, Senator Domenici and others on the HELP \nCommittee who have worked so hard to establish these critical benefits \nfor citizens across our great country. And I thank them for this \ndiscussion to clarify our support for S. 558.\n  Mr. CASEY I also want to express my deepest thanks to HELP Committee \nChairman Kennedy, Senator Domenici, HELP Committee Ranking Member Enzi, \nand all members and staff who have worked so hard to make this long \ntime dream a reality. I greatly appreciate this discussion and our \nestablishment of intent regarding S. 558.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10885-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10885-S10886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, America's strength has always been in the \ninnovation, technical skill, and education of its workforce. The \neconomic growth and well-being of the nation relies on the technical \ninnovations achieved by our workforce. To realize growth and success, \nthe United States must continue to support the two critical components \nvital to the innovation process: education and basic research. Today, \nCongress takes a significant step toward this commitment.\n  The National Academy of Sciences and the Council on Competitiveness \nhave identified science and innovation as key drivers of economic \ngrowth. The United States has seen a sharp palpable decline in its \nscientific prowess. The United States is losing the educational battle \nwith Germany, China, and Japan. In the United States, only 32 percent \nof graduates hold a degree in science and engineering, while Germany \nboasts 36 percent of graduates with degrees in science and engineering. \nOutpacing both the United States and Germany is China, with 59 percent \nof graduates with degrees in math and science, and Japan with 66 \npercent.\n  The America COMPETES Act embodies bipartisan, bicameral multi-\ncommittee efforts in responding to the Nation's defining economic \nchallenge of how to remain strong and competitive in the face of \nemerging challenges from India, China, and the rest of the world.\n  The America COMPETES Act addresses programs within several scientific \nagencies of which the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation has jurisdiction. Within the Department of Commerce, the \nNational Institutes of Standards and Technology, NIST, promotes U.S. \ninnovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement \nscience, standards, and technology. The legislation before us would \ndouble the agency's funding over the next 10 years. We also create a \nnew program, the Technology Innovation Program, which will support \nhigh-risk, high-reward research. This was one of the major \nrecommendations of the National Academies report, ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm.''\n  Also within the Department of Commerce, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, conducts significant basic \natmospheric and oceanographic research, including climate change \nresearch. Some have argued that the ocean truly is the last frontier on \nEarth, and ocean research and technology may have broad impacts on \nimproving health and understanding our environment. Toward this end, \nCongress included provisions on NOAA research and education, as well \nas, NOAA's continued participation in interagency innovation and \ncompetitiveness efforts.\n  The bill also includes the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA, in the competitiveness agenda. Like the oceans, \nspace serves to inspire young students and attract them to studies in \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n  The need for additional research through the National Science \nFoundation, NSF, also is addressed in this bill with authorization for \nappropriations through fiscal year 2010. This bill places NSF on track \nto double in 7 years. While this is not as aggressive an approach as \nthe Senate sought, it is clear that Congress is united in our belief \nthat the NSF is indeed the Nation's premier scientific research \nenterprise. We need to support this enterprise to the best of our \nabilities, so that it can enable our scientists to continue their \ndiscovery. Within the NSF, I am proud that the conferees supported the \ncreation of a mentoring program designed to recruit and train science, \ntechnology, and engineering professionals to mentor women, and other \nunderrepresented minorities, in these fields. We need to ensure that we \ndo not neglect a segment of the U.S. population, but rather maximize \nall of this country's great human resources.\n  A strong national investment in science, education, and technology \nprovides opportunities for Americans to succeed in a whole array of \ndisciplines and professions. Technology and innovation influence many \npolicy problems such as a changing telecommunications landscape, \npotential improvements to our transportation infrastructure, and the \nneed for advanced technologies to increase our energy independence. The \nAmerica COMPETES Act directs the Nation on the path to preserve and \nimprove its workforce. This bill demonstrates that Americans are not \ntaking their traditional technological and economic dominance for \ngranted but are continually working to improve and lead\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that last night the Senate \npassed the conference report that accompanies H.R. 2272, the America \nCOMPETES Act of 2007. Innovation resulting from Americans' genius and \ngift for innovation has revolutionized the global economy and workplace \nas well as all our everyday lives.\n  Unfortunately, our education system has failed to keep pace; now, \nmany of our Nation's schools are unable to provide their students with \nthe scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical knowledge \nand skills the 21st century economy demands. Without well-trained \npeople and the scientific and technical innovations they produce, this \nNation risks losing its place as the epicenter for innovative \nenterprise that has been one of our proudest traditions.\n  I applaud Senators Bingaman and Alexander and the other leading \nsponsors of the bill for their action to ensure that this Nation \nremains a technological leader. I was proud to join them as a cosponsor \nof the bill and was proud to join them to vote for its final passage.\n  I am grateful to the academic and business leaders, including Nancy \nGrasmick, the Maryland State superintendent of schools, and Dr. C.D. \nMote, Jr., president of the University of Maryland, who produced both \nthe National Academies' ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' and the \nCouncil on Competitiveness's ``Innovative America'' reports and \nrecommendations that serve as the foundation for this critical \nlegislation.\n  This legislation is critical for it addresses the growing gap in this \ncountry between what is taught in elementary and secondary schools and \nthe skills necessary to succeed in college, graduate school, and \ntoday's workforce. This gap threatens the implicit promise we have each \nmade to our own children and those whom we represent: get\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\ngood grades in school and you will succeed in life.\n  H.R. 2272 contains provisions that will encourage better alignment of \nelementary and secondary curricula with the knowledge and skills \nrequired by colleges and universities, 21st century employers, and the \nArmed Forces. There are critical measures that will improve teacher \nrecruitment and training, develop partnerships between schools and \nlaboratories, and encourage internship programs. These provisions will \nincrease students' exposure to inspirational teaching, talented \nscientists, and real-world experience so that high school graduates \nstudents are better prepared to succeed in today's global economy.\n  But it is not enough to improve science and math education. Those \nstudents who choose to pursue high-tech careers require federal funding \nto conduct research. H.R. 2272 will significantly increase America's \ninvestment in research, doubling funding for the National Science \nFoundation and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over the \nnext 4 years and authorizing a significant increase in funding for the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. The legislation goes \nfurther toward encouraging scientific and technological discovery by \ntargeting more funds to young researchers and high-risk frontier \nresearch.\n  Today, we face enormous challenges from halting global climate change \nto curing devastating diseases. This legislation takes critical steps \nto ensure we arm ourselves with the skills and resources to tackle \nthese problems so that our children and grandchildren may inherit a \nbetter world rich with economic opportunities\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10886-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10886-S10887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant William R. Fritsche\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of the brave staff sergeant from Martinsville, IN. William \nFritsche, 23 years old, died on July 29, 2007 from injuries sustained \non July 27 near Kamu, Afghanistan, when his dismounted patrol received \nrocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire. With an optimistic future \nbefore him, William risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  William joined the Army at the age of 17 after graduating from \nMartinsville High School. After being deployed in Africa in 2004 and \nreceiving several commendations, he was promoted to sergeant in April \nof 2005. He was chosen to serve in the Old Guard at Arlington National \nCemetery, which is the oldest active-duty infantry unit. He was also \nselected in 2005 to be part of President Bush's inaugural procession in \nWashington, DC. It was during his most recent assignment to the 1st \nSquadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, based out of \nVicenza, Italy, that he was killed while serving his country in \nOperation Enduring Freedom.\n  Today, I join William's family and friends in mourning his death. \nAlthough he was extremely proud of serving his country through military \nservice, he prided himself most on his family. He was a devoted husband \nto Brandi and the loving son of Volitta, a detective in the Morgan \nCounty Sherriff's Department.\n  Martinsville High School administrators, faculty, and students \nreferred to William as having a quiet intensity while being mature, \nfocused, and determined with the ability to succeed at anything he \ntried. His high school's athletic director spoke highly of the former \nbasketball player saying, ``He was one of those players, that if you \nwere a coach, you loved to have on your team because of his work ethic \nand obviously as an athletic director, he was one of those kids that \nyou love in your program, because he was such a good kid. He just \nrepresented you the way you wanted to be represented.''\n  William's final act was one of leadership and bravery. While other \nsoldiers lay dead and wounded, he led a nine man patrol into battle, \nand according to the Army, his efforts saved other troops. Today and \nalways, William will be remembered by family members, friends, and \nfellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the sacrifice he \nmade while dutifully serving his country. While we struggle to bear our \nsorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, \nbravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nWilliam, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days \nof conflict and grief.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring William's sacrifice, \nI am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the \nfamilies of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we \ncannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living \nand dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor \npower to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember \nwhat we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This \nstatement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am \ncertain that the impact of William's actions will live on far longer \nthat any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of William R. Fritsche in the \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that William's family \ncan find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with William\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, another month has passed, and more \nAmerican troops lost their lives overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. It \nis only right that we take a few moments in the U.S. Senate to honor \nthem. Outside my office here in Washington, we have a tribute called \n``Faces of the Fallen.'' Visitors to the Senate from across the country \nhave stopped by the memorial. I encourage my colleagues to come see \nthis tribute on the third floor of the Hart Building.\n  Since the end of June, the Pentagon has announced the deaths of 88 \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan. They will not be forgotten. So today, I \nwill read their names into the Record:\n\n       SGT Stephen R. Maddies of Elizabethton, TN;\n       CPL Jason M.

Mr. President, one of the first actions I took this year \nwas to reintroduce the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, S. 378, \non January 24, 2007. This bipartisan bill has a dozen cosponsors here \nin the Senate. In February we held a Judiciary Committee hearing at \nwhich we heard from Justice Anthony Kennedy. In March the Judiciary \nCommittee considered and then reported the bill by unanimous consent.\n  I thank the majority leader and the assistant majority leader for \ntheir interest in these matters. Each has witnessed violence against \njudges in their home States. With their leadership, in April the Senate \nwas called upon to consider the measure. I was amazed when it took a \ncloture motion to proceed to consideration of court security. Cloture \non the motion to proceed was obtained by a vote of 93 to 3. Thereafter, \nthis important measure was considered and passed by the Senate on April \n19 by a unanimous vote of 97 to 0. Not a single Senator voted against \nit, not even those Senators who objected to proceeding to the bill \ninitially or the three Senators who voted against cloture on the motion \nto proceed.\n  A companion bill was considered by the House of Representatives and \npassed on a voice vote. To resolve the remaining difference between the \nSenate-passed measure and the House-passed measure we sought to \nsubstitute the Senate-passed text into the House bill and to request a \nHouse-Senate conference. This is hardly a novel procedure. It is a \nstandard way to resolve differences and to complete action on \nlegislation. This routine request has cleared the Democratic side of \nthe aisle here in the Senate. No Democratic Senator has objected to \nproceeding. But, once again, an anonymous objection on the Republican \nside is thwarting progress. Just as Republican Senators objected to \nproceeding to consider legislation to bolster court security in April, \nnow, an anonymous Republican objection is preventing the Senate from \nacting, requesting a conference and moving forward to resolve the \ndifferences and enact this long overdue legislation. Despite the broad \nbipartisan support for both the Senate bill and for the House bill, we \nare being blocked from going to conference to resolve the minor \ndifferences between them by an anonymous Republican Senator.\n  This obstruction delays the useful provisions in these bills and \nthreatens important safety measures for our Federal judges and their \nfamilies. For our justice system to function, our judges must be able \nto dispense justice. They and their families must be free from the fear \nof retaliation. Witnesses who come forward must be protected, and the \ncourthouses where our laws are enforced must be secure. We are in \ndanger of letting this chance to improve the security of our Federal \ncourts slip through our fingers. I am disappointed and troubled that we \nwill not be improving the security for our Federal judges and \ncourthouses around the Nation before we go into recess.\n  I hope that the Republican Senator who has placed this anonymous \nobjection would remove it, to let us go to conference, and to let us \nimprove the security that our Federal courts need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10887-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BRIDGE DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, after the overthrow of Ethiopia's brutal \nformer Prime Minister Mengistu, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ushered in \na period of hope and optimism. On May 15, 2005, Ethiopia held its first \nopen multiparty elections. The international community praised the \npeople of Ethiopia for an astounding 90 percent voter participation \nrate, an encouraging beginning to a new political process. The \nEthiopian people deserve a democratic process in which opposition \nparties can organize and participate, and journalists can publish \nfreely, without fear of arrest or retribution. Unfortunately, as it \nturned out, the 2005 election was not the turning point many had hoped \nfor.\n  Early polls suggested the opposition Coalition for Unity and \nDemocracy Party would make gains in the Ethiopian Parliament that could \nthreaten the control of Prime Minister Meles' ruling Ethiopian People's \nRevolutionary Democratic Front. These reports were followed by credible \nallegations of manipulation of the vote-counting process. When the \ngovernment finally announced results that assured its continued hold on \npower, thousands of people took to the streets in protest. The police \narrested over 30,000 people and some 193 people were killed. Although \nmost of the protesters were released soon after their arrest, 70 \nopposition leaders and journalists remained in prison.\n  Following these events, I wrote to Ethiopia's Ambassador Kassahun \nAyele and officials at the State Department to express my concern with \nthe imprisonment of the Ethiopian politicians. Human rights \norganizations and other international figures condemned the detentions \nand urged Prime Minister Meles to release them. These efforts were to \nno avail.\n  Some detainees remained in jail for over 2 years before being brought \nto trial in a manner that was incompatible with international standards \nof justice. Last month, they were convicted of such vague charges as \n``outrage against the constitution'' and ``inciting armed opposition.'' \nThey were\n\n[[Page S10888]]\n\nstripped of their rights to vote and to run for public office. Several \nwere sentenced to life in prison. Nothing was done to prosecute the \npolice officers who fired on the protesters. The situation had gone \nfrom bad to worse.\n  Then suddenly, less than 2 weeks ago, the Ethiopian Government \nannounced the pardon and release of 38 opposition leaders. I am pleased \nthat Prime Minister Meles heeded the pleas of the Ethiopian people and \nthe international community and released these prisoners. The fact is, \nnone of them should have been arrested or tried in the first place. \nTheir release was long overdue and is welcome.\n  I hope the government acts expeditiously to release the remaining \npolitical detainees, and bring to justice police officers who used \nexcessive force. I also hope the negotiations that resulted in the \nprisoners' release will lead to further discussions between the \ngovernment and the leaders of the opposition, to ensure that their \npolitical rights are fully restored and that future elections are not \nsimilarly marred.\n  While this news is positive, it comes at a time when journalists and \nrepresentatives of humanitarian organizations report human rights \nabuses of civilians, including torture, rape and extrajudicial \nkillings, by Ethiopian security forces, including those trained and \nequipped by the U.S., in the Ogaden region.\n  Congressman Donald Payne, chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa and \nGlobal Health, and a vocal defender of human rights and democracy in \nEthiopia, inserted into the Congressional Record a June 18, 2007, New \nYork Times article that described these abuses.\n  This situation is also addressed in the Senate version of the fiscal \nyear 2008 State, Foreign Operations Appropriations bill and report, \nwhich were reported by the Appropriations Committee on July 10. The \nAppropriations Committee seeks assurance from the State Department that \nmilitary assistance for Ethiopia is being adequately monitored and is \nnot being used against civilians by units of Ethiopia's security \nforces. We need to know that the State Department is investigating \nthese reports. We also want to see effective measures by the Ethiopian \nGovernment to bring to justice anyone responsible for such abuses.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the Bush administration has made \nlittle effort to monitor military aid to Ethiopia. It is no excuse that \nthe Ethiopian military has impeded access to the Ogaden, as it has \ndone. In fact, this should give rise to a sense of urgency. If we \ncannot properly investigate these reports, and if the Leahy law which \nprohibits U.S. assistance to units of foreign security forces that \nviolate human rights is not being applied because the U.S. Embassy \ncannot determine the facts, then we should not be supporting these \nforces.\n  As if the allegations of human rights violations were not enough, the \nNew York Times reported on July 22 that the Ethiopian military is \nblocking food aid to the Ogaden region. The article also claimed that \nthe military is ``siphoning off millions'' of dollars intended for food \naid and a UN polio eradication program. A subsequent article on July 26 \nindicated that the World Food Program and the Ethiopian Government have \nreached agreement, after weeks of discussions, on a process for getting \nfood aid through the military blockade to civilians in the Ogaden \nregion. But the same article also reported that regional Ethiopian \nofficials have expelled the Red Cross.\n  During the Cold War we supported some of the world's most brutal, \ncorrupt dictators because they were anti-Communist. Their people, and \nour reputation, suffered as a result. Now the White House seems to \nsupport just about anyone who says they are against terrorism, no \nmatter how undemocratic or corrupt. It is short sighted, it tarnishes \nour image, and it will cost us dearly in the long term.\n  Prime Minister Meles has been an ally against Islamic extremism in \nthe Horn of Africa, for which we are grateful. But there are serious \nconcerns with Ethiopia's U.S.-supported military invasion of Somalia. \nIt has led to some of the same problems associated with the Bush \nadministration's misguided decision to invade Iraq without a plan for \nleaving the country more stable and secure than before the overthrow of \nSaddam. Iraq's partition now seems only a matter of time, and it is \nhard to be optimistic that Somalia a year from now will be any more \nsecure, or any less of a threat to regional stability, than before the \ninflux of Ethiopian troops.\n  Ethiopia is also a poor country that has faced one natural or man-\nmade disaster after another, and the U.S. has responded with hundreds \nof millions of dollars in humanitarian and other assistance. We have a \nlong history of supporting Ethiopia and its people, and we want to \ncontinue that support. But our support to the government is not \nunconditional. We will not ignore the unlawful imprisonment of \npolitical opponents or the mistreatment of journalists. We will not \nignore reports of abuses of civilians by Ethiopian security forces\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10888-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10888-S10889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WIRED FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to explain \nthe action I am taking related to S. 1693, the Wired for Health Care \nQuality Act. Today, with great reluctance, I have asked Republican \nLeader McConnell to consult with us prior to any action regarding the \nconsideration of this bill, which the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee reported on August 1, 2007.\n  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would encourage the development \nof interoperable standards for health information technology, IT, offer \nincentives for providers to acquire qualified health IT systems to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of health care, and facilitate the \nsecure exchange of electronic health information. The bill also \nincludes provisions to require all federal agencies to comply with \nstandards and specifications adopted by the Federal Government for \npurposes determined appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, and to ensure quality measurement and reporting of \nprovider performance under the Public Health Service Act.\n  I fully support fostering the adoption of health information \ntechnology to assist providers in making quality improvements in our \nhealth care system. In 2005, Senator Baucus and I introduced the \nMedicare Value Purchasing Act, S. 1356, in conjunction with Senators \nEnzi and Kennedy's legislation known as the Better Healthcare Through \nInformation Technology Act, S. 1355. Although the Medicare Value \nPurchasing Act did not pass in its entirety, provisions based on our \nbill have been enacted in other legislation.\n  Medicare is the single largest purchaser of health care in the \nNation, so adopting quality payments in Medicare influences the level \nof quality in all of health care. We have seen time and time again how \nwhen Medicare leads, the other public and private purchasers follow. \nMedicare can drive quality improvement through payment incentives. The \nadoption of information technology is also desirable, both to \nfacilitate the reporting of quality measures and to increase the \nefficiency and quality of our health care system. These two concepts \nshould work together.\n  A number of legislative initiatives have been enacted in Medicare in \nrecent years to promote the development and reporting of quality \nmeasures. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act of 2003, MMA, included provisions that required the \nreporting of quality measures for inpatient hospitals. The Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005 expanded the reporting of quality measures for \ninpatient hospital services and extended quality measures to home \nhealth settings.\n  Last year, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, TRHCA, \nextended quality measure reporting to hospital outpatient services and \nambulatory service centers. TRHCA also authorized the 2007 Physician \nQuality Reporting Initiative, PQRI, a voluntary quality reporting \nsystem in Medicare for physicians and other eligible health care \nprofessionals. Beginning July 1, 2007, the new PQRI program provides \nMedicare incentive payments for the successful reporting of quality \nmeasures that have been adopted or endorsed by a consensus \norganization. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has \nworked diligently with the\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\nAmerican Medical Association Physician Consortium for Performance \nImprovement, the Ambulatory Quality Alliance, and the National Quality \nForum in the development, adoption, endorsement, and selection of \nquality measures for this program.\n  Considerable time and effort have been devoted to the development and \nreporting of quality measures for various providers in Medicare under \nthe Social Security Act. Many of these programs have now been up and \nrunning for some time. This is why I am greatly troubled that, as \ncurrently drafted, the Wired for Health Care Quality Act would require \nthe development and reporting of quality measures under the Public \nHealth Service Act.\n  It is hard to comprehend how the quality measurement system created \nby S. 1693 would interact with the various quality measurement programs \nthat have already been enacted by Congress under the Social Security \nAct and implemented by CMS. Creating two different quality measurement \nsystems would have the potential to create differing or even \nduplicative quality measurement systems which could drastically \ninterfere with our common goal of improving the quality of health care \nin this country.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary also would establish Federal standards \nand implementation specifications for data collection. Within three \nyears of their adoption, all Federal agencies would have to implement \nthese standards according to the specifications. While this sounds \nappealing, I am concerned about the reality of implementing such \nstandards--across the myriad programs at the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, Veterans Affairs, Defense, and all the other Federal \nagencies that may have health care data. It would be an enormous \nchallenge. Agencies collect data for many different purposes, using \nmany different data systems. Six years ago, when Secretary Thompson \nfirst arrived at the Department of Health and Human Services, the \ndepartment had eight different computer systems. Presumably other \nagencies similarly have multiple systems. All will be expensive and \ndifficult to retrofit to meet new federal standards.\n  The bill also would require the HHS Secretary to provide federal \nhealth data, including the Medicare claims databases, to at least three \n``Quality Reporting Organizations'' that agreed to provide public \nreports based on the data.\n  The Quality Reporting Organizations would be required to release \nregular reports on quality performance that are provider- and supplier-\nspecific. Any organization, including those with commercial interests, \ncould request that the Quality Reporting Organizations compile specific \nreports based on the requester's methodology. So, for example, drug \ncompanies could request data on physician prescribing patterns to \ndetermine which physicians their salespeople should target.\n  In overseeing Medicare, Congress is working to bring more quality \nreporting into the program. As I mentioned before, just this past \nDecember Congress enacted the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, \nwhich implemented a physician pay-for-reporting program in Medicare. \nThe Finance Committee has been working for some time now to phase-in \nthe use of quality measures with various providers. Eventually, I hope \nthat Medicare can compensate providers appropriately for providing \nhigh-quality care.\n  I am, however, concerned about public disclosure of provider-specific \ninformation without appropriate safeguards. If not used properly, the \ndata could be misinterpreted. For example, hospitals that specialize in \nvery difficult cases might seem to provide lower quality of care than \nthose treating less severe cases. This would set up the wrong \nincentives for hospitals and other health care providers.\n  I agree that it would be helpful to standardize data reporting \nthroughout the federal government, and to use that data appropriately \nto assess the quality of care provided by clinicians, hospitals, and \nother health care organizations. At the same time, I have serious \nconcerns about how this bill is structured with respect to the \ndisclosure and use of the data from federal health entitlement programs \nwhich are within the sole jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  I welcome the opportunity to work with the sponsors of S. 1693, \nSenators Kennedy, Enzi, Clinton, and Hatch, along with members of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on this matter. I had \nhoped we could work out an agreement on legislative language that was \nacceptable to both the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee before \nthe bill was on the floor. I appreciate the efforts that my colleagues, \nSenators Enzi and Kennedy, have undertaken with us over the last month \nto resolve the concerns of the Finance Committee. However, I remain \ndeeply troubled that, as currently drafted, the Wired for Health Care \nQuality Act could end up unintentionally delaying or frustrating the \ngoal we all share of improving the quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10889-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10889-S10894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REPORT OF SEC INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today along with Senator Specter, I \npresent the findings of a joint investigation by the minority staffs of \nthe Committees on Finance and the Judiciary. It will be posted today on \nthe Finance Committee Web site. I urge all my colleagues to read this \nimportant report.\n  Together, our committees conducted an extensive investigation of \nallegations raised by former Securities and Exchange Commission \nattorney Gary Aguirre concerning the SEC and insider trading at a major \nhedge fund.\n  During the course of this investigation, the staff reviewed roughly \n10,000 pages of documents and conducted over 30 witness interviews. The \nJudiciary Committee held three related hearings. Our joint findings \nconfirm a series of failures at the SEC: (1) Failures in its \nenforcement division, (2) failures in personnel practices, and (3) \nfailures at the Office of Inspector General.\n  There was, however, one bright spot. The Chairman of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission cooperated fully with our inquiry. I would like \nto take a moment to thank Chairman Christopher Cox for recognizing the \nvalue of congressional oversight instead of resisting it like most \nother agencies do. In my years in the Senate, I have overseen many \ninvestigations of Federal agencies. I am happy to say that Chairman \nCox--who inherited these problems in 2005--was a model of transparency \nand accountability.\n  I also thank Senator Specter for his hard work on this issue, and for \nthe way our committees were able to work together so effectively.\n  Our investigation focused on three allegations: (1) The SEC \nmishandled its investigation of a major hedge fund, Pequot Capital \nManagement. (2) The SEC fired Gary Aguirre, the lead attorney in the \nPequot investigation, after he reported evidence of political influence \ncorrupting the investigation. (3) The SEC's Office of Inspector General \nfailed to thoroughly investigate Aguirre's allegations.\n  In 2001, Pequot made about $18 million in just a few weeks of trading \nin advance of the public announcement that General Electric was \nacquiring Heller Financial. Pequot accomplished this by buying over a \nmillion shares of Heller Financial and shorting GE stock. The New York \nStock Exchange highlighted these suspicious and highly profitable \ntrades for the SEC.\n  When the SEC finally got around to investigating the matter 3 years \nlater, the only full-time attorney working on it, Mr. Aguirre, was up \nagainst an army of lawyers from Pequot and Morgan Stanley.\n  Those lawyers could easily bypass the commission staff and go \ndirectly to the Director of Enforcement. In other words, attorneys from \nWall Street law firms had better access to SEC management than the \nstaff attorney working on the case, and they used it.\n  When Aguirre wanted to question Wall Street executive John Mack, his \nsupervisors blocked his efforts and delayed the testimony as long as \nthey could. Mack was about to be hired as the CEO of Morgan Stanley. \nThis raised a critical question in our investigation: Did Mack get \nspecial treatment, and if so, why? Gary Aguirre was told by one of his \nsupervisors that it was because of his ``political connections.''\n  Our investigation uncovered no evidence that Mack's special treatment \nwas due to partisan politics. However, internal e-mails do show that \nSEC\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\nmanagers cared about something else: prominence--not partisanship.\n  They put hurdles in the way of taking Mack's testimony because he was \nan ``industry captain'' and well-known on Wall Street. His lawyers \nwould have ``juice,'' according to SEC management--meaning they could \neasily pick up the phone and talk to senior officials three and four \nlayers above Aguirre. Mack's prominence protected him from the initial \nSEC inquiry, protection that would not have been afforded to him had he \nbeen from Main Street rather than Wall Street.\n  Our investigation also found that Mr. Aguirre's firing from the SEC \nwas closely connected to his objections to the special treatment \nafforded to John Mack. Unfortunately, that was not the only retaliation \nwe found at the SEC. Another employee was also penalized for objecting \nto problems similar to Aguirre's. This sort of retaliatory firing of a \nwhistleblower is not acceptable, and must be stopped.\n  Finally, our investigation found failures at the SEC's Office of \nInspector General. When Mr. Aguirre presented the Inspector General's \noffice with serious allegations, there was no attempt to conduct a \nserious, credible investigation.\n  The Inspector General merely interviewed SEC management, accepted \ntheir side of the story, and closed the case. This is unacceptable. It \nis the role of the inspector general to be an independent finder of \nfact, not a rubberstamp for agency management. I understand that the \ncurrent inspector general is retiring, and his last day is today. I \nhope Chairman Cox chooses the next inspector general very carefully.\n  Our investigation has uncovered real failures at the SEC, and fixing \nthese problems will take real reform. We have proposed six \nrecommendations. These recommendations include the creation of a \nuniform, comprehensive manual of procedures for conducting enforcement \ninvestigations along the lines of the U.S. Attorney's Manual. If the \nSEC had such a manual, there would have been clear guidance regarding \nthe standard for issuing a subpoena to any suspected tipper, whether \nJohn Mack or John Q. Public.\n  Other recommendations include the reform of the SEC's Office of \nInspector General, firmer ethics requirements, and standardized \nevaluation procedures to prevent the sort of retaliatory personnel \npractices that took place with Gary Aguirre. By implementing real \nreforms such as those our report outlines, the SEC can begin to regain \npublic confidence, and I look forward to working with the SEC as these \nreforms are implemented.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord, the report's executive summary and list of recommendations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         II. Executive Summary\n\n       Pequot's trades in advance of the GE acquisition of Heller \n     Financial were highly suspicious and deserved a thorough \n     investigation. In the weeks after a conversation with John \n     Mack and prior to the public announcement of GE's acquisition \n     of Heller, Pequot CEO Arthur Samberg purchased over one \n     million shares of Heller Financial stock, and also shorted GE \n     shares. On the day the deal was announced, Samberg sold all \n     of the Heller stock. He also covered the short positions in \n     GE shortly thereafter, for a total profit of about $18 \n     million for Pequot in a matter of weeks.\n       The SEC examined only a fraction of the other suspicious \n     Pequot trading highlighted by Self-Regulatory Organizations \n     (SROs). GE-Heller represented just one of at least 17 sets of \n     suspicious transactions involving Pequot brought to the SEC's \n     attention by organizations like the NYSE and NASD. However, \n     SEC managers ordered the staff to focus on only a few \n     transactions. In addition to GE-Heller, the SEC investigated \n     trades involving (1) Microsoft, (2) Astra Zeneca and Par \n     Pharmaceutical, and (3) various ``wash sales.''\n       Staff Attorney Gary Aguirre said that his supervisor warned \n     him that it would be difficult to obtain approval for a \n     subpoena of John Mack due to his ``very powerful political \n     connections.'' Aguirre's claim is corroborated by internal \n     SEC e-mails, including one from his supervisor, Robert \n     Hanson. Hanson also told Aguirre that Mack's counsel would \n     have ``juice,'' meaning they could directly contact the \n     Director or an Associate Director of Enforcement.\n       Attorneys for Pequot and Morgan Stanley had direct access \n     to the Director and an Associate Director of the SEC's \n     Enforcement Division. In January 2005, Pequot's lead counsel \n     met with the SEC Director of Enforcement Stephen Cutler. \n     Shortly thereafter, SEC managers ordered the case to be \n     narrowed considerably. In June 2005, Morgan Stanley's Board \n     of Directors hired former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White to \n     determine whether prospective CEO John Mack had any exposure \n     in the Pequot investigation. White contacted Director of \n     Enforcement Linda Thomsen directly, and other Morgan Stanley \n     officials contacted Associate Director Paul Berger. Soon \n     afterward, SEC managers prohibited the staff from asking John \n     Mack about his communications with Arthur Samberg at Pequot.\n       Seeking John Mack's testimony was a reasonable next step in \n     the investigation. Several SEC staff wished to take Mack's \n     testimony because they believed he: (1) had close ties to \n     Samberg, (2) had potential access to advanced knowledge of \n     the deal, (3) had spoken to Samberg just before Pequot \n     started buying Heller and shorting GE, and (4) was an \n     investor in Pequot funds and was allowed to share in a \n     lucrative direct investment in a (5) start-up company \n     alongside Pequot, possibly as a reward for providing inside \n     information.\n       SEC management delayed Mack's testimony for over a year, \n     until days after the statute of limitations expired. After \n     Aguirre complained about his supervisor's reference to Mack's \n     ``political clout,'' SEC management offered conflicting and \n     shifting explanations for blocking Mack's testimony. Although \n     Paul Berger claimed that the SEC had always intended to take \n     Mack's testimony, Branch Chief Mark Kreitman said that \n     definitive proof that Mack knew about the GE-Heller deal was \n     the ``necessary prerequisite'' for taking his testimony. The \n     SEC eventually took Mack's testimony only after the Senate \n     Committees began investigating and after Aguirre's \n     allegations became public, even though it had not met \n     Kreitman's prerequisite.\n       The SEC fired Gary Aguirre after he reported his \n     supervisor's comments about Mack's ``political connections,'' \n     despite positive performance reviews and a merit pay raise. \n     Just days after Aguirre sent an e-mail to Associate Director \n     Paul Berger detailing his allegations, his supervisors \n     prepared a negative re-evaluation outside the SEC's ordinary \n     performance appraisal process. They prepared a negative re-\n     evaluation of only one other employee. Like Aguirre, that \n     employee had recently sent an e-mail complaining about a \n     similar situation where he believed SEC managers limited an \n     investigation following contact between outside counsel and \n     the Director of Enforcement.\n       After being contacted by a friend in early September 2005, \n     Associate Director Paul Berger authorized the friend to \n     mention his interest in a job with Debevoise & Plimpton. \n     Although that was the same firm that contacted the SEC for \n     information about John Mack's exposure in the Pequot \n     investigation, Berger did not immediately recuse himself from \n     the Pequot probe. Berger ultimately left the SEC to join \n     Debevoise & Plimpton. When initially questioned, Berger's \n     answers concerning his employment search were less than \n     forthcoming.\n       The SEC's Office of Inspector General failed to conduct a \n     serious, credible investigation of Aguirre's claims. The OIG \n     did not attempt to contact Aguirre. It merely interviewed his \n     supervisors informally on the telephone, accepted their \n     statements at face-value, and closed the case without \n     obtaining key evidence. The OIG made no written document \n     requests of Aguirre's supervisors and failed to interview SEC \n     witnesses whom Aguirre had identified in his complaint as \n     likely to corroborate his allegations.\n\n                          III. Recommendations\n\n       The controversy over allegations of improper political \n     influence and the firing of SEC attorney Gary Aguirre \n     garnered considerable media attention. The public airing of \n     evidence in support of those allegations undoubtedly had an \n     adverse impact on public confidence in the SEC. The damage to \n     public confidence in the SEC as a fair and impartial \n     regulator must be repaired if the agency is to be effective \n     and able to fulfill its mission.\n       However, the controversy is more than merely an issue of \n     perception. Our investigation uncovered real failures that \n     need real solutions. Our recommendations focus on improving \n     the Commission's approach to the management of complex \n     securities investigations, personnel problems, the handling \n     of ethics issues, and the role of the Inspector General. A \n     more standardized, professional system for dealing with these \n     issues could have averted much of the controversy. It could \n     also improve employee morale and confidence in management by \n     ensuring more consistent, documented, transparent, and \n     careful internal deliberations.\n       For these reasons, we offer the following recommendations \n     for consideration:\n       1. Standardized Investigative Procedures: The SEC should \n     draft and maintain a uniform, comprehensive manual of \n     procedures for conducting enforcement investigations, along \n     the lines of the United States Attorney's Manual. The manual \n     should attempt to address situations or issues likely to \n     recur. It should set a consistent SEC policy where possible \n     and provide general guidance for complex issues that require \n     individual assessment on a case-by-case basis, so that \n     inquiries are handled as uniformly as possible throughout the \n     Enforcement Division.\n       2. Directing Resources to Significant and Complex Cases: \n     The SEC currently lacks a set of objective criteria for \n     setting staffing\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\n     levels and has no mechanism for designating a case as \n     critically important. The SEC should set standards for \n     assessing the size, complexity, and importance of cases to \n     ensure that significant cases receive more resources. The \n     Enforcement Division should develop and apply objective \n     criteria for determining how many attorneys, paralegals, and \n     support personnel should be assigned to a particular case.\n       3. Transparent and Uniform External Communications: The SEC \n     should issue written guidance requiring supervisors to keep \n     complete and reliable records of all outside communications \n     regarding any investigation. The need for a clear record and \n     transparency is especially acute regarding any communications \n     by supervisors that exclude the staff attorney assigned to \n     the case. The SEC's guidance should generally discourage \n     supervisors from engaging in such communications without the \n     knowledge or participation of the lead staff attorney. The \n     SEC needs to present one, consistent position to parties \n     involved in its investigations.\n       4. Greater Office of Inspector General (OIG) Independence \n     and More Thorough Investigative Procedures: The hallmarks of \n     any good Inspector General are independence and integrity. \n     However, the reputation of the Inspector General within the \n     SEC appears to be that of an office closely aligned with \n     management, lacking independence. In addition to the facts of \n     the Aguirre case, we received numerous complaints about the \n     OIG from both current and former SEC employees. The OIG \n     should develop a plan to ensure independence from SEC \n     management and the General Counsel's Office, and to ensure \n     that its future investigations of allegations against \n     management are thorough, fair, and credible. The SEC needs to \n     implement a directive requiring its Office of Information \n     Technology to provide thorough and timely responses to SEC/\n     OIG document requests. Since the purpose of the OIG is to \n     ensure integrity and efficiency, a document request in \n     connection with an SEC/OIG investigation should be among the \n     highest priorities.\n       5. Timely and Transparent Recusals: The SEC should review \n     its guidance to employees regarding their obligations to \n     recuse themselves immediately from any matter involving a \n     potential employer with whom the employee has had contact, \n     either directly or indirectly through an agent. Recusals \n     should be communicated in writing to all SEC staff who have \n     official contact with the recused individual, and a record of \n     the recusals should be centrally maintained by a designated \n     ethics officer. The appearance created by having undisclosed \n     contacts with potential employers while still participating \n     in an enforcement matter involving that potential employer \n     undermines public confidence in the fairness and impartiality \n     of the SEC.\n       6. Standardized Evaluation Procedures: Employee evaluations \n     should be submitted in a timely manner, according to an \n     established schedule. Evaluations should not be prepared \n     outside or apart from the established procedure. Although it \n     is appropriate to document performance issues and to discuss \n     them with the employee as the issues arise, submitting a re-\n     evaluation with substantive changes after the regularly \n     scheduled evaluation is submitted can raise questions. Where \n     the re-evaluation occurs just after an employee reports \n     alleged wrongdoing by a supervisor, it tends to suggest that \n     retaliation is driving the process rather than an honest \n     attempt to evaluate employee performance.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition, along with my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to inform the full Senate of the \nconclusion of our joint investigation into allegations of abuse of \nauthority at the Securities and Exchange Commission and of the \navailability of our findings and recommendations. On January 31, 2007, \nSenator Grassley and I came to the floor and submitted the ``Specter-\nGrassley Interim Findings on the Investigation Into Potential Abuse of \nAuthority at the Securities and Exchange Commission.'' Senator Grassley \nand I did not want to delay in expressing our concerns about, No. 1 the \nSEC's mishandling of the investigation of potential massive insider \ntrading by a hedge fund which we recommended be reopened; No. 2, the \ncircumstances of the termination of SEC attorney Gary Aguirre, who was \nleading the investigation; and No. 3, the manner in which the SEC's \nInspector General's Office handled Aguirre's allegations that he was \nterminated for improper reasons, including pressing too hard to \ninterview a witness in the investigation. We were concerned about what \nappeared to be managerial interference with the independence and \ndoggedness of an SEC attorney who was determined to follow the evidence \nwherever it might lead.\n  Today, we file our comprehensive report and recommendations--\ncomprising nearly 100 pages of annotated findings and recommendations--\nwith the Senate Judiciary and Finance Committees. Before I summarize \nthe key findings and recommendations, I must commend the SEC for two \naspects of its response to Congress. First, the SEC, despite some \ninitial disputes and letters relating to document production and \nprivilege, ultimately cooperated fully with Congress by producing all \nrequested documents and permitting all witnesses to be interviewed \nunder oath and with a transcript. Second, Chairman Cox, the other \nCommissioners, and SEC Director of Enforcement Linda Thomsen have \nclearly been listening to concerns we raised about insider trading in \ngeneral and in particular suspicious trading ahead of mergers on the \npart of hedge funds and others with access to material nonpublic \ninformation as a result of the intertwined relationships in our \nfinancial sector. Since the Judiciary Committee began holding hearings \non insider trading and related fraud in June 2006, the SEC has filed a \nnumber of substantial civil cases--often in coordination with the \nDepartment of Justice, which handles criminal matters. Linda Thomsen \ntestified at the Judiciary Committee hearing on September 26, 2006 that \n``[r]igorous enforcement of our current statutory and regulatory \nprohibition on insider trading is an important part of the Commission's \nmission.'' This appears to be the case.\n  In February 2007, the SEC charged seven individuals and two hedge \nfunds with insider trading ahead of announcements by Taro \nPharmaceuticals Industries regarding earnings and FDA drug approvals. \nFour of the individuals were in their early thirties or younger and \nworked at major accounting and law firms.\n  In March 2007, the SEC and Federal prosecutors filed charges against \na dozen defendants, including a former Morgan Stanley compliance \nofficer who pleaded guilty in May 2007 to charges that she and her \nhusband sold information about four deals--including Adobe Systems \nInc.'s $3.4 billion purchase of Macromedia and the $2.1 billion \nacquisition of Argosy Gaming by Penn National Gaming, Inc.--to \nindividuals who used the information in trading for hedge fund Q \nCapital Investment Partners and other accounts.\n  In March 2007, the SEC charged a 41-year-old UBS research executive \nwith selling information about upcoming UBS upgrades and downgrades of \nthe stock of Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs, and other companies. The \ninformation was then used in trading on behalf of hedge funds Lyford \nCay, Chelsea Capital and Q Capital Investment Partners.\n  In May 2007, a 37-year-old Credit Suisse investment banker was \ncharged with insider trading for leaking details of acquisitions \ninvolving nine publicly traded U.S. companies including the $45 billion \ntakeover of TXU Corp by a private equity firm. He also leaked \ninformation on deals involving Northwestern Corporation, Energy \nPartners, Veritas DGC, Jacuzzi Brands, Trammel Crow Co., Hydril \nCompany, Caremark RX, and John H. Harland Co.\n  In May 2007, the SEC accused a former analyst at Morgan Stanley and \nher husband, a former analyst in the hedge fund group at ING, of making \nmore than $600,000 by trading on companies advised by Morgan Stanley's \nreal estate subsidiary.\n  In May 2007, the SEC obtained a court order requiring Barclays Bank \nto pay $10.9 million--including a $6 million penalty--for insider \ntrading based on material nonpublic information obtained by its head \ntrader, who served on bankruptcy creditors committees.\n  In June 2007, the SEC filed a complaint alleging that a former bank \nvice president had traded in securities of a bank that he learned would \nbe acquired by another bank.\n  In June 2007, the SEC filed a complaint alleging unlawful insider \ntrading by the former managing partner of the Washington, DC office of \na large law firm who learned of an imminent acquisition from a job \ncandidate.\n  In July 2007, a court sentenced a corporate executive to a 6-year \njail term, and ordered him to forfeit $52 million, in a case involving \nmore traditional insider trading executed by a company executive in his \nown company's stock.\n  These aggressive enforcement efforts send a strong message to the \npublic, and we commend the SEC for ensuring that action accompanies \ntheir assurances to Congress and to the public. I point out the ages of \nsome of those charged because it strikes me that they may not have \nlived through the insider trading scandals of the 1980s that resulted \nin jail sentences for some very prominent businessmen. Though\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\ntime has passed since those scandals, there continues to be a need to \nreinforce that insider trading is a serious violation of the law. \nFollowing our hearings and investigation, the SEC appears to have \nreasserted itself.\n\n  On March 1, 2007, in announcing charges against 14 individuals in a \nbrazen insider trading scheme, Chairman Cox stated: ``Our action today \nis one of several that will make it very clear the SEC is targeting \nhedge fund insider trading as a top priority.'' Linda Thomsen, Director \nof the SEC's Division of Enforcement, recently stated that the SEC has \nmade insider trading ahead of mergers and acquisition one of its top \npriorities. Peter Bresnan, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of \nEnforcement, stated in a CNBC interview on May 11, 2007: ``Hedge fund \nmanagers are under enormous pressure to show profits for their clients. \n. . . Not every hedge fund manager can get those kinds of returns \nthrough legitimate trading.'' Bruce Karpati, an Assistant Regional \nDirector in the SEC's New York office stated in May 2007 that the SEC \nis ``actively studying the relationships that hedge funds have both \ninside the hedge funds and outside'' to see how information flows \naround financial markets and that the SEC is also looking at ``more \ncomplex trading strategies'' at hedge funds. Also in May 2007, when the \nSEC filed charges against a Hong Kong couple and alleged that they had \nillegally traded ahead of News Corp.'s offer to buy Dow Jones, Cheryl \nScarboro, SEC Associate Enforcement Director, stated: ``Cases like \nthis, insider trading ahead of mergers, are a top priority and we will \ncontinue our pursuit of it, no matter where it occurs.''\n  Finally, in early 2007 it was widely reported that the SEC had begun \na factfinding study of the relationships that hedge fund advisers have \nwith brokerages to determine if those contacts could have led to \ninsider trading. The SEC had specifically requested information about \nstock and options trading by major firms. It is encouraging to see that \nthe SEC's rhetoric is increasingly matched by real cases against those \nwho subvert our capital markets through insider trading.\n  On the other hand, we agree with Peter Bresnan, who recently \nexpressed dismay over the number of Wall Street professionals involved \nin these cases, from investment bankers and advisers to lawyers and \naccountants. ``When we see Wall Street professionals engage in insider \ntrading, it is particularly reprehensible because we rely on them to \nkeep the markets fair and clean.'' As I stated during the Judiciary \nCommittee hearings, although disgorgement and civil penalties in these \ncases are a good start, I will continue to press for jail terms for \nthose who engage in fraudulent conduct that harms other investors, \nespecially when those who commit fraud are in positions of trust.\n  With respect to our investigation and final report, Senator Grassley \nand I were primarily concerned about three aspects of a single case of \ninsider trading: First, the handling of the investigation of what some \nat the SEC believed was one of the largest insider trading cases in \nrecent history; second, the timing of the firing of Gary Aguirre, one \nof the lead investigators on the case; and third, the worse-than-\ncursory inspector general investigation of Mr. Aguirre's claims of \nimproper discharge. All of this presented a troubling picture that \ncenters on apparently lax enforcement by the SEC.\n  The alleged insider trading occurred in July 2001, several weeks \nbefore the public announcement that GE would purchase Heller Financial. \nDuring the lead-up to the announcement, Pequot CEO Arthur Samberg began \npurchasing large quantities of Heller Financial stock while also \nshorting GE stock. Two years later, the SEC began an investigation. \nDespite several promising leads, the investigation was left to wither \nwhen the lead attorney, Gary Aguirre, was abruptly fired with little \nexplanation. When Aguirre complained to Commissioner Cox about the \ncircumstances of the termination, Chairman Cox instructed the inspector \ngeneral to investigate. The inspector general's staff, however, did so \nwith the stated view that they were not going to ``second guess'' \nAguirre's managers. Perhaps for this reason, the inspector general did \nnot interview Aguirre or the other employees named in Aguirre's letters \nto Chairman Cox, choosing instead to accept the managers' explanations \nat face valueeven the explanations that were inconsistent with SEC \nprocedures and some of the documentary evidence submitted by Aguirre.\n  What was Gary Aguirre investigating? As explained at our hearings, \nwhen an acquisition like the GE-Heller deal is announced, the price of \nthe purchasing company typically falls and the price of the purchased \ncompany typically rises. This is an opportunity for guaranteed, quick \nand easy profits. Samberg directed the purchase of ``a little over a \nmillion shares'' of Heller stock. On several days, the shares he sought \nto purchase exceeded the total volume of trading that day. On January \n30, 2002, the NYSE ``highlighted'' these trades for the SEC as a matter \nthat warranted further scrutiny and surveillance. Yet it was not until \n2004, when Gary Aguirre joined the Commission, that an investigation \nbegan in earnest. Mr. Aguirre became the driving force behind the \ninvestigation of the GE Heller trades.\n  Aguirre's immediate supervisors were initially enthusiastic about the \ninvestigation and the identification of John Mack as the possible \ntipper. On June 14, 2005, Mr. Aguirre's supervisors authorized him to \nspeak to Federal prosecutors concerning the trades. His immediate \nmanager, Robert Hanson, wrote in an e-mail on June 20, 2005, ``Okay \nGary you've given me the bug. I'm starting to think about the case \nduring my non work hours.'' But the enthusiasm quickly waned at some \npoint after newspapers reported on June 23, 2005, that Morgan Stanley \nwas considering hiring John Mack as its new CEO. Aguirre testified that \nthe timing was no coincidence and that his supervisor, Robert Hanson, \nwould not let him take Mack's testimony because of his ``powerful \npolitical contacts.'' Hanson later sent Aguirre e-mails that mentioned \nMack's ``juice'' and ``political clout.'' Hanson, for his part, later \nexplained that he simply wanted to make sure that the SEC had gotten \n``their ducks in a row'' before taking drastic action.\n\n  Although reasonable minds may disagree on an appropriate \ninvestigative strategy, the SEC's stated rationale for delaying the \ntaking of Mack's testimony runs counter to the normal approach \ndescribed to the committees' staff by insider trading experts at the \nSEC. Hilton Foster, an experienced former SEC investor with knowledge \nof the Pequot matter, stated that ``as the SEC expert on insider \ntrading, if people had asked me when do you take his testimony, I would \nhave said take it yesterday.'' The explanation offered by Aguirre's \nsupervisors--that without direct evidence that Mack had knowledge of \nthe GE transaction, the deposition would consist simply of a denial by \nMack--is not at all convincing since the SEC eventually did question \nMack for over 4 hours in August 2006 without such direct evidence.\n  Mack's testimony was taken 5 days after the statute of limitations \nexpired. We note that shortly after Aguirre's termination, the SEC \nMarket Surveillance Branch Chief sought removal from the Pequot \ninvestigation, stating that ``something smells rotten.'' We note that \nthis chief was a reluctant witness who came forward to the committees \nto do the right thing. Despite a number of such SEC employees, with \nAguirre gone and a change in staff on the Pequot case, the trail seems \nto have grown cold and any evidence likely lost.\n  With respect to our recommendations, we start by noting that the \ncommittees adduced documents and testimony showing that Gary Aguirre, a \nprobationary employee while at the SEC, was an experienced, smart, \nhard-working, aggressive attorney who was passionately dedicated to the \nPequot investigation. These attributes were noted in a June 1, 2005, \nperformance plan and evaluation. A more detailed ``Merit Pay'' \nevaluation written by Hanson on January 29, 2005, noted Aguirre's \nunmatched dedication ``to the Pequot investigation'' and \n``contributions of high quality.'' These evaluations were submitted to \nthe SEC's Compensation Committee, which approved a two-step salary \nincrease recommendation on July 18, 2005. After these favorable \nreviews, Aguirre's managers wrote a ``supplemental evaluation,'' on \nAugust 1 that included negative assessments. The document was\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\nnever shared with Aguirre, who received a notice of termination exactly \n1 month later, on September 1. To the extent that there was \ncontemporaneous documentation, little appears to support the assertion \nthat the decision to terminate was based on poor performance or \nemployee misconduct, which leaves open the possibility that the \ndischarge was for improper reasons.\n  More disturbing, however, is the cursory investigation of Aguirre's \nallegations by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, headed by Walter \nStachnik. Chairman Cox referred the matter to Stachnik, who failed to \ninterview Aguirre or any of the other SEC employees mentioned in Mr. \nAguirre's letter. The IG's investigators repeatedly told staff that in \ninvestigating Mr. Aguirre's allegations of improper motivation for his \ntermination that they ``don't second guess management decisions . . . \n[and they] don't second guess why employees are terminated.'' These \nstatements are troubling. After speaking only to Aguirre's supervisors \nabout the facts and accepting everything they said at face value, the \nIG staff reviewed only those documents identified by Aguirre's \nmanagers.\n  This is not a recipe for an independent and thorough investigation. \nEven after committee hearings, Stachnik insisted that his investigation \nwas ``professional,'' but he did reopen the IG investigation. \nUnfortunately, as part of the reopened investigation, Stachnik sought \ndocuments in Aguirre's possession, including documents that were \ncommunications between Aguirre and the Senate. When Aguirre balked, \nStachnik asked the Department of Justice to petition a Federal court to \nenforce the subpoena. If Chairman Cox had been able to obtain a timely, \nobjective, and thorough consideration of Aguirre's concerns, the Pequot \ninvestigation may have been put back on track shortly after Aguirre's \ntermination. Because the Chairman did not have the benefit of a careful \nreview by the IG, we will never know what would have happened.\n  In light of this, and based on the committees' investigation, we make \ncertain recommendations intended to help the SEC remedy obvious \nshortcomings in order for it to avoid an undermining of public \nconfidence in the agency. The reputation of the SEC as a fair and \nimpartial regulator must be restored. I note that through our \ninvestigation, we determined that what we have is not merely an issue \nof perception. There are real failures that need real solutions to \nimprove the management of complex securities investigations; the \nhandling of ethics concerns and issues; and personnel policies and \nprocedures to increase employee morale and confidence in management and \nto ensure more consistency, transparency, and careful internal \ndeliberations.\n\n  The SEC should draft and maintain a comprehensive manual of \nprocedures for conducting enforcement investigations, along the lines \nof the U.S. Attorney's Manual. The manual should address situations and \nissues likely to recur, including a section outlining all SEC policies \nrelated to the issuance of subpoenas. It should set a consistent SEC \npolicy and provide general guidance for complex issues that require \nindividual assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n  Among other policy changes, the SEC should begin to conduct regularly \nscheduled, confidential employee surveys to measure confidence in \nsenior management. Such responses should be reviewed and evaluated by \nthe inspector general as potential predicates for audits, \ninvestigations, or recommendations to senior management. The SEC should \nalso revise its policies on disclosing nonpublic information to third \nparties.\n  The SEC currently lacks a set of objective criteria for setting \nstaffing levels and has no mechanism for designating a case as mission \ncritical. The SEC should set standards for assessing the size, \ncomplexity, and importance of cases to ensure that significant cases \nreceive more resources. The Enforcement Division should develop \nobjective criteria for determining how many attorneys, paralegals, and \nsupport personnel should be assigned to a particular case. It may be \nunavoidable that the SEC often will have fewer resources than the \nentities the agency regulates, but effective staffing could help the \nSEC avoid being outmatched when it matters most.\n  The SEC should issue written guidance requiring supervisors to keep \ncomplete records of all external communications regarding any \ninvestigation. As a starting point for drafting such a policy, the SEC \nshould review and consider adopting an approach similar to that of the \nFood and Drug Administration in 21 C.F.R. section 10.65. The need for a \nclear record and transparency is especially acute regarding any \ncommunications by supervisors that exclude the staff attorney assigned \nto the case. Allowing outside counsel and interested parties to \ncircumvent the staff attorney by dealing separately with higher level \nofficials may undermine the investigation and also undermine the goals \nof consistency, impartiality, and professionalism.\n  The SEC Office of Inspector General should develop a plan to ensure \nindependence from SEC management and the General Counsel's Office. Such \na plan must ensure that the SEC's investigations of allegations against \nmanagement are thorough, fair, and credible. The OIG should submit its \nplan to Congress for review and followup oversight.\n  Equally as important, employees should have confidence that they have \nconfidential alternate channels of communication through which both \nreal problems and misperceptions may be resolved early and without \npublic controversy. Personnel procedures should be regularly audited \nand reviewed to ensure that they are fairly and consistently applied.\n  All SEC inspector general audit and investigation reports should be \navailable to Congress, on a confidential basis when appropriate. The \ndetail, quality, and volume of reports from the Inspector General's \nOffice need to be improved dramatically.\n  The SEC should review its guidance to employees regarding their \nobligations to disclose any connections with potential employers and \nrecuse themselves from any matter involving those employers. The \nappearance created by having undisclosed contacts with potential \nemployers while still participating in an enforcement matter involving \nthat employer undermines public confidence in the fairness and \nimpartiality of the SEC.\n  Employee evaluations should be submitted in a timely manner, \naccording to an established schedule. Evaluations should not be \nprepared outside or apart from the established procedure. The process \nshould be audited regularly, and supervisors who fail to follow the \nprocedures should face meaningful consequences. Although it is \nappropriate to document and discuss performance issues as they arise, \nsubmitting a reevaluation with substantive changes after the regularly \nscheduled evaluation is submitted can raise questions--especially when \nit occurs just after an employee reports alleged wrongdoing by a \nsupervisor.\n  In conclusion, I will comment on an issue that was the subject of \nmuch discussion during the investigation whether hedge funds should be \nsubject to greater regulation. With baby boomers beginning to retire, \npension funds are moving more of their assets out of fairly \nconservative stocks and bond portfolios and increasing their \ninvestments in hedge funds. This shift comes as hedge fund returns are \ncooling. As just one example, the Amaranth fund, which made risky bets \non natural gas, collapsed in September 2006. On July 25, 2007, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission charged the fund and its chief \nenergy trader with trying to manipulate the natural gas markets.\n  Hedge funds are fiercely protective of their trading strategies, and \nthey are hard to value because they are not actively traded. Unlike \nmutual funds, they are not required to register with the SEC or \ndisclose their holdings. In addition, they may borrow as much as 10 \ntimes their cash holdings to execute their investment strategies. For \nthis reason, many say that there is an inconsistency between the high-\nrisk, high-return concept behind hedge funds and the low-risk, \nguaranteed return goal of pension funds. Pension funds may have \nconsultants and sophisticated money managers, but even they can be \ntripped up, as evidenced by the fact that Bear Stearns, a Wall street \nfirm known for its caution and its expertise in bond-treading, notified \nclients this month that their investment\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\nin two prominent hedge funds were worth pennies on the dollar. Those \nfunds made bets on risky bonds backed by subprime mortgages.\n  Individuals, like managers of the pension funds of middle class \nworkers, have also begun to increase their investments in hedge funds. \nOnce limited to the wealthy, hedge funds are now available to retail \ninvestors through funds of funds. By pooling money, funds of funds \nallow investors who do not have the minimum investments or assets to \ngain access to the hedge fund club.\n  Because of my concern for these investors, I will continue to study \nthe question of increased transparency and effective regulation of \nhedge funds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10894-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PESTICIDE REGISTRATION IMPROVEMENT RENEWAL ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nPesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act. It reauthorizes the \nhighly successful Pesticide Registration Improvement Act, PRIA, which \nwas modeled on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and enacted as part \nof the 2004 omnibus appropriations bill.\n  PRIA authorized the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to \ncollect service fees in order to help cover the cost of registering new \npesticides. It also authorized EPA to continue to collect fees to \nreview older pesticides. PRIA established a fee schedule for pesticide \nregistration requests and set specific time periods for EPA to make \nregulatory decisions on pesticide registration and tolerance requests. \nThe goal of PRIA was to create a more predictable and effective \nevaluation process for pesticide registration decisions and link the \ncollection of individual fees with specific decision review periods.\n  PRIA was developed through the work of a unique coalition of \nenvironmental associations and the registrant community, which included \nagricultural and non-agricultural, antimicrobial, large, small, \nbiotech, and biopesticide companies. This same coalition came together \nto develop this legislative proposal to reauthorize PRIA.\n  This is true consensus legislation. It clarifies the intent of the \noriginal law and continues the fee-for-service program, with some \ntechnical adjustments. Specifically, it increases and clarifies \ncategories covered, uses maintenance fees for registration review, \nprotects funds for grant programs, increases funding, and prevents \nfree-riding.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor and support this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve its reauthorization and continue the positive \nchanges PRIA brought to the pesticide registration process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10894-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     OBJECTION TO RIZZO NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, most of my colleagues are well aware that I \nhave been pushing for a ban on the practice of anonymous holds for \nseveral years. I believe that holds are an acceptable parliamentary \ntactic, but I firmly believe that it is inappropriate for Senators to \nuse them secretly. If Senators wish to object to the consideration of a \nparticular bill or executive nominee, they should be required to do so \npublicly, so that their objections can be discussed and debated in full \nview of the American people. Today, I am announcing my objection to any \nunanimous consent request to bring the nomination of John Rizzo to the \nSenate floor for approval.\n  The President has nominated Mr. Rizzo to be General Counsel of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, CIA. When Mr. Rizzo appeared before the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence a few weeks ago, I asked him \nabout a now-infamous legal opinion that was prepared by the Department \nof Justice in 2002. This opinion, commonly known as the ``Bybee memo'' \nincludes shocking interpretations of U.S. torture laws, and essentially \nconcludes that inflicting any physical pain short of organ failure is \nnot torture. Most Americans would agree that this conclusion is over \nthe line, and this is why the Administration revoked the memo as soon \nas it became public.\n  John Rizzo was the acting general counsel of the CIA at that time, \nand I asked him if, in hindsight, he wished that he had objected to \nthis memo. I was disappointed to hear him say, even with the benefit of \nfive years' hindsight, that he did not.\n  Much more recently, about 2 weeks ago the President issued an \nExecutive order interpreting Common Article Three of the Geneva \nConventions and how it applies to CIA detentions and interrogations. \nThis Executive order refers to classified CIA guidelines. I have read \nthese guidelines, and I believe that they have suffered from a clear \nlack of effective legal oversight. Since John Rizzo is once again \nacting general counsel of the CIA, I believe that he bears significant \nresponsibility for this situation. I am not at all convinced that the \ntechniques outlined in these guidelines are effective, nor am I \nconvinced that they stay within the law.\n  The last thing that I want to see is hard-working, well-intentioned \nCIA officers breaking the law because they have been given shaky legal \nguidance. These men and women dedicate their lives to serving their \ncountry, and they deserve better than that. They deserve to know that \nthey are on firm legal ground when they are doing their jobs, and that \nthey can rely on the legal advice of their general counsel.\n  I should also note that I disagree with the President's decision to \ninterpret the Geneva Conventions as broadly as he did, although this \ndoes not excuse Mr. Rizzo from responsibility. The Director of National \nIntelligence, Mike McConnell, discussed these techniques on television \nrecently and stated that he wouldn't want any Americans to undergo \nthem. I don't think it would be acceptable to use these techniques on \nAmericans either, but the President's new interpretation of the Geneva \nConventions says that it is okay for other countries to use them on \nAmericans when they are captured. This is also unacceptable.\n  I believe that you can fight terrorism ferociously without tossing \naside American laws and American values, and I worry that the \nadministration and CIA lawyers may be losing sight of this. I was \ndisappointed to hear John Rizzo say that he did not wish he had \nobjected to the 2002 torture memo, and I was even more disappointed \nwhen I read these guidelines. Our intelligence agencies cannot fight \nterrorism effectively unless programs like this one are on a solid \nlegal footing. Mr. Rizzo's record demonstrates that he is prepared to \nlet major programs go forward without a firm legal foundation in place.\n  This is why I have come to the conclusion that John Rizzo is not \nqualified to be the general counsel of the CIA. I plan to vote against \nMr. Rizzo's confirmation in committee, and when it comes to the floor I \nwill object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider his \nnomination until I am satisfied that our national counterterrorism \nprograms, and particularly the CIA detention program, have the solid \nlegal foundation that they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10894-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10894-S10895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CFIUS\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I applaud the signing of the Foreign \nInvestment and National Security Act of 2007 by President Bush. After \nmore than a year and a half of work, this critical piece of legislation \nwas finally signed into law on July 26, 2007. I would also like to \ncommend Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby, my colleagues on the Banking \nCommittee for their leadership in forging bipartisan legislation that \nwill further protect critical U.S. assets and infrastructure from \npredatory foreign control.\n  This much needed legislation updates, reforms, and provides \ntransparency to the review process conducted by the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States, CFIUS. This Act will ensure \nnational security while promoting foreign investment and the creation \nand maintenance of U.S. jobs. As we have seen over the last couple of \nyears with the Dubai Ports and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, \nCNOOC, issues, greater oversight and transparency is needed for foreign \ninvestment in the United States.\n  This legislation also clarifies and expands the term ``national \nsecurity'' to include those issues related to ``homeland security,'' \nincluding its application to critical infrastructure. The ct\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\nalso lays out additional factors to be considered during the CFIUS \nreview process as they relate to our ``national security.''\n  I would like to address two of these factors today as they relate to \na real threat in our hemisphere and to the United States. The act \nrequires that CFIUS review any transaction related to major U.S. energy \nassets as part of our critical infrastructure and any covered \ntransaction that would result in the control of any critical U.S. \ninfrastructure by a foreign government or an entity controlled by a \nforeign government.\n  I raise these issues because I am particularly concerned by the \nrecent, and ongoing, actions of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez \nagainst U.S. oil companies in Venezuela. While Venezuela has undertaken \nmany actions to the detriment of U.S. companies, President Chavez and \nPetroleos de Venezuela have been courting government-controlled Russian \nand Iranian oil interests to take their place.\n  It is no secret that Hugo Chavez is an enemy of the United States, \nthe liberty and freedom we stand for, and the open and honest commerce \nthat is the life-blood of our economy. It is also no secret that \nPresident Chavez will use whatever assets are at his disposal to harm \nour country. The lone tool in his kit is Venezuela's oil and gas \nwealth.\n  Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. already has a footprint in America \nthrough the ownership of CITGO Petroleum Corporation. While the CITGO \ngas stations you see on the roadsides and corners of American streets \nare franchised and owned largely by American small business men and \nwomen, these gas stations rely upon Petroleos de Venezuela and Hugo \nChavez for their gas supply.\n  Because the revenue it generates supports the Venezuelan economy, we \nmight think it is a far-fetched idea that Hugo Chavez and Petroleos de \nVenezuela would cut off oil and gas supplies to the United States, or \nother Nations. Yet one only has to look at the actions of the Russian \nGovernment to see how energy supplies can be used as an economic and \npolitical weapon against other nations.\n  The Russian strategy of using the power of energy assets as an \neconomic tool began in 2003 when the Russian Government expropriated \nthe assets of Yukos Oil, at that time, Russia's largest privately owned \nenergy company. The Russian Government took Yukos assets without \ncompensation to Yukos owners or investors and these assets also \nincluded $6 billion of U.S. investors' money.\n  In the winter of 2006, the Russian Government cut off natural gas \nexports to the Ukraine in an attempt to pressure the Ukrainian \nGovernment to slow its democratic reforms and move toward the West. \nLater in 2006, Russia also cut off crude shipments to Lithuania in an \nattempt to stop the sale of a refinery to a Polish competitor. And \nearlier this year, the Russian Government cut off shipments to Belarus \nto force that country to accept higher prices and turn its pipeline \nsystem over to Russian Government-controlled companies.\n  The Russian Government continues using heavyhanded tactics to move \nWestern companies out of Russia so it can regain control of oil and gas \nreserves previously sold to these companies for development.\n  The comparisons of President Chavez's actions to renationalize \nVenezuela's oil and gas industry are eerily similar to those taken by \nthe Russian Government. As Hugo Chavez increases his government's \nstranglehold on Venezuela's oil and gas supply, will he cut off supply \nto the United States, or other nations, in an attempt to influence \neconomic and political events? Will he cut off supply to CITGO stations \nin the United States?\n  Reforms to the CFIUS process identifying energy infrastructure and \nenergy security as national security interests, and the inclusion of \nthese as factors to review when foreign-owned companies especially \nstate-controlled companies with histories of using energy assets as \npolitical and economic tools will prevent Hugo Chavez and the \nVenezuelan Government from controlling additional energy assets here in \nthe United States.\n  I applaud President Bush for signing this important measure and \nencourage the CFIUS panel to perform stringent reviews of any potential \nsale of critical U.S. energy infrastructure to a foreign-government \ncontrolled company and deny any sale to entities controlled by tyrants \nlike Hugo Chavez who have a history of expropriating U.S. assets and \nwho, no doubt, would be willing to use the control of these assets to \nthreaten U.S. national security and our economic well-being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10895-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MANUFACTURING\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the manufacturing sector is under siege from \ncheap imports, unfair trade agreements, and escalating heath care and \nenergy costs. Instead of working to alleviate this burden, the Bush \nadministration has turned its back on manufacturing. The administration \nslashed funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, MEP, and \nthe Advanced Technology Program, ATP, in this year's budget. MEP helps \nmanufacturers streamline operations, integrate new technologies, \nshorten production times, and lower costs. ATP provides grants to \nsupport research and development of high-risk, cutting edge \ntechnologies. Both MEP and ATP help manufacturers survive and compete \nwith countries such as China.\n  Today I offer, with Senator Voinovich, some help for beleaguered \nmanufacturers. The Advanced Multidisciplinary Computing Software Center \nAct was drafted from recommendations made by the Council on \nCompetitiveness regarding high-performance computing. The legislation \nwould provide grants for the creation of five Advanced Computing \nSoftware Centers throughout the United States that would transfer high-\nperformance computing technologies to small businesses and \nmanufacturers.\n  High-performance computing will allow manufacturers to visualize and \nsimulate parts and products before they can be created, which will cut \nthe time and cost required to experiment with new materials. General \nMotors, for example, uses high-performance computing to simulate \ncollisions, saving millions of dollars in development costs and \nsubstantially shortening design cycle times.\n  Presently, only large companies like GM have the resources to reap \nthe benefits of high-performance computing. This bill would provide \ngrants to small and medium manufacturers to implement this technology \nand create new opportunities for economic growth, job creation, and \nproduct development and allow manufacturers and businesses to harness \nthe full potential of high-performance computing\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10895-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10895-S10896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROGER LANDRY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing of Roger \nLandry of Springvale, ME, and pay tribute to this former Maine State \nlegislator and steadfast advocate for our Nation's veterans. Roger was \none-of-a-kind individual who was truly a force of nature who allowed \nnothing to stand in the way of achieving results and helping others, \nand he had a unique ability to harness the compassion and empathy he \nfelt so deeply to produce positive and tangible results that truly \ntouched the hearts of so many. Whether serving his country as a highly \ndecorated master sergeant in the U.S. Air Force for 23 years, providing \na welcoming presence ceremonies to honor our returning troops, or \nfighting for better care for our heroic veterans, Roger was truly a \nbenevolent force of nature who placed a premium on helping others, \nespecially those servicemen and women who have given their all for this \nland.\n  Those in our State extraordinary enough to have worn our Nation's \nuniform never had a better friend or ally than Roger. He carried his \ntireless compassion, disarming humor, and can-do spirit to the Maine \nHouse of Representatives where his impact was felt immediately and \nwhere he sought common ground to advance the public good. We owe him an \nexceptional debt of gratitude for his enduring devotion to his State of \nMaine which he loved.\n  His service in the Military, in the State legislature, and as a \ncitizen of Maine forged a legacy that should stand as an inspiration to \nus all--he will be greatly missed and forever remembered. Roger was a \nremarkable public servant and a dear friend--I will always cherish \nhaving known him.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great \nstoryteller with a passion and deep empathy for the people of Hawaii. \nAfter a 20-year career in television journalism, Ron Mizutani announced \nthis week that he will be leaving his post as news anchor and reporter \nfor a top rated Honolulu newscast to pursue interests outside of \njournalism.\n  Ron exemplifies Hawaii's melting pot, our diverse human landscape \nrich with the contributions of unique cultures from around the Pacific \nand across the globe. His desire to make the islands he grew up in a \nbetter place for the future, while cherishing the cultures of old, is \nwell known throughout Hawaii. Drawing on his personal heritage from \nAsia, Europe, and Hawaii's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians, Ron \ncrossed cultural lines and played a major role in bringing the diverse \npeople of Hawaii together into a cohesive unit.\n  In his writing, Ron was true to the language and style of the \nislands. A proud graduate of my alma mater, Kamehameha Schools, Ron's \ncolleagues routinely turned to him whenever they needed help with the \npronunciation of a Hawaiian word or a greater understanding of \ntraditional practices.\n  Ron started his career as a sportscaster, and with time and \nexperience moved into news reporting. He is one of the only in-studio \nanchors that would actually go out, get dirty and cover news in the \nfield on location. As Ron's longtime photographer partner Greg Lau \nproudly recalls a day when an unusual storm generated high surf along \nthe North-East shores of the islands, topping the beaches and coming \ninto people's homes. Ron put his story second, jumping into the \ndangerous surf and ruining his clothes to help stack sandbags and \nsalvage what could be saved. That was the part of the story viewers \nnever knew, but colleagues certainly did.\n  Telling stories about the people, places, and issues facing the \nislands of Hawaii was Ron's kuleana, or duty. Ron took his kuleana \nseriously. His work captured the soul of the islands and he came to \nwork every day with a mission to tell his story in a way that was \ncompelling while remaining true to the issues at hand. More \nimportantly, he refused to sensationalize the news.\n  Ron's storytelling ran the gamut: from entering homeless camps to \ntell the stories of the real people who had hit hard times amidst the \nislands' soaring property prices, following a local boy turned New York \nMets hitter Benny Agbayani in his big moment in the World Series, the \nbittersweet celebration of a Native Hawaiian man who got his piece of \nHawaiian Homelands after 50 years on a waiting list, to flying to the \nface of hurricanes to keeping Hawaii residents safe and informed, Ron \nalways went to great lengths to shed light on stories he knew needed to \nbe told.\n  Mr. President, Ron's contribution to Hawaii's understanding of itself \nand its people will be sorely missed. We wish him well in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10896-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL RUSSELL M. OPLAND\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I commend a distinguished \npublic servant, the commander of Delaware Civil Air Patrol, COL Russell \nM. Opland.\n  Civil Air Patrol, CAP, is the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air \nForce, and is comprised entirely of civilian volunteers. It was formed \non the shores of Delaware and New Jersey in 1941 to patrol coastal \nwaters for enemy submarines. The wing commander is the senior corporate \nofficer within a CAP Wing and is responsible to the Civil Air Patrol \nCorporation and to the regional commander for ensuring that corporate \nobjectives, policies, and operational directives are executed within \nthe Wing.\n  CAP has three missions: cadet programs, emergency services, and \naerospace education. The cadet program provides youth, ages 12-21, the \nopportunity to serve their communities and develop into responsible \ncitizens, inspiring them to become the next generation of pilots, \nengineers, mechanics, and aviation enthusiasts. As part of the \nemergency services mission, CAP performs 95 percent of inland aerial \nsearch and rescue missions in the continental U.S. CAP volunteers also \nperform homeland security, disaster relief, and counterdrug missions at \nthe request of Federal, State, and local agencies.\n  Colonel Opland has led the Delaware Wing of the CAP since August 2003 \nand will step down on September 8, 2007. He has volunteered an average \nof 38 hours a week to the people of Delaware and the CAP cadets while \nstill keeping his full time job as chief privacy and information \nsecurity officer for the University of Pennsylvania Health System.\n  During his tenure as commander, Colonel Opland earned significant \nawards and honors including the following: four Exceptional Service \nAwards, three Meritorious Service Awards, the Gill Robb Wilson Award, \nNo. 2074, Delaware Wing Senior Member of the Year, the Air Force \nAssociation, AFA, Award for Outstanding CAP Achievements, \n``Outstanding'' rating as Commander, 2005 Wing Compliance Inspection, \nand ``Outstanding'' rating as Incident Commander, 2003 Evaluated SAR/DR \nexercise.\n  In addition to his personal awards, Colonel Opland led the Delaware \nWing to national recognition. Despite the Wing's small size, Colonel \nOpland's attention to operational detail and discipline allowed the \nDelaware Wing to log the most flying hours of any CAP wing in the \nnation, resulting in the wing receiving three new aircraft. For each of \nthe past four years, Delaware cadets participating in national drill \nteam and/or color guard competitions placed third or higher.\n  I commend Colonel Opland for his dedication to aerospace education, \nto helping build young enthusiasts who believe in volunteering, and to \nthe vital aerial missions that help keep Delaware and the Nation more \nsecure. It is the tireless work of citizens like him that make this \nNation great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10896-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10896-S10897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PROJECT COMPASSION\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I honor the work of an \norganization dedicated to preserving the memory of our service men and \nwomen who have died on active duty since the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Project Compassion has dedicated itself to providing one gallery-\nquality portrait of every one of these fallen heroes to their \ndesignated next of kin at no cost to the family. Project Compassion \nstarted in the spring of 2003 in the State of Utah, when a local artist \nnamed Kaziah Hancock learned of the death of a fellow Utah resident who \nwas serving in Iraq. She located the soldier's family and painted a \nfree portrait for them as a gift of her appreciation. She then decided \nto paint as many portraits of our fallen men and women as her personal \ntime and savings would allow. For more than 5 years, she has refused to \ntake a single dollar from anyone who has received a painting.\n  And in these last 5 years, Project Compassion has never faltered in \nits mission to provide a tangible ``thank-you'' to the families of the \nbrave men and women who have fallen in service to our country. That \nmission has required the addition of four more artists, all of whom \ndedicate their time to be a part of the effort. In November 2004, \nProject Compassion teamed up with Marie Woolf, a California-based \ncreative media director, who agreed to manage and publicize the \nproject. She worked to establish crucial relationships with the media, \ngovernment, and the armed services to fulfill the Project Compassion \nmission.\n  All of the military services except for the Army now include Project \nCompassion information with the standard paperwork personally delivered \nby casualty officers. However, Project Compassion is one of the Army's \nfew third party organizations approved to contact next of kin who have \ngiven their consent to be contacted. Project Compassion is also a \nmember of America Supports You, a Defense Department program connecting \ncitizens and corporations with military personnel and their families \nserving at home and abroad.\n  As of July, over 600 portraits have been completed and delivered to \nthe\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\nfamilies of our fallen servicemen and women. Project Compassion has \nearned major international, national, local, and military media \nrecognition of its unusual service, including from CNN, CBS, NBC, and \nPBS, and it is certainly well-deserved.\n  Mr. President, the story of Project Compassion is one of which we can \nall be proud. It is a story of everyday Americans bringing comfort to \nthose who have lost a loved one in uniform. Ms. Hancock has taken her \ngifts as an artist and used them to honor people she has never met and \nnever known. But she has stated that ``These soldiers and their \nfamilies are our buddies, they are our family as Americans, and we love \nthem.'' I am proud to honor the work of Project Compassion today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10897-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING HAL POTE\n\n Mr. BROWN. President, today I pay tribute to the life and \nlegacy of Harold Pote. Hal, the founder and president of the Spina \nBifida Foundation, SBF, passed away suddenly on June 26, 2007. My staff \nand I are deeply saddened by this loss, which is felt not only by his \nfriends and family but by many of us on Capitol Hill. My staff and I \nfirst had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with Mr. Pote nearly 6 \nyears ago when he began a campaign to increase congressional awareness \nof--and the national attention paid to--spina bifida, the Nation's most \ncommon, permanently disabling birth defect.\n  Hal's nephew Gregory was born with spina bifida almost 22 years ago. \nSpina bifida occurs in the first month of pregnancy when the spinal \ncolumn does not close completely. In the United States, spina bifida \noccurs in approximately 7 out of 10,000 live births and currently there \nare 70,000 men, women, adolescents, and children living with spina \nbifida. Hal supported his nephew through more than 20 surgeries and was \nthere to share in many wonderful moments, including the moment in 2004 \nwhen Gregory carried the Olympic torch. Hal was dedicated to ensuring \nthat Gregory and others living with spina bifida enjoy a high quality \nof life. He also maintained a steadfast commitment to helping prevent \nspina bifida by promoting efforts to educate women of childbearing age \nabout the importance of daily consumption of a multivitamin containing \nfolic acid.\n  Hal joined with a group of colleagues to form the Spina Bifida \nFoundation in 1999. In its 8 years of existence, the SBF, under Hal's \nsteadfast leadership, made remarkable progress on behalf of the spina \nbifida community. Not so long ago people born with spina bifida did not \nlive past their teenage years. Thanks to research and outreach enabled \nin part by Hal's exceptionally effective foundation, many children with \nspina bifida are now living to be adults and are enjoying a higher \nquality of life than previous generations.\n  Hal's achievements go beyond his philanthropy and advocacy on behalf \nof people with spina bifida. He was born in Penns Grove, NJ, in 1946 \nand received his bachelor's degree in economics from Princeton in 1968, \nand his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1972. In 1984, at the \nage of 37, he was named chairman and CEO of Fidelity Bank. Hal left \nFidelity in 1989 and that same year co-founded the PFR, a private real \nestate group, which was later acquired by Prologis. In 1993, Hal \ncofounded the Beacon Group, a Manhattan-based investment partnership \nlater acquired by Chase Manhattan. He led Chase's regional banking \ngroup and after that bank merged with JP Morgan he became chairman of \nretail financial services for JP Morgan Chase. After retiring from JP \nMorgan Chase, Hal returned to Philadelphia in 2006 to serve as CEO of \nthe American Financial Realty Trust.\n  Hal Pote's sudden death is a tragedy. Yet his life was a triumph. I \noffer my heartfelt condolences to his family--his wife Linda Johnson, \nhis mother Lucille Bock Pote, his two brothers Frank and Corey Pote, \nand his nephews.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life and honoring \nthe many achievements of this extraordinary man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10897-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRADLEY BUTLER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize an Idahoan \nwho since 1995 has served four Idaho Governors as director of the Idaho \nDepartment of Labor and twice served as interim executive director of \nthe Idaho Commission on the Arts. He also served as an Idaho assistant \nattorney general and as an Idaho State senator for 4 years. After 12 \nyears, Roger Madsen is among the longest-serving State employment \nagency directors in the Nation, and he is my friend.\n  Roger has been a tireless volunteer for the betterment of his \ncommunity and State. The list of his activities and leadership is long \nand prestigious. Roger has served as: delegate to the White House \nConference on Families;\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\nchair of the Governor's task force on unemployment insurance; vice \nchair of the Multiple Sclerosis Society; chair of the mayor's citizen's \nadvisory panel on public housing; chair of the Governor's advisory \ncouncil on worker's compensation; member of the job training and \nworkforce development councils; member of the TechHelp science advisory \nboard and the Governor's rural economic development committee; chair of \nthe Idaho State Employee's United Way Campaign; cochair of Idaho Rural \nPartnership; and, cochair of the ``Katrina Evacuee Resettlement'' \neffort in Idaho.\n  Without hesitation and despite his weighty workload, Roger twice \nagreed to guide the Idaho Commission on the Arts through difficult \nperiods and did so in an inimitable manner, with much gratitude on \nbehalf of the staff and arts community. Additionally, he served as the \ninterim director of the Idaho Disability Determination Services.\n  In 2005, the Idaho Department of Commerce and Labor received the \nWilliam J. Harris Equal Opportunity Award for its ``commitment to \nintensifying assistance to minorities and ensuring those new to the \nState receive the same quality service as longtime Idaho residents.'' \nThe annual award honors a work force agency administrator and the \nagency's equal opportunity officer for outstanding accomplishments. \nUnder Madsen's leadership, the department increased its bilingual \nstaff, doubled the number of female managers in local offices, \nincreased the number of employees with disabilities and launched new \nprograms such as special job search workshops in Spanish.\n  In June 2007, the International Association of Workforce \nProfessionals named Director Roger Madsen as its Administrator of the \nYear for his leadership in economic and work force development in 2006, \nwhen average wages rose 5.6 percent and Idaho's growth in real gross \nstate product led the Nation.\n  I recognize and commend Roger for his continued efforts and \naccomplishments on behalf of all of the citizens of Idaho. He is a \ngreat advocate for Idaho and I look forward to continuing to work with \nhim on issues important to Idahoans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10898-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENT ART COMPETITION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize three \nstudents from New Mexico who entered and were recognized in the \nEducation: A Gift Without Boundaries, 2007 Native American Student Art \nCompetition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of \nIndian Education. There were almost 1,400 entries from 34 States in 6 \nevents divided by age.\n  Native Americans put a very strong emphasis on their culture and in \nparticular, art. Even though the art may be different from tribe to \ntribe, the universal importance of art is seen in the number of \nentrants and from the diverse geographic areas that they come from. The \nnumber of entrants also speaks to the immense support from teachers and \nparents in the Native American communities.\n  Deidra Lee, an eighth grader from Cecditai Middle School, won first \nplace in the sixth- to eighth-grade division; Robert Francis, a 10th \ngrader from Grants High School, won third place in the 9th-10th grade \ndivision; and Michael Curly, a 10th grader from Pine Hill School, won \nfirst place in the 11th-12th grade division.

Mr. President, today I wish to commend the \nservice and acts of South Florida's Roxcy O'Neal Bolton. She has made \nmany contributions to women and society both locally and nationally. \nWhile she was born in Mississippi in 1926, Roxcy Bolton has made her \nmark in Florida over many long decades as a leading supporter of \nwomen's rights.\n  Mrs. Bolton has been the founder of many Florida organizations which \nhave helped women. While a strong advocate of increasing opportunities \nfor women in society, she still proudly embraced marriage and family \nlife.\n  Married to a U.S. Navy commander named David Bolton--now deceased--\nthey had three children together. In her life she has been an active \nwife, mother, and homemaker--all while supporting rights for women in \nFlorida and beyond. Her good acts are well known.\n  A leading defender of, and advocate for, women who have been abused \nor suffered through domestic violence, Mrs. Bolton founded a nonprofit \nagency that provides rescue service, assistance to women in personal \ncrisis, and emergency housing. This agency started after she personally \ntook in four children and several women who were in situations of \npersonal distress. I believe that is the definition of service--but it \nis just one example of Mrs. Bolton's kindness and vision.\n  At Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, she worked to establish one of \nthe country's first rape treatment centers. Providing services and \nsupport over the decades to children, adolescents, and adult victims of \nsexual assault, the Roxcy Bolton Rape Treatment Center has helped more \nthan 42,000 people and their families; and importantly, these services \nare provided at no cost to the victim.\n  Today, Roxcy Bolton is still caring for the women of Florida and \nremains dedicated to the rights of women everywhere. Through her \ndedicated work, she has lived a life of purpose. I am glad that we can \ncall her one of Florida's own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10898-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10898-S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING ANTHONY BURRUTO\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a \ntalented and courageous young American named Anthony Burruto. A rising \nseventh-grade student at Southwest Middle School in Orlando and a \npitcher and first baseman for a Dr. Phillips Little League baseball \nteam known as the Yankees, Anthony lives a fairly ordinary life; it is \njust that he is a rather extraordinary young man. Born without a fibula \nin his right leg or a shinbone in his left, he had his lower legs \namputated as a baby. At the time, Anthony and his family were informed \nthat surgery might one day make it possible for him to walk. Anthony, \nnow 12, decided that walking would not be enough for him.\n  He started playing baseball nearly 5 years ago; hitting his first \nhome run last November, he just recently finished the spring season \nwith five--two of them Grand Slams. Amongst the league leaders in home \nruns for the spring season, Anthony has been an inspiration to \neveryone--his teammates, his opponents, the coaches, parents, and fans \nalike. Using two titanium and carbon-fiber prostheses, Anthony moves \naround well; be it on the baseball diamond or while playing baritone \nwith his school's band, he embraces with confidence all of his \nopportunities.\n  In an Orlando Sentinel story written about Anthony, published earlier \nthis year, one of his teammates was quoted as saying, ``He's always the \none who gets everybody up in the dugout . . . He always sticks up for \neverybody when they have a problem.'' For a child who was born 2 months \npremature and weighed just a little more than 3 pounds, the \naforementioned says much about his character and personality.\n  While Anthony and his parents Vinny and Diane long lived in New York, \nthey have now been living in Orlando for the past 2 years. I am \ncertainly proud to call them Floridians. The Burrutos have been very \nsupportive of their only child; their love and devotion have certainly \nhelped this talented young man to shine even more brightly. The Orlando \ncommunity has also given great support to Anthony. As an Orlando \nresident, I have yet another reason to be thankful that my family and I \ncall Orlando home.\n  There are now other people who have been picking up on the rising \nstar that is Anthony Burruto. For instance, earlier this season when \nMajor League Baseball's Tampa Bay Devil Rays hosted a three-game ``home \nstand'' at Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando--the first \nregular season major league games ever played in the Orlando area--\nAnthony was asked to throw out the first pitch of the first game. On \nthis momentous occasion, Anthony threw a strike. Additionally, the \nDevil Rays won.\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\n  The accolades continue to come. Right before the official start of \nsummer, Anthony learned that he had made the Dr. Phillips Little League \nAll-Star team--yet another incredible accomplishment for an impressive \nyoung man. His mother reports that he and his team did really well. And \nas further proof of Anthony's inspiring story, there was even a film \ncrew from This Week in Baseball following him during part of his All-\nStar run.\n  Though given all of this praise, Anthony might respond much as he did \nin that Sentinel article. Commenting on ``able-bodied adults who say \nhe's remarkable or inspirational,'' Anthony's response was, ``You just \nsee things differently. To me, it's normal.'' This can-do attitude has \nbrought Anthony many admirers at an early age--and I have every reason \nto believe that this young man will continue to inspire and succeed in \never bigger ways. I commend Anthony for his hard work, attitude, and \napproach to living. I encourage Anthony to keep swinging for the \nfences--he has already proven that he can knock the ball out of the \npark. On and off the diamond, we all know that Anthony Burruto is an \nAll-Star.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10899-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING WANDA A. BROWN\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in congratulating Wanda A. Brown of Harrisonville, MO. Wanda has \ndevoted her life to community journalism and community service. The \nMissouri Associated Press will induct Wanda into the Missouri Press \nHall of Fame on September 7, 2007.\n  Wanda began her career in journalism in 1946 as copublisher of the \nWillow Springs News with her late husband J.W. Brown, Jr. With their \npurchase of the Harrisonville Democrat-Missourian in 1955, they were \nable to form the Cass County Publishing Company. Under Wanda's guidance \nas business manager, Cass County Publishing Company operated many of \nwestern Missouri's important publications including the Cass County \nDemocrat-Missourian, Lee's Summit Journal, Belton Star Herald, Bates \nCounty Democrat and the Lawrence County Record. Wanda retired from \npublishing in 1985 after working in community journalism for 30 years.\n  The State of Missouri has benefited not only from Wanda's prolific \ncareer in journalism but also from her dedication to public service and \nphilanthropy. Two generations of Cass County residents have known Wanda \nas the author of ``Wanda's Favorite Recipes'' which is a weekly column \nin the Democrat-Missourian. Wanda then turned these columns into two \ncookbooks. Proceeds from the first cookbook were donated to a local \ntheater group, the Way Off Broadway Players, and from the second book \nto the Cass Medical Center Foundation.\n  The town of Harrisonville and the State of Missouri have been lucky \nto have Wanda as one of its prominent citizens, awarding her with \nhonors such as the Harrisonville Area Chamber of Commerce President's \nAward and the Missouri Merit Mother of the Year Award.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring Wanda A. \nBrown for her decades of dedicated service to the citizens of Missouri. \nWe congratulate Wanda on her induction into the Missouri Press Hall of \nFame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10899-2", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF PHYLLIS DUNN\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

A bill to amend part D of title III of the Public Health \nService Act to authorize grants and loan guarantees for health centers \nto enable the centers to fund capital needs projects, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise with Senators Inouye and \nSanders to introduce a very important bill--the Build, Update, Improve, \nLift, and Design Health Centers Act of 2007. Also known as the BUILD \nAct, this legislation would provide building grants and loan guarantees \nto community health centers qualified under Section 330 of the Public \nHealth Service Act. This widely-needed source of funding would be used \nfor clinic renovation, replacement, modernization, and/or expansion in \norder to support community health centers in their on-going efforts to \ndeliver high-quality health care in medically underserved areas.\n  Research from the National Association of Community Health Centers \nand the Robert Graham Center indicates that there are 56 million \nAmericans that do not have access to a primary care provider, \nregardless of insurance. Another 45 million Americans lack health \ninsurance or the funds to pay out-of-pocket for their basic health care \nneeds. This means that more than 100 million Americans do not get the \nmedical treatment they need each year.\n  Established over 40 years ago, community health centers are the \nbackbone of America's health care safety net. Encompassing a network of \nover 1,000 centers, they provide much needed care to nearly 16 million \npeople each year, including one in five children. 40 percent of health \ncenter patients are uninsured while Medicaid and CHIP cover \napproximately 36 percent. More than 70 percent of patients live in \npoverty. The average annual cost per patient is small, roughly $1.25 \nper day. However, the benefits of community health centers are great. \nPeople in areas served by these clinics are less likely to use \nemergency room services and have unmet health care needs. Without these \ncenters, many people, particularly those in rural areas, would have \nnowhere to turn.\n  Clearly, our Nation's health centers bring health care to those in \nneed, but these health centers are in need as well. Renovation and \nmodernization are important to keep these buildings intact and up-to-\ndate. According to the National Association of Community Health \nCenters, 30 percent of the buildings are more than 30 years old and 12 \npercent are more than 50 years old. Narrow operating margins, however, \nmean that most health centers do not have the resources necessary to \npay for the capital improvements or new facilities needed to continue \nproviding effective health care.\n  In recent years, the President and the Senate have supported dramatic \nincreases in funding to create a number of new community health \ncenters. However, there has been no corresponding commitment to address \nthe desperate need for renovation and modernization of the older \ncenters.\n  Currently, the Federal Government has no authority to provide grants \nor loan guarantees to address the building and capacity needs of \nexisting community health centers. The BUILD Act provides such \nauthority and, in doing so, supports the ability of these clinics to \ncontinue offering high quality, cost-effective care now and into the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this critical \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Build, Update, Improve, \n     Lift, and Design Health Centers Act of 2007'' or the ``BUILD \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many health care experts believe that lack of access to \n     basic health services is our Nation's single most pressing \n     health care problem. There are 56,000,000 Americans that do \n     not have access to a primary care provider, whether they have \n     health insurance or not. In addition, more than 45,000,000 \n     Americans lack health insurance and have difficulty accessing \n     care due to the inability to pay for such care.\n       (2) Health centers, including community health centers, \n     migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and \n     public housing health centers, address the health care access \n     problem by providing primary care services in thousands of \n     rural and urban medically-underserved communities throughout \n     the United States.\n       (3) Health centers provide basic health care services to \n     16,000,000 Americans each year, including nearly 9,500,000 \n     minorities, 850,000 farmworkers, and 750,000 homeless \n     individuals. One in five children from low-income families \n     receives care through health centers.\n       (4) Studies show that health centers provide high-quality \n     and cost-effective health care. The average yearly cost for a \n     health center patient is approximately $1.25 per day.\n       (5) One of the most effective ways to address America's \n     health care access problem is by dramatically expanding \n     access to health centers, as both the Senate and the \n     President have proposed.\n       (6) Many existing health centers operate in facilities that \n     desperately need renovation or modernization. Thirty percent \n     of health centers are located in buildings that are more than \n     30 years old, with 12 percent of such centers operating out \n     of facilities that are more than 50 years old. In a survey of \n     health centers in 11 States, 2/3 of those centers identified \n     a need to improve, expand, or replace their current facility. \n     An extrapolation based on this survey indicates there may be \n     as much as $2,200,000,000 in unmet capital needs in our \n     Nation's health centers.\n       (7) Dramatically increasing access to health centers \n     requires building new facilities in communities that have \n     access problems and lack a health center.\n       (8) Health centers often do not have the means to pay for \n     capital improvements or new facilities. While most health \n     centers raise some funds through private donations, it is \n     difficult to raise sufficient amounts for capital needs \n     without a middle-upper-class donor base similar to other \n     nonprofit organizations like universities and hospitals.\n       (9) Health centers have a limited ability to support loan \n     payments. Due to an increasing number of uninsured patients \n     and the fact that many health care reimbursements are less \n     than the cost of care, health centers rarely have more than \n     minimal positive operating margins. Yet lenders are rarely \n     willing to take risks on nonprofit organizations without \n     these positive margins.\n       (10) While the Federal Government currently provides grants \n     to health centers to assist with operational expenses used to \n     provide care to a medically underserved population, there is \n     no authority to provide grants to assist health centers to \n     meet capital needs, such as construction of new facilities or \n     modernization, expansion, or replacement of existing \n     buildings.\n       (11) To assist health centers with their mission of \n     providing health care to the medically underserved, the \n     Federal Government should supplement local efforts to meet \n     the capital needs of health centers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na study to determine the suitability and feasibility of extending the \nLewis and Clark National Historic Trail to include additional sites \nassociated with the preparation and return phases of the expedition, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a bill to \nauthorize the National Park Service to conduct a comprehensive study to \nexamine the extension of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail to \ninclude additional sites associated with the preparation or return \nphase of the expedition, commonly known as the ``Eastern Legacy.''\n  On May 14, 1804, Lewis and Clark, along with the Corps of Discovery \ndeparted from Camp Dubois, IL, to set out on voyage that would shed \nlight on a landscape that had only been considered legend at the time. \nBut this American tale of adventure, determination, and curiosity did \nnot begin there. The 8,000-mile, 32-month expedition through the \nuncharted West and back to Washington, DC, started more than a year \nearlier in Virginia.\n  In 1803, Meriwether Lewis traveled through Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia, and West Virginia purchasing supplies and learning everything \nhe could about botany, paleontology, navigation, and field medicine. \nThe intrepid explorer and his growing crew then traveled down the Ohio \nRiver through Ohio and Indiana, meeting up with William Clark in \nLouisville, KY. Along this rich trail are many landmarks and sites that \nserve to honor and educate about this important event in American \nhistory.\n  Whether it is commemorating the American spirit or teaching about the \nearly Republic, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail is an \nenduring resource for education. A sea-to-sea trail would make it the \nlargest and longest trail in the National Park System, guiding visitors \nfrom across the Nation to all parks and interpretive centers.\n  This extension, a few years after the successful bicentennial \ncelebration, will continue to raise the profile of the Lewis and Clark \nTrail and increase the potential for tourism revenue in States across \nthe country. Including the eastern portion of the trail will garner \ngreater Lewis and Clark interest east of the Mississippi and bring \nunity to this American expedition of East meeting West.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1998.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Research shows that child marriage in developing \n     nations is often associated with adverse economic and social \n     consequences and is dangerous to the health, security, and \n     well-being of girls and detrimental to the economic \n     development of communities.\n       (2) The issue of child marriage is interwoven with broader \n     social and cultural issues and is most effectively addressed \n     as a development challenge through integrated, community-\n     based approaches to promote and support girls' education and \n     skill-building and healthcare, legal rights, and awareness \n     for girls and women.\n       (3) As Charlotte Ponticelli, Senior Coordinator for \n     International Women's Issues for the Department of State, \n     stated on September 14, 2005: ``It is unconscionable that in\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\n     the 21st century girls as young as 7 or 8 can be sold as \n     brides. There is no denying that extreme poverty is the \n     driving factor that has enabled the practice to continue, \n     even in countries where it has been outlawed . . . We need to \n     be shining the spotlight on early marriage and its underlying \n     causes . . . We must continue to do everything we can to \n     ensure that girls have every opportunity to become agents of \n     change and to expand the `realm of what is possible' for \n     their societies and the world at large.''\n       (4) The severity of the adverse impact of child marriage \n     increases as the age at marriage and first childbirth \n     decreases.\n       (5) A Department of State survey in 2005 found that child \n     marriage was a concern in 64 out of 182 countries surveyed \n     and that the practice is especially acute in sub-Saharan \n     Africa and South Asia.\n       (6) According to the United Nations Children's Fund, in \n     Ethiopia and in parts of West Africa marriage at the age of 7 \n     or 8 is not uncommon.\n       (7) In developing countries, girls aged 10 to 14 who become \n     pregnant are 5 times more likely to die in pregnancy or \n     childbirth than women aged 20 to 24.\n       (8) Girls in sub-Saharan Africa are at much higher risk of \n     suffering obstetric fistula.\n       (9) According to the Department of State: ``Pregnancy at an \n     early age often leads to obstetric fistulae and permanent \n     incontinence. In Ethiopia, treatment is available at only 1 \n     hospital in Addis Ababa that performs over 1,000 fistula \n     operations a year. It estimates that for every successful \n     operation performed, 10 other young women need the treatment. \n     The maternal mortality rate is extremely high due, in part, \n     to food taboos for pregnant women, poverty, early marriage, \n     and birth complications related to FGM [Female Genital \n     Mutilation], especially infibulation.''.\n       (10) Adolescents are at greater risk of complications \n     during childbirth that can lead to fistula because they have \n     less access to health care and are subject to other \n     significant risk factors related to the mother's physical \n     immaturity.\n       (11) In nearly every case of obstetric fistula, the baby \n     will be stillborn.\n       (12) The physical symptoms of obstetric fistula include \n     incontinence or constant uncontrollable leaking of urine or \n     feces, frequent bladder infections, infertility, and foul \n     odor. The condition often leads to the desertion of fistula \n     sufferers by husbands and family members and extreme social \n     stigma.\n       (13) Although data on obstetric fistula are scarce, the \n     World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are more \n     than 2,000,000 women living with fistula and 50,000 to \n     100,000 new cases each year. These figures are based on the \n     number of women who seek medical care. Many more suffer from \n     the disabling condition.\n       (14) Adolescent girls are more susceptible than mature \n     women to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, due \n     to both biological and social factors.\n       (15) Research in several countries with high rates of HIV \n     infection indicates that married girls are at greater risk \n     for HIV than their unmarried peers.\n       (16) Child marriage can have additional long-term \n     consequences when combined with female genital cutting \n     because the girls who have undergone that procedure can \n     experience greater complications during pregnancy, leading to \n     lasting health problems for themselves and their children.\n       (17) Child marriage is a leading barrier to girls' \n     education in certain developing countries.\n       (18) A high incidence of child marriage undermines the \n     efforts of developing countries and donor countries, \n     including the United States, to promote economic and social \n     development.\n       (19) The causes of child marriage include poverty, custom, \n     and the desire to protect girls from violence or premarital \n     sexual relations.\n       (20) Child marriage may also be a product of gender \n     violence in which a man abducts and rapes a girl and then, \n     sometimes through negotiations with traditional leaders, \n     negotiates a settlement with the girl's parents, including \n     marriage to the victim.\n       (21) The practice of child marriage is considered a \n     ``harmful traditional practice'' by the United Nations \n     Children's Fund.\n       (22) The Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for \n     Marriage, and Registration of Marriages, adopted at the \n     United Nations, December 10, 1962, requires the parties to \n     the Convention to overcome all ``customs, ancient laws, and \n     practices by ensuring complete freedom in the choice of a \n     spouse, eliminating completely child marriages and the \n     betrothal of young girls before the age of puberty''.\n       (23) The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the \n     Child, which entered into force in 1990, provides that \n     ``child marriage and the betrothal of girls and boys shall be \n     prohibited and effective action, including legislation, shall \n     be taken to specify the minimum age of marriage to be \n     eighteen years''.\n       (24) In Ethiopia, Girls' Activity Committees, community-\n     based groups formed to support girls in school and advocate \n     for girls' education, have conducted community awareness and \n     informational campaigns, enlisted the assistance of \n     traditional clan and religious leaders, discouraged families \n     from practicing child marriage, encouraged girls' school \n     attendance, and taken steps to reduce gender-based violence \n     and create safer environments for girls en route to or from \n     school and in the classroom.\n       (25) Recognizing the importance of the issue and the \n     effects of child marriage, the Senior Coordinator for \n     International Women's Issues of the Department of State \n     initiated an effort in 2005 to collect and assess information \n     on the incidence of child marriage and on the existence and \n     effectiveness of initiatives funded by the United States to \n     reduce the incidence of child marriage or the negative \n     effects of child marriage and to measure the need for \n     additional programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Agency.\n       (2) Agency.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the \n     term ``Agency'' means the United States Agency for \n     International Development.\n       (3) Child marriage.--The term ``child marriage'' means the \n     legal or traditional marriage of a girl or boy who has not \n     yet reached the minimum age for marriage stipulated in law in \n     the country of which they are a citizen.\n       (4) Developing nation.--The term ``developing nation'' \n     means any nation eligible to receive assistance from the \n     International Development Association or the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n       (5) HIV.--The term ``HIV'' has the meaning given that term \n     in section 3 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/\n     AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7602).\n       (6) HIV/AIDS.--The term ``HIV/AIDS'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 3 of the United States Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 \n     U.S.C. 7602).\n       (7) Obstetric fistula.--The term ``obstetric fistula'' \n     means a rupture or hole in tissues surrounding the vagina, \n     bladder, or rectum that occurs during prolonged, obstructed \n     childbirth.\n       (8) Relevant executive branch agencies.--The term \n     ``relevant executive branch agencies'' means the Department \n     of State, the Agency, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, and any other department or agency of the United \n     States, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation, that \n     is involved in implementing international health or \n     development policies and programs of the United States.\n       (9) Secretary.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, \n     the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of State.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the untapped economic and educational potential of \n     girls and women in many developing nations represent an \n     enormous loss to those societies;\n       (2) expanding educational opportunities for girls and \n     economic opportunities for women and reducing maternal and \n     child mortality are critical to the achievement of \n     internationally recognized health and development goals and \n     of many global health and development objectives of the \n     United States, including efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS;\n       (3) since child marriage is a leading barrier to the \n     continuation of girl's education in many developing \n     countries, it is important to integrate this issue into new \n     and existing United States-funded efforts to promote \n     education, strengthen legal rights and legal awareness, \n     reduce gender-based violence, and promote skill-building and \n     economic opportunities for girls and young women in regions \n     with a high incidence of child marriage; and\n       (4) effective community-based efforts to reduce and move \n     toward the elimination of child marriage as part of an \n     integrated strategy to promote girls' education and \n     empowerment will yield long-term dividends in the health and \n     economic sectors in developing countries.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, together \nwith my colleagues Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Norm Coleman, the \nAll Students Can Achieve Act. This bill represents a comprehensive \nbipartisan proposal to strengthen and improve No Child Left Behind, \nNCLB. We hope that many of the ideas contained in our proposal will be \nconsidered by the HELP Committee as it tackles NCLB reauthorization, \nand we look forward to working with the committee to that end.\n  Over 5 years ago, the President and Congress created a watershed \nmoment in American education when we enacted the No Child Left Behind \nAct. We worked together across party lines and from both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue to address an ongoing crisis in our public schools, \nespecially schools in minority and low-income communities, where \nstudents' reading and math achievement was far below that of peers in \nbetter off white communities.\n  Closing these student achievement gaps may be the most important \ncivil rights movement of our time. In No Child Left Behind we made a \nnational commitment to reject as unacceptable a system in which low-\nincome minority students were reading at a grade level 4 years below \nthat of their higher-income peers. We made a national commitment to \nbring an end to that intolerable gap and to ensure that each and every \nchild, regardless of race, nationality or family income, could develop \nhis or her talents to the fullest.\n  No Child Left Behind had the goal of bringing all minority and \ndisadvantaged children, including children with disabilities, the \nattention and support they need to succeed, by holding schools and \nStates accountable for delivering results to all of their students. \nWith passage of NCLB, we made a good start. Progress has occurred but \nthere is much more to be done to close the persistent gaps in student \nachievement.\n  No Child Left Behind, which Congress must now reauthorize, provides a \nfoundation, but we now must take new, bold steps to fulfill the \nnational commitments we first made 5 years ago. So that is why today we \nare presenting a significant reform proposal, which we are calling the \nAll Students Can Achieve Act, and which we ask our colleagues and the \nPresident to give serious consideration as we work to reauthorize No \nChild Left Behind.\n  I want to touch briefly on some of the key features in this bill that \nbuild upon the reforms of the No Child Left Behind Act, and will attach \na more detailed summary at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Central to our strategy for closing the achievement gap is the \npathway our bill creates for getting the very best teachers, teachers \nwho are the best at bringing real learning and real growth in \nachievement to their students, into the schools and classrooms where \nthey are most needed. No one does more important work in our society \ntoday than good teachers. We must attract, train and pay them as the \ncritical professionals that they are. In our proposal, we ask States to \nmove to a ``teacher effectiveness'' evaluation system. This system \nwould evaluate teacher performance based on results in the classroom. \nTo get to this point, States must develop comprehensive data systems \nthat can track individual student growth and performance, and link \nstudent performance to individual teachers. We require and fund the \ndata systems, and permit development of so-called growth models for \ncompliance with Adequate Yearly Progress, AYP. Growth models give \nschools credit for boosting student performance over time, even where \nabsolute test results are not at required levels. By linking student \ngrowth to individual teachers, States can measure teacher effectiveness \nby determining which teachers demonstrate learning gains in the \nclassroom.\n  Our proposal allows those States that have developed meritorious \nteacher effectiveness systems to opt out of the\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\nFederal Highly Qualified Teacher requirements, and to benefit from \nadditional flexibilities in the use of Federal funds. Further, since we \nwant to make sure that we can get the best teachers to the students \nmost in need, our bill requires an equitable distribution of effective \nteachers across all schools and ultimately, after teacher professional \ndevelopment, if teachers are still not effective, we assign them away \nfrom our most needy schools. Our bill includes a provision to ensure \nthat future collective bargaining agreements allow this to happen. In \nfact, because we recognize that there is nobody more important than a \nteacher, especially the most effective teachers, our bill puts the \noption of merit pay on the radar screen through a discretionary grant \nprogram to support new ideas for teacher professional development, \ntenure, assignment and compensation policies. We also seek to enrich \nthe quality of education by, among other things, giving schools the \noption to bring in experienced professionals in math, science and \ncritical foreign languages, as members of an Adjunct Teacher Corps.\n  We strengthen accountability by closing the existing loopholes that \noften prevent States and schools from truly measuring the actual \nachievement of minority students. Instead of allowing minority students \nto fall through the cracks of underachievement, this will force schools \nto take the steps needed to close the achievement gap for those \nstudents. Our bill gives parents the option of transferring their \nchildren in failing schools to other public schools, including schools \nacross district lines if there is not an acceptable option within the \noriginal school district. In addition, our bill provides a two-track \nsystem for schools missing AYP. Schools missing AYP due to one or more \nsubgroups, but less than 50 percent of the student population, would go \nthrough a more targeted attention program to address the problem areas.\n  Finally, we call for the development of voluntary American standards \nand assessments. Here we seek to address the need to promote rigorous \nstandards and assessment of student learning to ensure that all \nstudents, no matter where they are schooled, are taught the skills they \nneed to succeed in life. We call on the National Assessment Governing \nBoard, with an expanded membership to include more teachers and \nbusiness leaders, to develop these world class standards. States may \nchoose to adopt these standards, thereby freeing up State resources. \nAlternatively, states could build their own assessments and standards \nbased on the American standards, keep their own standards and tests, or \nteam together in regional censorial to develop standards and \nassessments. The Department of Education would report to Congress on \nthe variance between the rigor of state assessments and the American \nstandards and assessments in cases where the voluntary standards are \nnot used. It should be apparent that nothing in our bill would \ninterfere with State flexibility to determine teaching format and \nsubstance.\n  In sum, No Child Left Behind is not just the name of an education \nlaw. It remains a solemn and urgent commitment that we made to \nAmerica's children and parents. Because far too many children are still \nleft behind and denied the opportunity to succeed in our society, we \nhave renewed that commitment by offering this bill.\n  I want to thank my colleagues and cosponsors, Senators Mary Landrieu \nand Norm Coleman, and their staffs for their help in shaping this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a detailed \nsummary be printed in the Record\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DISTRICT WIDE HIGH SCHOOLS REFORM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 1112(b) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (P);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (Q) \n     and inserting ``;

A good education is the \n     best way to help every child realize their American dream. No \n     Child Left Behind must adhere to the basic principle that \n     each child can learn, and that all children, no matter where \n     they live in the country, are entitled to an education that \n     prepares them to succeed in life.\n     1. Moving to student achievement growth and effective \n         teachers\n       Teachers are the most important factor in school and \n     student achievement. This section requires states to measure \n     teacher and principal effectiveness. An effective teacher is \n     one that can demonstrate learning in the classroom. Funds are \n     provided for states to assess effectiveness primarily through \n     objective measures of student growth and achievement \n     (``growth models''), while allowing secondary consideration \n     of other factors including peer and principal evaluations. \n     This legislation requires and funds the development of data \n     systems to track individual student performance over time and \n     to link that performance to teachers, programs and services. \n     States with adequate data systems and plans for measuring \n     effectiveness may use growth models for determining Adequate \n     Yearly Progress (AYP). Schools that demonstrate teacher \n     effectiveness will have greater flexibilities to opt out of \n     the Highly Qualified Teacher requirements. States can also \n     gain flexibilities in their use of federal funds as long as \n     those funds principally still target students with the \n     highest needs.\n       Components:\n       Require and fund the development of state longitudinal data \n     systems, with common data elements, to track student growth \n     over time and to link student development to key items \n     including teachers, programs and supplemental services. A \n     portion of the funding is available for consortia of states \n     to develop infrastructure and systems for multi-state use.\n       States will need to complete data systems within four \n     years. If states already have data systems meeting the \n     necessary criteria or complete their systems in less than \n     four years, their funds may be used for the development, \n     enhancement and/or implementation of teacher and principal \n     effectiveness and growth model programs. Up to one-third of \n     the funds appropriated for data systems may go to regional \n     state consortia.\n       Provide funds for states to implement teacher and principal \n     effectiveness evaluations primarily through objective \n     measures of student learning growth. Teachers not rated as \n     effective will receive professional development. After five \n     years of continuously being rated as ineffective, these \n     teachers would no longer be permitted to teach in Title I \n     schools.\n       States with a plan to measure teacher effectiveness may \n     adopt a growth model for accountability. Students will need \n     to be on a trajectory toward proficiency in reading/language \n     arts and math by 2014 and science by 2020. The growth model \n     goals must be based on grade-level proficiency, with a \n     limited exception for students with severe cognitive \n     disabilities. States currently in the growth model pilot may \n     continue in that pilot.\n       Provide flexibility for schools and districts that actually \n     demonstrate effectiveness by allowing them to opt out of the \n     Highly Qualified Teacher (HQT) provisions. These schools and \n     districts would also be able to benefit from greater \n     flexibility in their use of federal funds, as long as those \n     funds still target students with the highest needs and their \n     states adopt or maintain rigorous standards and assessments. \n     States may apply to be permitted to increase from 50 percent \n     to 100 percent the amount that may be transferred from other \n     Titles into Title I where they are making AYP and states have \n     a successfully peer-reviewed teacher and principal \n     effectiveness program.\n       Provides grant funds for innovative programs to evaluate \n     professional development activities and to reform teacher \n     compensation, assignment, and tenure policies. These reforms \n     may include better pay to better teachers and incentives for \n     the best teachers to teach in high need schools.\n     2. Closing the achievement gap\n       This section takes steps to tackle the continuing \n     achievement gap in the country. It addresses the situation \n     where many students do not get a good education simply \n     because of where they live. It promotes the notion that \n     education anywhere should prepare you for life everywhere. \n     Among other things, this section requires the equitable \n     distribution of non-Federal funds within school districts; \n     provides incentives for school professionals through teamwork \n     in the poorest schools to make the greatest improvements in \n     student performance; provides funds for out-of-district \n     transfers to public schools for students without viable \n     alternatives; provide equitable funding and flexibility under \n     the Charter School Program; and disaggregates graduation rate \n     data requiring the gap in graduation rates to be closed.\n       Components:\n       Require that Title I and non-Title I schools have an \n     equitable distribution of non-Federal funds. States will \n     perform a needs assessment to identify disproportionate \n     funding.\n       Provide a school-based rewards system that recognizes the \n     teamwork of teachers, administrators, counselors, librarians \n     and media specialists, and other staff necessary to improve \n     schools. Schools in the bottom third of income of Title I \n     schools in the state that show exemplary growth in student \n     performance will be eligible. Funding may be used for non-\n     recurring bonuses for teachers, administrators and staff; \n     professional development for teachers, administrators and \n     staff; the addition of temporary personnel to continue school \n     improvement; and reduced teaching schedules to permit limited \n     numbers of teachers to act as mentors at their school and/\n     or at other Title I schools.\n       Grants for students in schools missing AYP for two or more \n     consecutive years with no available alternative public school \n     options, due to all the other schools failing to make AYP \n     within the school district or a lack of room in other \n     schools, to transfer to a public school outside of their \n     district with the federal funds following the student. \n     Students will need to be from low income families. Receiving \n     schools will be public schools within another nearby district \n     agreeing to accept students. Under this pilot program, the \n     receiving district will receive funding, up to $4000, for \n     tuition, fees and transportation; safe harbor against missing \n     AYP due to recent transfers (transferred students may be \n     excluded from AYP calculation for their first year); and \n     provided funds, up to $1000 per student, for mentoring new \n     students and for parental involvement programs.\n       Require independent audits of space availability for in-\n     district transfers for school districts containing schools in \n     need of improvement.\n       Disaggregate graduation rate data and work to close the \n     achievement gap where subgroups are significantly falling \n     behind.\n       Incorporate evidence-based intervention (also known as \n     response to intervention) models to increase the opportunity \n     for all students to meet challenging academic achievement \n     standards through early identification.\n       Elementary schools identified for school improvement shall \n     administer developmental screens and assessments to incoming \n     preschool and kindergarten. These screens and assessments \n     will be used to plan for and improve instruction and needed \n     services.\n       Include principles of universal design for learning to \n     reduce barriers, provide appropriate supports and challenges, \n     and maintain high achievement standards for all students, \n     including those with disabilities and English language \n     learners.\n       Enhance the Charter Schools Program to permit schools under \n     restructuring to close and reopen themselves as charters even \n     if the addition of such schools would exceed the State's \n     limit on the number of charter schools that may operate in \n     the State, city, county, or region. Preference is given under \n     the program to states that fund charter schools commensurate \n     with their funding of other public schools.\n     3. Setting and achieving high American standards\n       This section addresses the need to promote rigorous \n     standards and assessments of student learning to ensure that \n     students succeed in life. Nothing in this section would \n     interfere with local flexibility in how to teach. The \n     National Assessment Governing Board, with local, state and \n     national representatives, is expanded with more business \n     leaders and teachers. They will develop world-class voluntary \n     American learning standards and assessments in reading, math \n     and science while ensuring that the standards and assessments \n     are aligned with life, college and workplace readiness \n     skills.\n       States may choose to adopt these standards and assessments. \n     In return, they will receive the assessments, including \n     alternative assessments designed specifically for students \n     with disabilities and English language learners, and the \n     infrastructure for administering them. This will free these \n     states to concentrate their education resources in other \n     critical need areas. States may also\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\n     build their own assessments based upon the American learning \n     standards or keep their existing rigorous standards and \n     tests. State standards and tests, however, will be compared \n     to the rigorous voluntary American standards.\n       State leaders from higher education, schools, businesses \n     and government will work, through P-16 Commissions, to align \n     standards, assessments and curriculum from preschool through \n     college to ensure that high school and college graduates have \n     up-to-date skills needed to succeed in life.\n       Components:\n       Directs the National Assessment Governing Board, where more \n     business leaders, teachers and other representatives are \n     added, to develop world-class voluntary American learning \n     standards and assessments in reading, math and science in \n     grades 3-12. Alternate assessments will be developed for \n     students with disabilities and English language learners.\n       States may adopt the American standards and tests, build \n     their tests to the American standards, join standards and \n     assessments from regional consortia, or keep their current \n     systems. The Secretary of Education will report to the \n     Congress and public annually on the variance between the \n     rigor of state assessments and the Commission's assessment.\n       Require states to ensure that they have the standards, \n     assessments and curriculum aligned to meet life, college and \n     workplace needs, including critical thinking and problem \n     solving skills, from preschool to college, through P-16 \n     Commissions. These Commissions, headed by the Governor or the \n     Governor's designee, will also address ways that economically \n     disadvantaged students, students from each major racial and \n     ethnic group, students with disabilities, and English \n     language learners will increase their success in \n     postsecondary education.\n     4. Improvements to accountability\n       This section distinguishes those schools needing intensive \n     interventions, i.e. schools with a majority of students \n     missing AYP, from schools missing AYP for less than half the \n     student population. This division permits more resources to \n     be directed to those schools with pervasive problems while \n     other schools concentrate on improving learning for specific \n     subgroups or within particular areas of need. This change \n     also alleviates a common criticism that a single subgroup, \n     especially students with disabilities, will single-handedly \n     move a school into restructuring.\n       The vague restructuring option that permitted ``any other \n     major restructuring of the school's governance'' is \n     eliminated while a limit is provided on the percentage of \n     schools required to implement comprehensive restructuring \n     within a single school district in a given year. This \n     legislation addresses modified and alternative achievement \n     standards and related assessments for students with \n     disabilities and provides more time in AYP calculations \n     for students exiting the English language learner \n     subgroup. Schools and districts will be held more \n     accountable for students with disabilities and English \n     language learners by placing upper limits on the minimum \n     number of students that need to make up a subgroup. It \n     also limits the practice of using very wide statistical \n     error ranges when determining success.\n       Funding school improvements continues to be a critical \n     need. This legislation increases the authorization for the \n     School Improvement Grants program and distributes new funds \n     to states according to the number of schools they have under \n     improvement. This distribution provides incentives for a more \n     accurate portrayal of schools not meeting Adequate Yearly \n     Progress as states with more schools under improvement will \n     receive a larger share of funds.\n       Components:\n       Schools with a majority of their students missing AYP will \n     follow an intensive program of attention. Supplemental \n     Education Services (SES) will be available in the second year \n     under improvement, one year earlier than under the present \n     law. Schools in the final year of restructuring, limited to \n     no more than 10 percent of schools, as determined by the \n     state, within a given district in a single year, will have \n     similar options to those existing now except that the option \n     for ``any other major restructuring of the school's \n     governance'' is eliminated.\n       Schools missing AYP due to one or more subgroups, but less \n     than 50 percent of the student population, will go through a \n     targeted attention program to address the problem areas. This \n     program will include identification of specific actions to \n     address the subgroups in need. SES and school transfers are \n     still offered as options for economically disadvantaged \n     students failing to make AYP.\n       AYP calculations by states will have limits on student \n     thresholds, N-size no greater than 20-30, and statistical \n     confidence intervals, no greater than 95 percent confidence.\n       States may develop modified academic achievement standards \n     and use alternate assessments based on those modified grade-\n     level achievement standards for students with persistent \n     academic disabilities for up to 1 percent of students tested \n     (down from current regulations of 2 percent). School \n     districts showing strong evidence of a significantly larger \n     percentage of students than the national average with \n     disabilities within the district or an individual school, \n     perhaps due to a facility focusing on students with \n     disabilities, may apply to the state to use a higher \n     percentage. States may also use alternate assessments based \n     on alternate achievement standards for students with the most \n     significant cognitive disabilities for up to 1 percent of \n     students tested.\n       Expand, from two to three years, the amount of time English \n     language learners may be included in AYP calculations after \n     they become proficient and exit the subgroup.\n       Substantially increase funding for the School Improvement \n     Grants program while linking the federal distribution of \n     additional funds to the number of schools under improvement. \n     This provides incentives for a more accurate portrayal of \n     schools not meeting Adequate Yearly Progress as states \n     with more schools under improvement will receive a larger \n     share.\n     5. Enhancing learning\n       There are various other ways to support enhancements to \n     student learning and achievement including making it easier \n     to access SES services and providing ways to better inform \n     and involve parents. Innovative approaches to education and \n     successful innovations by charters need to be provided for \n     use in schools. States and districts successful at meeting \n     AYP and at measuring teacher effectiveness should have \n     greater flexibility in transferring funds to the most \n     critical areas they have within No Child Left Behind.\n       Components:\n       Districts that permit other non-school-affiliated entities \n     to use school facilities will need to offer, with \n     limitations, space in schools for private providers of SES \n     services.\n       Permit multi-district cooperatives for administering SES \n     programs and services.\n       Authorize grants for an Adjunct Teacher Corps program to \n     bring math, science and critical foreign language \n     professionals into public secondary schools to work with \n     teachers and students. These adjunct teachers will provide \n     expertise and assistance to teachers during their first year \n     and in subsequent years will be held accountable under the \n     teacher effectiveness requirements.\n       Given its importance to American competitiveness, science \n     assessments already required under No Child Left Behind will \n     be added to the accountability system with all students to be \n     proficient by the 2019-2020 school year. Successful models of \n     math and science partnerships expanded and replicated.\n       Support increased peer-reviewed research and development on \n     innovative approaches to education and ways to improve \n     learning to allow states, districts, schools and students to \n     better meet the goals of No Child Left Behind.\n       Strengthen parental involvement in and notification by \n     schools including having states designate an office or \n     position responsible for overseeing implementation of parent \n     involvement provisions. Parent Information and Resource \n     Centers will be integrated into increased parental \n     involvement plans.\n       Amend the McKinney-Vento provisions to protect children in \n     transition, including both children who lack a fixed, \n     regular, and adequate nighttime residence, and children who \n     are in out of home care in the custody of the public child \n     welfare agency.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the All Students \nCan Achieve Act that I am introducing today with Senators Lieberman and \nColeman.\n  I was proud to have been a part of developing the No Child Left \nBehind legislation 5 years ago, which made strides in holding schools \naccountable and drawing attention to the students who had fallen \nbetween the cracks. Senators Lieberman, Coleman, and I have come \ntogether to build upon the successes of No Child Left Behind, to \nimprove it, and to help our Nation's schools take the next step to help \nall of our students to achieve and to succeed. Louisiana has made great \nprogress in its standards and accountability, now ranking number one in \nthe Nation. However, of the more than 650,000 students in Louisiana, \nmany are not meeting academic achievement goals. We need to help all of \nour students meet and exceed achievement expectations.\n  The All Students Can Achieve Act focuses on the achievements of all \nstudents. Recognizing that quality data systems are crucial to \nmeasuring the progress of student achievement, we have included a \nrequirement to establish data systems and provided funding \nauthorizations and incentives to support the development of such \nsystems. In order to ensure that all students are achieving, states \nmust create comprehensive data systems that track students' academic \nprogress and other factors that affect their success.\n  One of the most important factors in school and student achievement \nis teachers. The quality of teachers should be determined by their \neffect on students' learning, not just their qualifications. All \nstudents should have effective teachers. Thus, these data systems must \nlink student achievement data to teachers, allowing states to\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\nmeasure teacher effectiveness. In addition, this bill requires the \nequitable distribution of effective teachers and non-federal funding.\n  States should be held accountable for student achievement. However, \nstudents do not progress at the same pace. Louisiana has recognized \nthis and has incorporated growth labels in its accountability system. \nLouisiana looks at the level of growth achieved by a school and each \nschool's success in meeting its growth targets. The All Students Can \nAchieve Act allows states to use growth models in calculating adequate \nyearly progress. It allows states the flexibility to measure student \nacademic growth, rather than strictly looking at test scores.\n  We must have high expectations for all students. To ensure that all \nelementary though secondary school students, regardless of where they \nlive, are prepared for success in college or the workplace, states must \nset high expectations for all students. Academic standards must be \ndesigned to prepare students to succeed and assessments must be \neffective tools to measure students' progress toward meeting these \nstandards. In addition, we need to continue to properly measure the \nachievement of all students. Thus, this bill will close current \nloopholes in the law that allow states to avoid counting students or \nskew achievement data.\n  The All Students Can Achieve Act aims to close the achievement gap. \nStates need to focus resources on closing the achievement gap. This \nincludes directing their attention to comprehensive interventions where \nmore than 50% of students are not making Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) \nor focused interventions where less than 50% of students are not making \nAYP. The All Students Can Achieve Act increases the amount of funding \nauthorized for these interventions and focuses support where the need \nis greatest.\n  Another important measure of academic achievement is high school \ngraduation rates, which should be tracked and reported for all groups \nof students. High school graduation rates are an important measure of \nacademic achievement, but they must be calculated consistently and \naccurately. Like other assessments, these rates should be tracked and \nreported for all groups of students. Nearly 1.2 million students did \nnot graduate from American high schools in 2006; the lost lifetime \nearnings in America for that class of dropouts alone totals more than \n$309 billion.\n  The All Students Can Achieve Act also increases focus on and support \nfor high need students. For example, we have also included foster \nchildren and youth. There are over 800,000 foster children and youth. \nThey face many of the same challenges as homeless children and youth. \nThey go through numerous changes in where they live and go to school. \nThey lack stability and permanency. Thus, we have added them to the \nMcKinney-Vento Act, in order to ensure that they do not fall through \nthe cracks. We hope that by giving them access to the services and \nprotections of McKinney-Vento, their schools will become a safe and \npermanent place in their lives.\n  Public education is important to Senators Lieberman, Coleman, and me. \nWe want our Nation's children to be prepared to compete and succeed \nonce they graduate. We need to improve our schools and hold them \naccountable for the achievement of all students. Though there has been \nmuch discussion about No Child Left Behind Act, there has been little \naction toward the reauthorization of this law. We have heard from our \nconstituents about the parts of NCLB that work and the parts that do \nnot work for our students at home. Through a nationwide public process, \nthe Aspen Institute has generated concrete, actionable recommendations \nthat will improve schools for the Nation's children. We wanted to take \nthis opportunity to help begin the process of improving this law. We \nhave come together to take a bipartisan approach to improving the \neducation of all students. We have pulled together the proposals that \nwe think will best serve our students and improve public education in \nAmerica. We want people to actively discuss our proposal. We hope that \npeople will support what we have done or build upon it.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues Senators \nJoe Lieberman and Mary Landrieu to introduce the All Students Can \nAchieve Act of 2007, ASCA, legislation aimed at improving the current \nNo Child Left Behind law.\n  As a parent and a legislator, improving our Nation's education system \nhas been a top priority for me. Several years ago, we passed the No \nChild Left Behind Act to bring accountability to our Nation's learning \nsystem. While this bill was a step in the right direction, Minnesota's \neducators have voiced their concerns over an overly restrictive system \nthat still leaves students behind. The All Students Can Achieve Act \nwill change that by giving flexibility to each State and school without \ndiminishing school accountability.\n  One of the best features of our legislation is that it will allow \nStates to measure individual student growth over time instead of \nrelying on, and teaching for, one test administered on one day. \nMeasuring a student's growth over time benefits both students and \nteachers because it recognizes that students have different starting \npoints and acknowledges their individual progress. This approach will \nfree teachers from the burden of teaching for one high-stakes test, \nwhile still giving parents the assurances they need that their children \nare learning in a high quality atmosphere. Minnesota has been trying \nfor some time to move to this ``growth model'' of evaluation and our \nbill provides the funding to develop and implement the data systems our \nState would need to move to such a model.\n  Our bill also addresses something I have been particularly focused \non--ensuring that the next generation has the math, science and foreign \nlanguage skills needed to be competitive in an increasingly globalized \neconomy. As countries like China or India develop increasingly skilled \nworkforces, we must ensure that American students do not fall behind in \nthese critical and highly relevant fields. Our legislation adds a \nscience assessment to the accountability system and gives States the \noption to bring in qualified science, math, and foreign language \npractitioners to assist teachers and students.\n  Another concern I hear in Minnesota is that a school can be, in \neffect, penalized because a group of new immigrants does not test as \nwell as long-time students. The All Students Can Achieve Act will \nreplace the current all-or-nothing approach with a system that makes a \ndistinction between schools that need comprehensive interventions, \nversus those that need more focused help. In other words, while current \nlaw groups all low performing schools together regardless of how many \nstudents miss adequate yearly progress, our legislation offers a more \ntargeted approach, sending additional resources toward schools with \npervasive problems, while allowing schools that just have one or more \nlow performing subgroups to focus on closing the achievement gap with \nthat particular group.\n  A final aspect of our legislation is that it would change the way \nteachers are evaluated. Currently under No Child Left Behind, good \nteachers have to jump through a number of bureaucratic hoops to \ndemonstrate on paper that they are ``qualified'' experts in the \nsubjects they teach. I understand this has been a serious burden \nparticularly in rural communities, where very good teachers provide \ninstruction in more than one subject. I also know as a parent, that a \nteacher's resume may or may not reflect their actual abilities in the \nclassroom. That is why our legislation provides States with new \nflexibility in the ways they rate and reward excellent teachers.\n  At its core, No Child Left Behind is about closing the achievement \ngap. We still have a long way to go, recent data shows that still only \n13 percent of African American and 19 percent of Hispanic 4th graders \nscored at or above the proficient level on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress mathematics test, compared to 47 percent of their \nwhite peers. By measuring teacher effectiveness, school quality, and \nstudent learning, our legislation will help reduce this unacceptable \ndisparity in America today.\n  Our bipartisan legislation is based on recommendations from a panel \nof experts, and has been endorsed by some leading educators. However, \nwe know it is just the beginning of a conversation\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nabout how and where to add flexibility to the No Child Left Behind law. \nAs we move forward, I welcome the advice of teachers, parents, and \nadministrators on how best to help all students achieve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Smith, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 2002. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify certain provisions applicable to real estate investment \ntrusts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. Hatch: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the REIT \nInvestment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, legislation \nwhich would make several important revisions to the current tax law \ngoverning real estate investment trusts, or REITs. I am particularly \npleased to be joined by my good friend, the distinguished senator from \nColorado, Senator Salazar, in sponsoring this bipartisan legislation. I \nam also very happy that Senators Smith and Kerry are joining us as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  The development of real estate investment trusts is among the true \nsuccess stories of American business. Moreover, REIT legislation \nenacted over the past 47 years presents a remarkable example of how \nCongress can create the legal framework to liberate entrepreneurs, \nsmall investors, and hard working men and women across the country to \ndo what they do best--create wealth and, more importantly, build \nthriving communities.\n  When REITs were first created in 1960, small investors had almost no \nrole in commercial real estate ventures. At that time, private \npartnerships and other groups closed to ordinary investors directed \nreal estate investments, typically using debt, not equity, to finance \ntheir ventures. That model not only served small investors poorly, it \nresulted in the misallocation of capital, and contributed to \nsignificant market volatility.\n  Since that time, REITs have permitted small investors to participate \nin one of our country's greatest generators of wealth, income producing \nreal estate, and REITs have greatly improved real estate markets by \npromoting transparency, liquidity, and stability. The growth in REITs \nhas been particularly dramatic and beneficial in the past 15 years, as \ncapital markets responded to a series of changes in the tax rules that \nmodernized the original 1960 REIT legislation to adjust it to new \nrealities of the marketplace.\n  I am proud of my role in sponsoring legislation that included many of \nthese changes that modernized the REIT rules, and I remain committed to \nmaking every effort to ensure that the people of Utah and across our \nNation continue to benefit from a dynamic and innovative REIT sector.\n  I have seen first hand what REITs have done for communities across my \nState. It is very much in Utah's interests, and in our country's \ninterests, to make sure that REITs continue to work effectively and \nefficiently to carry out the mission which Congress intended.\n  As my colleagues know, Utah is known as the ``Beehive State'', a \ntestament to the hard work and industriousness of its residents. REITs \nhave proven again and again to be a particularly effective means \nthrough which Utahns can utilize those attributes, and aggregate needed \ncapital, to create the thriving real estate sector which is essential \nto our State's economic well being.\n  Towards that end, I am pleased to report that REITs now account for \nwell over a $1 billion of property in Utah alone, and afford an \nopportunity for many investors in my State to have an ownership stake \nin those properties in their communities. This is not an aberration. I \nbelieve that my colleagues will find a similarly impressive amount of \nREIT investment in their home States as well.\n  I am also pleased to report, that, in an era when companies must \ncompete successfully on a global scale, our Nation's REITs have grown \nto be leaders in international real estate markets, and our REIT laws \nare proving to be a model for other countries around the globe. In \nfact, much of the bill I am introducing today is necessitated by the \ngrowing international presence of our domestic REITs. The international \nexpansion of real estate investment trusts is something that could not \nhave been contemplated when the first REIT laws were enacted decades \nago.\n  The bill we are introducing today is based on S. 4030, which I \nintroduced toward the end of the 109 Congress, and is very similar to \nH.R. 1147, which was introduced in the House this year. I note that \nH.R. 1147 enjoys the bipartisan sponsorship of more than two-thirds of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee, and I hope that more of my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee will join us in supporting this \nbill.\n  Further, I am grateful that the distinguished Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee stated at our recent markup of the Senate energy tax package \nthat he was aware of my efforts to pass REIT reform legislation this \nyear, and that he and his staff ``will continue to work with Senator \nGrassley and you, Senator Hatch, to find a tax bill later this year in \nwhich to include this proposal.''\n  I urge my colleagues to review this bill and lend their support to \nit. In a small but important way, it will help Americans to better \ninvest for their savings and retirement. I hope we can move this \nstraightforward, bipartisan legislation through as quickly as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section description of the \nREIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007\n\n\n                     Section-by-Section Description\n\n       The REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of \n     2007 (RIDEA) includes the following provisions to help \n     modernize the tax rules governing Real Estate Investment \n     Trusts to permit REITs to better meet the challenges of \n     evolving market conditions and opportunities:\n     Title I: Foreign currency and other qualified activities\n       Title I addresses one specific issue and also equips the \n     IRS to handle similar interpretative matters in the future \n     without the need of legislation.\n       As globalization has accelerated in the past decade, REITs, \n     as with other businesses, have followed their customers \n     abroad and have accessed new opportunities in Canada, Mexico, \n     Europe and Asia. The issue that Title I resolves is how \n     foreign currency gains a REIT earns should be treated under \n     the REIT income and asset tests. For example, if a REIT buys \n     a shopping center in England for a million pounds, operates \n     it for ten years and then sells it for a million pounds, that \n     sale produces no gain (assuming that capital expenditures \n     equal the tax depreciation accruing during that period). If \n     during that 10-year period the U.S. dollar has declined \n     compared to the English pound, U.S. tax law says that the \n     appreciation of the pounds when they are converted back to \n     dollars is a separate gain. Until recently, it wasn't clear \n     how that currency gain should be treated under the REIT tax \n     tests.\n       In May, 2007, the IRS released Revenue Ruling 2007-33 and \n     Notice 2007-42 to clarify that in the overwhelming majority \n     of cases a REIT's foreign currency gains earned while \n     operating its real estate business qualify as ``good income'' \n     under the REIT rules. Title I essentially reaches the same \n     result on a more direct basis and also provides some \n     conforming changes in other parts of the REIT rules.\n       Although the recent guidance was welcome, it took the IRS \n     about four years to issue it because of questions about the \n     extent of the government's regulatory authority in the area. \n     To prevent similar delays in the future, Title I clearly \n     provides the Secretary of the Treasury with the authority to \n     determine what items of income can be treated either as \n     ``good income'' or disregarded for purposes of the REIT \n     income tests. Under this authority, it is expected that, for \n     example, the IRS would conclude that dividend-like items such \n     as Subpart F deemed dividends and PFIC income would be \n     treated in the same manner as dividends for purposes of the \n     95 percent gross income test. Further, the IRS could convert \n     many of its rulings it issued to individual taxpayers into \n     public guidance, which could be a more efficient use of its \n     resources.\n     Title II: Taxable REIT subsidiaries\n       In 1999, Congress materially changed the REIT rules to \n     allow a REIT to own up to 20 percent of its assets in \n     securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. The \n     premise is straight-forward: a REIT should be able to engage \n     in activities outside of the scope of renting and financing \n     real estate as permitted by the REIT rules with a single \n     level of tax, but only if the subsidiary is subject to a \n     separate level of tax.\n       These ``TRS'' rules have worked quite well. REITs have been \n     able to use their real estate expertise in a number of ways \n     not available under the REIT rules so long as they subjected \n     their profits from these activities to a\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\n     corporate level of tax, as well as the shareholder level of \n     tax once those profits are distributed to the REIT and its \n     shareholders. Further, the IRS study on TRSs mandated by the \n     1999 law shows that TRSs formed after the bill was enacted \n     are generating a substantial and increasing amount of tax \n     revenues.\n       Since both the main asset and income tests are set at 75 \n     percent, the dividing line normally used to demarcate between \n     REIT and non-REIT activities is 25 percent. RIDEA would \n     conform to this dividing line by increasing the limit on TRS \n     size from 20 percent to 25 percent of a REIT's assets, \n     thereby subjecting even more activities conducted by a REIT \n     to two levels of tax.\n     Title III: Dealer sales\n       Congress has always wanted REITs to invest in real estate \n     on behalf of their shareholders for the long term. Since the \n     late 1970s, the mechanism to carry out these purposes has \n     been a 100 percent excise tax on a REIT's gain from so-called \n     ``dealer sales''. Because the 100 percent tax is so severe, \n     Congress created a safe harbor under which a REIT can be \n     certain that it is not acting as a dealer (and therefore not \n     subject to the excise tax) if it meets a series of objective \n     tests. This provision would update two of these safe harbor \n     requirements.\n       The current safe harbor requires a REIT to own property for \n     at least four years. This is simply too long a time in \n     today's marketplace. Further, four years departs too much \n     from the most common time requirement for long-term \n     investment--the one-year holding period for an individual's \n     long-term capital gains. Accordingly, this provision uses a \n     more realistic two-year threshold.\n       Another test under the dealer sales safe harbor restricts \n     the amount of real estate assets a REIT can sell in any \n     taxable year to 10 percent of its portfolio. Current law \n     measures the 10 percent level by reference to the REIT's tax \n     basis in its assets. H.R. 1147 instead would measure the 10 \n     percent level by using fair market value. To allow a REIT to \n     maximize its sales under the safe harbor (and thereby \n     generating more economic activity), RIDEA would allow a REIT \n     to choose either method for any given year. Presumably, the \n     IRS would develop instructions on Form 1120-REIT allowing a \n     REIT to declare which method it selected when it files its \n     tax return for the year in which the sales occur.\n     Title IV: Health care REITs\n       In 1999, Congress allowed a REIT to rent lodging facilities \n     to its taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) while treating the \n     rental payments from the TRS as income that qualifies under \n     the REIT income tests so long as the rents were in line with \n     rents from unrelated third parties. Simultaneously, it \n     required that the TRS use an independent contractor to manage \n     or operate the lodging facilities. These complex rules were \n     adopted because hotel management companies did not want to \n     assume the leasing risk inherent in lodging facilities but \n     rather wanted to be compensated purely for operating the \n     facilities.\n       A similar situation has arisen with regard to health care \n     properties such as assisted living facilities. Operators that \n     now lease such facilities would rather have a REIT (through \n     its TRS) assume any leasing risk and instead be hired purely \n     to operate the facilities. Accordingly, this provision would \n     extend the exception made in 1999 for lodging facilities to \n     health care facilities. This change should make it easier for \n     health care facilities to be provided to senior citizens and \n     others in need of such services. As with the current rules \n     for lodging facilities, a TRS would continue to need an \n     independent contractor to manage or operate health care \n     facilities.\n     Title V: Foreign REITs\n       Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Congress \n     should be proud that about 20 countries have enacted \n     legislation paralleling the U.S. REIT rules after observing \n     the benefits brought to the United States as a result of a \n     vibrant REIT market. Just this year, Germany, Italy and the \n     United Kingdom enacted REIT laws, and Canada codified its \n     long-standing trust rules to adopt U.S.-like REIT tests. \n     Although the tax code treats stock in a U.S. REIT as a real \n     estate asset, so that it is a qualified asset that generates \n     qualifying income, current law does not afford the same \n     treatment to the stock of non-U.S. REITs.\n       Because of the many tests designed to focus a REIT on \n     commercial real estate, since the original 1960 REIT law a \n     stock interest in a U.S. REIT is treated as real estate when \n     owned by another U.S. REIT. This provision would extend this \n     treatment to a U.S. REIT's ownership in foreign REITs to the \n     extent that the Treasury Department concludes that the rules \n     or market requirements in another country are comparable to \n     the basic tenets defining a U.S. REIT.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2003. A bill to facilitate the part-time reemployment of \nannuitants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce Senate Bill 2003, a \nmeasure that will enhance the Federal Government's ability to perform \nits duties capably and economically as it faces a wave of retirement of \nhighly experienced Federal employees.\n  When we think about the coming demographic shock of millions of baby \nboomers reaching retirement age, we usually focus on the cash-flow \nimplications for the Social Security and Medicare programs. But their \naging will also have a profound effect on the Federal workforce.\n  On average, retirements from the Federal workforce have exceeded \n50,000 a year for a decade. The numbers will certainly rise in the near \nfuture. The Office of Personnel Management calculates that 60 percent \nof the current Federal workforce, whose civilian component approaches 3 \nmillion people, will be eligible to retire during the coming 10 years.\n  Federal agencies, which already must hire more than 250,000 new \nemployees each year, will need to work hard to replace those retirees, \nas the private sector and State and local governments will be facing \nthe same problem and competing for qualified replacements.\n  The baby boom retirement wave will have another impact. It will cause \na sudden acceleration in the loss of accumulated skills and mentoring \ncapabilities that experienced workers uniquely possess.\n  Human-resources research has repeatedly shown that, in general, older \nworkers equal or outperform younger workers in organizational \nknowledge, ability to work independently, commitment, productivity, \nflexibility, and mentoring ability.\n  Making good use of their talents is, therefore, not charity. It is \ncommon sense and sound management.\n  Federal agencies recognize the value of older workers, as witnessed \nby the fact that nearly 4,500 retirees have been allowed to return to \nfull-time work on a waiver basis.\n  Agencies could make use of even more Federal annuitants for short-\nterm projects or part-time work, but for a disincentive embedded in \ncurrent law.\n  Title 5 of the United States Code currently mandates that annuitants \nwho return to work for the Federal Government must have their salary \nreduced by the amount of their annuity during the period of \nreemployment. The bill I introduce today with the welcome cosponsorship \nof Senators Warner and Voinovich would provide a limited but vital \nmeasure of relief to agencies who could benefit from the skills and \nknowledge of Federal retirees. It provides a limited opportunity for \nFederal agencies to reemploy retirees without requiring them to take \npay cuts based on their annuity payment.\n  This simple but powerful reform is a priority item for the Federal \nOffice of Personnel Management. As OPM Director Linda Springer has \nsaid, ``Modifying the rules to bring talented retirees back to the \nGovernment on a part-time basis without penalizing their annuity would \nallow Federal agencies to rehire recently retired employees to assist \nwith short-term projects, fill critical skill gaps and train the next \ngeneration of Federal employees.''\n  Organizations endorsing the reform contemplated in my bill include \nthe National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, the \nFederal Managers Association, the Partnership for Public Service, and \nthe Council for Excellence in Government.\n  I would note two important points about the bill.\n  First, it will not materially affect the necessary flow of younger \nworkers into Federal agencies. The bill contemplates reemployment for \npart-time or project work of not more than 520 hours in the first 6 \nmonths following the start of annuity payments, not more than 1,040 \nhours in any 12-month period, and not more than 6,240 hours total for \nthe annuitant's lifetime. In terms of 8-hour days, those figures are \nequivalent to 65, 130, and 780 days, respectively.\n  These limits will give agencies flexibility in assigning retirees to \nlimited-time or limited-scope projects, including mentoring and \ncollaboration, without evading or undermining the waiver requirement \nfor substantial or full-time employment. of annuitants.\n  I would also note that this bill gives no cause for concern about \nfinancial impact. Reemployed annuitants would be performing work that \nthe agencies needed to do in any case, but would not require any \nadditional contributions to pension or savings plans. Meanwhile, their \nretiree health and life insurance benefits would be costs unaffected by \ntheir part-time work. Even without making any allowance for the \npositive\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\neffects of their organizational knowledge, commitment, productivity, \nand mentoring potential, their reemployment is likely to produce net \nsavings.\n  This measure offers benefits for Federal agencies, for Federal \nretirees who would welcome the opportunity to perform part-time work, \nand for taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Sanders, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2005. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \neducation on the health consequences of exposure to secondhand smoke, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Secondhand \nSmoke Education and Outreach Act of 2007 to provide information to the \npublic about the health consequences of secondhand smoke and support \ntobacco cessation education.\n  I want to thank Senators Sanders and Murray for cosponsoring the \nSecondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act and recognize them as \nstrong advocates for smoking cessation efforts.\n  I believe that tobacco use constitutes one of the greatest threats to \npublic health, a conclusion that was also expressed in the 2000 Supreme \nCourt ruling, and I also believe that we have a duty to safeguard our \nNation's health against tobacco products.\n  Every year, an estimated 400,000 smokers die as a result of smoking-\nrelated diseases. But nonsmokers also suffer and die from exposure to \ntobacco smoke.\n  Last year, the Surgeon General issued the report, The Health \nConsequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, which found that \nthere is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. The \nSurgeon General reported that nearly half of all nonsmoking Americans \nare still regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, which contains more \nthan 50 carcinogens.\n  Living with a smoker increases a non-smoker's risk of developing lung \ncancer by 20 to 30 percent and, according to the California \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, exposure to secondhand smoke causes \napproximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths in the U.S. each year. \nSecondhand smoke also causes 46,000 cardiac deaths annually in our \ncountry.\n  Studies have shown that exposure to secondhand smoke has both \nimmediate and long-term adverse health consequences on the adult \ncardiovascular system. Exposure to secondhand smoke for 30 minutes can \ndamage coronary arteries, while sustained exposure can increase the \nrisk of coronary heart disease by 20 to 30 percent.\n  Although more than 20 States have passed smoke-free laws, including \nlaws that ban smoking in restaurants and bars, Americans of all age \ngroups are involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke through exposure in \nworkplaces, homes, cars, apartments, and even outdoor public spaces. \nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, racial and ethnic \nminorities in the U.S. have higher rates of occupational exposure to \nsecondhand smoke, with Latinos and Native Americans having the highest \nrates.\n  Therefore, it is critical that individuals, especially youth, should \nnot be exposed to secondhand smoke. Further, parents should have access \nto information about the adverse health consequences so that they can \nbetter protect their children and themselves from secondhand smoke.\n\n  Education about the dangers of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco \nsmoke is absolutely critical for combating the misleading messages that \nthe tobacco industry propagates through savvy advertising campaigns.\n  There is strong evidence that tobacco advertisements cynically target \nadvertising to adult and adolescent women. According to an analysis \npublished by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1994 \nand a 2001 report by the Surgeon General, the tobacco industry has \ntargeted women with some form of this dangerous promotional strategy \nfor almost a century, beginning in the 1920s. The latest example of \nthis is chronicled in a recent New York Times editorial, entitled \n``Don't Fall for Hot Pink Camels'', which discusses R.J. Reynolds's $25 \nmillion to $50 million investment in an advertising campaign behind the \nnew female-friendly Camel No. 9.\n  In addition to targeting women, tobacco advertisements are also \ndesigned to appeal to our youth. In the August 2006 racketeering suit \nbrought by the Justice Department against the tobacco industry, Judge \nKessler's Final Opinion concluded that: ``. . . Defendants continue to \nengage in many practices which target youth, and deny that they do so. \nDespite the provisions of the MSA, Defendants continue to track youth \nbehavior and preferences and market to youth using imagery which \nappeals to the needs and desires of adolescents.'' This is an \nunconscionable, but effective, practice. A study published this year in \nthe Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine concluded that youth \nare more likely to start smoking if exposed to retail cigarette \nadvertising and that cigarette promotions also increase the probability \nof youth becoming regular smokers.\n  Finally, racial and ethnic minority communities are \ndisproportionately targeted with advertising campaigns for tobacco \nproducts, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices. The tobacco industry has contributed to primary and secondary \nschools, funded universities and colleges, and supported scholarship \nprograms targeting racial and ethnic minorities. Tobacco companies have \nalso placed advertising in community publications and sponsored \ncultural events in racial and ethnic minority communities.\n  Despite the public's growing understanding of the health dangers \nposed by tobacco, too many still succumb to the lure of these deadly \nproducts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nover 20 percent of adults currently smoke cigarettes in the U.S. Among \nracial and ethnic communities, approximately 16 percent of Hispanic \nadults, 13 percent of Asian American adults, 22 percent of Caucasians \nadults, 22 percent of African American adults, and 32 percent of \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives currently smoke cigarettes.\n  As for our Nation's youth, a 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and \nHealth reported that nearly 3 million Americans under the age of 18 \ncurrently smoke cigarettes. According to the CDC, unless current rates \nof youth smoking are reversed, more than 6.3 million children under the \nage of 18 will die from smoking-related diseases.\n\n  That is why health care professionals should have the opportunity to \nreceive training in the delivery of evidence-based tobacco dependence \nand prevention treatment in order to assist smokers in overcoming their \naddiction and educating all patients about the harm of secondhand \nsmoke.\n  That is why I, along with Senators Sanders and Murray, am introducing \nthe Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act. I am grateful to have \ndeveloped this proposal with the American Lung Association, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and the \nCampaign for Tobacco Free Kids.\n  This bill, through education and outreach, will help reverse the \npublic's underestimation of the harm that secondhand smoke can wreck on \none's health and will promote smoking cessation efforts across our \nnation.\n  This new legislation would establish grants and demonstration \nprojects, awarded by the Secretary of HHS in consultation with the \nSAMHSA administrator, for educating the public about the health \nconsequences of secondhand smoke in multi-unit dwellings and in public \nspaces, such as public parks, playgrounds, and national parks. Special \nconsideration would be given to awarding grants to organizations whose \nparticipation includes secondary school or college-age individuals, and \nto organizations that reach racial or ethnic populations that \nexperience a disproportionate share of the cancer burden.\n  The Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act would also authorize \nand fund grants for regional or local tobacco cessation education and \ncounseling for health care workers and providers. The training \ncurricula would assist smokers in quitting through smoking cessation \ncounseling, educate smokers and nonsmokers about the\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\nhealth consequences of secondhand smoke, and help promote self-\nsustaining networks for the delivery of affordable, accessible, and \neffective cessation services.\n  The U.S. spends more on health care than any other industrialized \nnation and yet we struggle to provide adequate health care for all our \ncitizens. We literally cannot afford the myriad of health problems that \nwe know result from tobacco use: bladder, esophageal, laryngeal, lung, \noral, and throat cancers, chronic lung diseases, coronary heart and \ncardiovascular diseases, as well as reproductive effects and sudden \ninfant death syndrome.\n  The Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act is an important step \nin ensuring that our nation's communities have the knowledge they need \nto keep themselves and their environments healthy, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to enact this legislation during the \nupcoming reauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       American Heart Association,\n\n\n                                  American Stroke Association,\n\n                                                   August 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Heart Association, on \n     behalf of our more than 22 million volunteers and supporters, \n     strongly endorses the Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach \n     Act of 2007. If enacted, this legislation would provide \n     Federal funds to educate the public about the health \n     consequences of secondhand smoke and create tobacco cessation \n     education and counseling programs.\n       Secondhand smoke causes death and disease in children and \n     adults who do not choose to smoke. The 2006 Surgeon General's \n     Report The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to \n     Tobacco Smoke found that there is no safe level of secondhand \n     smoke. Secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the \n     cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of coronary heart \n     disease by 25 to 30 percent. An estimated 35,052 nonsmokers \n     die each year as a result of exposure to environmental \n     tobacco smoke.\n       Secondhand smoke has a particularly adverse effect on \n     children's health. An estimated 150,000-300,000 children \n     younger than 18 months of age have respiratory tract \n     infections due to exposure to secondhand smoke. The \n     educational campaigns and demonstration projects about the \n     health effects of secondhand smoke in multi-unit housing and \n     public spaces that would be funded by the Secondhand Smoke \n     Education and Outreach Act of 2007 would give particular \n     emphasis to programs that would include secondary school and \n     college-age individuals.\n       We applaud you for your leadership and look forward to \n     working with you to advance this vitally important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sue A. Nelson,\n     Vice President, Federal Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary R. Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids \n     strongly supports your legislation, ``Secondhand Smoke \n     Education and Outreach Act.'' As stated by former Surgeon \n     General Richard Carmona, ``The debate is over. The science is \n     clear. Secondhand smoke is not a mere annoyance but a serious \n     health hazard.'' This legislation will provide timely and \n     accessible educational programs concerning secondhand smoke \n     along with funds to train health professionals to help more \n     Americans quit smoking.\n       The ``Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act'' will \n     fund much needed educational campaigns about the dangers of \n     secondhand smoke in the workplace and in multi-unit housing. \n     These campaigns will promote greater awareness on the health \n     consequences of smoking and secondhand smoke and will \n     encourage more communities to go smokefree.\n       The mission of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids is to \n     reduce the harm associated with smoking and exposure to \n     tobacco smoke, preventing children from using tobacco, and \n     helping adults to end their tobacco use. Your initiative will \n     help further these goals by promoting awareness of the harms \n     of secondhand smoke and ways to prevent exposure to it and by \n     supporting people's efforts to quit smoking and improve their \n     quality of life.\n       This initiative is consistent with your demonstrated \n     commitment to helping protect our nation's children from the \n     harms associated with tobacco use. Your support of re-\n     authorization of the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program which is funded by an increase in the excise tax on \n     all tobacco products (a proven measure to deter kids from \n     smoking) and your recent vote in the Senate Health Education \n     Labor and Pensions Committee to give the Food and Drug \n     Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and \n     advertising clearly demonstrates your strong support for \n     reducing the harms of tobacco in this country.\n       The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids applauds your leadership \n     on tobacco prevention efforts and we look forward to working \n     with you to move your Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach \n     Act forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William V. Corr,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          American Cancer Society,\n\n\n                                        Cancer Action Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U. S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Cancer Society Cancer \n     Action NetworkSM (ACS CAN) is pleased to endorse the \n     Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act of 2007. This \n     legislation would make federal funds available for public \n     education campaigns on the dangers of secondhand smoke and \n     the consequences of secondhand smoke in public spaces, as \n     well as fund grants for tobacco cessation education and \n     counseling.\n       There are devastating health consequences directly \n     attributable to secondhand smoke: Secondhand smoke causes \n     between 35,000 and 40,000 deaths from heart disease every \n     year; 3,000 otherwise healthy nonsmokers will die of lung \n     cancer annually because of their exposure to secondhand \n     smoke; The total annual costs of secondhand smoke exposure \n     are estimated to be at least $5 billion in direct medical \n     costs and at least $5 billion in indirect costs.\n       The 2006 Surgeon General's Report on The Health \n     Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke \n     documents that: There is no risk-free level of exposure to \n     secondhand smoke; Children exposed to secondhand smoke are at \n     an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), \n     low birthweights, acute respiratory infections, ear problems \n     and more severe asthma; Parents who smoke cause respiratory \n     symptoms and slow lung growth in their children; Exposure to \n     secondhand smoke leads to an increased risk for lung cancer \n     and cardiovascular disease and death; Nonsmokers living with \n     a smoker have a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of lung \n     cancer and a 25 to 30 percent increased risk for coronary \n     heart disease.\n       We look forward to working with you to secure passage of \n     this important legislation by the 110th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n       Daniel E. Smith,\n                                                         President\n     Wendy K. Selig,\n       Vice President, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary R. Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The American Lung Association \n     strongly supports your Secondhand Smoke Education and \n     Outreach Act. Despite the irrefutable scientific evidence \n     that secondhand smoke kills, people of every age are exposed \n     to tobacco smoke in the workplace, at home and in other \n     public spaces. This legislation will provide accessible \n     educational programs concerning secondhand smoke and smoking \n     cessation in order to effectively reduce secondhand smoke \n     exposure and promote lung health among Americans.\n       In June of 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General issued The Health \n     Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke, which \n     concluded that there is no risk-free level of exposure to \n     secondhand smoke. Even short exposure to secondhand smoke can \n     decrease coronary flow and increase the risk of a heart \n     attack in adults; additionally, in children, the risk of \n     developing acute respiratory infections or asthma is \n     elevated. However, despite this conclusive scientific \n     evidence, more education is needed to communicate the dangers \n     of secondhand smoke.\n       The Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act will fund \n     much needed educational campaigns about the dangers of \n     secondhand smoke in the workplace and in multi-unit housing. \n     These campaigns will promote awareness on the health \n     consequences of smoking and secondhand smoke and promote lung \n     health among the public. The legislation will also authorize \n     grants to health care workers and providers for tobacco \n     cessation education.\n       The mission of the American Lung Association is to prevent \n     lung disease and promote lung health. The Secondhand Smoke \n     Education and Outreach Act will do both by promoting \n     secondhand smoke awareness and supporting people's efforts to \n     quit smoking and enhance their lives.\n       The American Lung Association looks forward to working with \n     you to see the Secondhand Smoke Education and Outreach Act \n     enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Bernadette A. Toomey,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                         The City of White Plains,\n\n\n                                                 Youth Bureau,\n\n                            White Plains, New York, July 31, 2007.\n     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Building Suite 476, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Second hand Smoke Education\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The White Plains Youth Bureau is \n     writing this letter in support of the Bill you are \n     introducing to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \n     education on the health consequences of exposure to second \n     hand smoke, and for other purposes.\n       Studies conducted by various health organizations, as well \n     as the Surgeon General have documented that there are more \n     than 60 million young children still being involuntarily \n     exposed to second hand smoke. Although the passage of laws \n     such as the Clean Indoor Air Act, and other laws passed by \n     individual states, have made significant reductions to \n     smoking rates, involuntary exposure to second hand smoke \n     continues to effect the health of our most vulnerable \n     population--our children. Exposure to second hand smoke in \n     outdoor public spaces as well as in multi unit housing \n     complexes continues to be a significant health risk factor.\n       This bi1l is designed to address these very problems by \n     providing support for increased education about the dangers \n     of second hand smoke exposure. Research has proven that \n     continuous education does make a difference. Additionally, \n     the support for increased training of health professionals \n     will help educate parents and other adults about the need to \n     protect vulnerable segment of our population from involuntary \n     exposure to second hand smoke.\n       We commend you and your staff for taking the initiative in \n     putting together this important Bill that will definitely \n     help to improve the health outcomes for many of our young \n     people as well as continue the battle against the \n     unscrupulous practices of the tobacco industry.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n                                                     Linda Puoplo,\n                                                  Deputy Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2008. A bill to reform the single family housing loan guarantee \nprogram under the Housing Act of 1949; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Home \nOwnership Made Easier Act, or the HOME Act. This bill will revitalize \nour Nation's rural communities by making it easier to become a \nhomeowner and to provide opportunities to refinance high interest and \nsubprime loans.\n  Our country has provided many excellent opportunities over the years \nto individuals living in rural areas to become a homeowner. One of \nthese programs is what is commonly referred to as the 502 program \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This program \nadministers guaranteed loans to low-income families that are backed by \nthe U.S. Government. Families must be able to show that they are \nwithout adequate housing and not exceed certain income limits. \nCurrently, these loans last 30 years and do not require a down payment, \nhowever the applicant must be able to afford mortgage payments, \nincluding taxes, and insurance.\n  I applaud the success of the 502 program. In Louisiana alone, the \nprogram has already administered 1,212 loans for 2007 and nationwide, \nthe program has administered 27,643 loans. While the program does cost \nthe taxpayer approximately $42 million a year, it administers over $3 \nbillion in loans a year. Let me repeat that again, for $42 million a \nyear, our Government is able to provide $3 billion in loans a year to \nlow-income families to become homeowners. The risk extremely low. In \n2006, the 502 program has a foreclosure rate of 1.36 percent. Again, I \napplaud the success of our Government to provide this much-needed help \nto rural Americans.\n  Some might ask why should the Federal Government help low-income \nfamilies become homeowners? The answer is simple. Homeownership \nprovides financial advantages to owners and to their communities. \nIndividuals who own homes have an investment, of those that own homes, \non average, one-half of the equity in their homes is one-half of their \nnet worth. Homeowners enjoy tax benefits and they also enjoy financial \nstability if they are locked into a permanent interest rate. \nCommunities also benefit, those that have a high percentage of \nhomeownership see increased involvement with the community and with the \nlocal schools.\n  Also, maybe most importantly, homeownership by low-income households \nis linked to a child's educational advancement and future success.\n  My HOME Act will build upon the success of the 502 program and update \nthe program to reflect current conditions. In some instances, this law \nhasn't been updated in nearly 30 years.\n  The HOME Act will do five things. First, it will increase the \nqualifying income limits for families and set out a three-tiered level \nof income standard instead of the current eight tiered standard. The \nfirst tier will be for families that have one to four individuals, the \nsecond tier is established for families of 5 to 8 persons and the third \ntier is for families larger than eight.\n  The second change will affect the qualifying population limit. \nCurrently, the population limit is tied to communities of 10,000 or \nless in an areas contained within a standard metropolitan statistical \narea, MSA, and communities less than 20,000 if they are not contained \nwithin a MSA. My HOME Act will expand the qualifying population limit \nto encompass rural communities of 40,000 or less.\n  HOME Act legislation will maintain the guaranteed fee that an \napplicant is required to pay at 2 percent, instead of raising the fee \nto 3 percent. This is to keep costs low for the borrower. It will also \nreduce the redtape involved by allowing an applicant that qualifies for \na 502 loan to receive that loan regardless of whether or not the \napplicant can qualify for another Federal Government housing loan.\n  Finally, my bill will provide opportunities for individuals inside \nand outside the 502 program to refinance their loans. These \nopportunities include refinancing to pay for a first or second purchase \nmortgage, for repairs to structural deficiencies, to pay for closing \ncosts, and allow a borrower to consolidate debts up to the greater of \n$10,000 or 10 percent.\n  The 502 program is an excellent program that has helped many \nindividuals and families afford to purchase a clean, affordable home \nthat increases their quality of life. I want to expand this program and \nallow more opportunities for low-income rural Americans to become \nhomeowners. This is a good bill and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to make this bill a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2013. A bill to initially apply the required use of tamper-\nresistant prescription pads under the Medicaid Program to schedule II \nnarcotic drugs and to delay the application of the requirement to other \nprescription drugs for 18 months; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that \nwould delay for 18 months the requirement that doctors write Medicaid \nprescriptions on tamper-resistant paper. I am pleased that my colleague \nand friend, Mr. Voinovich, has agreed to cosponsor this important bill.\n  Let me place the bill in context. The Iraq supplemental signed into \nlaw 2 months ago requires all Medicaid prescriptions to be written on \ntamper-resistant paper effective October 1, 2007.\n  It is important to understand what tamper-resistant prescribing does \nand does not do.\n  First, what it does not do.\n  Tamper-resistant prescribing does not help prevent medication errors, \nwhich occur when a provider writes the wrong prescription, a pharmacist \ndispenses the wrong medicine, or a patient takes the wrong dose of a \nmedicine.\n  Tamper-resistant prescribing does, however, help prevent fraud.\n  Tamper-resistant paper is intended to prevent the fraudulent \nmodification of prescriptions, particularly prescriptions for opiates \nand other narcotics.\n  It is a worthy goal, and one we should pursue.\n  But the October 1, 2007, implementation date simply isn't realistic.\n  More time is needed to inform physicians and pharmacists about these \nnew requirements and make sure that physicians across America have \ntamper-resistant pads in their offices.\n  If we don't delay the requirement, come October 1 pharmacists \nthroughout our Nation will face an impossible situation.\n  The pharmacist can turn the beneficiary away since they are not going \nto be paid if they seek payment for a Medicaid prescription that is not \nwritten on tamper proof paper. Or they can go ahead and fill it and \nhope they don't get sued.\n  And what about the Medicaid beneficiary who needs to fill a \nprescription?\n\n[[Page S10936]]\n\nWhat about the financial integrity of Medicaid itself?\n  Let us say a Medicaid beneficiary needs insulin.\n  How much work does she miss and what is the additional cost to \nMedicaid if, in order to fill her prescription, this beneficiary must: \n1. go to her doctor for a prescription; 2. go to her local pharmacy, \nwhich is forced to turn her away; 3. go to the emergency room in the \nhopes she can get a temporary supply; 4. go back to her doctor for a \ntamper-resistant prescription; and 5. go back to her pharmacy for her \nmedicine?\n  If you give the health care sector enough time to prepare for the \ntamper-proof requirement, that requirement will improve the public \nhealth and reduce Medicaid costs.\n  Implemented prematurely, and the equation flips, Medicaid wastes \ndollars on needless doctor and hospital visits, and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries suffer the consequences of unfilled prescriptions.\n  Providing more time to ensure smooth implementation of the tamper-\nresistant prescribing requirement is the smart thing to do and the \nright thing to do. It is the right thing to do for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, for community pharmacies, and for U.S. taxpayers.\n  On behalf of all of these constituencies, we should send this \nlegislation to the President's desk as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Snowe, \n        Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Collins, \n        Mrs. Murray, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S.J. Res. 17. A joint resolution directing the United States to \ninitiate international discussions and take necessary steps with other \nNations to negotiate an agreement for managing migratory and \ntransboundary fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a Senate joint \nresolution directing the United States to initiate efforts with other \nNations to negotiate international agreements for managing migratory \nand transboundary fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean. As we have seen in \nfar too many cases around the world, fish stocks can easily become \ndepleted when the international community fails to develop effective, \nscience based agreements for conserving and managing shared fish \nstocks. The goal of this resolution is to ensure that we do not repeat \nthat same mistake with any commercial fisheries that develop in the \nArctic Ocean.\n  In many ways, the Arctic Ocean is the final frontier into which the \nworld's commercial fisheries may expand. Currently, industrial fishing \nin this ocean has been limited by the distribution of fish habitat and \nthe short duration of favorable fishing conditions, but that may change \nin the coming years. Scientific evidence suggests that as the world's \nclimate changes, ocean temperature regimes may shift and cause many \nfish stocks to colonize new habitats in the Arctic Ocean.\n  Similarly, fishing vessels may gain greater access to previously \ninhospitable areas of the Arctic.\n  Taken together, these potential shifts may create favorable \nconditions for expanding commercial fisheries in the United States, \nRussia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and other nations that have access to \nthe remote arctic waters.\n  Having seen the fish stock declines that come when multiple nations \ntarget the same stocks without effective coordinated management, it is \nvital that these nations work together to prevent this outcome.\n  Given the benefit of foresight and our ability to anticipate the need \nfor international fisheries management systems in the Arctic, we must \nnow begin the process of creating such a system before commercial \nfisheries become firmly established there.\n  The North Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council, the body \nthat manages U.S. fisheries in the North Pacific, recognizes the need \nto develop an effective management plan for Arctic Ocean fishing before \nsignificant fishing activity occurs. In June 2007, the council approved \na proposal to close all Federal waters in the Arctic Ocean to fishing \nuntil they develop and implement a fisheries management plan. This \naction should serve as a signal to the rest of the United States and to \nall nations interested in Arctic Ocean fishing that sound conservation \nand management plans should be our top priority before moving forward \nto develop commercial fisheries there.\n  This Senate joint resolution builds upon the efforts of the North \nPacific Regional Fisheries Management Council and takes it a step \nfurther by calling on the United States to lead international efforts \nto develop international fisheries management agreements for the Arctic \nOcean. Such agreements should promote management systems for member \nnations that emphasize science-based limits on harvests, timely and \naccurate reporting of catch-and-trade data, equitable allocation and \naccess systems, and effective monitoring and enforcement. These \nfisheries management principles are consistent with the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Amendments Act that was \nenacted last January and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. Such \nprinciples are vital for preventing proliferation of illegal, \nunreported, and unregulated--what we call IUU--fishing which \nunfortunately continues to plague and undermine other international \nfisheries.\n  This resolution contains other important provisions as well. While \nnegotiating any agreements for the arctic fisheries, the United States \nshould consult with the North Pacific Regional Fishery Management \nCouncil and Alaska Native subsistence communities in the Arctic. And, \nof course, consistent with the President's October 2006 Memorandum on \nPromoting Sustainable Fisheries and Ending Destructive Fishing \nPractices, this resolution calls on the United States to support \ninternational efforts to halt the expansion of commercial fisheries on \nthe high seas of the Arctic Ocean until effective international \nagreements are enforced.\n  On behalf of Alaska's subsistence and commercial fishing communities \nand the organizations that work to sustain our fisheries, I thank the \nmany cosponsors of this resolution for sharing our great concern for \nsound fisheries management.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                            S. Joint Res. 17\n\n       Whereas the decline of several commercially valuable fish \n     stocks throughout the world's oceans highlights the need for \n     fishing nations to conserve fish stocks and develop \n     management systems that promote fisheries sustainability;\n       Whereas fish stocks are migratory throughout their \n     habitats, and changing ocean conditions can restructure \n     marine habitats and redistribute the species dependent on \n     those habitats;\n       Whereas changing global climate regimes may increase ocean \n     water temperature, creating suitable new habitats in areas \n     previously too cold to support certain fish stocks, such as \n     the Arctic Ocean;\n       Whereas habitat expansion and migration of fish stocks into \n     the Arctic Ocean and the potential for vessel docking and \n     navigation in the Arctic Ocean could create conditions \n     favorable for establishing and expanding commercial fisheries \n     in the future;\n       Whereas commercial fishing has occurred in several regions \n     of the Arctic Ocean, including the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, \n     Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Greenland Sea, although \n     fisheries scientists have only limited data on current and \n     projected future fish stock abundance and distribution \n     patterns throughout the Arctic Ocean;\n       Whereas remote indigenous communities in all nations that \n     border the Arctic Ocean engage in limited, small scale \n     subsistence fishing and must maintain access to and \n     sustainability of this fishing in order to survive;\n       Whereas many of these communities depend on a variety of \n     other marine life for social, cultural and subsistence \n     purposes, including marine mammals and seabirds that may be \n     adversely affected by climate change, and emerging fisheries \n     in the Arctic should take into account the social, economic, \n     cultural and subsistence needs of these small coastal \n     communities;\n       Whereas managing for fisheries sustainability requires that \n     all commercial fishing be conducted in accordance with \n     science-based limits on harvest, timely and accurate \n     reporting of catch data, equitable allocation and access \n     systems, and effective monitoring and enforcement systems;\n       Whereas migratory fish stocks traverse international \n     boundaries between the exclusive economic zones of fishing \n     nations and the high seas, and ensuring sustainability of \n     fisheries targeting these stocks requires management systems \n     based on international coordination and cooperation;\n\n[[Page S10937]]\n\n       Whereas international fishing treaties and agreements \n     provide a framework for establishing rules to guide \n     sustainable fishing activities among those nations that are \n     parties to the agreement, and regional fisheries management \n     organizations provide international fora for implementing \n     these agreements and facilitating international cooperation \n     and collaboration;\n       Whereas under its authorities in the Magnuson-Stevens \n     Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the North Pacific \n     Fishery Management Council has proposed that the United \n     States close all Federal waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort \n     Seas to commercial fishing until a fisheries management plan \n     is fully developed; and\n       Whereas future commercial fishing and fisheries management \n     activities in the Arctic Ocean should be developed through a \n     coordinated international framework, as provided by \n     international treaties or regional fisheries management \n     organizations, and this framework should be implemented \n     before significant commercial fishing activity expands to the \n     high seas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and the House of Representatives in \n     Congress assembled That--\n       (1) the United States should initiate international \n     discussions and take necessary steps with other Arctic \n     nations to negotiate an agreement or agreements for managing \n     migratory, transboundary, and straddling fish stocks in the \n     Arctic Ocean and establishing a new international fisheries \n     management organization or organizations for the region;\n       (2) the agreement or agreements negotiated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) should conform to the requirements of the \n     United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement and contain mechanisms, \n     inter alia, for establishing catch and bycatch limits, \n     harvest allocations, observers, monitoring, data collection \n     and reporting, enforcement, and other elements necessary for \n     sustaining future Arctic fish stocks;\n       (3) as international fisheries agreements are negotiated \n     and implemented, the United States should consult with the \n     North Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and Alaska \n     Native subsistence communities of the Arctic; and\n       (4) until the agreement or agreements negotiated pursuant \n     to paragraph (1) come into force and measures consistent with \n     the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement are in effect, the \n     United States should support international efforts to halt \n     the expansion of commercial fishing activities in the high \n     seas of the Arctic Ocean.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10937-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 299--RECOGNIZING THE RELIGIOUS AND HISTORICAL \n                 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FESTIVAL OF DIWALI\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 300\n\n       Whereas, on April 8, 1993, the United Nations General \n     Assembly admitted as a member the Former Yugoslav Republic of \n     Macedonia (FYROM), under the name the ``Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia'';\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 817 \n     (1993) states that the dispute over the name must be resolved \n     to maintain peaceful relations between Greece and FYROM;\n       Whereas, on September 13, 1995, Greece and FYROM signed a \n     United Nations-brokered Interim Accord that, among other \n     things, commits them to not ``support claims to any part of \n     the territory of the other party or claims for a change of \n     their existing frontiers'';\n       Whereas a pre-eminent goal of the United Nations Interim \n     Accord was to stop FYROM from utilizing, since its admittance \n     to the United Nations in 1993, what the Accord calls \n     ``propaganda'', including in school textbooks;\n       Whereas a television report in recent years showed students \n     in a state-run school in FYROM still being taught that parts \n     of Greece, including Greek Macedonia, are rightfully part of \n     FYROM;\n       Whereas some textbooks, including the Military Academy \n     textbook published in 2004 by the Military Academy ``General \n     Mihailo Apostolski'' in the FYROM capital city, contain maps \n     showing that a ``Greater Macedonia'' extends many miles south \n     into Greece to Mount Olympus and miles east to Mount Pirin in \n     Bulgaria;\n       Whereas, in direct contradiction of the spirit of the \n     United Nations Interim Accord's section ``A'', entitled \n     ``Friendly Relations and Confidence Building Measures'', \n     which attempts to eliminate challenges regarding ``historic \n     and cultural patrimony'', the Government of FYROM recently \n     renamed the capital city's international airport ``Alexander \n     the Great Airport'';\n       Whereas the aforementioned acts constitute a breach of \n     FYROM's international obligations deriving from the spirit of \n     the United Nations Interim Accord, which provide that FYROM \n     should abstain from any form of ``propaganda'' against \n     Greece's historical or cultural heritage;\n       Whereas such acts are not compatible with Article 10 of the \n     United Nations Interim Accord, which calls for ``improving \n     understanding and good neighbourly relations'', as well as \n     with European standards and values endorsed by European Union \n     member-states; and\n       Whereas this information, like that exposed in the media \n     report and elsewhere, being used contrary to the United \n     Nations Interim Accord instills hostility and a rationale for \n     irredentism in portions of the population of FYROM toward \n     Greece and the history of Greece: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) \n     to observe its obligations under Article 7 of the 1995 United \n     Nations-brokered Interim Accord, which directs the parties to \n     ``promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile \n     activities or propaganda by state-controlled agencies and to \n     discourage acts by private entities likely to incite \n     violence, hatred or hostility'' and review the contents of \n     textbooks, maps, and teaching aids to ensure that such tools \n     are stating accurate information; and\n       (2) urges FYROM to work with Greece within the framework of \n     the United Nations process to achieve longstanding United \n     States and United Nations policy goals by reaching a \n     mutually-acceptable official name for FYROM.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10937-3", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10937-S10938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 301--RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n   DESEGREGATION OF LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL, ONE OF THE MOST \n        SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Pryor) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Cheney \n     stated that ``[m]any of us are convinced that Saddam will \n     acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon.'';\n       (C) on September 8, 2002, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``[w]e do know, with absolute certainty, that he \n     is using his procurement system to acquire the equipment he \n     needs in order to enrich uranium to build a nuclear \n     weapon.'';\n       (D) on September 20, 2002, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``we now have irrefutable evidence that he has \n     once again set up and reconstituted his program, to take \n     uranium, to enrich it to sufficiently high grade, so that it \n     will function as the base material as a nuclear weapon.'';\n       (E) on October 7, 2002, President George W.

Bush stated \n     that ``[w]e don't know whether or not [Saddam] has a nuclear \n     weapon.'';\n       (G) on January 28, 2003, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``[t]he British government has learned that Saddam \n     Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium \n     from Africa.''; and\n       (H) on March 16, 2003, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``[w]e believe [Hussein] has, in fact, \n     reconstituted nuclear weapons.''.\n       (b) Saddam's Alleged Intent to Use Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate \n     assessed that ``Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line \n     short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or \n     CBW against the United States, fearing that exposure of Iraqi \n     involvement would provide Washington a stronger cause for \n     making war'' and that ``Iraq probably would attempt \n     clandestine attacks against the United States Homeland if \n     Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the \n     regime were imminent or unavoidable, or possibly for \n     revenge.''.\n       (2) President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard B. \n     Cheney made misleading statements, that were not supported by \n     the available intelligence, suggesting that Saddam Hussein \n     sought weapons of mass destruction for the purpose of an \n     unprovoked, offensive attack, including--\n       (A) on August 26, 2002, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``. . . there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now \n     has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is \n     amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, \n     and against us.'';\n       (B) on August 26, 2002, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``[t]hese are not weapons for the purpose of \n     defending Iraq; these are offensive weapons for the purpose \n     of inflicting death on a massive scale, developed so that \n     Saddam can hold the threat over the head of anyone he \n     chooses, in his own region or beyond.''; and\n       (C) on October 2, 2002, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``On its present course, the Iraqi regime is a threat of \n     unique urgency. We know the treacherous history of the \n     regime. It has waged a war against its neighbors, it has \n     sponsored and sheltered terrorists, it has developed weapons \n     of mass death, it has used them against innocent men, women \n     and children. We know the designs of the Iraqi regime.''.\n       (c) Saddam's Alleged Links to Al Qaeda and 9/11.--The \n     Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Before the war, the Central Intelligence Agency \n     assessed that ``Saddam has viewed Islamic extremists \n     operating inside Iraq as a threat, and his regime since its \n     inception has arrested and executed members of both Shia and \n     Sunni groups to disrupt their organizations and limit their \n     influence,'' that ``Saddam Hussain and Usama bin Laden are \n     far from being natural partners,'' and that assessments about \n     Iraqi links to al Qaeda rest on ``a body of fragmented, \n     conflicting reporting from sources of varying reliability.''.\n       (2) President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard B. \n     Cheney overstated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein by \n     making unqualified assertions that were not supported by \n     available intelligence linking Saddam Hussein to the \n     September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and stating that Saddam \n     Hussein and al Qaeda had a relationship and that Saddam \n     Hussein would provide al Qaeda with weapons of mass \n     destruction for purposes of an offensive attack against the \n     United States, including--\n       (A) on September 25, 2002, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``[Y]ou can't distinguish between al Qa'ida and Saddam \n     when you talk about the war on terror.'';\n       (B) on September 26, 2002, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``[t]he dangers we face will only worsen from month to \n     month and from year to year . . . Each passing day could be \n     the one on which the Iraqi regime gives anthrax or VX--nerve \n     gas--or some day a nuclear weapon to a terrorist ally.'';\n       (C) on October 14, 2002, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``[t]his is a man that we know has had connections with \n     al Qa'ida. This is a man who, in my judgment, would like to \n     use al Qa'ida as a forward army.'';\n       (D) on November 7, 2002, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``[Saddam is] a threat because he is dealing with al \n     Qaida . . . [A] true threat facing our country is that an al \n     Qaida-type network trained and armed by Saddam could attack \n     America and not leave one fingerprint.'';\n       (E) on January 31, 2003, President George W. Bush stated \n     that ``Saddam Hussein would like nothing more than to use a \n     terrorist network to attack and to kill and leave no \n     fingerprints behind.'';\n       (F) on March 16, 2003, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``we also have to address the question of where \n     might these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction, \n     chemical weapons, biological weapons,\n\n[[Page S10939]]\n\n     nuclear weapons? And Saddam Hussein becomes a prime suspect \n     in that regard because of his past track record and because \n     we know he has, in fact, developed these kinds of \n     capabilities, chemical and biological weapons. We know he's \n     used chemical weapons. And we know he's reconstituted these \n     programs since the Gulf War. We know he's out trying once \n     again to produce nuclear weapons and we know that he has a \n     long-standing relationship with various terrorist groups, \n     including the al-Qaeda organization.'';\n       (G) on March 17, 2003, President George W. Bush stated that \n     ``The danger is clear: using chemical, biological or, one \n     day, nuclear weapons obtained with the help of Iraq, the \n     terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill \n     thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our \n     country or any other.'';\n       (H) on May 1, 2003, President George W. Bush stated that \n     ``[t]he liberation of Iraq . . . removed an ally of al \n     Qaeda.'';\n       (I) on September 14, 2003, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``the Iraqi intelligen[ce] service had a \n     relationship with al Qaeda that developed throughout the \n     decade of the 90's. That was clearly official policy.'';\n       (J) on September 14, 2003, Vice President Richard B. Cheney \n     stated that ``[i]f we're successful in Iraq . . . we will \n     have struck a major blow right at the heart of the base, if \n     you will, the geographic base of the terrorists who have had \n     us under assault now for many years, but most especially on \n     9/11.''; and\n       (K) on March 21, 2006, President George W. Bush said at a \n     press conference, ``But we realized on September the 11th, \n     2001, that killers could destroy innocent life. And I'm never \n     going to forget it. And I'm never going to forget the vow I \n     made to the American people that we will do everything in our \n     power to protect our people. Part of that meant to make sure \n     that we didn't allow people to provide safe haven to an \n     enemy. And that's why I went into Iraq.''.\n       (d) Inadequate Planning and Insufficient Troop Levels.--The \n     Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The intelligence community judged in January 2003 that \n     ``[t]he ouster of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussayn would pose a \n     variety of significant policy challenges for whoever assumes \n     responsibility for governing Iraq'' including ``political \n     transformation, controlling internal strife, solving economic \n     and humanitarian challenges, and dealing with persistent \n     foreign policy and security concerns.''.\n       (2) The intelligence community judged in January 2003 that \n     ``a post-Saddam authority would face a deeply divided society \n     with a significant chance that domestic groups would engage \n     in violent conflict with each other unless an occupying force \n     prevented them from doing so.''.\n       (3) These judgments were delivered to the White House and \n     Office of the Vice President.\n       (4) Then Army Chief of Staff General Shinseki testified on \n     February 25, 2003, that ``something on the order of several \n     hundred thousands soldiers'' would be needed to secure Iraq \n     following a successful completion of the war.\n       (5) General Abizaid, then-CENTCOM commander, testified \n     before the Senate Armed Services Committee on November 15, \n     2006, that ``General Shinseki was right that a greater \n     international force contribution, United States force \n     contribution and Iraqi force contribution should have been \n     available immediately after major combat operations.''.\n       (6) After President George W. Bush declared the end of \n     major combat operations in Iraq, there were insufficient \n     troops to prevent the outbreak of violence and lawlessness \n     that contributed to the flight of millions of Iraqis and the \n     deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqis.\n       (7) The Government Accountability Office provided testimony \n     to the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, \n     House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, on March \n     22, 2007, that due to insufficient troop levels, United \n     States forces were unable to secure conventional weapons \n     stockpiles in Iraq that continue to pose a threat to American \n     servicemembers.\n       (8) President George W. Bush failed to ensure that plans \n     were prepared and implemented to address the challenges that \n     the intelligence community predicted would occur after the \n     ouster of Saddam Hussein, and in particular failed to ensure \n     that there were sufficient coalition troops in Iraq after \n     major combat operations ended to maintain security and secure \n     weapons stockpiles.\n       (e) Strain on Military and Undermining Homeland Security.--\n     The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Retired Major General John Batiste, former commander of \n     the First Infantry Division in Iraq, testified before the \n     House Committee on Foreign Affairs on June 27, 2007, that \n     ``[o]ur Army and Marine Corps are at a breaking point at a \n     time in history when we need a strong military the most. The \n     cycle of deployments is staggering. American formations \n     continue to lose a battalion's worth of dead and wounded \n     every month with little to show for it. The current \n     recruiting system falls drastically short of long-term \n     requirements and our all-volunteer force can not sustain the \n     current tempo for much longer. The military is spending over \n     $1,000,000,000 a year in incentives in a last ditch effort to \n     keep the force together. Young officers and noncommissioned \n     officers are leaving the service at an alarming rate.''.\n       (2) Extended deployments of 15 months, and insufficient \n     time to rest and train between deployments, have undermined \n     the readiness of the Army.\n       (3) The Army National Guard reported as early as July 2005 \n     that equipment transfers to deploying units ``had largely \n     exhausted its inventory of more than 220 critical items, \n     including some items useful to nondeployed units for training \n     and domestic missions.''.\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office found, in \n     September 2006, that ``[a]mong the items for which the Army \n     National Guard had shortages of over 80 percent of the \n     authorized inventory were chemical warfare monitoring and \n     decontamination equipment and night vision goggles''.\n       (5) President George W. Bush's policies in Iraq have \n     undermined homeland security by depleting the personnel and \n     equipment needed by the National Guard.\n       (f) Insurgency in ``Last Throes''.--The Senate finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Multi-National Force-Iraq reports indicate that the \n     number of attacks on coalition forces has increased since the \n     beginning of military action.\n       (2) The Government Accountability Office, in March 2007, \n     reported that attacks using improvised explosive devices \n     continued to increase between 2005 and July 2006.\n       (3) On June 23, 2005, General John Abizaid, in his capacity \n     as head of Central Command, testified before the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee about the state of the insurgency that \n     ``[i]n terms of comparison from 6 months ago, in terms of \n     foreign fighters I believe there are more foreign fighters \n     coming into Iraq than there were 6 months ago. In terms of \n     the overall strength of the insurgency, I'd say it's about \n     the same as it was.''.\n       (4) President George W. Bush's Initial Benchmark Assessment \n     report from July 12, 2007, states that ``[a]s a result of \n     increased offensive operations, Coalition and Iraqi Forces \n     have sustained increased attacks in Iraq, particularly in \n     Baghdad, Diyala, and Salah ad Din.''.\n       (5) Vice President Richard B. Cheney made misleading \n     statements that the insurgency in Iraq was in its ``last \n     throes,'' including--\n       (A) on May 30, 2005, Vice President Richard B. Cheney said, \n     ``The level of activity that we see today from a military \n     standpoint, I think, will clearly decline. I think they're in \n     the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.''; and\n       (B) on June 19, 2006, Vice President Richard B. Cheney was \n     asked whether he still supported the comment he made in 2005, \n     regarding the fact that the insurgency in Iraq was in its \n     ``last throes,'' to which he responded ``I do.''\n\n     SEC. 2. CENSURE BY THE SENATE.\n\n       The Senate censures President George W. Bush and Vice \n     President Richard B. Cheney for--\n       (1) misleading the American people about the basis for \n     going to war in Iraq;\n       (2) failing to plan adequately for the war;\n       (3) pursuing policies in Iraq that have strained our \n     military and undermined our homeland security; and\n       (4) misleading the American people about the insurgency in \n     Iraq.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing two censure \nresolutions condemning the President, Vice President, and Attorney \nGeneral for their misconduct relating to the war in Iraq and for their \nrepeated assaults on the rule of law. These censure resolutions are \ncritical steps to hold the administration accountable for the \nmisconduct and egregious abuses of the law that we have witnessed over \nthe past 6\\1/2\\ years.\n  When future generations look back at the misbehavior of this \nadministration, they need to know that an equal branch of Government \nstood up and formally repudiated that misbehavior. They need to know \nthat this administration was not allowed to violate with impunity the \nprinciples on which our Nation was founded.\n  Some have said that censure does too little. Others protest that it \ngoes too far. I understand the concerns of those who believe that this \nadministration deserves worse than censure. I agree that censure is not \na cure for the devastating toll this administration's actions have had \non this country. But it is a step in the right direction and it most \ncertainly is important for the historical record. Because censure does \nnot require multiple impeachments in the House and trials in the \nSenate, or the support of two-thirds of Senators, it is far less \ncumbersome than impeachment. We can pass these resolutions without \ntaking significant time away from our efforts to address other pressing \nmatters.\n  The first resolution, S. Res. 302, cosponsored by Senators Harkin and \nBoxer, censures the President and Vice President for their misconduct \nrelating to the war in Iraq. It cites their misleading pre-war \nstatements, which\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\nwere not based on available intelligence, exaggerating the threat posed \nby Saddam Hussein and the likelihood that he had nuclear weapons, and \nfalsely implying that he had a relationship with al Qaeda and links to \n9/11. This resolution also condemns the President's appalling failure \nto ensure that adequate plans were in place to address the post-Saddam \nproblems predicted by the intelligence community, and in particular his \nfailure to ensure that sufficient troops were deployed to maintain \norder and secure weapons stockpiles in Iraq. The resolution censures \nthe President for pursuing policies in Iraq that have placed unfair \nburdens on our brave men and women in uniform and undermined our \nhomeland security. The resolution censures the Vice President for his \nmisleading statements about the Iraqi insurgency being in its ``last \nthroes.'' The Vice President's recent, belated concession that he was \nincorrect does not mitigate his efforts to mislead the American people \non this point.\n  The second resolution, S. Res. 303, cosponsored by Senator Harkin, \ncensures the President and Attorney General for undermining the rule of \nlaw. The President and Attorney General have shown flagrant disregard \nfor statutes, for treaties ratified by the United States, and for our \nown Constitution--all in an effort to consolidate more and more power \nin the executive branch. In the process, they have repeatedly misled \nthe American people. Among the abuses of the rule of law that this \ncensure resolution addresses are the illegal warrantless wiretapping \nprogram at the National Security Agency, the administration's \ninterrogation policy, extreme positions taken on treatment of detainees \nthat have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court, misleading \nstatements by the President and the Attorney General on the USA PATRIOT \nAct, the refusal to recognize and cooperate with Congress's legitimate \nresponsibility to conduct oversight, and the use of signing statements \nthat further demonstrate this President does not believe he has to \nfollow the laws that Congress writes.\n  More than a year ago, I introduced a resolution to censure the \nPresident for breaking the law with his warrantless wiretapping program \nand for misleading the public and Congress before and after the program \nwas revealed. This time, I am taking a broader approach because \nevidence of the administration's misconduct, misleading statements and \nabuses of power has only mounted since then.\n  While I do not believe impeachment proceedings would be best for the \ncountry, I share the public's deep anger at this administration's \nrepeated and serious wrongdoing and its refusal to acknowledge or \nanswer for its actions. These two resolutions give Congress a way to \ncondemn the administration's actions without taking time and energy \naway from the other critically important work before us.\n  Passing these resolutions would also make clear, not only to the \nAmerican people today, but also to future generations, how this \nPresident and this administration misserved the country. History will \njudge them, and us, by our actions, so we must formally condemn the \nmalfeasance of this President and his administration.\n  Censure is a measured approach that both holds this administration \naccountable and allows Congress to focus on ending the war in Iraq, \nprotecting the rule of law and addressing the many other needs of the \nAmerican people. I am pleased to be working with Congressman Maurice \nHinchey, who is introducing companion legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10940-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10940-S10943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 303--CENSURING THE PRESIDENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Harkin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 303\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. BASIS FOR CENSURE.\n\n       (a) National Security Agency Wiretapping.--The Senate finds \n     the following:\n       (1) Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and in so doing \n     provided the executive branch with clear authority to wiretap \n     suspected terrorists inside the United States.\n       (2) Section 201 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 states that it and the criminal wiretap law are \n     the ``exclusive means by which electronic surveillance'' may \n     be conducted by the United States Government, and section 109 \n     of that Act makes it a crime to wiretap individuals without \n     complying with this statutory authority.\n       (3) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 both \n     permits the Government to initiate wiretapping immediately in \n     emergencies as long as the Government obtains approval from \n     the court established under section 103 of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) within \n     72 hours of initiating the wiretap, and authorizes wiretaps \n     without a court order otherwise required by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 for the first 15 days \n     following a declaration of war by Congress.\n       (4) The Authorization for Use of Military Force that became \n     law on September 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 \n     note), did not grant the President the power to authorize \n     wiretaps of Americans within the United States without \n     obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n       (5) The President's inherent constitutional authority does \n     not give him the power to violate the explicit statutory \n     prohibition on warrantless wiretaps in the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n       (6) George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     authorized the National Security Agency to wiretap Americans \n     within the United States without obtaining the court orders \n     required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     for more than 5 years.\n       (7) Alberto R. Gonzales, as Attorney General of the United \n     States and as Counsel to the President, reviewed and defended \n     the legality of the President's authorization of wiretaps by \n     the National Security Agency of Americans within the United \n     States without the court orders required by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n       (8) President George W. Bush repeatedly misled the public \n     prior to the public disclosure of the National Security \n     Agency warrantless surveillance program by indicating his \n     Administration was relying on court orders to wiretap \n     suspected terrorists inside the United States.\n       (9) Alberto R. Gonzales misled Congress in January 2005 \n     during the hearing on his nomination to be Attorney General \n     of the United States by indicating that a question about \n     whether the President has the authority to authorize \n     warrantless wiretaps in violation of statutory prohibitions \n     presented a ``hypothetical situation,'' even though he was \n     fully aware that a warrantless wiretapping program had been \n     ongoing for several years.\n       (10) In statements about the supposed need for the National \n     Security Agency warrantless surveillance program after the \n     public disclosure of the program, President George W. Bush \n     falsely implied that the program was necessary because the \n     executive branch did not otherwise have authority to wiretap \n     suspected terrorists inside the United States.\n       (11) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, despite his \n     admitted awareness that congressional critics of the program \n     support wiretapping terrorists in accordance with the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, attempted to create \n     the opposite impression by making public statements such as \n     ``[s]ome people will argue that nothing could justify the \n     Government being able to intercept conversations like the \n     ones the Program targets''.\n       (12) President George W. Bush inaccurately stated in his \n     January 31, 2006, State of the Union address that \n     ``[p]revious Presidents have used the same constitutional \n     authority I have, and federal courts have approved the use of \n     that authority.'', even though the Administration has failed \n     to identify a single instance since the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 became law in which another \n     President has authorized wiretaps inside the United States \n     without complying with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978, and no Federal court has evaluated whether the \n     President has the inherent authority to authorize wiretaps \n     inside the United States without complying with the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.\n       (13) At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on February 6, \n     2006, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales defended the \n     President's misleading statements in the January 31, 2006, \n     State of the Union address.\n       (14) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales has misled \n     Congress and the American people repeatedly by stating that \n     there was no serious disagreement among Government officials \n     ``about'' or ``relate[d] to'' the National Security Agency \n     program confirmed by the President.\n       (15) According to testimony from former Deputy Attorney \n     General James Comey, Alberto R. Gonzales, while serving as \n     Counsel to the President, participated in a visit to then-\n     Attorney General John Ashcroft in the intensive care unit of \n     the hospital in an attempt to convince Mr. Ashcroft to \n     overturn the decision by Mr. Comey, then serving as Acting \n     Attorney General due to Mr. Ashcroft's illness, not to \n     certify the legality of a classified intelligence program, in \n     what Mr. Comey described as ``an effort to take advantage of \n     a very sick man''.\n       (b) Detainee and Torture Policy.--The Senate finds the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\n       (1) The United States is a party to the Convention Against \n     Torture, the Geneva Conventions, and the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n       (2) Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions requires \n     that detainees in armed conflicts other than those between \n     nations ``shall in all circumstances be treated humanely,'' \n     and the Third Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners \n     of War provides additional protections for detainees who \n     qualify as ``prisoners of war''.\n       (3) United States law criminalizes any ``act specifically \n     intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering'' under sections 2340 and 2340A of title 18, United \n     States Code, and the War Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. 2441) and \n     recognizes the gravity of such offenses by further providing \n     for civil liability under the Torture Victim Protection Act \n     and the Alien Tort Claims Act.\n       (4) In a draft memorandum dated January 25, 2002, Alberto \n     R. Gonzales, in his capacity as Counsel to the President, \n     argued that the protections of the Third Geneva Convention \n     should not be afforded to Taliban and al Qaeda detainees, and \n     described provisions of the Convention as ``quaint'' and \n     ``obsolete''.\n       (5) The January 25, 2002, memorandum by then-Counsel to the \n     President Alberto R. Gonzales cited ``reduc[ing] the threat \n     of domestic criminal prosecution'' as a ``positive'' \n     consequence of disavowing the Geneva Conventions' \n     applicability, asserting that such a disavowal ``would \n     provide a solid defense to any future prosecution'' in the \n     event a prosecutor brought charges under the domestic War \n     Crimes Act.\n       (6) Secretary of State Colin Powell responded in a January \n     26, 2002, memorandum that such an attempt to evade the Geneva \n     Conventions would ``reverse over a century of U.S. policy and \n     practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions and undermine \n     the protections of the rule of law for our troops''.\n       (7) Despite the warnings of the Secretary of State and in \n     contravention of the language of the Third Geneva Convention, \n     President George W. Bush announced on February 7, 2002, \n     that--\n       (A) he did not consider the Convention to apply to al Qaeda \n     fighters; and\n       (B) Taliban detainees would not be entitled to ``prisoner \n     of war'' status under the Convention, despite the fact that \n     Article 5 of the Convention and United States Army \n     regulations expressly require such determinations to be made \n     by a ``competent tribunal''.\n       (8) The Supreme Court, in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, confirmed \n     that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to \n     Taliban forces and al Qaeda forces, and characterized a \n     central legal premise by which the President sought to avoid \n     the obligations of international law as ``erroneous''.\n       (9) Alberto R. Gonzales, acting as Counsel to the \n     President, solicited and accepted the August 1, 2002, Office \n     of Legal Counsel memorandum entitled ``Standards of Conduct \n     for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2340-2340A'', \n     which took the untenable position that ``mere infliction of \n     pain'' is not ``torture'' unless ``the victim . . . \n     experiences intense pain or suffering of the kind that is \n     equivalent to the pain that would be associated with serious \n     physical injury so severe that death, organ failure, or \n     permanent damage resulting in a loss of significant body \n     function will likely result.''.\n       (10) According to the ``Review of Department of Defense \n     Detention Operations and Detainee Interrogation Techniques'' \n     (the ``Church Report''), issued on March 7, 2005, then-\n     Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on December 2, 2002, \n     authorized the use on Guantanamo Bay detainees of harsh \n     interrogation techniques not listed in the Army Field Manual, \n     including stress positions, hooding, the use of military dogs \n     to exploit phobias, prolonged isolation, sensory deprivation, \n     and forcing Muslim men to shave their beards.\n       (11) According to the ``Article 15-6 Investigation of \n     CJSOTF-AP [Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-\n     Arabian Peninsula] and 5th SF [Special Forces] Group \n     Detention Operation (Formica Report)'' and Department of \n     Defense documents released under the Freedom of Information \n     Act, Guantanamo Bay detainees were chained to the floor, \n     subjected to loud music, fed only bread and water, and kept \n     for some period of time in cells measuring 4 feet by 4 feet \n     by 20 inches.\n       (12) The March 2004 investigative report of Major General \n     Antonio Taguba documented ``sadistic, blatant and wanton \n     criminal abuses'' against detainees at the Abu Ghraib \n     detention facility, including sexual and physical abuse, the \n     threat of torture, the forcing of detainees to perform \n     degrading acts designed to assault their religious identity, \n     and the use of dogs to frighten detainees.\n       (13) According to Department of Defense documents released \n     under the Freedom of Information Act, the United States Armed \n     Forces held certain Iraqis as ``ghost detainees,'' who were \n     ``not accounted for'' and were hidden from the observation of \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\n       (14) Military autopsy reports and death certificates \n     released pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act revealed \n     that at least 39 deaths, and probably more, have occurred \n     among detainees in United States custody overseas, \n     approximately half of which were homicides and 7 of which \n     appear to have been caused by ``strangulation,'' \n     ``asphyxiation'' or fatal ``blunt force injuries''.\n       (15) On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush stated \n     that he had authorized the incommunicado detention of certain \n     suspected terrorist leaders and operatives at secret sites \n     outside the United States under a ``separate program'' \n     operated by the Central Intelligence Agency.\n       (16) President George W. Bush has authorized the indefinite \n     detention, without charge or trial, of more than 700 \n     individuals at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on the ground that \n     they are ``enemy combatants'' and therefore may be held until \n     the cessation of hostilities under the laws of war.\n       (17) Department of Justice lawyers, representing President \n     George W. Bush and the Department of Defense in a Federal \n     lawsuit brought on behalf of Guantanamo detainees, took the \n     unprecedented position that the term ``enemy combatant'' \n     could in theory justify the indefinite detention of a \n     ``little old lady in Switzerland who writes checks to what \n     she thinks is [a] charity that helps orphans in Afghanistan \n     but is really a front to finance al-Qaeda activities'' and \n     ``a person who teaches English to the son of an al Qaeda \n     member''.\n       (18) After the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Rasul \n     v. Bush rejected the claim that an alleged ``enemy \n     combatant'' could be detained indefinitely without any \n     meaningful opportunity to challenge the designation, the \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense issued an order on July 7, 2004, \n     creating ``Combatant Status Review Tribunals'' (CSRTs) for \n     the stated purpose of ``review[ing] the detainee's status as \n     an enemy combatant''.\n       (19) Such Order--\n       (A) did not allow detainees to be represented by counsel in \n     Combatant Status Review Tribunal proceedings, but instead \n     specified that a ``military officer'' would be assigned to \n     ``assist[ ]'' each detainee and required such military \n     officers to inform the detainees that ``I am neither a lawyer \n     nor your advocate,'' and that ``[n]one of the information you \n     provide me shall be held in confidence'';\n       (B) allowed the detainee to be excluded from attendance \n     during review proceedings involving ``testimony or other \n     matters that would compromise national security if held in \n     the presence of the detainee'';\n       (C) allowed the decision-maker to rely on hearsay evidence \n     and specified that ``[t]he Tribunal is not bound by the rules \n     of evidence such as would apply in a court of law''; and\n       (D) specified that ``there shall be a rebuttable \n     presumption in favor of the Government's evidence''.\n       (20) The Government has relied on the above procedures to \n     deprive individuals of their liberty for an indefinite period \n     of time without a meaningful opportunity to confront and \n     rebut the evidence on which that detention is predicated.\n       (21) President George W. Bush and the Department of Defense \n     designated at least 2 United States citizens as ``enemy \n     combatants,'' claimed the right to detain them indefinitely \n     on United States soil without charge and without access to \n     counsel, and argued that allowing meaningful judicial review \n     of their detention would be ``constitutionally intolerable''.\n       (22) The Supreme Court established in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld \n     that meaningful review by a neutral decisionmaker of the \n     detention of United States citizens is constitutionally \n     required, that ``the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a \n     citizen's liberty . . . is very real,'' and that the \n     Constitution mandates that a United States citizen be given a \n     fair opportunity to rebut the Government's ``enemy \n     combatant'' designation.\n       (23) The administration, having consistently claimed that \n     according United States citizens designated as ``enemy \n     combatants'' the due process protections accorded to criminal \n     defendants in civilian courts would jeopardize national \n     security interests of the utmost importance, elected to \n     pursue criminal charges against alleged ``enemy combatant'' \n     Jose Padilla in a civilian court after holding him in \n     military custody for 3 years.\n       (24) The administration, having contended that alleged \n     ``enemy combatant'' and United States citizen Yaser Esam \n     Hamdi was so dangerous that merely allowing him to meet with \n     counsel ``jeopardizes compelling national security \n     interests'' because he might ``pass concealed messages \n     through unwitting intermediaries,'' released Mr. Hamdi from \n     custody after 3 years and allowed him to return to Saudi \n     Arabia.\n       (25) President George W. Bush issued ``Military Order of \n     November 13, 2001, Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain \n     Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,'' which authorized \n     the creation of military tribunals to try suspected al Qaeda \n     members and other international terrorist suspects for \n     violations of the law of war.\n       (26) Alberto R. Gonzales, as Counsel to the President, in a \n     November 30, 2001, newspaper editorial, defended these \n     military tribunals and misleadingly represented that they \n     would have adequate procedural safeguards, by stating: \n     ``Everyone tried before a military commission will know the \n     charges against him, be represented by qualified counsel and \n     be allowed to present a defense.''.\n       (27) The military tribunals' procedural rules as outlined \n     in Military Commission Order No. 1, issued on March 21, 2002, \n     and as subsequently amended--\n       (A) permitted the accused and his civilian counsel to be \n     excluded from any part of the proceeding that the presiding \n     officer decided to close, and never learn what was presented \n     during that portion of the proceeding;\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\n       (B) permitted the introduction of any evidence that the \n     presiding officer determined would have probative value to a \n     reasonable person, thereby permitting the admission of \n     hearsay and evidence obtained through undue coercion; and\n       (C) restricted appellate review of the commissions to a \n     panel appointed by the Secretary of Defense, followed by \n     review by the Secretary of Defense and a final decision by \n     the President, with no provision for direct appeal to the \n     Federal courts for review by civilian judges.\n       (28) Nearly 5 years after the military order was signed, \n     the Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld struck down the \n     military commissions as unlawful, finding that--\n       (A) the military commissions as constituted were not \n     expressly authorized by any congressional act, including the \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force, the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice (UCMJ), and the Detainee Treatment Act;\n       (B) the military commission procedures violated the UCMJ, \n     which mandates that rules governing military commissions be \n     as similar to those governing courts-martial ``as \n     practicable,'' and which affords the accused the right to be \n     present;\n       (C) the military commission procedures violated Common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which is part of the \n     ``law of war'' under UCMJ Article 21 and requires trial in \n     ``a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial \n     guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized \n     peoples''.\n       (29) President George W. Bush sought to prevent the \n     Guantanamo detainees from obtaining judicial review of their \n     indefinite confinement by claiming that the writ of habeas \n     corpus was categorically unavailable to non-citizens held at \n     Guantanamo Bay.\n       (30) The Supreme Court in Rasul v. Bush squarely rejected \n     this claim, holding that the legal precedent on which the \n     President relied ``plainly does not preclude the exercise of \n     [statutory habeas] jurisdiction'' over the detainees' claims, \n     and that the general presumption against extraterritorial \n     application of a statute, cited by the President, ``certainly \n     has no application'' with respect to detainees at Guantanamo \n     Bay where the United States exercises ``complete jurisdiction \n     and control''.\n       (c) United States Attorney Firings and Executive \n     Privilege.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) At least 9 United States Attorneys were told in 2006 \n     that they must step down under the authority of President \n     George W. Bush, who had the final decision-making power in \n     terminating the employment of United States Attorneys.\n       (2) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and subordinates \n     under his supervision repeatedly misled Congress and \n     attempted to block legitimate congressional oversight efforts \n     concerning the firing of at least nine United States \n     Attorneys.\n       (3) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales repeatedly \n     obscured the true scope of the firings, originally declining \n     to cite a specific number of individuals fired in his \n     testimony on January 18, 2007, acknowledging only seven in \n     his USA Today op-ed published on March 6, 2007, acknowledging \n     eight firings in his testimony on April 19, 2007, tacitly \n     conceding there had been nine individuals fired in his \n     testimony on May 10, 2007, and testifying on July 24, 2007, \n     that ``there may have been others'' but he did not know the \n     exact number.\n       (4) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales initially \n     characterized the firings as ``an overblown personnel \n     matter,'' claiming that the United States Attorneys had lost \n     his confidence and were fired for ``performance reasons'' \n     when many of those same individuals had received only the \n     highest performance reviews prior to their dismissal.\n       (5) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales testified before \n     the Senate on January 18, 2007, that he would ``never, ever \n     make a change in a United States attorney for political \n     reasons,'' but in later testimony on April 19, 2007, and July \n     24, 2007, admitted that he does not know who selected each \n     individual United States Attorney for firing or why they were \n     included on the list of United States Attorneys to be fired.\n       (6) Prior to their selection for firing, both former New \n     Mexico United States Attorney David Iglesias and former \n     Washington United States Attorney John McKay received \n     inappropriate phone calls from Members of Congress or their \n     staffs regarding ongoing, politically sensitive \n     investigations and the White House received complaints about \n     the manner in which they were conducting those \n     investigations.\n       (7) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales testified before \n     the Senate on January 18, 2007, that he would not fire a \n     United States Attorney ``if it would in any way jeopardize an \n     ongoing serious investigation,'' but later testified, as did \n     his subordinates, that concerns about whether ongoing \n     investigations would be jeopardized were not explored prior \n     to the firings and were specifically ignored when some fired \n     United States Attorneys asked for a delay in their departure \n     dates to allow them to wrap up ongoing investigations.\n       (8) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales publicly stated on \n     March 13, 2007, that he was ``not involved in seeing any \n     memos, was not involved in any discussions about what was \n     going on'' regarding the process leading up to the firing of \n     the United States Attorneys, but later testimony from his \n     subordinates and documents released by the Department of \n     Justice indicate that the Attorney General was, in fact, \n     regularly briefed on the process and did receive at least one \n     memo in November 2005 regarding the planned firings.\n       (9) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales publicly stated on \n     May 15, 2007, that Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty's \n     participation in the firing of the United States Attorneys \n     was of central importance to the validity of the process and \n     to the Attorney General's decision to fire the specific \n     individuals, but he had previously testified on April 19, \n     2007, that he did not discuss the process with Mr. McNulty \n     prior to firing the United States Attorneys, and that \n     ``looking back . . . I would have had the deputy attorney \n     general more involved, directly involved''.\n       (10) Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales testified on May \n     10, 2007, that, after the start of the congressional \n     investigation into the firings, he had refrained from \n     discussing the firings with anyone involved because he did \n     not want to interfere with the ongoing investigations, but \n     former White House Liaison for the Department of Justice, \n     Monica Goodling, testified on May 23, 2007, that the Attorney \n     General spoke with her in late March of 2007 and ``laid out . \n     . . his general recollection . . . of some of the process \n     regarding the replacement of the United States Attorneys.''\n       (11) Former White House Liaison for the Department of \n     Justice, Monica Goodling, also testified on May 23, 2007, \n     that she did not respond to what Attorney General Alberto R. \n     Gonzales said about his recollection because ``I did not know \n     if it was appropriate for us to both be discussing our \n     recollections of what had happened, and I just thought maybe \n     we shouldn't have that conversation.''\n       (12) President George W. Bush has consistently stonewalled \n     congressional attempts at oversight by refusing to turn over \n     White House documents relating to the firing of at least 9 \n     United States Attorneys and refusing to allow current or \n     former White House officials to testify before Congress on \n     this matter, based on an excessively broad and legally \n     insufficient assertion of executive privilege.\n       (13) President George W. Bush has asserted executive \n     privilege in refusing even to turn over correspondence \n     between non-Executive Branch officials and White House \n     officials concerning the firings of at least 9 United States \n     Attorneys, even though such communications could not \n     reasonably be classified as falling within the privilege.\n       (14) President George W. Bush has directed at least two \n     staff members, former and current, to ignore congressional \n     subpoenas altogether, ordering former Counsel to the \n     President Harriet Miers and current Deputy Chief of Staff and \n     Senior Adviser to the President Karl Rove not to appear at \n     Congressional oversight hearings based on the assertion that \n     immediate presidential advisors are ``immune from compelled \n     Congressional testimony about matters that arose during \n     [their] tenure,'' rather than simply instructing them to \n     refrain from answering questions that might be covered by a \n     proper assertion of executive privilege.\n       (15) President George W. Bush has refused to work to find a \n     compromise with Congress or otherwise accommodate legitimate \n     congressional oversight efforts, disregarding the proper \n     relationship between the executive and legislative branches \n     and demonstrating a belief that he and his Administration are \n     above oversight and the rule of law.\n       (d) Misleading Statements on the USA Patriot Act.--The \n     Senate finds the following:\n       (1) President George W. Bush made misleading claims during \n     the course of the Administration's 2005 campaign to \n     reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, by suggesting that \n     Federal officials did not have access to the same tools to \n     investigate terrorism as they did to investigate other \n     crimes.\n       (2) In 2005 the Federal Bureau of Investigation transmitted \n     to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales multiple reports of \n     violations of law in connection with provisions of the USA \n     PATRIOT Act and related authorities, including unauthorized \n     surveillance and improper collection of communications data \n     that were serious enough to require notification of the \n     President's Intelligence Oversight Board.\n       (3) Despite these reports, Attorney General Alberto R. \n     Gonzales told Congress and the American people in the course \n     of the Administration's 2005 campaign to reauthorize the USA \n     PATRIOT Act of 2001 that ``[t]he track record established \n     over the past three years has demonstrated the effectiveness \n     of the safeguards of civil liberties put in place when the \n     Act was passed,'' that ``[t]here has not been one verified \n     case of civil liberties abuse,'' and that ``no one has \n     provided me with evidence that the Patriot Act is being \n     abused or misused''.\n       (4) The United States Department of Justice sent a 10-page \n     letter to Congress dated November 23, 2005--\n       (A) stating that a November 6, 2005, Washington Post story \n     detailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation's use of \n     National Security Letters was a ``materially misleading \n     portrayal'' full of ``distortions and factual errors'';\n       (B) defending its use of National Security Letters by \n     pointing to the Department's ``robust mechanisms for checking \n     misuse,'' ``significant internal oversight and checks,'' and \n     reports to Congress regarding the number of National Security \n     Letters issued; and\n       (C) stating that the November 6, 2005, Washington Post \n     story was inaccurate in\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\n     stating that ``The FBI now issues more than 30,000 National \n     Security Letters a year, . . . a hundredfold increase over \n     historic norms.''.\n       (5) On March 9, 2007, the Inspector General for the United \n     States Department of Justice issued a report on the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation's use of National Security Letters \n     from 2003 through 2005--\n       (A) that the Inspector General said found ``widespread and \n     serious misuse of the FBI's national security letter \n     authorities'' that ``in many instances . . . violated NSL \n     statutes, Attorney General Guidelines, or the FBI's own \n     internal policies,'' and found that ``the FBI did not provide \n     adequate guidance, adequate controls, or adequate training on \n     the use of these sensitive authorities''; and\n       (B) that indicated the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     issued approximately 39,000 National Security Letter requests \n     in 2003, 56,000 National Security Letter requests in 2004, \n     and 47,000 National Security Letter requests in 2005.\n       (6) The United States Department of Justice sent a letter \n     on March 9, 2007, to Congress, admitting that it had \n     ``determined that certain statements in our November 23, 2005 \n     letter need clarification'' in light of the Inspector \n     General's findings and that ``the reports [The Department of \n     Justice] provided Congress in response to statutory reporting \n     requirements did not accurately reflect the FBI's use of \n     NSLs''.\n       (e) Signing Statements.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) President George W. Bush has lodged more than 800 \n     challenges to duly enacted provisions of law by issuing \n     signing statements that indicate that the President does not \n     believe he must comply with such provisions of law.\n       (2) Such signing statements effectively assign to the \n     executive branch alone the decision whether to fully comply \n     with the laws that Congress has passed.\n       (3) On December 30, 2005, President George W. Bush signed \n     the Department of Defense Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, \n     and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006, title X of which prohibits \n     the Government from subjecting any individual ``in the \n     custody or under the physical control of the United States \n     Government, regardless of nationality or physical location'' \n     to ``cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment''.\n       (4) President George W. Bush issued a signing statement to \n     such Act that suggested he believed he did not have to comply \n     with the prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman and \n     degrading treatment, stating: ``The executive branch shall \n     construe Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to \n     detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional \n     authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive \n     branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the \n     constitutional limitations on the judicial power, which will \n     assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and \n     the President, evidenced in Title X, of protecting the \n     American people from further terrorist attacks.''.\n       (5) On March 9, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the \n     USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, \n     which requires that the executive branch furnish reports to \n     Congress on certain surveillance activities.\n       (6) President George W. Bush issued a signing statement to \n     such Act that suggested he believed he did not have to comply \n     fully with these reporting requirements, stating: ``The \n     executive branch shall construe the provisions of H.R. 3199 \n     that call for furnishing information to entities outside the \n     executive branch, such as sections 106A and 119, in a manner \n     consistent with the President's constitutional authority to \n     supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold \n     information the disclosure of which could impair foreign \n     relations, national security, the deliberative processes of \n     the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's \n     constitutional duties.''.\n       (7) On December 20, 2006, President George W. Bush signed \n     the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which protects \n     certain classes of sealed domestic mail from being opened \n     except in specifically defined circumstances.\n       (8) President George W. Bush issued a signing statement to \n     such Act that suggested he believed he did not have to comply \n     with this provision, stating: ``The executive branch shall \n     construe subsection 404(c) of title 39, as enacted by \n     subsection 1010(e) of the Act, which provides for opening of \n     an item of a class of mail otherwise sealed against \n     inspection, in a manner consistent, to the maximum extent \n     permissible, with the need to conduct searches in exigent \n     circumstances, such as to protect human life and safety \n     against hazardous materials, and the need for physical \n     searches specifically authorized by law for foreign \n     intelligence collection.''\n       (9) The American Bar Association Task Force on Presidential \n     Signing Statements and the Separation of Powers Doctrine \n     concluded that President George W. Bush's misuse of signing \n     statements ``weaken[s] our cherished system of checks and \n     balances and separation of powers''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CENSURE BY THE SENATE.\n\n       The Senate censures George W. Bush, President of the United \n     States, and Alberto R.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce a sense of the Senate regarding a recent Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services, CMS, national coverage determination on the \ntreatment of anemia in Medicare cancer patients.\n  On June 29, 2007, I wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services \nMichael Leavitt concerning the proposed CMS coverage determination that \nlimits access to erythropoiesis-simulating agents which increases the \nred blood cell counts of chemotherapy patients who have become anemic. \nFurther, 51 other Senators sent similar letters to Department of Health \nand Human Services officials.\n  On July 30, 2007, CMS issued the final coverage determination, and \nwhile some of the proposed restrictions were substantially altered in \nfavor of patients, I remain concerned about the impact that this \ndecision will have on Medicare beneficiary access to needed therapies. \nThe new policy requires that patients have lower red blood cell counts \nbefore being able to receive treatment with an erythropoiesis-\nsimulating agent, resulting in patients that are unnecessarily weaker \nand may not be able to maintain their chemotherapy treatment regimens \nwithout having to turn to costly and time-consuming blood transfusions.\n  This restriction is inconsistent with both the FDA-approved label and \nprescribing instructions and is also contrary to national professional \nsociety oncology guidelines. For instance, the American Society of \nClinical Oncology, the national organization representing physicians \nwho treat patients with cancer, has written to CMS to express deep \nconcerns about the coverage determination, urging CMS to reconsider \nthese restrictions.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this sense of the Senate that I \nintroduce with Senators Harkin and Lautenberg to have CMS reconsider \nthe final national coverage determination on the use of erythropoiesis-\nsimulating agents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10944-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 43--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \n ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE, AND A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF \n                      THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. Reid submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

and\n       (V) if such error rate exceeds 3 percent for any fiscal \n     year in which the State participates in the demonstration \n     program, a reduction in the amount otherwise payable to the \n     State under section 1903(a) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     Secretary 1396b(a)) for quarters for that fiscal year, equal \n     to the total amount of erroneous excess payments determined \n     for the fiscal year only with respect to the children \n     included in the sample for the fiscal year that are in excess \n     of a 3 percent error rate with respect to such children.\n\n       (ii) No punitive action based on error rate.--The Secretary \n     shall not apply the error rate derived from the sample under \n     clause (i) to the entire population of children enrolled in \n     the State Medicaid plan or the State CHIP plan through \n     reliance on a finding made by an Express Lane agency, or to \n     the population of children enrolled in such plans on the \n     basis of the State's regular procedures for determining \n     eligibility, or penalize the State on the basis of such error \n     rate in any manner other than the reduction of payments \n     provided for under clause (i)(V).\n       (iii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed as relieving a State that participates in the \n     demonstration program established under this section from \n     being subject to a penalty under section 1903(u) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(u)) for payments made \n     under the State Medicaid plan with respect to ineligible \n     individuals and families that are determined to exceed the \n     error rate permitted under that section (as determined \n     without regard to the error rate determined under clause \n     (i)(II)).\n       (2) State options for application.--A State selected to \n     participate in the demonstration program may elect to apply \n     any of the following:\n       (A) Satisfaction of chip screen and enroll requirements.--\n     If the State relies on a finding of an Express Lane agency \n     for purposes of determining eligibility under the State CHIP \n     plan, the State may meet the screen and enroll requirements \n     imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 2102(b)(3) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397bb(b)(3)) by using \n     any of the following:\n       (i) Establishing a threshold percentage of the poverty line \n     that is 30 percentage points (or such other higher number of \n     percentage points) as the State determines reflects the \n     income methodologies of the program administered by the \n     Express Lane Agency and the State Medicaid plan.\n       (ii) Providing that a child satisfies all income \n     requirements for eligibility under the State Medicaid plan.\n       (iii) Providing that a child has a family income that \n     exceeds the Medicaid applicable income level.\n       (B) Presumptive eligibility.--The State may provide for \n     presumptive eligibility under the State CHIP plan for a child \n     who, based on an eligibility determination of an income \n     finding from an Express Lane agency, would qualify for child \n     health assistance under the State CHIP plan.

Mr. President, this month marks the 2-year anniversary of \nHurricane Katrina, and still thousands of small business owners in New \nOrleans and across the gulf coast are still struggling to keep their \ndoors open, keep their employees working, and get the economy back on \nits feet.\n  Since the days immediately following the storm, I have worked with \nSenators Snowe, Landrieu, and Vitter to produce a comprehensive package \nto reform the SBA's Disaster Assistance program. Nearly 2 years of \nbipartisan negotiations have produced a piece of legislation that has \nbroad bipartisan support as well as the support of the administration. \nToday that legislation will pass the Senate, and is one step closer to \nauthorizing the tools needed by the SBA to respond to large scale \ndisasters.\n  This bill includes directives for the SBA to create a private \ndisaster loan program, to allow for lenders to issue guaranteed \ndisaster loans in the aftermath of a catastrophic disaster. To ensure \nthat these loans are borrower-friendly, we provide authorization for \nappropriations so that the agency can subsidize the interest rates. In \naddition, the administrator is authorized to enter into agreements with \nprivate contractors in order to expedite loan application processing \nfor direct disaster loans.\n  The bill also includes language directing SBA to create an expedited \ndisaster assistance loan program to provide businesses with short-term \nloans so that they may keep their doors open until they receive \nalternative forms of assistance. The days immediately following a \ndisaster are crucial for business owners--statistics show that once \nthey close their doors, they likely will not open them again. These \nshort-term will be available following a disaster of catastrophic \nproportions so that processing delays such as the ones experienced \nafter the 2005 gulf coast storms will not result in widespread business \nfailure.\n  A presidential declaration of catastrophic national disaster will \nallow the Administrator to offer economic injury disaster loans to \nadversely affected business owners beyond the geographic reach of the \ndisaster area. In the event of a large-scale disaster, businesses \nlocated far from the physical reach of the disaster can be affected by \nthe magnitude of a localized destruction. We saw this when the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 affected businesses from coast \nto coast, and we saw it again with the 2005 gulf coast hurricanes. \nShould another catastrophic disaster strike, the President should have \nthe authority to provide businesses across the country with access to \nthe same low-interest economic injury loans available to businesses \nwithin the declared disaster area.\n  Nonprofit entities working to provide services to victims should be \nrewarded and given access to the capital they require to continue their \nservices. To this end, the administrator is authorized to make disaster \nloans to non-profit entities, including religious organizations.\n  Construction and rebuilding contracts being awarded are likely to be \nlarger than the current $2 million threshold currently applied to the \nSBA Surety Bond Program, which helps small construction firms gain \naccess to contracts. This bill increases the guarantee against loss for \nsmall business contracts up to $5 million and allows the administrator \nto increase that level to $10 million, if required.\n  The bill also provides for small business development centers to \noffer business counseling in disaster areas and to travel beyond \ntraditional geographic boundaries to provide services during declared \ndisasters. To encourage small business development centers located in \ndisaster areas to keep their doors open, the maximum grant amount of \n$100,000 is waived.\n  So that Congress may remain better aware of the status of the \nadministration's Disaster Loan Program, this bill directs the \nadministration to report to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship of the Senate and to the Committee on Small Business \nof the House of Representatives regularly on the fiscal status of the \ndisaster loan program as well as the need for supplemental funding. The \nadministration is also directed to report on the number of Federal \ncontracts awarded to small businesses, minority-owned small businesses, \nwomen-owned businesses, and local businesses during a disaster \ndeclaration.\n  Though it took many, many months to pass this much-needed \nlegislation, I am confident that our extensive negotiations have \nproduced a piece of legislation that, when enacted, will provide the \ntools that the administrator requires to swiftly and effectively \nrespond to future disasters, both large and small. I thank Ranking \nMember Snowe as well as Senators Landrieu, and Vitter for their \nextraordinary efforts over the past 2 years. I also thank Senators Bond \nand Coburn for their ability to see the need for this important \nlegislation and to work through disagreements in order to get this bill \npassed. I look forward to working with the House of Representatives to \naddress any differences that remain between the House and Senate \nversions of the bill so that we can put in place a more comprehensive \ndisaster response program at the SBA as quickly as possible.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we all know, there was a tremendous \namount of criticism of the Federal Government's response to Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita of 2005. Things are better now, and the region is \nslowly recovering. But as I stand here tonight, we are exactly 63 days \ninto the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Two years ago, the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration's, SBA, response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nwas too slow and lacking in urgency, threatening the very survival of \nimpacted businesses and homeowners. This failure occurred because SBA \nlacked the necessary tools and resources to respond swiftly and \neffectively to a large-scale disaster. Thanks in part to the efforts of \nAdministrator Steven Preston, much has been done to improve the SBA \ndisaster assistance program in the past\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\nyear. However, many in Congress remain concerned that despite these \nefforts, the agency lacks the additional legislative authority and \nresources required to respond to a large-scale disaster. This is \nbecause we must be sure that if we have another disaster, the Federal \nGovernment's response will be better this time around. Disaster \nresponse agencies have to be better organized, more efficient, and more \nresponsive in order to avoid the problems, the delays, mismanagement, \nand the seeming incompetence that occurred in 2005.\n  I am proud that legislation, of which I am an original cosponsor, is \npassing the Senate tonight. This is because I strongly believe that we \ncannot afford to adjourn for August, the heart of hurricane season, \nwithout moving this important legislation forward--legislation which \nwould immediately provide SBA with the resources it needs to \neffectively respond to natural or manmade disasters. In particular, \nthis legislation improves the disaster response of one agency that had \na great deal of problems last year, the SBA. This bill, S. 163, the \nSmall Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act, makes major \nimprovements to the SBA's disaster response and provides them with \nessential tools to ensure that they are more efficient and better \nprepared for future disasters--big and small.\n  I should also note that this bill is a result of intensive bipartisan \nwork over 2 years and was introduced shortly before the 109th Congress \nadjourned as S. 4097 by Senator Snowe. Unfortunately, there was no \naction on that bill, so it was reintroduced in January 2007, at the \nstart of the 110th Congress, by Senator Kerry as S. 163. On May 7, \n2007, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship unanimously \nreported out S. 163 and sent it to the full Senate for consideration. \nThis bipartisan legislation features comprehensive SBA reforms as \noutlined in the attached summary. S. 163 also has the full support of \nthe SBA, who assisted the committee in drafting many of the provisions \nas well as the support of our Louisiana business community. As \nmentioned above, although this bill was reported out of committee 86 \ndays ago, S. 163 was blocked from passage, most recently on July 17 due \nto a Republican objection. The committee worked closely with the \nRepublican Senator to address his specific concerns, but unfortunately \nafter this hold was lifted last night, it appeared as if there would be \nan additional hold from the Republican side. Given the urgent nature of \nthis legislation, in addition to the fact that the House of \nRepresentatives passed companion legislation on April 18, 2007, my \ncolleagues and I were pleased that we could work out these remaining \nissues and pass this bill tonight because stalling this legislation \nwould send the wrong signal to America's small businesses.\n  As mentioned previously, this bill is reflective of my priorities as \nwell as those from Senators Kerry and Snowe, respectively chair and \nranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee. For my part, I \nhave heard loudly and clearly from our impacted businesses that SBA \nreforms should be implemented as soon as possible. In fact, as of \nAugust 29, 2007, these reforms will be 2 years overdue. That is why I \nhave worked tirelessly alongside my colleagues on the Small Business \nCommittee to secure passage of this legislation. Like my colleagues, I \nhave led when appropriate, pushed back when pushed, and negotiated when \nneeded so that S. 163 could pass the Senate before we adjourn for \nAugust recess.\n  This legislation offers new tools to enhance SBA's disaster \nassistance programs. In every disaster, the SBA disaster loan program \nis a lifeline for businesses and homeowners who want to rebuild their \nlives after a catastrophe. When Katrina hit, our businesses and \nhomeowners had to wait months for loan approvals. I do not know how \nmany businesses we lost because help did not come in time. Because of \nthe scale of this disaster, what these businesses needed was immediate, \nshort-term assistance to hold them over until SBA was ready to process \nthe tens of thousands of loan applications it received.\n  That is why this legislation provides the SBA Administrator with the \nability to set up an expedited disaster assistance business loan \nprogram to make short-term, low-interest loans to keep them afloat. \nThese loans will allow businesses to make payroll, begin making \nrepairs, and address other immediate needs while they are awaiting \ninsurance payouts or regular SBA disaster loans. However, I realize \nthat every disaster is different and could range from a disaster on the \nscale of Hurricane Katrina or 9/11, to an ice storm or drought. This \nlegislation gives the SBA additional options and flexibility in the \nkinds of relief they can offer a community. When a tornado destroys 20 \nbusinesses in a small town in the Midwest, SBA can get the regular \ndisaster program up and running fairly quickly. You may not need short-\nterm loans in this instance. But if you know that SBA's resources would \nbe overwhelmed by a storm--just as they were initially with Katrina--\nthese expedited business loans would be very helpful.\n  This legislation also would direct SBA to study ways to expedite \ndisaster loans for those businesses in a disaster area that have a \ngood, solid track record with the SBA or can provide vital recovery \nefforts. We had many businesses in the gulf coast that had paid off \nprevious SBA loans, were major sources of employment in their \ncommunities, but had to wait months for decisions on their SBA disaster \nloan applications. I do not want to get rid of the SBA's current \npractice of reviewing applications on a first-come first-served basis, \nbut there should be some mechanism in place for major disasters to get \nexpedited loans out the door to specific businesses that have a \npositive record with SBA or those who could serve a vital role in the \nrecovery efforts. Expedited loans would jump-start impacted economies, \nget vital capital out to businesses, and retain essential jobs \nfollowing future disasters.\n  This bill also makes an important modification to the collateral \nrequirements for disaster loans. The SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved loan without showing collateral. This is to \nlimit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. However, \nthis disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and these \ndays, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running. That is \nwhy this bill increases this collateral requirement to $14,000 and \ngives the administrator the ability to increase that amount, in the \nevent of another large-scale disaster. I believe this is a reasonable \nand fiscally responsible increase, and at the same time gives the \nadministrator flexibility for future disasters which will inevitably \noccur.\n  As you may know, I pushed to get language in the last hurricane \nsupplemental appropriations bill in June 2006 to require SBA to develop \na disaster plan and report to Congress on its contents by July 15, \n2006. SBA provided this status report in July, and I am pleased that, \ndue to my request, the agency provided the completed disaster response \nplan to our committee on June 1, 2007. That said, it is one thing to \ndraft up a plan but it is not worth the time and effort if there is no \none to monitor its implementation and update it when needed. For this \nreason, I included a provision in this bill to require the \nadministrator to designate one agency employee, who would report \ndirectly to him/her, to be responsible for this plan. This disaster \nplanning designee would be responsible for the plan, and more \nimportantly, would be accountable to Congress if it fails. Following \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, not only is execution important but also \njust as important is clear accountability if these best laid plans \nfail.\n  The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act will \nprovide essential tools to make the SBA more proactive, flexible, and \nmost important, more efficient during future disasters. Again, I look \nforward to working with both Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry in the \ncoming weeks to begin discussions with our House colleagues to resolve \ndifferences on both the Senate-passed bill and the House-passed bill. \nThe goal of both these bills is to ensure that the SBA has everything \nit needs to better respond following future disasters, so I am hopeful \nthat we can work out a reasonable agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a June 29, 2007, letter of \nsupport from Administrator Preston, along with a July 31, 2007, letter \nfrom Greater New Orleans, Inc. be printed in the\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Small Business Administration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2007.\n     Hon.

We would also recommend clarifying that the \n     Administrator would have flexibility under Section 205 to \n     designate portions of a declared catastrophic national \n     disaster area as a HUBZone area, without extending this \n     designation to an entire disaster area.\n       We look forward to working with you when the bill goes into \n     conference discussions with the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. If you have any questions or comments, \n     please contact me directly.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Steven C. Preston,\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Greater New Orleans, Inc.,\n\n                                   New Orleans, LA, July 31, 2007.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kerry and Ranking Member Snowe: Greater New \n     Orleans, Inc., the 10-parish economic development \n     organization for the New Orleans, Louisiana region, would \n     like to express strong support of S. 163, The Small Business \n     Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007 reported \n     unanimously by the Senate Small Business Committee in May of \n     this year, after months of thorough committee deliberations.\n       In our assessment, S. 163 sponsored by Senator Kerry and \n     co-sponsored by five other Senators represents significant \n     legislation to improve SBA's response to future storm events, \n     as part of overall Congressional efforts to improve the \n     federal government's role, learning from the catastrophic \n     hurricanes of 2004 and 2005.\n       More specifically, the legislation would provide a new \n     level of SBA response for catastrophic disasters, expedited \n     assistance to small businesses, adjustment of the loan \n     guarantee levels and loan caps, a better coordination process \n     with FEMA, increased response resources, improved access and \n     overall accountability of SBA services. These policy changes \n     will go a long way to helping local communities get back on \n     their feet in future federally declared disasters.\n       Two years after the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, our \n     region is still struggling to restore our population, housing \n     stock, healthcare services, infrastructure, and basic \n     economy. 18,000 small businesses in our area were directly \n     impacted by the hurricane, experiencing significant physical \n     and economic damages. As these businesses fight to restore \n     operations, hire adequate staff, find affordable insurance, \n     and meet payroll, it seems appropriate to have their trials \n     and tribulations be cause for new federal policies.\n       By many accounts and measures the SBA capacity, resources, \n     process and policies following Hurricane Katrina were \n     inadequate to meet the needs of the devastated business \n     community. However, rather than complain about the past, it \n     would be more productive to make every effort to improve the \n     SBA disaster program and protocols, changes requiring \n     aggressive congressional action. It appears that S. 163 is a \n     significant step in that direction.\n       We applaud your leadership of this issue, and that of our \n     Louisiana Senators Landrieu and Vitter, in forwarding this \n     important legislation to step up federal efforts and capacity \n     in future storms to protect our nation's assets and citizens \n     who may be impacted in the coming months and years. As we \n     approach the peak of the 2007 hurricane season, we urge the \n     full Senate to expedite this legislation in order to pass \n     these vital SBA reforms.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark C. Drennen,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  The bill (S. 163), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/08/03/senate-section/article/S10983-1", "month": "08", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10983-S10986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 127, S. 849.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 849) to promote accessibility, accountability, \n     and openness in Government by strengthening section 552 of \n     title V, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n     Freedom of Information Act), and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the \nLeahy-Cornyn Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government \nAct'' (the ``OPEN Government Act''), S. 849, before adjourning for the \nAugust recess. This important Freedom of Information Act legislation \nwill strengthen and reinvigorate FOIA for all Americans.\n  For more than four decades, FOIA has translated the great American \nvalues of openness and accountability into practice by guaranteeing \naccess to government information. The OPEN Government Act will help \nensure that these important values remain a cornerstone of our American \ndemocracy.\n  I commend the bill's chief Republican cosponsor, Senator John Cornyn, \nfor his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation \nthis year. Since he joined the Senate 5 years ago, Senator Cornyn and I \nhave worked closely together on the Judiciary Committee to ensure that \nFOIA and other open government laws are preserved for future \ngenerations. The passage of the OPEN Government Act is a fitting \ntribute to our bipartisan partnership and to openness, transparency and \naccountability in our government.\n  I also thank the many cosponsors of this legislation for their \ndedication to open government and I thank the Majority Leader for his \nstrong support of this legislation. I am also appreciative of the \nefforts of Senator Kyl and Senator Bennett in helping us to reach a \ncompromise on this legislation, so that the Senate could consider and \npass meaningful FOIA reform this legislation before the August recess.\n  But, most importantly, I especially want to thank the many concerned \ncitizens who, knowing the importance of this measure to the American \npeople's right to know, have demanded action on this bill. This bill is \nendorsed by more than 115 business, public interest, and news \norganizations from across the political and ideological spectrum, \nincluding the American Library Association, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, the Republican Liberty \nCaucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and the Vermont Press \nAssociation. The invaluable support of these and many other \norganizations is what led the opponents of this bill to come around and \nsupport this legislation.\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\n  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN \nGovernment Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive \ndelays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore \nthe public's trust in their government. This bill will also improve \ntransparency in the Federal Government's FOIA process by:\n  Restoring meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA;\n  Imposing real consequences on federal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-\nday statutory deadline;\n  Clarifying that FOIA applies to government records held by outside \nprivate contractors;\n  Establishing a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies; and\n  Creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and federal \nagencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation.\n  Specifically, the OPEN Government Act will protect the public's right \nto know, by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to inform the \npublic, including freelance journalist and bloggers, may seek a fee \nwaiver when they request information under FOIA. The bill ensures that \nfederal agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs and \nother Web-based forms of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA \nfees. In addition, the bill also clarifies that the definition of news \nmedia, for purposes of FOIA fee waivers, includes free newspapers and \nindividuals performing a media function who do not necessarily have a \nprior history of publication.\n  The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action, by \nensuring that the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a \nrequest is received by the appropriate component of the agency and \nrequiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate \nagency component within 10 days of the receipt of such requests. The \nbill allows federal agencies to toll the 20-day clock while they are \nawaiting a response to a reasonable request for information from a FOIA \nrequester on one occasion, or while the agency is awaiting \nclarification regarding a FOIA fee assessment. In addition, to \nencourage agencies to meet the 20-day time limit, the bill prohibits an \nagency from collecting search fees if it fails to meet the 20-day \ndeadline, except in the case of exceptional circumstances as defined by \nthe FOIA statute.\n  The bill also addresses a relatively new concern that, under current \nlaw, federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with FOIA \nrequests until just before a court decision that is favorable to a FOIA \nrequestor. The Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon Board and Care \nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health and Human Resources, 532 \nU.S. 598 (2001), eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' for attorneys' fees \nrecovery under certain federal civil rights laws. When applied to FOIA \ncases, Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters from ever being eligible to \nrecover attorneys fees under circumstances where an agency provides the \nrecords requested in the litigation just prior to a court decision that \nwould have been favorable to the FOIA requestor. The bill clarifies \nthat Buckhannon does not apply to FOIA cases. Under the bill, a FOIA \nrequester can obtain attorneys' fees when he or she files a lawsuit to \nobtain records from the government and the government releases those \nrecords before the court orders them to do so. But, this provision \nwould not allow the requester to recover attorneys' fees if the \nrequester's claim is wholly insubstantial.\n\n  To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation, the \nbill also creates an Office of Government Information Services in the \nNational Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency-level FOIA \ndisputes. In addition the bill ensures that each federal agency will \nappoint a Chief FOIA Officer, who will monitor the agency's compliance \nwith FOIA requests, and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to \nFOIA to resolve FOIA related disputes.\n  Finally, the bill does several things to enhance the agency reporting \nand tracking requirements under FOIA. Tracking numbers are not required \nfor FOIA requests that are anticipated to take ten days or less to \nprocess. The bill creates a tracking system for FOIA requests to assist \nmembers of the public and the media. The bill also establishes a FOIA \nhotline service for all federal agencies, either by telephone or on the \nInternet, to enable requestors to track the status of their FOIA \nrequests.\n  In addition, the bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency \nrecords that are held by outside private contractors, no matter where \nthese records are located. And to create more transparency about the \nuse of statutory exemptions under FOIA, the bill ensures that FOIA \nstatutory exemptions that are included in legislation enacted after the \npassage of this bill clearly cite the FOIA statute and clearly state \nthe intent to be exempt from FOIA.\n  The Freedom of Information Act is critical to ensuring that all \nAmerican citizens can access information about the workings of their \ngovernment. But, after four decades this open government law needs to \nbe strengthened. I am pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN \nGovernment Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated so that it works \nmore effectively for the American people.\n  I am also pleased that, by passing this important reform legislation \ntoday, the Senate has reaffirmed the principle that open government is \nnot a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. But, rather, it is an \nAmerican issue and an American value. I commend all of my Senate \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, for unanimously passing this \nhistoric FOIA reform measure. I hope that the House of Representatives, \nwhich overwhelmingly passed a similar measure earlier this year, will \npromptly take up and pass this bill and that the President will then \npromptly sign it into law.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on S. 849, the OPEN \nGovernment Act. As a result of negotiations between Senators Cornyn, \nLeahy, and me, we have reached an agreement on an amendment to this \nbill that addresses my concerns about the legislation while keeping \ntrue to the bill's intended purposes. When this bill was marked up in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee several months ago, I filed a number of \namendments intended to address problems with the bill. Senator Leahy \nasked me at the mark up to withhold offering my amendments in favor of \naddressing my concerns through negotiations with him and with Senator \nCornyn. I agreed to do so, and later submitted a statement of \nadditional views to the committee report for this bill that described \nthe nature of some of my concerns, and that included as an attachment \nthe Justice Department's lengthy Views Letter on this bill. After \nfollow-up meetings with the Justice Department and Office of Management \nand Budget to elucidate the nature of some of those agencies' concerns \nand to try to come up with compromise language, negotiations among \nmembers of the Senate began. I am pleased to report that those \nnegotiations have proved fruitful. Our negotiations have benefited from \nextensive assistance from the Justice Department and other parts of the \nexecutive branch, as well as from the input of various journalists' \norganizations. While none of these parties has gotten exactly what it \nwants, I do believe that we now have a bill that strikes the right \nbalance with regard to FOIA--a bill that will make FOIA work more \nsmoothly and efficiently.\n  Allow me to describe some of the changes that my amendment will make \nto the underlying bill. Section three of the original bill broadened \nthe definition of media requesters to include anyone who ``intends'' to \nbroadly disseminate information. My concern, which was also expressed \nby the Justice Department, was that in the age of the internet, anyone \ncan plausibly state that he ``intends'' to broadly disseminate the \ninformation that he obtains through FOIA. The media-requester category \nis important because requesters who receive this status are exempt from \nsearch fees. Search fees are one of the principal tools that agencies \nuse to encourage requesters to clarify and sharpen their requests. When \nsomeone makes a broad and vague request, the agency will come back with \nan estimate of the cost of conducting such a search. Often, the \nindividual will then sharpen that request. This saves the agency time \nand the requester money. According to some FOIA administrators, \nlegitimate media requesters rarely make vague\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\nrequests. These requesters usually know what they want and they want to \nget it quickly. But if virtually any requester could be exempted from \nsearch fees by claiming that he intends to widely disseminate the \ninformation, search fees would no longer serve as a tool for \nencouraging requesters to focus their requests. Overall, this would \nwaste FOIA resources and slow down processing of all requests. Such a \nresult would not be in anyone's interest.\n  The compromise language included in my amendment clarifies the \ndefinition of media requester in a way that protects internet \npublications and freelance journalists but that still preserves \ncommonsense limits on who can claim to be a journalist. At the \nsuggestion of some media representatives, we have incorporated into the \namendment the definition of media requester that was announced by the \nDC Circuit in National Security Archive v. U.S. Department of Defense. \n880 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1989). That definition focuses on public \ninterest in the collected information, the use of editorial skill to \nprocess that information into news, and the distribution of that news \nto an audience. It would appear in my view to protect publishers of \nnewsletters and other smaller news sources, as well as, obviously, the \ntypes of organizations described in that opinion. On the other hand, \ngiven that this construction of the term news media as used in FOIA has \nbeen in effect for 17 years, I do not think that anyone can reasonably \nfear that codifying it will turn the world upside down. I was amused to \nsee that Judge Ginsburg's analysis of the statute's definition of news \nmedia relied in part on conflicting legislative statements made by \nSenators Hatch and Leahy, two members with whom I currently serve on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding the meaning of the 1986 \namendments to FOIA. By incorporating a judicially crafted definition of \nnews media, I believe that my amendment spares the courts the indignity \nof being compelled to parse conflicting Senate floor statements in \norder to divine the meaning of that term.\n  The remainder of my amendment's changes to section 3 codify language \nthat has been adopted by some administrative agencies to clarify who is \na media requester. Other than stylistic edits, that agency language has \nbeen modified in my amendment only to make express that news-media \nentities include periodicals that are distributed for free to the \npublic. This will protect the fee status of the numerous free \nnewspapers that have become common in American cities in recent years. \nThe agency language codified here also extends express protection to \nfreelance journalists.\n  Overall, this language should guarantee news-media status for new \nelectronic formats and for anyone who would logically be considered a \njournalist, even when that journalist's method of news distribution \ntakes on new means and forms. But the language should also prevent \ngamesmanship by individuals who cannot logically be considered \njournalists but who are willing to assert that they are journalists in \norder to avoid paying search fees.\n  The modified bill also makes important changes to section 6 of the \nbill. The original version of this section eliminated certain important \nFOIA exemptions as a penalty for an agency's failure to comply with \nFOIA's 20-day response deadline. I commented at length on this \nprovision of the bill at the beginning of my additional views to the \ncommittee report for the bill. This provision was far and away the most \nproblematic provision of the original bill and I am relieved that \nSenators Leahy and Cornyn have agreed to abandon this approach to \ndeadline enforcement.\n  My amendment adopts a modified version of an approach to deadline \nenforcement that was suggested by Senators Cornyn and Leahy. Their \napproach denies search fees to agencies that do not meet FOIA \ndeadlines. I have modified my colleagues' proposal by including an \nexception allowing an agency to still collect search fees if a delay in \nprocessing the request was the result of unusual or exceptional \ncircumstances. These exceptions have been part of FOIA for many years \nnow and have a reasonably well-known meaning. I expect that these \nexceptions will account for virtually all of the cases where an agency \ncannot reasonably be expected to process a particular FOIA request \nwithin the paragraph (6) time limits.\n  Preserving this type of flexibility is important. A penalty that \nseriously punishes an agency, which I believe that denying search fees \nwould do, would likely backfire if the penalty did not account for \ncomplex or broad requests that cannot reasonably be processed within \nthe FOIA deadlines. If the penalties for not processing a request \nwithin the deadlines are harsh and include no exceptions, the agency \nwill process every request within 20 or 30 days. It will simply do a \nsloppy job. That would not improve the operation of the FOIA and would \nnot be in anyone's interest.\n  The original bill also made FOIA's 20-day clock run from the time \nwhen any part of a government agency or department received a FOIA \nrequest. Again, the modified bill exempts FOIA requesters from search \nfees if the 20-day deadline is not met and no unusual or exceptional \ncircumstances are present. These provisions in combination would have \ncreated a perverse incentive for a FOIA requester to ignore the \naddressing instructions on an agency's website and send his request to \nsome distant outpost of an agency or department, in the hope that doing \nso would prevent the agency from meeting the 20-day deadline and the \nrequester would be exempted from search fees. I would not expect more \nthan a very small portion of FOIA requesters to engage in such \ngamesmanship. But given the large number of individuals and \ninstitutions that make FOIA requests, it is inevitable that some bad \napples would abuse the rules if Congress were to create an incentive to \ndo so.\n  My amendment makes the FOIA deadline run only from the time when the \nappropriate component of an agency receives the request. To address \nconcerns that an agency might unreasonably delay in routing a request \nto the appropriate component, I have added language providing that the \ndeadline shall begin to run from no later than ten days after some \ndesignated FOIA component receives the request. I think that it is \nreasonable to expect that requesters send their requests to some \ndesignated FOIA-receiving component of an agency, and I think that it \nis reasonable to expect that once a FOIA component of the agency gets \nthe request, it will expeditiously route that request to the \nappropriate FOIA component.\n  My amendment also changes the bill's standard for awarding attorney's \nfees to FOIA requesters when litigation is ended short of a judgement \nor court-approved settlement. The original bill would have entitled a \nrequester to fees whenever an agency voluntarily or unilaterally \nchanged its position and handed over the requested information after \nlitigation had commenced. As I noted in my statement of additional \nviews to the committee report, I am concerned that such a standard \nwould discourage agencies from releasing documents in situations where \nthe agency is fully within its rights to withhold a record--for \nexample, because some clear exception applies--but senior personnel at \nthe agency decide to produce the documents anyway. To impose fees in \nsuch a situation would be to adopt a rule of no good deed goes \nunpunished. It would also likely discourage some disclosures. If an \nexemption clearly applied to the records in question, the only way that \nthe agency could avoid being assessed fees would be to continue \nlitigating. Also, in my view attorney's fee shifting should only reward \nlitigation that was meritorious. A baseless lawsuit should not be \nrewarded with attorney's fees. There is enough bad lawyering around \nalready. The government should not be paying litigants for bringing \nclaims that lack legal merit.\n\n  On the other hand, Senator Cornyn has presented compelling arguments \nthat since the time when the Buckhannon standard was extended to FOIA, \nsome agencies have begun denying clearly meritorious requests and then \nunilaterally settling the case on the eve of trial to avoid paying \nattorney's fees. Obviously, such behavior should not be encouraged. Or \nat the very least, the requester should be compensated for the legal \nexpense of forcing agency compliance with a meritorious request. \nSenator Cornyn has\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\nmade a strong case that the current standard denies the public access \nto important information about the operations of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In the spirit of compromise, and out of deference to Senator Cornyn's \narguments and persistence, I have agreed to incorporate language into \nmy amendment that does not fully address my concerns about this part of \nthe bill and that is very generous to FOIA requesters. The language of \nthe amendment entitles a requester to fees unless the court finds that \nthe requester's claims were not substantial. This is a pretty low \nstandard. It would allow the requester to be deemed a prevailing party \nfor fee-assessment purposes even if the government's litigating \nposition was entirely reasonable--or even if the government's arguments \nwere meritorious and the government would have won had the case been \nlitigated to a judgment.\n  Substantiality is a test that is employed in the Federal courts to \ndetermine whether a federal claim is adequate to justify retaining \njurisdiction over supplemental or other State law claims. It is \ngenerally understood to require only that the plaintiff's complaint not \nbe clearly nonmeritorious on its face and not be clearly precluded by \ncontrolling precedent. The classic and most-quoted statement of the \nsubstantiality standard appears to be that in the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103, 105 \n(1933), in which Justice Sutherland explained that a claim may be \n``plainly unsubstantial either because obviously without merit, or \nbecause its unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions \nof this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the \ninference that the questions sought to be raised can be the subject of \ncontroversy.'' The same principle is expressed through different words \nin Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974), \nas whether the claim is ``so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by \nprior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit \nas not to involve a Federal controversy,'' and in Kaz Manufacturing v. \nChesebrough-Pond's, Inc., 211 F.Supp. 815, 822 (S.D.N.Y. 1962), as \nwhether ``it cannot be said that the claim is obviously without merit \nor that its invalidity clearly results from the previous decisions of \nthis court or, where the claim is pretty clearly unfounded.''\n  One aspect of this test that makes it well-suited to evaluating \nattorney's fee requests is that the ``insubstantiality'' of a claim is \na quality ``which is apparent at the outset.'' Rosado v. Wyman, 397 \nU.S. 397, 404 (1970). It is a standard that courts should be able to \napply without further factual inquiry into the nature of a complaint. \nIt thus addresses one of the Supreme Court's major concerns in the \nBuckhannon case, that ``a request for attorney's fees should not result \nin a second major litigation.''\n  Part of the very definition of the substantiality test is that courts \ncan evaluate the complaint on its pleadings or without resolving \nfactual disputes. A claim is substantial so long as ``it cannot be said \nthat [it] is obviously without merit, or clearly foreclosed by prior \nSupreme Court decisions, or a matter that should be dismissed on the \npleadings alone without the presentation of some evidence.'' Rumbaugh \nv. Winifrede Railroad Company, 331 F.2d 530, 539-40 (4th Cir. 1964). \n``The substantiality of the Federal claim is ordinarily determined on \nthe basis of the pleadings''--on whether ``it appears that the Federal \nclaim is subject to dismissal under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or could be \ndisposed of on a motion for summary judgment under F.R.Civ.P. 56.'' \nTully v. Mott Supermarkets, Inc., 540 F.2d 187, 196 (3d Cir. 1976). \nOther cases articulating these principles are Kavit v. A.L. Stam & Co., \n491 F.2d 1176, 1179-80 (2d Cir. 1974) (Friendly, J.); Scholz Homes, \nInc. v. Maddox, 379 F.2d 84, 87 (6th Cir. 1967); Smith v. Metropolitan \nDevelopment Housing Agency, 857 F.Supp. 597, 601 (M.D. Tenn. 1994); In \nthe Matter of Union National Bank & Trust Company of Souderton, \nPennsylvania, 298 F.Supp. 422, 424 (E.D. Pa. 1969).\n  I hope that these comments on my understanding of the law in this \narea are of assistance to courts and litigants who will now be forced \nto adapt to the application of the substantiality test to FOIA fee \nshifting. Obviously this transition would be easier had we adopted a \ntest more familiar to this area of the law, but the exigencies of \nlegislative compromise have precluded such an outcome. For some recent \nand very thorough examples of how a substantiality analysis is actually \nconducted, courts and litigants should also look to Judge Williams's \npanel opinion in Decatur Liquors, Inc. v. District of Columbia, 478 \nF.3d 360, 363-63 (D.C. Cir. 2007), and to the Sixth Circuit's opinion \nin Wal-Juice Bar, Inc. v. Elliott, 899 F.2d 1502, 1505-07 (6th Cir. \n1990).\n  Again, I would have preferred that the Senate select some standard \nthat protects from fee assessments an agency that releases information \nwhen the law clearly applied an exemption to the requested information. \nAgencies will still be protected by the discretionary factors \nconsidered in the fee-shifting system, but the lacks-a-reasonable-\nlegal-basis factor is not always controlling and does not create a \nguaranteed safe harbor. I fear that the standard that we adopt today \nwill lead some agency employees to withhold information that they would \notherwise be inclined to release out of concern that unilaterally \nreleasing the information would make the agencies subject to fee \nassessments.\n  I would also note that the substantiality test would have been \nunacceptable were this a fee-shifting statute that assessed fees \nagainst private parties. If a private party adopts a meritorious \nposition in litigation but then unilaterally settles, the Federal \nGovernment could not rightfully force that party to pay attorney's \nfees. The occasional unfairness of this provision--the fact that it \nwill sometimes require the payment of fees to a party whose litigation \nposition lacked merit--is tolerable only because the only party that \nwill be forced to pay fees under this provision even when that party \nwas in the right is the government.\n  I would also like to emphasize for the legislative record that I had \noriginally proposed formulating this standard as ``provided that the \ncomplainant's claim is substantial''--and I would have been equally \ncontent with language along the lines of ``unless the complainant's \nclaim is insubstantial.'' The double negative in the amendment was not \nmy proposal and I accept no responsibility for that grammatical \ninfraction. It is only because others have insisted on that formulation \nand I can perceive no substantive difference between ``not \ninsubstantial'' and ``substantial'' that the double negative appears in \nmy amendment.\n  My amendment also makes one other important change to section 4 of \nthe bill. The original bill allowed a requester to be deemed a \nprevailing party if the requester obtained relief through ``an \nadministrative action.'' Agency administrative appeals of FOIA \ndecisions do not require lawyers, and FOIA requesters should not be \ncompensated for or encouraged to bring lawyers into these proceedings. \nAn agency appeal simply means that the plaintiff asks the agency to \nreconsider its denial of a request. Every agency has an appeal \nprocedure in which it assigns the case to another agency employee \ntrained in FOIA who then reevaluates the request. These appeals are \nmost often successful when the plaintiff provides more information \nabout his request. Legal arguments are not appropriate to these \nappeals. There is no reason to bring attorneys-fee shifting into this \nstage of FOIA. Thus my amendment eliminates the fee-shifting section's \nreference to relief obtained through an administrative action.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, since coming to the U.S. Senate in 2002, I \nhave made it my mission to bring a little ``Texas sunshine'' to \nWashington.\n  The State of Texas has one of the strongest laws expanding the right \nof every citizen to access records documenting what the government is \nup to. As attorney general of Texas, I was responsible for enforcing \nTexas's open government laws. I have always been proud that Texas is \nknown for having one of the strongest and most robust freedom of \ninformation laws in the country.\n  Unfortunately, the Sun doesn't shine as brightly in Washington. The \nFederal Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, which was signed into law \n41 years ago, was designed to guarantee public access to records that \nexplain what the Government is doing.\n  Some Federal agencies are taking years to even start working on \nrequests. Far too often when citizens\n\n[[Page S10990]]\n\nseek records from our Government, they are met with long delays, \ndenials and difficulties. Federal agencies can routinely and repeatedly \ndeny requests for information with near impunity. Making the situation \nworse, requestors have few alternatives to lawsuits for appealing an \nagency's decision.\n  And when requestors do sue agencies, the deck is stacked in the \nGovernment's favor.\n  Courts have ruled that requestors cannot recover legal fees from \nagencies who improperly withhold information until a judge rules for \nthe requestor. That means an agency can withhold documents without any \nconsequences until the day before a judge's ruling. Then the agency can \nsuddenly send a box full of documents, render the lawsuit moot and \nleave the requestor with a hefty legal bill. And the agency gets away \nscot-free.\n  In the meantime, the delay can keep mismanagement and wasteful \npractices hidden and unfixed. Documents obtained through FOIA helped \nreporters for Knight Ridder--now part of McClatchy Company--show the \npublic that veterans who fought bravely for our country have trouble \nobtaining the medical benefits they deserve upon returning home. \nThousands died waiting for their benefits, many more received wrong \ninformation. Legal fees alone topped $100,000 along with the time and \neffort. Few citizens have such time and budgets.\n  To address problems of long delays and strengthen the ability of \nevery citizen to know what its government is up to, Senator Patrick \nLeahy and I introduced bipartisan legislation to reform FOIA.\n  There are, unfortunately, many issues in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that have become partisan and divisive. So it is especially \ngratifying to be able to have worked so closely with Chairman Leahy on \nan issue as important and as fundamental to our Nation as openness in \ngovernment.\n  Today we are making history by passing the Openness Promotes \nEffectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007, also known as the \nOPEN Government Act.\n  I am grateful to Senator Leahy and to his staff for all their hard \nwork on these issues of mutual interest and national interest. A \nspecial thanks to Lydia Griggsby, Senator Leahy's counsel, for her \ndiligence and hard work. And I would like to thank and to commend \nSenator Leahy for his decades-long commitment to freedom of \ninformation.\n  I also want to especially thank Senators Kyl and Bennett and their \nrespective staff members, Joe Matal and Shawn Gunnarson for their good \nfaith efforts to resolve differences and move this bill out of the \nSenate. We couldn't have done it without their cooperation and fair-\nmindedness.\n  Open-government reforms should be embraced by conservatives, \nliberals, and anyone who believes in the freedom and the dignity of the \nindividual.\n  Passage of this important legislation is a victory for the American \npeople. From my vantage point here in Washington, DC, it is about \nholding accountable the politicians who continue to grow the size and \nscope of the Federal Government. And it is about holding accountable \nthe bureaucrats who populate the Federal Government's ever-expanding \nreach over individual liberty.\n  This legislation contains important congressional findings to \nreiterate and reinforce our belief that FOIA establishes a presumption \nof openness, and that our government is based not on the need to know, \nbut upon the fundamental right to know. In addition, the act contains \nover a dozen substantive provisions, designed to achieve four important \nobjectives: (1) to strengthen FOIA and close loopholes, (2) to help \nFOIA requestors obtain timely responses to their requests, (3) to \nensure that agencies have strong incentives to act on FOIA requests in \na timely fashion, and (4) to provide FOIA officials with all of the \ntools they need to ensure that our government remains open and \naccessible.\n  The OPEN Government Act is not just pro-openness, pro-accountability, \nand pro-accessibility--it is also pro-Internet. It requires government \nagencies to establish a hotline to enable citizens to track their FOIA \nrequests, including Internet tracking, and it grants the same \nprivileged FOIA fee status currently enjoyed by traditional media \noutlets to bloggers and others who publish reports on the Internet.\n  The act has the support of business groups, such as the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers, media groups and \nmore than 100 advocacy organizations from across the political \nspectrum. Without their help, this legislation would have been \nimpossible.\n  We owe it to all Americans to help them know what their government is \nup to and to make our great democracy even stronger and more \naccountable to its citizens\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish the record to reflect how much I \nappreciate the work of Senator Leahy on this very important matter. The \nFreedom of Information Act is something that has needed amending for \nsome time, and I am happy we are able to do it tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be considered \nand agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements be \nprinted in the Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2655) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       The bill is amended as follows:\n       (a) News-Media Status.--At page 4, strike lines 4 though 15 \n     and insert:\n       ``The term ``a representative of the news media'' means any \n     person or entity that gathers information of potential \n     interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial \n     skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and \n     distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means \n     information that is about current events or that would be of \n     current interest to the public. Examples of news-media \n     entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the \n     public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if \n     such entities qualify as disseminators of ``news'') who make \n     their products available for purchase by or subscription by \n     or free distribution to the general public. These examples \n     are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery \n     evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic \n     dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications \n     services), such alternative media shall be considered to be \n     news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded \n     as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can \n     demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through \n     that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually \n     employed by the entity. A publication contract would present \n     a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may \n     also consider the past publication record of the requester in \n     making such a determination.''.\n       (b) Attorneys' Fees.--At page 5, strike lines 1 through 7 \n     and insert:\n       ``(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement \n     or consent decree; or\n       (II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the \n     agency, provided that the complainant's claim is not \n     insubstantial.''.\n       (c) Commencement of 20-Day Period and Tolling.--At page 6, \n     lines 1 through 7 and insert:\n       ``(1) In General.--Section 552(a)(6)(A)(i) of title 5, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``determination;'' \n     and inserting:\n\n     ``determination.
