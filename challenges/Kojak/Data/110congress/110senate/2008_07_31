Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about \nthe continued crisis in Somalia and my dismay at the failure of the \nUnited States and also the international community to give this \nsituation the attention and resources it deserves.\n  Time and again, I have called for a comprehensive, coordinated U.S. \nstrategy to bring security and stability to Somalia. Yet despite \nSomalia's continued collapse, the administration has clung to a clumsy \nset of tactics that have done little to quell the relentless violence \nor to enhance our own national security.\n  According to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees and the U.N.'s \nUnder Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, the crisis in Somalia \nhas become the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Yes, let me repeat \nthat: the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Ongoing violence, a poor \nharvest, drought, rising food prices, and skyrocketing inflation have \ncreated a perfect storm. Over 2.6 million or 35 percent of Somalis are \ncurrently in need of aid, with that number likely to increase to 3.5 \nmillion or nearly 50 percent of the population by the end of the year. \nSimultaneously, the fighting has forced an estimated 1 million Somalis \nfrom their homes into overcrowded and squalid camps both within the \ncountry and in northern Kenya and Ethiopia.\n  In the midst of this disaster, those individuals working courageously \nto provide aid to the battered population have themselves become \ntargets. I have been deeply troubled by the recent\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nkillings of aid workers, including the head of the U.N. Development \nProgram in Mogadishu and three Somali elders who were shot while they \nwere distributing food to displaced communities. According to the New \nYork Times, at least 20 aid workers have been killed and 17 kidnapped \nsince January. This is unacceptable. The international community, with \nthe U.S. leading the way, must make clear that attacks on humanitarian \nworkers will not be tolerated. Moreover, we must make sure that aid \nagencies, including the World Food Program, have sufficient resources \nto respond to the escalating needs on the ground.\n  Humanitarian assistance, however, only stops the bleeding \ntemporarily. Transforming the underlying causes of Somalia's \ninstability requires a political solution leading to a national \ngovernment that is both representative and reconciliatory. As I said \nshortly after it was brokered last month, the Djibouti agreement--\nbetween the Transitional Federal Government and a moderate faction of \nthe opposition group for the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia, \nARS--was a positive step forward. I applaud the U.N. Representative of \nthe Secretary General for taking a lead role and the U.S. Special Envoy \nfor Somalia, Ambassador John Yates, for ensuring the U.S. was actively \ninvolved--but now it is time to get down to business.\n  I am concerned by the slow progress of implementation. Rather than \nmoving quickly to shore up that agreement and injecting the necessary \ndiplomatic resources, the international community has remained in a \nwait-and-see posture. This has allowed al-Shabaab and other spoilers to \nundermine the legitimacy of the agreement and divide the opposition \nparty, rather than the other way around.\n  I have repeatedly called on the administration to develop a long-term \ncomprehensive regional strategy toward Somalia backed by sufficient \nresources and political commitment. Our current approach is clearly not \nworking. Relying on reactive and short-term tactics has limited our \nability to change the security dynamics on the ground and in the wider \nregion. An effective strategy begins with refocusing on the bigger \npicture and committing to our long-term goals, namely, helping Somalis \nto build robust democratic institutions that can provide security and \nundercut violent extremism--which poses a direct threat to the U.S.\n  It is not too late to salvage the opportunity presented by the \nDjibouti agreement. To do so, the United States and our international \npartners must move quickly with a coordinated diplomatic push to bring \nmore Somalis into the process as well as put forth the necessary \nresources for implementation. An inclusive and vigorous political \nprocess can marginalize the appeal of al-Shabaab and other violent \nextremists, but only if we act now. Simultaneously, there must be a \nmore active effort to hold accountable all those who perpetrate \nviolence and violate human rights. This includes strengthening the \nexisting arms embargo and pressuring regional actors who undermine a \nsustainable political solution. It won't be easy, but it is critical to \nbegin laying the groundwork for long-term peace and security.\n\n  The need to bring stability to Somalia is imperative not only to \navert humanitarian catastrophe, but also for our national security. \nNext week, on August 7, we will commemorate the 10-year anniversary of \nthe terrorist attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-\nSalaam, which left 224 people dead, including 12 U.S. citizens and \ndozens of other Embassy employees. That was a tragic day in American \nhistory. While some of those responsible have been brought to justice, \nthere is still work to be done to ensure that the remaining suspects \nare held to account for their involvement in these heinous acts and \nthat victims receive fair and just compensation.\n  Meanwhile, Somalia remains a safe haven for terrorists, as we know \nfrom the recent designation of the al-Shabaab and periodic Defense \nDepartment strikes against terrorist targets. But neither these \nstrikes, nor other ad hoc or fragmented actions, can substitute for a \nsustained, comprehensive strategy. We must act aggressively against \nterrorists who pose a threat to our country, but it will take more than \njust military options alone to solve Somalia's problems. Instead of \nhelping to build a society committed to the development of legitimate \ndemocratic institutions, we are effectively allowing Somalia to serve \nas a recruitment tool for insurgents and extremists as they further \nisolate various groups from the current political process. This is what \nthe State Department itself said this past April about safe havens in \nplaces like Somalia:\n\n       Defeating the terrorist enemy requires a comprehensive \n     effort executed locally, nationally, regionally, and \n     globally. Working with partner nations, we must eliminate \n     terrorist leadership, but incarcerating or killing terrorists \n     will not achieve an end to terrorism. We must simultaneously \n     eliminate terrorist safe havens, tailoring regional \n     strategies to disaggregate terrorist networks and break \n     terrorist financial, travel, communications, and intelligence \n     links. Finally, and most challenging, we must address the \n     underlying conditions that terrorists exploit at the national \n     and local levels to induce alienated or aggrieved populations \n     to become sympathizers, supporters, and ultimately members of \n     terrorist networks. We can marginalize violent extremists by \n     addressing people's needs and grievances, by giving people a \n     stake in their own political future, and by providing \n     alternatives to what terrorists offer.\n\n  The problem is not so much that the administration doesn't recognize \nwhat needs to be done, but that it doesn't have the will or the \ncommitment to do it. Basically, our bark is bigger than our bite. Ten \nyears after those attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, it appears we have \nmissed the larger lesson of that tragic day, and our front-line \ndiplomats continue to pay the price as they scramble to respond to the \nproblems of weak states caught up in a vicious and turbulent cycle of \ncollapse. They aren't the only ones paying the price, however, as those \nfailed states breed insecurity and conditions favorable for terrorism. \nTen years on, the United States still does not have a long-term \nstrategy to bring peace and stability to the Horn of Africa. We have \ntremendous diplomatic, military, intelligence, and foreign assistance \nresources at our disposal, but they are ineffective in the absence of a \ncoordinated and balanced strategy that incorporates both the short- and \nlong-term goals. This is no more evident than in Somalia.\n  It is not too late to chart a new path and prevent future suffering, \nbut we must act decisively. As we remember those who lost their lives \n10 years ago, many doing diplomatic work in some of the most demanding \npostings in the world, let us commit to honor their legacy by ensuring \nthat our country is no longer vulnerable to the terrorists who attacked \nus a decade ago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7806-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Ames\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my home State of Kentucky is mourning \nthe loss of a brave young soldier. On August 31, 2005, SPC Jason E. \nAmes was killed while serving his country in Mosul, Iraq. Hailing from \nCerulean, KY, Specialist Ames was 21 years old.\n  For his valor in uniform, Specialist Ames received several medals, \ndecorations, and awards, including the Army Commendation Medal, the \nGood Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Combat \nInfantryman Badge.\n  Jason was taken from his loved ones much too soon. But those closest \nto him know he packed his 21 years with all he could. ``Jason was \nalways a happy-go-lucky person,'' says his mom Susan Foust. ``Whatever \nhe encountered . . . he did it with a lot of life and a lot of \nlaughter.''\n\n  Born in Illinois to a military family, Jason moved around a lot as a \nkid and saw many parts of the world. Wherever he went, he made his own \nfun.\n  Susan recalls:\n\n       Jason loved to play Army as a child and played it often \n     with kids in the neighborhood. He made a suit out of \n     camouflage netting, sticks, and leaves. Using the military \n     acronym for Battle Dress Uniform--\n\n  She says--\n\n     he would also wear his mother's BDUs.\n\n  Susan also says:\n\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\n\n       Another favorite of Jason's was riding in his mother's \n     Dodge convertible with the top down, no matter the weather, \n     and listening to ``Danger Zone'' from ``Top Gun.''\n\n  Young Jason could also rely on the companionship of man's best \nfriend. As Susan explains it:\n\n       Jason would often play in the woods for hours while trying \n     to hide from the family dog named Moocher. I would tell \n     Moocher to find Jason, and no matter how well hidden Jason \n     thought he was, Moocher would find him.\n\n  Jason eventually settled in Cerulean, a town in Trigg County, in the \nsouthwestern part of my State. He attended Trigg County High School in \nCadiz and graduated in 2003.\n  Even before reaching high school graduation, however, Jason felt \nstrongly that he wanted to serve his country. Perhaps he was influenced \nby the respect for duty and service that ran deep in his family. At the \nage of 17, while still in high school, he asked his mother to grant her \npermission for him to enlist. Susan wanted Jason to wait until he \nturned 18, but Jason was so eager he convinced his mom to let him go \nahead and sign up.\n  ``We supported him with whatever decision he made,'' Susan says.\n  Jason enlisted and became an infantryman. By the time he was deployed \nto Iraq in October 2004, he was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 21st \nInfantry Regiment, 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, based in Fort \nLewis, WA.\n  Sadly, Jason's life was taken just a few weeks shy of when he was due \nto return home and shortly before his 21st birthday.\n  The Reverend Ron Hicks, a close friend of the Ames family, officiated \nat the services, and Jason was buried with full military honors at the \nKentucky Veterans Cemetery West in Hopkinsville, the Commonwealth's \nfirst State veterans cemetery.\n  Many beloved family members and friends across the country mourn \nJason's loss, including his mother, Susan Arlene Ames Foust, and his \nsister Krystal Dawn Knight. Our thoughts turn to them as they are \nconfronted with this great loss.\n  Jason's mom Susan says:\n\n       Jason had just turned 21 years old when he was taken. For \n     the 21 years that he was with us, those years are priceless.\n\n  Susan and all of Jason's family are certainly right to treasure those \n21 precious years. It is my hope they are also comforted by the \nknowledge that this country and this Senate honors SPC Jason E. Ames as \na patriot and as a hero. He left his Nation stronger by his service and \nhis sacrifice.\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Nicholas R. Carnes\n\n  Additionally, Mr. President, I rise because another Kentucky family \nis missing a husband, son, and brother, and our great State is missing \na patriot who loved his country. SSG Nicholas R. Carnes was tragically \nkilled on October 26, 2007, in Afghanistan while in combat with the \nenemy. A native of Dayton, KY, he was 25 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Carnes had volunteered for the mission that would be \nhis last, stepping in for another soldier on leave. For his bravery and \nservice, he received several medals, awards, and decorations, including \nthe Combat Action Badge, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Kentucky \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star \nMedal.\n  Because of a letter he sent to his wife Terri, we know why Nick chose \nto serve and place himself in harm's way. This is what he wrote in \nNovember 2006, a few weeks after he deployed to Afghanistan. He said:\n\n       Dear Terri . . . If the other soldiers who came before me \n     did not stand up for freedom, then we would not have freedom. \n     So I feel that I am obliged to stand up for freedom to ensure \n     that everyone else after me has the same freedoms we do \n     today.\n\n  Nick's family and friends remain inspired to this day by that young \nman's courage. His mother, WrayJean, puts it simply:\n\n       My son has been a hero from the second he was born. He \n     became a bigger hero when he did the job he did over there.\n\n  Nick grew up in Dayton, and WrayJean and his father, Gove, recall he \nhad a fun-filled and active childhood. He loved to hunt and he loved to \nfish. Gove taught him how to shoot. He played football in high school \nand practiced martial arts.\n  Nick loved country music, especially Johnny Cash, George Jones, and \nHank Williams, Jr. ``I have a country band and Nicholas would sing with \nus,'' Gove remembers.\n  His sister, Amanda Manasra, remembers: ``We went four-wheeling often \nand got a little muddy.''\n  She also remembers the time she and Nick built a treehouse, a \ntreehouse Amanda was too scared to climb. ``I never went up there,'' \nshe says.\n\n       Nick helped me overcome my fear. He always pushed me over \n     my limits. He always had a can-do attitude. He said: \n     ``can't'' isn't in your vocabulary.\n\n  Gove and Gove's uncle were both in the Kentucky National Guard, and \nNick grew up climbing on Army trucks. In 1999, when he was 17, he \nentered a Guard training program and by his senior year at Dayton High \nSchool, Nick was in the Guard. ``It was in his blood,'' WrayJean said.\n\n       There was no stopping the desire. He would say, ``Who would \n     keep us free if I don't do this?''\n\n  Nick graduated from high school in 2000 and went to work for BB \nRiverboats, a company that runs riverboat cruises along the Ohio River. \nIt was there he met Terri, the woman he would ask to become his wife. \n``We ran off to Las Vegas for my 30th birthday,'' Terri says.\n\n       When we were there, we went to Lake Mead . . . he got on \n     his knee and asked me to marry him. I said, ``Sure! Let's \n     go!'' It was meant to be.\n\n  With a happy life and friends and family who loved him, Nick still \nfelt the call to duty. WrayJean remembers what Nick said to her on the \nday of the worst terrorist attack in this Nation's history.\n  ``When 9/11 happened, Nicholas and I sat side by side on the couch,'' \nshe says.\n\n       We both sat there with tears rolling down our face. He \n     said, ``This is what I want to do.''\n\n  Terri also remembers how her husband was eager to serve. ``He could \nnot wait to go overseas,'' she says.\n\n       He would say, ``Can you imagine preparing for your whole \n     life and never getting to fight for your country?'' He loved \n     what he was doing over there . . . I know he would do it \n     again.\n\n  Nick's Guard unit was activated and he was eventually deployed to \nAfghanistan with Battery A, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery, based \nout of Carrollton, KY. His friend, Brian Sawyer, who served alongside \nhim, remembers Nick's dedication to his training and to his mission.\n  ``Nick was by the rulebook,'' Brian says.\n\n       When he graded my physical training test, if it wasn't a \n     push-up by the books, he didn't count it. . . . With \n     everybody, he was by the book. Not mean, but fair. Fair and \n     firm. . . . He knew pushing me to do the push-up the right \n     way was better for me.\n\n  Nick believed he had been sent to Afghanistan to make people's lives \nbetter, and he did it even in his downtime. He asked Terri to send him \ntoys and gifts he could distribute to the kids there.\n  ``Everything he did was sweet,'' Terri says.\n\n       It was rare, because mainly guys typically aren't caring \n     and understanding. He was different than all the rest.\n  Nick's work ethic also impressed everyone. His commanding officer, \nMAJ Walt Leaumont, had this to say:\n\n       When Nick came into the National Guard originally, I was \n     his battery commander. He was this little chubby 18-year-old \n     who had a spirit that wouldn't quit. He had a positive \n     attitude. He was a dream to command.\n\n  Sadly, Major Leaumont was also the officer charged with the sad task \nof telling Nick's family he would not be coming home. ``The night I \nnotified his family was probably the toughest time I have ever worn \nthis uniform,'' the major recalls.\n  Our prayers are with the Carnes family after their terrible loss. We \nare thinking of his wife Terri Bernstein-Carnes; his mother WrayJean; \nhis father Gove; his sisters, Amanda Manasra and Sarah Carnes; his \nbrother Brian Carnes; his grandmother, Frankie Glascock; his \ngrandfather, Gove Carnes, Jr.; his stepmother Charlotte Carnes, and \nmany other beloved family members and friends.\n  Nick was predeceased by his grandfather, Earl Glascock, and his \ngrandmother, Hazel Carnes.\n  Before Nick shipped out, he and his family threw a birthday party for \nhis wife Terri. Nick's sister, Amanda, jokingly told him:\n\n       You don't have to go. I can break your legs.\n\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\n\n  But Nick would have none of it. He told his little sister:\n\n       Just always know that I did it for us and I did it for \n     them. This was my destiny given by God and I have to fulfill \n     it.\n\n  SSG Nicholas R. Carnes represented the very best his town, his State, \nand his Nation have to offer.

Mr. President, as we prepare to return to our home States, \nI believe it is important to remind our colleagues about the work we \nhave done for the veterans of this Nation. As Chairman of the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I have had the privilege of working with almost \nevery entity and level of Government, veterans and military service \norganizations across the Nation, and every branch of the military, in \nan ongoing effort to better serve those who have served us.\n  In the past 19 months, the committee has held over 50 hearings, \ntaking testimony from over 320 witnesses. The committee staff has \ncarried out over 140 days of investigations and visits across the \ncountry. I commend the hard-working members of our committee, on both \nsides of the aisle, for their work this session.\n  After years of underfunding veterans programs, I wish to remind \neveryone that this Congress appropriated the largest increase in the \nhistory of the Department of Veterans Affairs. These funds are helping \nto provide better health care to veterans and enabling the Veterans \nBenefits Administration to hire thousands of new employees. It is my \nprofound hope this investment will produce marked improvements in care \nand in reduced backlog of veterans' disability claims. Last year, in \nconnection with the disclosures about Walter Reed, America learned of \nthe disgraceful treatment of some of our disabled servicemembers and \nveterans. Congress responded promptly and the Armed Services and \nVeterans' Affairs Committees collaborated in an unprecedented manner to \naddress the issues at Walter Reed and elsewhere. One result of this \ncooperation was the wounded warrior provisions included in last year's \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n\n  I take special pride in one particular wounded warrior provision \nwhich more than doubled the period of automatic VA health care \neligibility for returning troops. Servicemembers returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan are now eligible for 5 years of VA health care upon \nseparation from service.\n  I am also pleased with the work we have done in seeking an expanded \noutreach to veterans of the National Guard and Reserve. It is vital \nthat the growing role they play in our all-volunteer military be \nrecognized and that those who have been deployed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan be recognized and helped.\n  Congress also enacted the 21st Century GI bill of rights. Like others \nwho served in World War II, I personally know how that GI bill changed \nour country for the better. I hope this improved benefit will provide \nsimilar help for today's and tomorrow's troops.\n  But for all we have done, much remains unfinished in these waning \nweeks. Important legislation is pending in both the House and the \nSenate. To name two bills, we are still waiting for action on S. 1315 \nand S. 2162.\n  S. 1315, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007, would \nprovide needed assistance to veterans young and old, including the \nFilipino veterans of World War II who served under U.S. command but \nwere denied veterans status for over 60 years.\n  S. 2162 is the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements \nAct of 2008. This bill responds to the growing need among veterans for \nhigh quality mental health care. Many veterans return from war \nsuffering from invisible wounds. If left untreated, these wounds can \ninfect a veteran's life and livelihood, with dire consequences. The \nbill represents a tribute to Justin Bailey, a young Iraq veteran who \noverdosed while under VA care. We must not let other veterans suffer a \nsimilar tragedy.\n  Both of these bills passed the Senate with unanimous or nearly \nunanimous support, and both count strong supporters in the House. I \nhope that before this session ends, we will see both become law.\n  I do not report today that our work for veterans is anywhere near \ndone, but I do say it is work in progress. I thank my colleagues in \nboth Chambers and both parties for their support and cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7808-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7808-S7809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM BREW\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I normally come to the Senate floor and speak on various \nveterans issues--I advocate for increased screening and treatment and \nmental health issues for our veterans; I remind my fellow Senators that \nveterans of their home States must file income taxes for 2008 in order \nto receive their tax rebates; I argue for increased funding for VA's \nvital mission; and I urge the Senate to approve a new GI bill. Today, \nhowever, I come to the Senate floor to speak about one particular \nveteran--a Vietnam veteran who has dedicated his long career, enormous \ntalents, and tireless efforts to better the treatment and the lives of \nall who have served our Nation in uniform. Today, I will speak of my \nstaff director, William Brew.\n  Bill has just completed 20 years of service to the Senate. His entire \ntenure in the Senate has been at the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. \nBill started in the Senate on April 3, 1978. At that time, his desk was \nin what is now the committee's hearing room. The chairman was Alan \nCranston of California. The major issues were Agent Orange, judicial \nreview, and the emerging medical condition that had newly been labeled \npost-traumatic stress disorder. As a former naval officer, and a \nlawyer, Bill was thrown right into these issues, and his presence made \na huge difference.\n  An immediate and pressing need was to provide psychological \ncounseling to Vietnam veterans at a time when the war and, sadly, even \nthose who fought in it, remained a divisive issue for our Nation. Men \nand women who had served during that conflict did not return to heroes' \nwelcomes, yellow ribbons, and joyous neighborhood celebrations we so \noften see today. In 1980, in Van Nuys, CA, one of the very first vet \ncenters opened and offered a means of providing community-based \ncounseling and outreach services to those who were returning from \nSoutheast Asia. Now, there are 232 scattered around the country.\n  Millions of veterans and their families from all wars have received \ncounseling and support through these centers. Bill was instrumental in \ndeveloping the legislation that established these facilities and was \npresent at the creation of vet centers.\n  Bill was deeply involved in the debates surrounding Agent Orange and \nquickly became an expert on an issue whose vocabulary resolved around \ndioxin, defoliation, Ranch Hand, and a variety of health problems and \nconcerns. His efforts contributed to the development of wide-ranging \ninitiatives designed to address the needs of those who believe their \nexposure has adversely affected their health.\n  Bill was instrumental in the passage of legislation in 1996, which \nfundamentally changed the law with regard to eligibility for VA health \ncare. Eligibility Reform, as this law is known, eradicated the line \nbetween inpatient and outpatient care. VA, for the first time, was \nauthorized to provide a standard benefits package of services in the \nmost appropriate care setting. This seemingly simple change enabled VA \nto open up community-based clinics all across this country. Veterans \ncare has been dramatically improved because of the increased access to \nthe now 700 clinics dotting the landscape.\n  Assisting disabled veterans to reenter civilian life has always been \na high priority for the committee. Bill worked on legislation to revamp \nfederally assisted State vocational rehabilitation programs, giving \npriority to the most seriously disabled.\n  Bill was instrumental in the establishment of the Court of Veterans \nClaims, which gave judicial review to veterans' benefit determinations, \nand the committee recently approved legislation to expand the Court.\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n  It is little known that Bill has served on both sides of the aisle, \nworking not only for Chairmen Cranston and Rockefeller, and now myself, \nbut also working for Chairman Alan Simpson, my Republican colleague \nfrom Wyoming. In 1980, when the Democrats entered the minority, Bill \nremained a majority staff member under Chairman Simpson for 9 months \nbefore returning to Ranking Member Cranston's staff.\n  I congratulate Bill for his service and tell him that I am grateful \nfor that, and to thank him for his 20 years of dedicated and faithful \nservice to the Senate and to our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7809-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7809-S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENDING THE GAS PRICE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am here today to point out what I believe \neverybody in this body knows, certainly everybody back in the \nheartland, where the occupant of the chair and I live: America is \nsuffering a gas price crisis. I regret to tell the people back home \nthat the Senate is in a crisis of its own.\n  It appears that Democrats are desperate to deny real gas price \nrelief. They are apparently united behind the misguided policy of the \npresumptive Democratic nominee for President who says: Don't provide \nany new sources of supply. They are doing anything they can to block \nthe one real solution to this gas price.\n  Opening new offshore drilling will bring suffering American families \n18 billion barrels of new oil supplies. News of America's commitment to \nnew supplies will drive prices down immediately. We saw with the \nsuggestion that we would be opening offshore when the President lifted \nthe Executive moratorium on offshore drilling, that the prices came \ndown immediately $10 and then came down roughly $20 because the price \nof oil today is influenced by the long-term judgment of what the price \nwill be in the future.\n  Airlines, trucking companies, and others have to go out in the \nfutures market to buy the oil they need in the future. Those who bought \nfutures contracts at $90 turned out to be prescient. They saved money \nfrom the $145 a barrel oil we see today. But right now there are too \nmany hedgers, too many investors, and, yes, even some speculators, too \nmany investors, including the Public Employee Retirement Systems of \nCalifornia, and of local governments that are saying: Hey, if we don't \nopen oil supplies, we are going to see that $145 a barrel oil go to \n$175 and $200 and $250.\n  Regrettably, if the policy of the Democrats being acted on in the \nSenate today holds, we will see those oil prices going above $200 a \nbarrel and over $5 at the gas pump. The Democrats, in lockstep with \ntheir Presidential nominee, are doing anything they can to block the \none real solution: News of America's commitment to new supplies and oil \nwill drive down the prices immediately. New supplies, 10 years' worth \nin the case of offshore reserves, will drive prices lower for years to \ncome.\n  Some may say it will take a long time to bring it on line. That is \nwhat President Clinton said in 1995 when he vetoed the authorization to \nopen ANWR, which could have been producing a million barrels of oil a \nday. He said it wouldn't happen for 10 years. Well, it is now 13 years \npast that veto. We surely could use that additional million barrels of \noil a day.\n  The Democratic leader, when it comes to lowering gas prices with new \noffshore supplies, says: ``No, we can't.'' Actually, in the case of the \nSenate Democrats, it is ``No, we won't,'' reflecting the views of their \nPresidential nominee.\n  Earlier this month, I tried to join with my colleagues to repeal the \nlegislative moratorium preventing new offshore drilling off our \nAtlantic and Pacific coasts. With the high gas prices facing our \nfamilies, it is time to end the offshore drilling ban included each \nyear on the annual appropriations bill for the Department of the \nInterior.\n  Much to my surprise and regret, the Democratic leadership canceled \nthe planned business meeting to consider and write the Interior \nappropriations bill. We thought we would succeed. We thought people \nwould understand that bringing gas price relief to America's families \nby reversing the current ban on offshore drilling could meet the cry \nfrom our people back home to do something about the price of gas. But \nthe Democratic leadership canceled the meeting to prevent the will of \nthe people through their Senators from being heard.\n  Now we have confirmation. We have seen a statement from the \nAppropriations Committee that the Democrats thought they would lose the \nvote and fail in their attempt to keep new oil supplies from the \nAmerican people. It came from the Appropriations Committee itself \nsaying they did not want to see the offshore opened for drilling. That \nis not the way this body is supposed to work.\n  We disagree with a lot of things, but we at least ought to come to \nthe floor and have a vote. Those who are for it and those who are \nagainst it, let them take their stand in public and let the people \njudge.\n  Now we are on the floor of the Senate trying to move to a bill \nsupposedly on energy. We have asked for a debate and a vote on measures \nin addition to their measure on speculation, because speculation is a \nsmall part. What we need to do is get more supplies.\n  The plan of Republican Senators and our presumptive nominee for \nPresident, the Senator from Arizona, is to enact additional measures \nthat will lower gas prices through additional supplies from offshore \noil reserves, tap billions of barrels of oil in Rocky Mountain oil \nshale deposits, provide clean nuclear-powered electricity that can \ndrive our next generation of hybrid cars and trucks, and give financial \nhelp to jump-start our U.S. manufacturing supply base for hybrid car \nbatteries to bring their prices down and put people in America to work.\n  But now the Democratic leadership has gone back on this offer. They \nhave reneged on this offer. It is like Lucy with the football. The \nAmerican people, we feel like Charlie Brown and the football is \nlowering gas prices. They are offering to let Charlie Brown kick the \nfootball to get a vote on opening offshore oil reserves and see if he \ncan score a goal for lower gas prices. But, wait, the leadership of the \nDemocratic Party on this floor has yanked the oil supply football away, \nonly to let the American people swing and miss. The Democratic \nleadership apparently instead wants to move the goalposts back to pay \nfor new wind and solar incentives.\n  I support wind and solar incentives. The whole Senate voted for wind \nand solar incentives earlier this year, adopting an amendment by over \n80 votes. How many times do you have to do that? But the Democrats \nyanked the football away as well. They added new taxes to that measure. \nI guess they figured something so popular would be a good opportunity \nto raise taxes. That seems to be the policy of their nominee for \nPresident.\n  I can tell you that the people of Missouri do not want higher taxes. \nThey do not want us to make it harder to find and produce oil. More \nwind and solar power is not going to get gas prices down now or anytime \nin the future. Not a single trucker in Missouri will pay less for \ndiesel because we pass a bill for wind power. Not a single Missouri \nfamily will suffer less pain at the pump because we pass a bill for \nsolar power. Not a single farmer will pay less to run his tractors or \nless to send his produce to market.\n  The only real thing that will work to get gas prices down is \nfundamental--more oil supplies to scare away the speculators and meet \nthe demand.\n  Missouri does not need more hot air from the Democrats. Energy \nsummits where Washington politicians talk about how much they claim \nthey care about families will not get the gas prices down. And yet, the \nSenator from Illinois, the Democratic presumptive nominee for \nPresident, was in Missouri, and he had a solution for the gas price \ncrisis. He said we need to keep our tires fully inflated.\n  I agree with keeping our tires fully inflated. I am told by the \nstudies of the Department of Transportation that can save 6 to 12 \ngallons of gasoline a year. So please keep your tires inflated. But \nsuggestions to inflate our tires fully are not going to make a \nsignificant difference in the gas price.\n  America deserves more than Democratic hot air. Here it is hot air to \ninflate our tires. On the floor of the Senate, it is hot air to tell us \neverything\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nelse but increasing supplies may have an impact.\n  America deserves real action with real solutions. We should not \nabandon the American people to this gas price crisis. We need to move \nback to the bill on speculation and include amendments that will bring \nreal gas price relief.\n  I have an amendment, No. 5121, to open 18 million barrels of oil \nreserves off our Atlantic and Pacific coasts--10 years of new oil \nsupplies for the American people.\n  My amendment would also authorize more than $1 billion a year to \njump-start a U.S. manufacturing supply base for hybrid car and truck \nbatteries. Funding would go to hybrid battery research and development, \nbattery manufacturing equipment and capabilities, and re-equipping, \nexpanding, and establishing U.S. domestic manufacturing facilities or \nhybrid vehicle batteries.\n  Why do we need it? We need it to get the supply of batteries. I have \nvisited factories in Missouri where they are producing battery-powered \ncars, hybrid cars, such as the Ford Escape, the Claycomo plant. General \nMotors is working on these products. These are tremendous gas savers. \nWe need to move to more plug-in vehicles.\n  In my hometown of New Mexico, MO, my good friend who sells modified \ngolf carts is selling street-ready vehicles now, and they are popular. \nWe can have full-size vehicles if we have the batteries to power them. \nBut most of those batteries are being made in Asia, and American car \nmanufacturers get second call. We need to have those batteries \nmanufactured in America to supply our automobile industry.\n  This amendment would force gas prices down, find more oil and use \nless. The amendment would provide new oil supplies and new sources of \noil conservation. But the Democratic leadership doing the will of the \nSenator from Illinois, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is blocking \nconsideration of this amendment and all amendments.\n  As I said before, this is very disappointing to me, to the people of \nMissouri, and to the people of America. Missouri and America deserve \nmore than half measures that will only produce a few days or months \nmore of oil supplies. We deserve more than the Senate attempting to \nabandon them in the gas price crisis by moving on to other issues.\n  Missouri and America deserve real action now to lower gas prices. \nThat means new offshore supplies to get prices down. That is the \nposition the Republican Senators and the Republican Senator from \nArizona, our nominee for President, are pushing for: new offshore oil \nsupplies for American families, new offshore supplies for our farmers, \nnew offshore supplies for our truckers. That is the only real hope for \ngas price relief.\n  I beg the Senate leadership to let us move now. Failure to do so will \nassure the American people that they will go another month while we are \nout of session and have done nothing but talk hot air and suggest \nputting hot air into car tires.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMartinez, the Senator from Florida, Senator Gregg, the Senator from New \nHampshire, and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Let me interrupt the Senator from \nTexas for a moment. There are less than 8 minutes remaining in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was under the impression there was a \nlonger period of time. May I ask what the order of business is \nfollowing the expiration of morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirty minutes of debate controlled \nby the minority on the motion to proceed to the Defense bill.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are going to have a vote on the motion to proceed \nto the Defense authorization bill. The distinguished occupant of the \nchair, myself, and Senator Martinez all sit on the Armed Services \nCommittee. We know how important this legislation is. I have every \nconfidence that we will ultimately--at least I sure hope--get to and \npass a Defense authorization bill.\n  I will point out that for the last 2 weeks, we have had a series of \nattempts by the majority to get us off the single most important issue \nfacing the country today, and that is high energy prices, particularly \nhigh gasoline prices. My expectation is that this attempt, which will \nnow make this No. 7 instead of 6, will fail as well because on this \nside of the aisle we believe we should not leave here, we should not \nadjourn for the August recess without addressing this pressing issue.\n  It touches everybody in the country, rich or poor, regardless of \ncircumstances in life. It is also driving up the price of food and \nthreatening inflation which is going to threaten our economy regardless \nof what we do on housing and the subprime mortgage crisis.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire if he has some \nthoughts about what we ought to be doing between now and the time we \nadjourn for the August recess.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I wanted to \njoin with him today in addressing this issue because at least in New \nHampshire--and I suspect it is true in Texas, too, even though maybe in \na different way--the No. 1 issue on the minds of the people is the cost \nof energy. They are concerned about it when they fill up their car with \ngasoline, but they are even more concerned about it heading into the \nwinter.\n  People in New Hampshire anticipate winters. We know it is coming. \nThere is not much we can do about it. It is coming. We also know that \n60 to 70 percent of the homes in New Hampshire--maybe more--are heated \nby oil. The price of oil that has to be put in the tanks in order to \nheat homes has doubled or tripled. A lot of families in New Hampshire, \nlow-income families, but also moderate income families, are going to be \nextraordinarily stressed to try to meet that energy need and the price \nof that energy.\n  There are a lot of things that you can maybe do to change your \nlifestyle. You can maybe drive a little less. Maybe you can take a bus; \nnot so much in New Hampshire because there are not a lot of city areas \nthat have bus districts, although we do have some. But you can adjust \nyour driving. You can downsize your car so you use less gasoline. But \nif you have a home and you have a family, there is nothing you can do \nabout it. You have to heat that home. You have to stay warm in the \nwinter when the temperature is at zero or even minus degrees and the \nwind chill is certainly at minus degrees. To do that takes a lot of \nenergy and takes oil. So people are scared. They are scared about how \nthey are going to heat their homes.\n  I believe my No. 1 responsibility as their representative in \nWashington is try to do something about bringing down the price of that \nenergy. How do we do that? In my opinion, we do it by at least voting \nin the Senate on the issue of expanding our supply in the United \nStates, with American energy, while also conserving more. Yet we have \nbeen blocked now. As the Senator from Texas points out, this will be \nthe seventh time the Democratic Party and the Democratic leadership has \ntried to move the Congress and the Senate off the issue of trying to \nbring down oil prices, bring down gasoline prices by expanding American \nsources and American production by allowing us to drill offshore, by \nallowing us to use oil shale, by allowing us to expand nuclear power, \nby allowing us to put an effort into the development of electric cars, \nby doing a whole series of things.\n  Seven times now the Democratic leadership here has said, no, they do \nnot want to hear about this. They want to talk about issues that are \nimportant, but they are nowhere near the importance, at least to my \nconstituents, of what it costs them to fill up their gasoline tanks and \nwhat it is going to cost them to fill up their oil tanks this winter.\n  I cannot think of a higher priority as a Congress than to take up \nthis Energy bill and have some votes on these very important issues of \nwhether we open more drilling offshore, whether we use more oil shale, \nwhether we expand our efforts to try to bring online nuclear \npowerplants, whether we continue our efforts to try to expand electric \ncars.\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\n  The Senator from Texas hit the nail on the head. We need to act on \nthese issues, and we should stop this obfuscation which is occurring on \nthe other side of the aisle on this issue. We should get to the essence \nof the issue, which is produce more American energy.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire addressing \nthat issue. I have always been amazed that those who say we ought to do \nsomething to help poor people who need help with their heating oil are \nthe same folks who seem to be the most resistant to opening America's \nreserves of natural resources which would have the effect of bringing \ndown oil prices for everybody. It seems to me that would be one of the \nmost commonsense things we could do.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator makes a truly excellent point. If we want to \naddress the fear low-income people have about the cost of their energy \nto heat their home, bring down the cost of energy. Address the \nsystematic problem.\n  LIHEAP is an important program. It is a critical program for us in \nNew England. But it is the bandaid. It is not going to the symptom. The \nsymptom is the price of the energy, so that is why we need to vote on \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7811-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I know Senator Obama has adamantly \nopposed any additional offshore exploration and production. One \nconclusion I guess you might draw is that the majority leader, by \nrefusing an opportunity for Senators to vote, is somehow protecting the \nPresidential nominee, the presumptive Presidential nominee, from \nperhaps an embarrassing split in his own political party.\n  I wonder if the Senator has any comments.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I am happy to comment on the situation in Florida and \nalso what I think is an observation you made accurately in the larger \npolitical climate. They are related. The State of Florida has jealously \nguarded its offshore resources because we have a tremendous tourism \neconomy, as does Texas in some parts of the State. However, $4 for a \ngallon of gas has caused a transformation in thinking. It has allowed \nus to see more clearly what is occurring. What is occurring to our \nNation is not just that the people, the families, American families, \nare hurting at the pump when they go pump gas. Fortunately in Florida \nour winters are mild, but I understand the situation in New Hampshire \nand other cold States that is going to be coming up. This is hurting \nfamilies. This is a problem to the American family, particularly those \non fixed income, many of whom live in Florida.\n  The problem becomes more acute because this also merges into our \nnational defense, into our security as a nation. When the Persian Gulf \nwar took place, Alaska increased its production of oil, and at that \ntime they were producing at a capacity of 2.1 million barrels a day. \nToday they are only producing 700,000 barrels a day because the supply \nof oil in Alaska is dwindling because we are not allowed to develop \nadditional resources there.\n  What is occurring, essentially, is that the domestic supply of oil is \never decreasing, our percentage of dependence on foreign sources is \never increasing, while at the same time the price is going through the \nroof. It is a supply-and-demand problem that cries out for a solution.\n  What has occurred? My own transformation has been that while I was \nadamantly opposed to any form of drilling, my own Governor took a \nforward-thinking position and decided maybe the time had come for us to \nreconsider and think a little differently about it. We still want to \nprotect our coastline. We still want to protect our beaches. But at the \nsame time, we have to recognize a new reality. That new reality \nrequires us to adapt to the current circumstances. We are transferring \nwealth to the extent of $700 billion a year to foreign sources. It is \nunsustainable over a long period of time. America will be squandering \nits wealth purely to satisfy our demand for oil.\n  Surely we have to do other things about renewables. We have to do all \nthat. But at the end of the day, we have to do more on our own \nresources to produce more oil from America's soil.\n  What has occurred is, in fact, the presumptive nominee of the \nDemocratic Party and the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party \nhave taken divergent points of view. Senator McCain, changing his \nposition much as I have, has said: Times have changed. We have to drill \nin the offshore. Senator Obama remains stuck in the past. He is not for \nchange. He is against change when it comes to taking care of America's \noil resources. I believe what we are following is the dictates of \nhigher powers. At the same time, the business of the Senate has ground \nto a halt. We have not been able to accomplish much because we have not \nbeen allowed to have the thorough debate we need to have on this very \nimportant issue.\n  When I hear from Floridians today, they want us to move the business \nof Government, but they most of all want us to solve this problem. They \ndo not want us to put it aside. They know they are hurting.\n  They also realize, by the way, this is no panacea. We have no magic \nwand we can wave and lower prices tomorrow, but we can begin a trend \nthat is going to trend in the downward direction if we begin to do \nsomething about opening America's resources to more drilling.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Florida. In \nthe real world, when the facts change, people are free to change their \nmind.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. That is right.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I think $4 gasoline and $140-plus for a barrel of oil \nhave caused a lot of people to rethink their prior positions. Gasoline \nwas $2.33 when the Democrats took control of Congress in early 2007 but \nnow is hovering around $4 a gallon, and I think it is only reasonable \nthat people will reassess their decisionmaking. Indeed, I think we have \nseen that happen with the American people, if you look at public \nopinion polls, shifting to overwhelming support for exploration and \nproduction from the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, I know, as the Senator from \nFlorida said, more oil is going to be a transitional step on our part \nbecause production globally is declining. Yet demand, especially from \nhuge economies such as China and India, is going up. I know the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is a big proponent of clean nuclear power. I wonder \nif he can comment on what he sees this transition looking like, in \nterms of starting with more American production but with conservation, \nwith renewable energy, and developing nuclear power.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Texas has been one of the best advocates \non the floor for balance, which is what we\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\nneed. The American people understand the basic common sense of an \nissue, which is we need to use all the different options we have at \nhand. We are a nation with great creativity, great ability to be \ninnovative. We are also willing to push the envelope, to try to use \ntechnology to improve our situation.\n  Not only do we need to find more, we need to use less. We need also \nto use our great strength in technology to advance our cause of \ndelivering more American energy.\n  Nuclear power is a classic example of that. We basically created \nnuclear power, the concept of it, and how to use it in a positive way. \nYet for the last 27 years, because of the adamant and, in my opinion, \ninappropriate opposition of the most activist environmentalist groups \nin this country, we have not had a new nuclear powerplant application \napproved.\n\n  New Hampshire, ironically, was the last State to bring online a \nnuclear powerplant. That occurred in the late 1980s. That nuclear \npowerplant was resisted by the Democratic leadership in the State and \nby the activist environmentalists in the State at a level which was \nbasically civil disobedience. Thousands of people were arrested at the \nsite where the plant was being built. It was delayed for almost 15 \nyears. The cost of it quadrupled--it went up by a factor of 10, I \nthink.\n  What happened in the end was the plant came online. What has happened \nsince the plant has been online? It has produced safe, clean, reliable \nenergy--not only for the people of New Hampshire but for the people of \nall the Northeast because it is producing so much energy it actually \nexceeds New Hampshire's needs. As a result, we have had an energy \nsource which has saved us from having to buy thousands and thousands--\nmillions of barrels of oil. We should be doing that across the country.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. May I ask the Senator a question. This nuclear plant, \ndoes it produce greenhouse gases? Does it, in any way, harm the quality \nof air or produce the kinds of problems associated with global warming?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is a good question and it is very important. Nuclear \npower is clean. It addresses the issue of global warming. It is the \nmost effective energy we have for that. It has no emissions which \nbasically go into the atmosphere and aggravate the issue of global \nwarming, so it is the type of power we want. It is safe and it is ours. \nWe do not have to buy it from some other country. It is very logical we \nshould be aggressively pursuing nuclear power. Again, you have to \nappreciate the fact that the other side of the aisle and the leadership \nof the other side of the aisle, especially Senator Obama, are opposed \nto expanding the nuclear option for our Nation which, in my opinion, is \ncutting off your nose to spite your face. This is a very safe and \nusable form of energy which addresses the issue of global climate \nchange in a positive way by still giving Americans American-purchased \nenergy.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to the Senator from New Hampshire, it does \nnot make sense to me. The U.S. Navy, of course, as we know, has been \nusing nuclear power for its aircraft carriers and submarines for, I \nthink, 50 years and is able to do so safely and without incident.\n  France generates 80 percent of its electricity using nuclear power. \nIn France, the environmental activists have actually cut a deal, as I \nunderstand it, with the nuclear power producers because they \nunderstand. They get the point the Senator from Florida makes, and the \nSenator from New Hampshire, that nuclear power is clean power. For \nthose who are concerned about climate change, that would be one of the \nbest things we could do to alleviate the pressure on the environment.\n  I wish to get back, if I can for a second, because there has been a \nlot of talk, particularly the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, is \ntalking about the need to develop new technology, to develop plug-in \nhybrid cars, battery-operated cars. I know there is a little confusion \nbecause right now we need transportation energy, which is basically oil \nand gasoline--aviation fuel to fly our airplanes. People wonder how \ndoes nuclear power or using coal in a clean way to generate electricity \nfigure into that? The point we are trying to make is we need all of the \nabove. We need to generate the electricity cleanly so we can use the \nnew technology that we think will bring us into a clean energy future.\n  I wish to ask both my colleagues to comment on a couple things. One \nof my constituents, T. Boone Pickens, is in town. He is a remarkable \nman. He has been very successful in the oil and gas business. He says \nwe need a different way of looking at our energy future. He is \nadvocating increased use of wind energy to generate electricity. He is \nadvocating more use of natural gas because he says we have found ways \nto develop more of that here in America so we have to buy less--the \npoint of the Senator from Florida. That is less money we have to send \nthan the $700 billion we send overseas each year.\n  Mr. GREGG. He also said, did he not, that we need to use everything. \nHe didn't say don't use drilling; he said we have to drill everywhere \nwe can in the United States, we have to use wind, we have to use solar, \nwe have to use nuclear, we have to use everything, because we have to \nstop sending $700 billion, as the Senator from Florida mentioned, to \npeople who do not like us--Venezuela and Iran. Let's keep it here, \nwhere we can use it to build our economy.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I remember him being asked: What do you feel about \ndrilling? He said: I want to drill everywhere.\n  Now, I am not there, because I don't want to drill everywhere. I want \nsome beaches to be protected. But he was saying we need to drill, \ndrill, drill. That is part of the answer. It is not going to get us out \nof the problem, but it is part of the solution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have two points, and I would like to hear from both \nSenators. One is we hear from folks opposed to offshore drilling say we \ncan't drill our way out of this.\n  Other opponents of offshore exploration and production said: It is \ngoing to take too long.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Florida and the Senator from New \nHampshire have some thoughts about those. I happen to believe those are \npulled out of context, particularly when it comes to Boone Pickens, \nbecause, as you said, we need it all. What is the best answer to that?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I would say that, no, we cannot drill our way out of \nthe problem, but we can improve on the problem. Today, we use about 21 \nmillion barrels of oil, and 5 million of those come from overseas. That \nis what turns into that $700 billion bill.\n  What if we could add another million barrels to that production \ndomestically? We will have ameliorated the problem by a significant \npercentage. What if we did 2 million barrels? All of a sudden, the \nequation is different and we can be more sustainable within our own \nresources.\n  The second part of this is, it is not all about oil. It is about \nother things, such as oil shale. The Democrats oppose looking into that \npossibility. We have not been allowed to have a full discussion. \nColorado, Utah, and Wyoming should be allowed to develop this resource. \nI understand that we have an estimated 2 trillion barrels of oil that \ncan be produced from oil shale. So maybe we can drill our way out of \nthis with enough creativity, enough technology, and enough resources \nbeing employed.\n  So it is not going to just be about nuclear, although it ought to be \nnuclear. Florida has three nuclear powerplants built in the 1970s and \n1980s, and thank goodness for those because in Florida we cannot \nproduce any oil, we do not have any hydro, and we depend on those \nnuclear powerplants to power ourselves. So thank goodness we have that.\n  We also need to look at more production offshore. We need to do more \noil shale, and the new technologies of wind and solar and new battery \ntechnology--all of the above.\n  My point is, we cannot drill our way out of this, but part of the \nsolution is drilling. So it is not about suggesting that we should \nforget everything else and just drill, but it is to say that drilling \nas a component part of a comprehensive energy policy can move this \ncountry ahead, can move us forward.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the point the Senator makes is extraordinarily \nvalid. But there is an ancillary issue here,\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nwhich is, not only do we need the energy to try to increase supplies \nand reduce the price, but it seems incomprehensible that we would not \nwant to put in place programs which would relieve us from sending \nAmericans' hard-earned dollars, you know, folks who are working every \nday, sending those dollars to Venezuela and Iran and other countries \nwhich hate us and want to do us harm. It seems that common sense would \nwant us to produce American energy if we have American energy available \nto us and we can produce it in an environmentally sound way rather than \nsend the money overseas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I want to ask the Senator from New Hampshire, the bill \nthat was on the floor about 2 weeks ago was a bill to deal with \nspeculation and the commodity futures market. Our point was, we should \nnot just deal with part of it, part of the problem, we ought to deal \nwith the whole problem. That is why we have insisted--in fact, we have \ndemanded and we said we should not leave here until we have had an \nopportunity to vote on offshore production and those other good ideas.\n  But I wonder if the Senator would address why the speculation \ncomponent alone would be an insufficient response--may be part of the \nanswer but certainly not the complete answer to the problems we face \ntoday?\n  Mr. GREGG. The simple answer is that it does not produce any more \nenergy. Yes, there is probably speculation in the market. Yes, we \nshould have more transparency and more enforcement to make sure the \nmarket is not being abused. But that is not going to produce any more \nenergy.\n  We know there are 2.5 billion people between India and China, and \nthey are starting to have much more high-quality lives, and so they are \nstarting to buy cars, they are starting to buy motor scooters, they are \nstarting to use energy. As a result, the demand for energy is \naccelerating dramatically. That is 2.2 billion more people than we have \nin the United States. So the simple math of it shows us we have to find \nmore energy and we have to use less energy.\n  That is why amendments brought to the floor which are directed at \nfinding more energy--such as oil shale, drilling offshore, and \nnuclear--need to be addressed. We need to discuss them. I cannot \nunderstand why the other side of the aisle refuses to do that.\n  I asked my staff to put together a chart which would summarize this \nin the most simple and stark way. Here is the chart. It is a big zero. \nIt is a zero. Zero amendments are being allowed here. Zero new oil is \nbeing produced as a result of that. Zero new gas, zero new nuclear \nplants. Until we have some amendments on this floor which allow us to \naddress these issues, we are still going to have zero as being the \nanswer of the other party to how you produce more oil and more energy. \nIt is not right. We should be getting down to the issue of what the \nAmerican people want, which is to get the price of energy down by \nproducing more and using less and producing more American energy rather \nthan buying it from other countries that do not like us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. The International Energy Agency painted a grim picture \nabout the future. The report estimated that over 3.5 million barrels a \nday of new production will be needed each year just to hold the total \nproduction steady. So as India, China, and these other countries are \nrising in their demand, we need 3.5 million barrels a day of new oil \njust to keep the current standards of what we have. That is not just a \nU.S. problem, it is a global problem.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank my colleagues.\n  We are going to relinquish the floor to the Senator from Georgia for \nthe final comments.\n  I would say in closing that I can anticipate what the argument is \ngoing to be when the majority leader comes out, and the whip--they are \ngoing to say it is all about Republican obstruction.\n  But the problem is, we have insisted we are not going home, we are \nnot going to quit, we are not going to change the topic until we get an \nopportunity to vote on what we believe will have the most direct impact \non reducing gas prices: increasing supply and offering all of the above \nthat we have discussed during this colloquy this morning. That is our \nposition, and we believe that should be a bipartisan position. We \ninvite our friends on the other side of the aisle to join us in being \npart of the solution instead of being part of the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I associate myself with the Senators from \nNew Hampshire, Florida, and Texas, and would like to report an \ninteresting occurrence that took place yesterday that kind of verifies \nexactly what Senator Cornyn said.\n  After the vote on the media shield motion to proceed, I went back to \nmy office and placed two phone calls, one to the president of the \nGeorgia Press Association, the other one to the president of the \nGeorgia Broadcasters Association. I told both of them: We have had \nconversations about the importance of media shield, and I know both of \nyou are very interested in it. But I want to explain why a few minutes \nago I cast a ``no'' vote on a motion to proceed to media shield.\n  I said: The reason I did it, quite simply, is that for everybody in \nmy State--and I would submit most everybody in the United States of \nAmerica--the No. 1 issue is the high cost of energy and particularly \nthe high cost of gasoline.\n  Both men, both professional journalists, both presidents of their \nassociations, said: We understand.\n  The broadcasters said: Our talk shows are not calling in about media \nshield; they are calling in about the gas.\n  The president of the press association said: Listen, I understand. \nRead our letters to the editor. I listen at the coffee shop. I know \nwhat Georgians are concerned about. It is the high price of energy and \nthe high price of gas.\n  So that is why I have remained committed to staying on the Energy \nbill until we find some way to bring Republicans and Democrats \ntogether. Both of us can give. I said in a speech the other day: We \nought to put our donkeys and elephants in the barn and sit down and \ntalk about ways to really meaningfully change the lives of the American \npeople, not 20 years from now but today.\n  The country is hungry for a Congress and for leadership that will say \nyes to more production, yes to more conservation, yes to a better \nenvironment, yes to a productive economy, all of which would be the \nresult of a comprehensive, balanced approach toward energy. But a \nsingular slingshot approach or a rifle approach, like just speculation \nor just drilling or just something else--we have to do it all. We have \nto do it comprehensively. We have it within our capabilities to do it \nright.\n  As the Senators before me have stated, we have all kinds of \nresources. Many of these resources are not only abundant but they are \ncleaner than gasoline and they are cleaner than oil--nuclear energy, \nfor example. In America, 19 percent of our electric energy is produced \nwith nuclear; in France, it is 87 percent. Think about the difference \nthat makes not only in the reliability and the cost of energy but the \ncarbon-free emissions that come from nuclear versus the heavy carbons \nthat come from the burning of oil or gas or coal or other sources.\n  Ingenuity and innovation. The American people are a remarkable \npeople. When confronted with whatever challenge, we have almost always \ncome up with a solution. But sometimes those solutions either take \ninspiration or they take encouragement. When we needed to go to the \nMoon and win the space race, we had the inspiration of a great \nPresident, John Kennedy, to declare a goal to land a man on the Moon \nand bring him back again before the end of the decade. We did not know \nhow to do it, but we did it. We need a Congress that is just as bold \ntoday to say that $4 a gallon is too much for gasoline, carbon is too \nbad for our atmosphere, and fossil fuels are geopolitically not in our \ninterest.\n  It is time that we as America find ways through engineering and \ningenuity to invent and to develop and to process those sources of \nenergy that are clean, renewable, reliable, and less expensive. And we \ncan do it. But you cannot do it if you stand in gridlock on the floor \nof the Senate and the House of Representatives, unwilling to talk about \nall the issues.\n  We all have our biases and we all have our prejudices, but all of us \ntake\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\nan oath of office to represent the people of our State and to uphold \nthe Constitution of the United States of America and defend the \ndomestic tranquility of our people. When your economy is tanking, when \nyour debt is going up because of your addiction to foreign oil, and \nCongress sits here for 2 weeks and debates only one sliver of the \nsolution without everything, then we are not living up to our \nresponsibility.\n  So if the Georgia Press Association understands, if the Association \nof Broadcasters understands, if the 17,488 people who communicated last \nweek with my office about one issue--and that was cost of energy--\nunderstand, why can't we in the Senate understand? We are all in this \ntogether. We are 100 coequals. We all have the same responsibility. And \nwe ought to all have the same goal; that is, to find a way to thread \nthe needle so we sit down and we develop a comprehensive energy program \nfor the people of the United States of America.\n  I did a talk show yesterday--actually, it was a television program \nwhere I was asked about this energy question. I was asked about the \nArab oil embargo of the 1970s. I said that the Arab oil embargo of the \n1970s was an early warning. It gave us a second chance to address the \nenergy question. But when prices went down in the 1980s and 1990s and \nthe price of gasoline was not that high, we did not take that chance. \nWell, now prices have spiked to an alltime high.\n  This is not a second chance for us in America, this is a last chance \nfor us in America. A sustained cost of gas at $4 a gallon, oil at $120 \nto $150 a barrel will break the U.S. economy. It will destroy the value \nof the U.S. dollar, and it will hurt the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So it is time for us to put these prejudices aside, put them aside \nand sit down and be willing to agree. I will be the first person to lay \non a table--I am willing to sit down and talk to anybody, anyplace, \nanywhere, about any singular facet of the energy crisis if they are \nwilling to talk about the other facets of the energy crisis.\n  As Boone Pickens said, drilling will not solve it, but it will help. \nSolar will not solve it, but it will help. Wind will not solve it, but \nit will help. Renewables will not solve it, but they will help. What we \nhave to do is put together the pieces of the puzzle that are within our \ngrasp and make sure the people of the United States have abundant \nenergy at affordable prices. We are sitting on a ham sandwich, starving \nto death. We are not developing the resources we have at our disposal, \nand because of that, our citizens are paying a dramatic price.\n  Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, let's start talking about solutions \nrather than continuing to perpetuate the problem.\n  I yield back any time we have remaining, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have the \nfloor at 2 o'clock for the purpose of a colloquy between Senators \nDurbin, Murray, Schumer, Dorgan, and Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think it will--we will have that happen at the half \nhour. I don't think we will use all the time. That is the Democratic \ntime. We will just work the Republican time at 2:30 or 3 o'clock and \nthereafter.\n  Is there an order in effect now as to what will happen after lunches \nas to the allocation of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The current order provides allocation of time \nuntil 12:30 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent--if I could have the attention of \nthe distinguished Republican leader, the time has been allocated until \n12:30 today. So 11:30 is Republican time, from 12:30 to 1:00 would be \nthe Republican time again; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So I ask that the time be allocated every half hour until 5 \no'clock tonight, and that I be recognized at 2 o'clock for the half \nhour of Democratic time under the conditions I mentioned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also say that if we have any \nconference reports that we can agree on, whoever's time it is, we will \ninterrupt and try to do that--if, in fact, we get an agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. If we are in a quorum call----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not in a quorum call.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think I have until 11:45, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order as to time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans control the time until noon.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, our side of the aisle has allowed me until \n11:45 to speak.\n\n\n                              Katy French\n\n  Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor for a lot of reasons at a lot \nof different times, but today is extremely unusual. I wish to spend the \ntime talking about how important staff is in Washington. We are only \ncapable of doing and accomplishing what we accomplish because we have \nstaff here to help us.\n  I have had the great fortune over the last 3\\1/2\\ years to have \nsomeone on my staff who has displayed character virtues like none other \nI have seen in my career. She will be leaving my staff. Her name is \nKaty French. She has a master's in public health from Harvard. She has \nbeen on the front lines of HIV/AIDS since the epidemic came about. She \nworked for both Senator Gregg and Senator Brownback. The \ncharacteristics about her that make her great--in Oklahoma we would say \nher ``plow runs deep.'' She is well-rooted in the principles of \nliberty.\n  What she has done with that principle is recognize that if you are \nfree, and you have liberty and yet you don't spend your life helping \nother people, the liberty is for naught. So she has been a great \nexample to me and my staff over the last 3\\1/2\\ years for her tireless \ndedication--which all on our staff have--and for bringing with that \nwell-rootedness, that deep-rootedness, the ability to challenge a \nSenator, to tell us what she thinks even though we may not like it, to \nbring forth ideas that aren't in the conservative realm yet are \nhumanitarian, great ideas, the ideas to help people. The people who \nknow Katy French know she means business, but that business has always \ninvolved taking care of people.\n  One of the first things she did as my staff director on the Federal \nFinancial Management Subcommittee was set up a hearing on malaria. What \nwe know is millions of people today in Africa are being cured of \nmalaria because we, in fact, changed that program. The oversight \nhearings we held changed the direction. I know the Presiding Officer of \nthe Senate now, the Senator from Ohio, is very much interested in that \ntopic. Through her work, millions of Africans are alive today who would \nnot otherwise be alive because the program was changed where we \nactually made a difference.\n  I can't think of any greater tribute to an individual who comes to \nwork to help us in the Senate than to measure the value of what they \nhave done in terms of the lives that have been made better, made \nhealthier, and have forgone a serious disease and dread. She also \nconducted more hearings in our subcommittee than any other committee or \nsubcommittee in the entire Senate in the 109th Congress. Most staff \ndirectors of committees know--and subcommittees know--how hard it is to \nput together and hold hearings.\n  Probably the greatest tribute to Katy is the fact that she didn't \nstop with that. When the Pope was here in his visit this last year, he \ncalled on America's youth to reach out and make a difference. Katy is \nin the middle of her career. She has made a big difference in the \nSenate for three separate Senators. She has made a big difference in \nterms of the PEPFAR legislation--the original legislation and the \nlegislation that we just passed and the President has signed. She \nlistened to that call to make a difference. So it is\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nboth a sad time and a happy time for me to know that Katy is joining a \nreligious order to further her life in giving to other people.\n  She is foregoing money. She is foregoing material things. In fact, \nshe will be in an order that was established some 30 years ago \nassociated with the Catholic Church out of Argentina that she will \ndedicate the rest of her life to, making a difference--a real \ndifference--in other people's lives.\n  She will be focusing on troubled urban youth. Her characteristics and \nmultilingual talents will lead her in that direction. To me, the \ngreatest compliment you can have as a Senator is to have a staff member \nleave for such a higher calling. For Katy and all of those who work in \nour office and on behalf of the Senate, and as a reflection of the rest \nof the staff of the Senate, we thank you for your efforts on behalf of \nfreedom.\n  I thank you, Katy, for your efforts on behalf of our office and what \nwe are trying to do for the people of Oklahoma. Most importantly, I \nthank you for your grasp of faith and what it means to truly give up \nyour life so that in the words of that man from Nazareth: ``He who is \nlast will be first.''\n  Katy French has lived that example. We will miss her.\n  I thank the Senate for the time.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      American Energy Freedom Day\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to invite my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting American Energy Freedom Day on October 1, 2008.\n  On this day, the current prohibitions on oil and gas exploration off \nthe Outer Continental shelf and in the oil shale fields of the West \nwill expire, giving Americans the freedom to access their own energy \nreserves and providing them with relief from sky-high prices at the \npump.\n  Estimates indicate there are upwards of 18 billion barrels of \nrecoverable crude oil in the off-limit areas of the Outer Continental \nShelf, as well as more than 55 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. In \naddition, estimates indicate that between 800 billion and 2 trillion \nbarrels of oil can be drawn from American oil shale.\n  Taking advantage of American resources will increase the worldwide \nsupply of petroleum and bring down prices at the pump. The very access \nto these resources will send powerful price-reducing signals to the \nfutures market, providing immediate relief for all Americans.\n  For over 25 years, Democrats have denied Americans the freedom to \naccess their own energy, making our Nation more and more dependent on \nforeign oil. Each year, they have continued the ban on American energy. \nNow it is time for them to get out of the way and open up American \nenergy supplies.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support Energy Freedom Day and \nallow the prohibitions on American energy exploration to expire once \nand for all. We must actively oppose any attempt to extend these bans \non American prosperity and security. Now is not the time to deny \nAmericans access to their own energy.\n  October 1 is going to be a great day for all Americans. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting American Energy Freedom Day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n\n                            renewable energy\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof renewable energy and addressing our current energy crisis in the \nUnited States. We need a comprehensive approach to our energy problems \nin the United States. Renewable energy is one of the answers.\n  Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from the State of Washington, and \nI have been working tirelessly together, in a bipartisan way, to get a \nrenewable energy bill passed through the Senate, passed through the \nHouse, and onto the President's desk for a signature. I applaud her for \nher efforts in this battle.\n  We passed our renewable energy bill--a bipartisan bill--back in \nApril. We attached it to the housing bill that was done then. It passed \nthis body with a vote of 88 to 8. Not too often around here do you see \nRepublicans and Democrats joining together in such a bipartisan way. \nBut it shows you the kind of support this body has shown toward \nrenewable energy. Unfortunately, the Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives blocked our renewable energy bill from being considered \nas part of the housing bill.\n  Once again, we attempted, in July, to get our amendment added to the \nhousing bill that would expand renewable energy, such as solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and other types of green energy to the United States. We \nwould have been able to attach that to the housing bill if the majority \nparty had allowed us to have that kind of a vote. Unfortunately, they \nused the excuse it wasn't paid for and that the House of \nRepresentatives--the Democrats in the House--would block our piece of \nlegislation from being considered in the final package.\n  So we offered a compromise and we said, OK, we will pay for it, \nexcept that instead of raising taxes to ``pay for it,'' we will offer \nspending cuts. The Federal Government is too big anyway. We said let's \nhave a very small ``haircut'' from nonveteran spending programs across \nthe board. We will do across-the-board spending cuts--a tiny \npercentage.\n  Once again, the Democratic majority said no. It was very \ndisappointing. We need to come together in a bipartisan way to address \nthe energy needs of this country. Republicans have been saying: Let's \ndo a comprehensive approach; let's include renewable energy and more \nconservation, but let's also pass a comprehensive bill that allows us \nto drill in places such as our Outer Continental Shelf. Deep sea \nexploration is a great way for us to bring more oil and natural gas to \nthe United States, to make us less dependent on Middle Eastern oil.\n  My colleague from South Carolina talked about oil shale. Up to 2 \ntrillion barrels of oil--which is three times more oil than Saudi \nArabia has--is potentially available between Wyoming, Colorado, and \nUtah. Right now, we have a moratorium put on that. Why? Because the \nDemocratic majority put that into law last year.\n  We need to repeal that moratorium so that progress can go forward to \nmake us less dependent on countries that--frankly, a lot of them don't \nlike us. Whether it is Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, or some of the other \nmore volatile regions of the world where we get a lot of our oil today, \nthose are not exactly the places where we should be sending our money.\n  Currently, the United States sends about $700 billion a year \noverseas, funding a lot of governments that are not our friends. We, as \nRepublicans and Democrats, need to lay our party labels aside and \nbecome Americans. Let's do something that is right for the country. \nLet's bring more American energy production to America, so we are less \ndependent on other governments around the world.\n  I strongly believe we need to tap more of our coal reserves. That is \none of our cheapest forms of power we have in the United States. There \nis exciting new technology for coal, called carbon recapture \ntechnology. Senator Kerry and I have a subcommittee--he is chairman and \nI am the ranking member--and we have done several hearings over the \nlast couple of years on this carbon recapture technology to make coal \neven cleaner than it is today. That carbon recapture technology is \nexciting. We are talking about capturing 95 percent of all of the \ncarbon produced by coal. It can produce more and more electricity for \nthe United States.\n  When we are talking about battery technologies for cars, or hybrids, \nyou can also produce more electricity so that we can take natural gas \naway from some of these powerplants and convert some of our cars to \nnatural gas. All of this will lower the price of gasoline, because we \nwill need less.\n  Today, the price of oil and gas is up so high because there is more \ndemand than there is supply. The world is demanding more energy, \nincluding oil, than it is currently supplying. That is the reason the \nprice has been going up. That is the reason prices will continue on \ntheir upward trend over the next\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\nseveral years, unless we bring more supplies. I would like more of \nthose supplies to be right here in America. I think that is the right \nthing to do. It is good from a national security standpoint, from an \neconomic security standpoint, and it is good for the pocketbooks of \nordinary Americans across our country.\n  I call on my colleagues to look at a comprehensive approach that \nwould include renewables, more conservation, and looking for more \nAmerican energy in the form of oil and natural gas. It is the right \nthing to do for the American people.\n  It is time for us to act and to quit playing more politics. The motto \non the Republican side has been to ``find more and use less.'' Well, \nthe only way we are going to be able to do that, frankly, is for the \nDemocrats to talk less and start voting more. We need to have \namendments that are fully debatable on the Senate floor, because there \nare answers out there. There are no silver bullets, but in a \ncomprehensive approach, we can have answers to bring down the cost of \ngasoline in the United States.\n  Let's join together as Republicans and Democrats and act for the good \nof the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n           One-Year Anniversary of the I-35W Bridge Collapse\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, tomorrow at 6:05 p.m. Minnesota time, \nit will be exactly 1 year since the horrific collapse of the I-35W \nbridge. It is a day and a moment when all Minnesotans will always \nremember where they were. They will remember what they were doing, they \nwill remember what they heard, and they will remember the pictures. \nMinnesotans will even remember the weather and what it was like that \nday because as if to symbolize what was to come, that warm summer day \nstarted with clear skies, but by late afternoon, dark and ominous storm \nclouds had begun forming on the horizon, with thunder rumbling in the \ndistance. Then after the bridge collapsed, as if to provide relief for \nthe rescuers, the storms retreated.\n  I know many people across America will also remember that day, and \nthey will think about those who died and those who survived, \nmiraculously, on that bridge.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate will also remember. I thank each \nand every one of them for their tremendous sympathy and concern for the \npeople of my State following the bridge collapse. On behalf of all \nMinnesotans, I wish to say how grateful we are for the bipartisan \nsupport in the days after that bridge collapse, the immediate funding \nfor emergency relief, and then the funding for the bridge so that \nbridge could be built again.\n  This support from the Senate and the Congress helped lay the \ngroundwork for the fast and efficient reconstruction of the bridge. In \nfact, a new bridge already spans the river. It is expected that by the \nend of the year, possibly within the next month or two, cars and trucks \nwill again be crossing over the Mississippi River on the newly \nconstructed 35W bridge. My home is only 6 blocks away. So my family and \nI look forward to, once again, driving across the 35W bridge.\n  Not only in Congress but across the Nation, the catastrophic failure \nof this bridge provoked deep concern that it might not be an isolated \nincident, that there might be a broader problem with bridges across the \ncountry. That is because a bridge should not fall down in the middle of \nAmerica on the 1st day of August in 2007, especially not an eight-lane \ninterstate highway, especially not one of the most heavily traveled \nbridges in the State, especially not during rush hour, in the heart of \na major metropolitan area.\n  But on August 1 of last year, the 35W bridge in Minneapolis fell \ndown. So tomorrow, 1 year later, we remember the 13 people who lost \ntheir lives on that bridge, and we remember the 145 people who were \ninjured, many of them now living with serious and permanent injuries.\n  Tomorrow we also remember the many people--the police officers, the \nfirefighters, the paramedics, the citizen bystanders who risked their \nlives by running toward that catastrophe and not away from it.\n  When I watched what unfolded that night, I was shocked and horrified. \nBut as the evening wore on and the days went by, the entire world \nwatched our State come together, and I was proud to be a Minnesotan.\n  We saw the heroes. We saw them in the face of unimaginable \ncircumstances. We saw the off-duty Minnesota firefighter, Shanna \nHanson, who grabbed her lifejacket. She was off duty, but she was among \nthe first on the scene. She was tethered to a yellow life rope and she \nwas in the midst of broken concrete and shards as she swam from car to \ncar, in and out, in and out of that river searching for survivors.\n\n  We saw a school bus perched precariously on the falling bridge deck. \nI like to call it the ``Miracle Bus,'' perched on that falling bridge \ndeck, on the side, ready to fall in. Inside were dozens of kids from a \nMinneapolis neighborhood who had been on a swimming field trip. Their \nbus was crossing the bridge when it collapsed. Thanks to the quick \naction of responsible adults and the kids themselves, they all \nsurvived.\n  Now, with the perspective of a year, what can we learn from this \ncatastrophe? Well, first, the emergency response to the bridge collapse \ndemonstrated an impressive level of preparedness that should be a model \nfor the Nation. You can never feel good about a tragedy such as this, \nbut I do feel good about our police officers, our firefighters, our \nparamedics, and our first responders. Look at the scene they came upon, \nthis enormous eight-lane highway in the middle of the water, a storm \nabove them, and they dove into that water and literally saved hundreds \nof people.\n  This week, the Hennepin County Medical Center, located only blocks \nfrom the bridge, was honored with a national award for extraordinary \nresponse to this crisis. As the Hennepin County attorney for 8 years, I \nremember meeting with the sheriff, the police chief, and other \nofficials as we planned and practiced for disaster relief drills after \n9/11. Even though no one imagined a major bridge would collapse, the \nresult of all that planning and the preparation was evident on the \nnight of August 1 when our survivors were quickly rushed to the \nhospital.\n  Second, we saw how important it was to move forward and build a new, \nsafe bridge, and I will show you the bridge as it stands 1 year later. \nAgain, it is 6 blocks from my house, so I have been able to watch its \nprogress. You can see this bridge now. The last piece actually was just \nadded, and it is spanning this huge river, the Mississippi River. It is \nan eight-lane highway.\n  So what happened in Washington? In 3 days, the Senate voted to \nprovide $250 million in emergency bridge construction funding. \nRepresentative Jim Oberstar led the way in the House, and it was a \nbipartisan effort in the Senate as Senator Coleman and I worked \ntogether on the relief.\n  I personally thank Senator Durbin and Senator Patty Murray for \nassisting me with this. I still remember the day the Senate voted for a \nbillion dollars for bridge reconstruction across the country, but it \ndidn't include the funding for our bridge. I came in early, and I sat \nat my desk, and I said I wasn't going to leave until we got our \namendment to fund the construction on our bridge. The pages and the \nchaplain came in, and the Senate was starting, and Senator Durbin came \nand sat next to me and he said: Somehow I think you are here to do more \nthan pray. He helped me, and we got that amendment through and we got \nit passed.\n  Approval of this funding came with remarkable speed and \nbipartisanship. Capitol Hill veterans tell us it was a rare feat to get \nit done so quickly.\n  What else can we learn from this bridge? Third, we must still get to \nthe bottom of why this enormous bridge fell into the middle of the \nMississippi River. It didn't happen because of a barge or some kind of \nelectrical storm or tornado. It just fell down. Evidence is \naccumulating that the bridge's condition had been deteriorating for \nyears\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\nand that it had been the subject of growing concern within the \nMinnesota Department of Transportation. This wasn't a bridge over \ntroubled waters, this was a troubled bridge over waters. Still, as a \nformer prosecutor, I know we must wait until all the facts and evidence \nare in before we reach a verdict. We will need to be patient as the \ninvestigation continues.\n  Mark Rosenker, the Chairman of the NTSB, the National Transportation \nSafety Board, said the other day that the NTSB investigation is nearing \ncompletion and that a final report should be ready for public release \nwithin 100 days. Already, the NTSB has publicly released a number of \ndocuments, photographs, diagrams, and other evidence that are part of \ntheir investigation. We know this bridge had problems, and we look \nforward to the NTSB report to give us definitive answers.\n  Finally, the bridge collapse in Minnesota has shown us that America \nneeds to come to grips with the broader questions about our \ndeteriorating infrastructure. The Minnesota bridge disaster shocked \nAmericans into a realization of how important it is to invest in safe, \nstrong, and sound infrastructure.\n  As if we didn't know already, Minnesotans got a reminder a few months \nafter the 35W bridge collapsed, because we learned another bridge of a \nsimilar design was inspected and found to be in serious trouble. That \nbridge is in St. Cloud, MN, a major regional city in central Minnesota, \nwhich is now closed with plans to replace it.\n  Unfortunately, it took a disaster to put this issue of infrastructure \nsquarely on the agenda of this Congress. According to the Federal \nHighway Administration, more than 25 percent of the Nation's 600,000 \nbridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. \nThat is more than 150,000 bridges. When 25 percent of all American \nbridges are in need of serious repair or replacement, it is time to \nact.\n  When we don't have enough money to build new bridges or repair the \nones we already have, there is clearly a problem with our priorities. \nAnd when the American people question the integrity of the bridges they \ncross every day, we must act. Putting it all together with the bridge \ncollapse in Minnesota, this should be a national call to action on \ninfrastructure.\n  Senator Durbin and I recently introduced the National Bridge \nReconstruction and Inspection Act. This legislation has already passed \nthe House and we hope it will move quickly in the Senate. This is only \na start, but it is a good start, if the Senate will pass it and the \nPresident will sign it. I am hopeful it will get us headed in the right \ndirection.\n  In closing, I note one final lesson. What happened a year ago in \nMinnesota reminds us that disasters can bring out the worst or the best \nin people. They can divide us or they can unite us. I believe the \ncatastrophe, the collapse of the I-35W bridge, brought out the very \nbest in Minnesotans and it united us. We joined together for the \nrescue, we joined together for the recovery, and we joined together for \nthe rebuilding. I hope that going forward the ultimate legacy of the \n35W bridge collapse can be something positive for our Nation. I hope it \ncan bring out the best in all Americans and unite us as we address the \npressing infrastructure issues facing our country.\n  Tomorrow, as we remember and as we grieve for the bridge victims and \ntheir families, let us also look ahead and move forward and take the \naction necessary to make sure that no bridge ever again falls down in \nthe middle of America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, how much time remains in this half-hour \nallocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes remain on the Democratic time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I came expecting to be recognized at \n12:10, so I think what I will do, I believe my colleague from Minnesota \napparently is seeking time as well. I assume my colleague from \nMinnesota is seeking time in the second half-hour allotted; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I am seeking time to follow on the \nremarks of my colleague from Minnesota reflecting on the collapse of \nthe bridge, but I will defer to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Madam President, how much time is left in the majority's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes for the majority.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me, in the spirit of allowing the \ntwo Senators from Minnesota to be able to complete their discussion of \nthe bridge collapse, which is truly a tragedy, let me ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Minnesota be recognized for that 8-minute \nperiod, and that the majority side be allowed to claim 8 minutes in the \nnext half-hour, if that is what the Senator is suggesting.\n  The next half-hour belongs to the minority. If the Senator wishes to \nagree to a unanimous consent request that our side use 8 minutes in the \nnext half-hour, I would be happy to have him go now.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. No objection, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I first thank and applaud my colleague \nfor the leadership she has shown in dealing with the challenges this \nNation faces on infrastructure. We need to do something about it. She \nmoved forward aggressively after the bridge collapse, and I joined her \nand applaud her for those efforts.\n  Like everyone who suffers loss, the people of Minnesota have come to \na tragic anniversary, a hole in the calendar where we confront the pain \nof our past. Friday, at 6:05 p.m., we commemorate the moment when the \nI-35W bridge collapsed, taking the lives of 13, injuring hundreds, and \ndisrupting the lives of untold thousands.\n  I have a few words to share as we observe this first memorial.\n  So much of what Minnesota was, is, and will become is tied to our \nrivers and bridges. Before the roads and the railroads, rivers were \nMinnesota's fluid highways through difficult terrain. European \nsettlement followed the rivers. Because of Minnesota's unique \ngeography, our rivers flow out toward all the points of the compass, \nwhich is why we call ourselves ``The Headwaters State.''\n  But rivers can be barriers as well as thoroughfares, so towns and \ncities grew up around bridges which allowed people to move \nperpendicular to the river flows. More than a century later, we are a \nState of river towns and bridge towns.\n  That is why the I-35W bridge collapse was so significant humanly and \nspiritually to Minnesotans. It fell not far from the Falls of St. \nAnthony, the head of navigation of one of the world's great rivers. It \nfell where Father Louis Hennepin became the first European to look on \nthe area which comprises Minneapolis today. It fell where huge early \n19th century flour mills, textile mills, lumber processors, and \nrailroad terminals met to create an economic boom which put Minnesota \non the map. It fell at the heart of our heartland.\n  It has been said that adversity doesn't create character, but it \nsurely does reveal it. We witnessed that in the days following August \n1, and it continues to this hour. Preparation is a virtue, and our Twin \nCities learned the valuable lesson of 9/11, that we have to get ready \nfor the unthinkable. When it happened to us, there was an \nextraordinarily well-coordinated response from law enforcement, medical \ninstitutions, and other first responders. The speed and professionalism \nof their actions are a textbook case of emergency response.\n  We also experienced amazing spontaneous acts of heroism. It is our \nnatural instinct to run from pain and danger, and on this occasion, \nhundreds of regular Minnesotans ran toward the pain and toward the \ndanger and saved many lives. In the days following the disaster, the \n364 days preceding today, we have seen an unprecedented unity of effort \namong all branches of government and levels of government, without \nregard to party or position. Our single goal has been to raise a new \nbridge over our old river that we can be proud of and that we can \ntrust, as the pictures shown by my colleague from Minnesota reflect. \nOur goal has also been to care for those who have been injured, and we \nhave done that.\n  But this is a day to remember those who have been lost: Greg Joldstad \nof\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\nfar northern Kanabec County, a construction worker on the bridge; \nSadiya Sahal, her daughter Hana, and her unborn child; Paul Eickstadt \nof Mounds View, 10 miles north of the bridge; Vera Peck and her son \nRichard Chit, who had an inseparable bond; Scott Sathers, a young \nhusband of Minneapolis; Peter Hausman, a computer security specialist; \nChristina Sacorafas, of White Bear Lake; Julia Blackhawk of Savage, MN, \n10 miles south of the bridge; Patrick Holms, also from Mounds View; \nSherry Engebretsen, a wife, mom, and businesswoman from Shoreview; and \nArtemio Trinidad-Mena of Minneapolis.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence and reflection \nin their honor.\n  (Moment of silence observed.)\n  Madam President, sometimes a meaningful silence is the only answer.\n  I conclude with the ancient words I have prayed many times this last \nyear, the Hebrew Kaddish, prayed by Jewish mourners for centuries. It \nends as follows:\n\n       May there be abundant peace from Heaven and life upon us \n     all and upon all Israel, now say amen. He who makes peace in \n     his heights, may he make peace upon us all and upon his \n     Nation, Israel. Now say amen.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, we may be hours or a day away from \nadjourning for the August recess. At the same time, many of us have \nsaid there is no more important issue for this Senate to be dealing \nwith than the issue of energy and the price of gas at the pump. For the \nlast year, the American consumer has gone through increasing price \nshocks as they have seen more and more of their family budget left at \nthe service station or gas station every time they fill the family car. \nFirst it was $15, then $20, then $25, then $30, $40, $50, and in some \ninstances now and in certain locations $60 to fill the family car. If \nthat family car is also the vehicle in which they commute to their \nworkplace and they have to fill it several times a week, it has become \na dramatic hit on the American family in a way that has now clearly \nregistered in polling across our country and in what we are hearing \nevery day in our phone calls coming in from those distressed Americans \nout there who are paying more for energy than they ever have before.\n  That is just one side of the energy equation. Our whole world, our \nwhole economy runs on energy. The cost of that energy in that economy \nhas to be felt--whether it is in the heating of the home or the \nprocessing, manufacturing, or growing of food. All segments of our \neconomy feed on energy and feed, basically, on gas or hydrocarbons that \nare reduced into gas and diesel and oil and plastics and the refining \nof energy. All of them have also become factors for which the average \nAmerican--and certainly the average Idahoan--is paying now at a higher \nprice than they have ever paid.\n  In my great open Western State of Idaho, we travel long distances. \nThe majority of our people do not live downtown, don't live in the \nsuburbs. They live out in the countryside. Going to town is a trip that \nis not unusual to rack up 50, 60, 70, 80 miles. I grew up on a ranch \nthat was 30 miles from the nearest community. It was not unrealistic, \nwhen my mother went to town to acquire groceries or do the family \nshopping, to travel 60 or 70 or 80 miles in one round trip. That still \ngoes on today in many of our Western States. So the cost for that \nfamily has gone up dramatically, also, simply by the character of where \nwe live.\n  Yet, for the last 2 weeks, in an effort to try to deal with this \nissue on the floor of the Senate by allowing the offering of amendments \nthat would in many ways cause production to begin once again in this \ncountry in locations where we know oil exists today but they have been \ntaken off limits for political reasons--in that debate over the last 2 \nweeks, the leadership, the Democratic Party, the majority leader has \nstopped us from doing so on at least six different occasions.\n  Why, I am not sure--why any leadership of the great Senate would stop \nthis Senate from doing what the American consumer and the American \nvoter are asking for is largely beyond me. I could speculate--and I \nhave, on numerous occasions, in speeches on the floor over the last \nseveral weeks, as have my colleagues. But one thing is clear: On six \noccasions, the majority leader, the Democratic leader, has said: No, we \nwill not proceed to offer amendments to allow or to cause this country \nto become once again a producing nation.\n  Now we are about ready to try a seventh time. I am told that on the \nDefense Authorization Act, cloture has been filed. That is a procedure \nwe use here in the Senate ultimately to force a vote on whether we will \nproceed to go to Defense authorization. We could vote on that today if \nwe all agreed or we could vote on it tomorrow, as the cloture motion \nripens--the term we use here in the Senate when all time has run out. I \nknow what our vote is going to be. As important as Defense \nauthorization is, we are going to say no. There is something even more \nimportant today to every American than that Defense authorization; that \nis, the price of energy at the pump which is literally sucking the \nfamily budget dry.\n  What do we do? My guess is we are going to adjourn for the August \nrecess having done nothing. Every Senator here is going to go home. I \nhope they go home to explain to their voters and to their State why \nthey would not vote for increased production; why they will not allow \nthis great country of ours to get in the business of producing energy \nonce again.\n  The President has responded. He removed the moratoria he had placed \non Outer Continental Shelf drilling. Prices dropped a little as a \nresult of that. Yesterday, the Interior Department initiated a 5-year \noil and gas leasing program for the OCS. They are preparing, if we act, \nto expedite and allow these areas in which we believe production can go \non to go on there sooner. We have heard the argument here on the floor \nthat it is 5 or 6 or 7 years away. No, it is not. In many areas, it \ncould be as short as 2 or 3 years. And the anticipation of coming into \nthe market in 2 or 3 years, in nearly everyone's opinion who \nunderstands oil markets--they would tell you it would bring the price \nof that product down now in the market.\n  The price already is coming down--not because of our actions but \nbecause of a beleaguered consumer out there who simply cannot afford \nthe price anymore. That consumer and his or her family are already \nmaking decisions to shrink their travel and shrink their gas budgets. \nThey are doing so.\n  In the last 4 months comparable to the 4 months of a year ago, the \nAmerican family has driven 40 billion fewer miles. They didn't want to, \nthey didn't want to alter their lifestyle, but they did. The reason \nthey did is they just simply did not have the money to go forward. The \nprice began to drop. Across America today, the gas price in many States \nhas now dropped below $4 a gallon.\n  You see the marketplace is out there, and what we have said about \nsupply and demand is true in the market even though here in the Senate \nthe action to deny production is to deny that the marketplace exists. \nWhat is going on today across America is living proof that market \nexists.\n  What can we do? If we were able to act as we have asked our majority \nleader here in the Senate to allow us to do, we could gain access to \nwhat we believe is about 30 billion barrels of known oil reserves in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. We think there is an additional 85 billion \nbarrels of undiscovered resources out there, simply, if we are allowed \nto explore and develop the resources we know are there that are off \nlimits today--if.\n  If I were allowed to offer an amendment, here is the amendment I \nwould offer. I would go to what we call the eastern gulf that is now \noff limits and I would say: 50 miles out from the shoreline along \nFlorida in the eastern gulf, this would be open for leases. We believe \nthere are over 2 billion barrels of oil out there and trillions of \ncubic feet of gas. Right across here are the pipelines and the \ninfrastructure we could connect to, which would go into\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nthe refining areas in Louisiana and Texas.\n  Doesn't that make sense? Even Floridians who once said: No, we do not \nwant any drilling, are now by their latest polling saying: Yes, we do, \nbecause we, too, are going broke at the pump. We want an opportunity to \ndo so.\n  Of course, what Floridians know is that if oil is discovered here, \nthey will share in the money that comes from it, and that can go into \ntheir educational programs and their State budgets and potentially \nreduce the tax burden on the average Floridian, along with bringing the \nprice of gas down at the pumps in Florida.\n  I have offered that amendment. I filed that amendment at the desk. \nYet the majority leader of the Senate has said no, that amendment will \nnot be offered.\n  Ultimately, it will be offered. Ultimately, someday the voter is \ngoing to say: We have had enough of this. We are not going to stand by \nand let the Senate of the United States block us from the resources \nthat are ours as a nation, that need to be developed, that can bring \nthe price of energy down.\n  It is a pretty simple equation and, as many of us have said, this is \nan interim solution. Many of us have called it a bridge to the future. \nThe Energy Policy Act we passed in 2005, and the new Energy Policy Act \nwe passed in 2007, already the Senate of the United States was \nrecognizing that the day of a nation living exclusively on oil as a \nform of transportation energy was a day that would ultimately end and \nthat we would invest in hybrids and electric-powered cars and new \ntechnologies.\n  I am very proud, in my State of Idaho, that, in part, we have led \nthose kinds of technologies in our national energy laboratory in Idaho \nFalls. Hydrogen cars and hydrogen initial combustion vehicles and full-\nsized electric cars have been experimented with and are being developed \nat that laboratory and in other facilities across the Nation.\n  But that is not going to be available tomorrow. It takes billions of \ndollars and 10 or 15 years for a lot of this new technology to come \nonline and be available to the American consumer. So do we sit idly by \nand allow the family budget to be drained away? Do we sit idly by and \nbuy from foreign nations the billions of barrels of oil we currently \nbuy from them and pay $1.2 billion a day to a foreign nation and drain \nnot only our family budgets dry but our national treasure?\n  It is a phenomenal dilemma we have put ourselves in. As you note, I \nused the word ``we'' put ourselves in because it is folks on the floor \nof the Senate and the House of Representatives across the Rotunda from \nus who have put these properties off-limits, who have put Alaska's oil \noff-limits, all in the name of the environment.\n  We caused this crisis, and American families now know it. Eighty \npercent of American families and consumers out there are saying: \nCongress, fix it. For 3 weeks we have been on the floor trying to do \nthat, and every time we try it, we are denied that opportunity in the \nraw name of politics.\n  Well, we are about to go home. I hope in the raw name of politics, \nAmerica's voters rise and say to their politicians: Go back to \nWashington and do your work and do it in a way that allows this great \nNation of ours to once again become a producing Nation, not just a \nconsuming Nation.\n  We know the resources are there. Our national geologic survey says \nthey are there. We know they are there because they have been put off-\nlimits in the name of the environment years ago when gas was cheap. But \nmany of us who have worked in this area for a long while said the day \nwould come when there would be a break point and no longer would \nAmerica be sitting with cheap energy available in an unlimited way. \nThat day is here.\n  Yet, politically, we are bound up. We cannot move. I guess we will \nnow not move to do what we ought to be doing for the American consumer, \nacting and allowing these resources to become available so we can \ndevelop them in a safe and clean environmental way for the American \nconsumers to use.\n  This is a challenge for all of us, but it is a challenge we are \ncapable of meeting if we simply surpass the politics of the moment and \nget on with the business of this great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, are we in morning business at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed to S. 3001, \nand the minority side has the 10 minutes until 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that I might use a portion of \nthat 10 minutes to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Honoring Korean War Veterans\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this week our Nation, and indeed nations \nthroughout the world, paid our reverence to the men and women of a past \ngeneration who fought so valiantly to provide freedom for the Southern \nportion of the Korean Peninsula. They fought under the Commander In \nChief at that time, President Harry Truman, a courageous man.\n  It has been 55 years since that conflict. Today, the Senate Armed \nServices Committee held an extensive hearing on the current status of \nthe Korean Peninsula, most specifically the progress we are making, in \nmy judgment, with respect to North Korea.\n  I played a very modest role in that war as a young Marine Lieutenant, \nfor a period, 1951-1952, but my contribution and participation is of \nlittle consequence when you look at the extensive casualties our Nation \ntook in that conflict.\n  The total deaths were 36,574, the total wounded over 100,000, and 1.7 \nmillion-plus men and women in the Armed Forces were in and out of that \ntheater to preserve freedom.\n  Today, South Korea is a flourishing nation, one with a very strong \neconomy. It ranks, I think, 11th worldwide. It is a partner in world \naffairs in terms of its strategic importance and, clearly, a \nparticipant in trying to secure freedom for others on that historic \npeninsula.\n  I do hope, as the Senate begins to finish its work prior to the \nAugust recess, the Chamber will consider the nomination, which I \nunderstand is pending, of Kathy Stevens, a career diplomat of many \nyears who has been nominated to become the new Ambassador to South \nKorea.\n  I had the privilege of visiting with her, and I certainly felt that, \nin every respect, she is eminently qualified to take this important \npost.\n  I wish to thank Ambassador Hill this morning, because he addressed a \nnumber of issues, most notably the question of the deprivation of basic \nhuman rights by North Korea to so many of its citizens. I support \nAmbassador Hill in his endeavor, and colleagues on both sides who, in \nthe course of the hearing this morning, expressed our concerns about \nthe human rights of individuals in North Korea and the environs. \nSenator Brownback, an internationally recognized spokesman on behalf of \nhuman rights, took an active role in today's hearing.\n  I wish to note that Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin from \nMaryland, Congressman Steny Hoyer, and I met with a group of Korean war \nveterans who came to the Hill to talk, to memorialize the sacrifices of \nso many of their fellow service persons of that generation.\n  I am so humbled and privileged to have had that very modest, brief, \ntour of service with that generation. My service was inconsequential \ncompared to the extensive loss of life and limb by others during this \nconflict.\n  But I do urge America not to forget those who served in Korea. The \nwar is often referred to as the ``forgotten war.'' But they laid the \nfoundation for the current freedoms in South Korea. Indeed, Harry \nTruman's decision to stop the spread of communism on that peninsula \nsaved other small nations in the region. Today, those countries might \nnot have the freedoms, they now have, had it not been for the \nsacrifices of the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, and other \nnations fighting under the ``banner'' of the United Nations \nOrganization.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Honoring Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, a few days ago the Birmingham, AL, \nairport announced plans to rename the Birmingham International Airport \nafter Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth.\n  I rise to honor the work of activist, legendary civil rights leader, \nthe Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. For more than 60 years, Reverend \nShuttlesworth has fought passionately for racial equality and social \njustice in our great country.\n  Born in Birmingham, AL, Reverend Shuttlesworth became involved in the \ncivil rights movement as a young pastor. He organized sit-ins and \nboycotts. He challenged the injustice for decades of Birmingham's Jim \nCrow laws, despite attempts on his life, and there were many by the Ku \nKlux Klan.\n  In spite of repeated arrests, attacks by police dogs and firehoses, \nReverend Shuttlesworth simply refused to back down. In 1957, Reverend \nShuttlesworth joined the efforts with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and \nRalph Abernathy to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. \nMembers of the SCLC fought side by side to increase educational \nopportunities, to promote voter registration, and to promoting equality \nof opportunity for African Americans throughout the country.\n  In 1961, Reverend Shuttlesworth took up the pastorate of Revelation \nBaptist Church in Cincinnati, OH, and continued his campaign for racial \njustice.\n  Bringing the same fearless opposition to segregation he had displayed \nin Birmingham, he joined forces with other Black ministers to make \nWilliam Lovelace the city's first African-American judge.\n  For greater than a half century, Reverend Shuttlesworth spoke out \nagainst injustice. He has worked to increase minority representation in \ncity government, he has expanded minority hiring by the local police \ndepartment, and worked to improve access to housing in Over-the-Rhine, \nan area of Cincinnati, for needy families and throughout Hamilton \nCounty.\n  Reverend Shuttlesworth has made great personal sacrifice, risking his \nlife, risking his own health and the health of his family, so every \nAmerican, without regard to race, would have access to equal \nopportunity to succeed.\n  I announced my campaign for the Senate in 2005 at the church of \nReverend Shuttlesworth in Cincinnati. I consider him a friend. I have \nmet him many times over the last 15 or so years. He took me one day to \na small room in his church, a room he called a museum. It was a room \ndedicated to the civil rights movement. It had so many wonderful \nexamples of his courage, his bravery, his accomplishments, and the \naccomplishments of so many people he worked with to promote social \njustice, to promote economic justice, to promote civil and human \nrights.\n  For that, I am especially proud of Reverend Shuttlesworth. I am \nespecially proud of the role he plays in Cincinnati, always battling \nfor racial justice. I am proud the Birmingham, AL, airport has named \ntheir international airport after the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have been presiding in the chair \nlistening to some of our friends across the aisle talk about oil and \ngas prices and lamenting that we may go home without taking action. I \nwas blessed to be home yesterday and had the chance to be in rural \nMissouri. I talked to a lot of people who represent the heart of our \ncountry.\n  I will tell my colleagues what they have figured out. They have \nlearned to look beyond everybody talking about this stuff and to figure \nout who wants what. This is simple for the American people. All they \nneed to do is ask about the solutions and who wants them.\n  The Republican Party says there is only one solution. Even with the \n68 million acres they are not touching, they only need to have another \n10 or 20 million acres and our problems are over. Who wants that? Big \noil.\n  What this town has done for decades is give big oil everything it \nwants. This administration has given big oil everything it wants. For \n25 years, big oil has had its way with the Congress. The solution they \nare proposing is, once again, giving big oil its way.\n  I don't know how one can look at today's financial news and not shake \ntheir head. ExxonMobil with $12 billion in profits, announced today, in \nthe last 3 months; $11 billion the quarter before. They want to give \nExxonMobil another tax break, and they want to give ExxonMobil what \nthey want moving forward.\n  It is very simple. We got in this mess because the Republican Party \ncontinues to do the bidding of big oil. We will only get out of this \nmess if we turn our back on big oil and start doing what makes sense \nfor the future. If only we had been willing to say no to big oil in \n2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005, when the Vice President had 40 \nmeetings with big oil executives and one meeting with alternative fuels \npeople.\n  It is time we say no to big oil. America is sick and tired of being \nhandcuffed by the demands of big oil.\n  Democrats say no to big oil. We say yes to getting out from \nunderneath big oil. We do that by extending tax credits for solar and \nwind, to which Republicans keep saying no. Of course, they keep saying \nno to that; big oil doesn't want that. They called big oil. Big oil \nsaid no; they say no.\n  We say: Let's do more alternatives and invest in technologies that \nwill rid us of our dependence on foreign oil. America has 2 or 3 \npercent of the world's oil and she consumes 25 percent. We will never \ndrill our way out of this. The only way we will find relief for the \nAmerican public is to say no to big oil.\n  It is time. They to have muster the courage. The sky will not fall if \nthey will only stand and say, for the first time on that side of the \naisle, no to big oil.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        National Infrastructure\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I come to the floor today to remember the \nterrible tragedy that occurred 1 year ago tomorrow in Minneapolis, MN, \nwhen the bridge carrying Interstate 35W over the Mississippi River near \ndowntown Minneapolis abruptly collapsed during the evening rush hour. \nAt least 50 vehicles plunged some 60 feet into the Mississippi River, \nkilling 13 people and injuring dozens more.\n  As we approach the anniversary of this devastating event, my thoughts \nand prayers and those, I know, of all our colleagues are with the \nvictims and their families, with Senator Klobuchar, our colleague, \nSenator Coleman, Representative Ellison, whose district the bridge is \nin, and all those affected by this terrible tragedy.\n  The people of my own State of Connecticut can sympathize in a direct \nway with the people of Minnesota, as they prepare to remember: 25 years \nago, a bridge carrying Interstate 95--the main thoroughfare along the \neast coast of the United States--over the Mianus River in Greenwich, \nCT, abruptly collapsed in the early afternoon. Four vehicles plunged \ninto the Mianus River, three people lost their lives, and others \nsustained serious injuries. It remains one of the worst transportation \ndisasters in my small State's history.\n  The tragedy in Minnesota is the most recent example of our national \ninfrastructure crumbling before our very eyes. Indeed, this is not a \nproblem that only affects Minneapolis or Connecticut or--in the case of \nlast year's steampipe eruption--New York City. These are problems \naffecting every single State, every single county, every single \ncommunity in our Nation from San Diego, CA, to Bangor, ME.\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\n  For far too long, we have taken all our infrastructure systems--our \nroads, bridges, mass transit systems, drinking water systems, \nwastewater systems, public housing properties--for granted. For far too \nlong, we have failed to invest adequately in their long-term \nsustainability. Today, we find ourselves in a precarious position \nconcerning their future viability--a precarious position that is \ncosting lives and jeopardizing the high quality of life we have come to \nenjoy and expect as American citizens.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that 152,000 of the \nNation's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally \nobsolete. Put another way, one out of every four bridges in our Nation \nis in a state of serious disrepair. The American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials estimates it would cost some $140 \nbillion just to repair the 152,000 bridges that are in that condition.\n  The life-threatening problems are not confined to bridges. The \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that \napproximately 14,000 Americans die each year, at least in part, because \nour roads and bridges are no longer up to the task.\n  Congestion on our highways causes tons of carbon dioxide and other \npollutants to be pumped into the atmosphere every day. These emissions \ncompromise the health of children and adults and contribute to global \nwarming, which poses immense risks to the future of all of us. This \ncongestion on our highways stems from the absence of mass transit \nsystems or other adequate means to move people.\n  Tens of millions of Americans receive drinking water in their homes \nevery day from pipes that are, on average, over 100 years old. In our \nNation's capital city, in the area of Georgetown--one of the city's \nmost affluent neighborhoods--wastewater is still conveyed through \nwooden sewage pipes constructed in the 19th century.\n  In the city of Milwaukee, over 400,000 people were sickened several \nyears ago with flu-like symptoms caused by a strain of bacteria in the \nmunicipal drinking water system of that community. The bacteria strain \nwas eventually linked to inadequate treatment of the drinking water.\n  It is not just our health and safety that is affected by our \ncrumbling infrastructure; in fact, our national prosperity is at stake. \nFrom the days of the Roman aqueducts to the present, a nation's ability \nto grow and prosper has always relied upon its ability to effectively \nmove people, goods, and information.\n  Ask any American today how we are doing in achieving this objective, \nand chances are the response would be the same: We are not doing very \nwell, and we could be doing substantially better.\n  When the average American spends 51.5 hours a year--more than 2 full \ndays of one's life, per year--stuck in traffic congestion, then I think \nwe can do better. When one out of three of our roads is in poor, \nmediocre, or fair condition, then I think all of us would agree we can \ndo better. When the United States invests less than 2 percent of its \ngross domestic product on infrastructure, while nations such as China \nand India--the major competitors of this country in the 21st century--\ninvest between 7 and 12 percent, then I think all of us recognize we \nneed to do better or we are going to find our country in a very \nweakened position very quickly. Infrastructure is not something you can \ncorrect overnight. The investments need to be made. It takes time to do \nit right. We are almost to the second decade of this century, and we \nremain way behind in this area.\n\n  Tomorrow is also the 1-year anniversary of the introduction of the \nNational Infrastructure Bank Act that I have offered along with Senator \nChuck Hagel of Nebraska. It is a bipartisan bill that has gained a \nnumber of cosponsors over the last year, and we would like more.\n  The Infrastructure Bank would establish a unique and powerful public-\nprivate partnership to restore our Nation's infrastructure. Using \nlimited Federal resources, it would leverage the significant resources, \nboth at home and abroad, of the private sector. If we don't talk about \nhow we are going to finance this, it is not going to happen.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. We need to come up with a financing mechanism. We all \nunderstand the need for doing this. I think all of us recognize as well \nthat we are not going to talk about doing this out of the \nappropriations process alone. There are not enough resources there to \nmeet the $1.6 trillion currently needed to repair decaying \ninfrastructure. We need a better mechanism to finance this. Senator \nHagel of Nebraska and I have worked with the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, along with Senator \nBob Kerrey, the former Senator of Nebraska; Warren Rudman, the former \nSenator of New Hampshire; Felix Rohatyn, a well-known business \nindividual from New York who is almost certainly responsible for \ngetting New York City back on its feet years ago; and John Hamre, a \nformer official at the Defense Department, and we have constructed a \nmeans by which a limited amount of Federal dollars could attract \nmassive amounts of private capital to allow us to really begin this \nwork.\n  Absent some idea like this--and we think this is a good one--then \nyear after year we can give speeches about our infrastructure, but \nnothing much will happen. This bill is designed to deal with regional \nand national needs, not local ones. We leave those up to the local \nmunicipalities.\n  We need to once again recognize that to grow as a people, to have our \neconomy grow and provide the jobs and fulfill the aspirations and hopes \nof many Americans, we have to grow as well in our capacity to handle \nthat kind of growth. The infrastructure needs of our Nation are \ndaunting.\n  So on this tragic anniversary of the events in Minneapolis and the \nreminder of what occurred in my own State, as well as the recognition \nof what is occurring every single day all across our Nation, my hope \nwould be that in the coming Congress, whether we are talking about a \nMcCain administration or an Obama administration, that infrastructure \nwould be a high priority for our country, that we get on that track \ntogether, as Democrats and Republicans, and come up with some creative \nideas on how we can invest in this needed aspect of our economy.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to urge action on what is clearly \nthe single top priority, the single top challenge for American \nfamilies; that is, sky-high gasoline prices and energy prices.\n  In the real world, in every State of the Union, families are \nstruggling with this enormous additional burden. Gasoline prices, the \nprices at the pump--all energy prices have obviously gone through the \nroof in the last several months. Yet, even faced with this true crisis, \neven faced with this outpouring of hurt on the part of the American \npeople and call for action, we are not yet acting. We are not yet \nacting as grownups. We are not yet coming together. We are not yet \nacting on the issue. I urge us to do just that and to simply act in a \nfull, bipartisan, and balanced way on what is clearly the single \nbiggest challenge facing Louisiana and all American families.\n  The good news is that at least there has been an energy-related bill \non the floor of the Senate which has been the pending business that I \nthink goes back to Tuesday, July 22--almost 2 full legislative weeks \nago. The bad news is the distinguished majority leader has blocked all \nattempts to have an open debate and an open amendment process about \nenergy.\n  That bill--his bill--about the limited issue of speculation--and I \nurge us to act on speculation, but we clearly must act on other things \nas well--that speculation-only bill has been the business at hand on \nthe floor of the Senate for almost 2 legislative weeks, and yet we \nhaven't had a single amendment considered, certainly not a single vote \non an amendment. What an enormous lost opportunity. What an enormous \nexample of pure obstructionism in Washington and the sort of gridlock \npeople are sick and tired of when the country truly faces a crisis. \nAmerican families face enormous challenges based on energy prices. We \nneed that real debate.\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\nWe need that open amendment process. We need to act as grownups. We \nneed to come together and act on energy.\n  It is in that vein that I suggest two very specific things. First of \nall, in less than 24 hours, I assume there is going to be some move for \nus to go home for August. I don't think we should until and unless we \ntake some reasonable action on energy. I believe it is a derogation of \nour responsibility to go home for any length of time when this crisis \nis hanging out there and this institution is failing to act. I think we \nshould stay here and work. We should stay here and act in a fair and in \na balanced way.\n  We should consider a host of issues--yes, including speculation, but \nalso fundamental issues that go to supply and demand on both sides of \nthat equation: conservation, yes; greater fuel efficiency, yes; new \ntechnology, yes; renewable sources of energy and alternative sources of \nenergy, yes. Also, we should be doing something on the supply side: \nfinding more here at home and using our resources we do have right here \nat home. So I am against going home, going off on vacation, going on \nthe August recess--however you want to put it--when we are not acting \non the top priority and concern of the American people.\n  Secondly, I certainly oppose moving off this topic, which has been \nwhat the distinguished majority has tried to get us to do over and over \nagain. We will have an upcoming vote--his latest attempt to get us off \nthis topic. He has filed a motion to invoke cloture to proceed to the \nDefense authorization bill. Defense is an extremely important issue, \nparticularly in this time of war and terrorist threat. However, I can \ntell my colleagues the reaction the American people have to this choice \nof energy versus Defense authorization. They have the same reaction I \nhave: Staying on energy, acting on energy in a meaningful, bold, \npositive, balanced way, is the single most important thing we can do to \nimprove our security, to improve our defenses. Quite frankly, that is \nfar more important for national security and for defense than any \nDefense authorization bill. So surely we should reject that attempt to \nmove off the subject to take this vote and move to the Defense \nauthorization bill when the single biggest issue that not only faces \nAmerican families and hits their pocketbooks but also the single \nbiggest national security issue is energy.\n  So, again, I urge us to reject that attempt once again to move off \nthe subject. We need to stay on energy but, more importantly, we need \nto act on energy. We need to reject that cloture vote. I urge us to \nstay here and work and act rather than go off on any August recess. We \nmust address this crucial energy issue.\n  As so many of my colleagues, I have important amendments on the \ntopic. I specifically filed seven amendments. Those amendments address \na number of key issues and a number of key questions, but they are \nbalanced. They are not just about drilling because we can't just drill \nour way out of the problem. They have us use less and find more at the \nsame time. That is exactly the sort of balanced approach we need, as I \nsaid a few minutes ago. Yes, use less. Yes to conservation. Yes to \ngreater efficiency standards. Yes to new technology. Yes to renewables. \nYes to biofuels. Yes to alternative fuels. Also, at the same time, yes \nto accessing greater supply right here at home, to accessing that \nenergy we have here offshore, in Western States in shale deposits and \nelsewhere, to help ourselves rather than have to go beg, hat in hand, \nto Middle Eastern countries to cut us a break. We need to do all of the \nabove. We need to act on the demand side and the supply side to \nstabilize, bring down prices, and help American families with this, \ntheir top challenge and their top concern.\n\n  I have seven amendments. Unfortunately, under the rules of the game \nthat the distinguished majority leader has laid out, I haven't come \nnear any opportunity to call any of those amendments up, and certainly \nI have not been able to have a vote on those amendments. The majority \nleader at one point offered four votes on the entire issue; none of \nthem would have been on my amendments. He then rescinded that offer, so \nwe are back to an offer of zero amendments and zero amendment votes.\n  Let's get serious about a serious challenge facing American families. \nLet's not only be on the topic on the Senate floor--so what. Let's act \non it in a grownup way, in a bipartisan way, in a balanced way, \naddressing supply and demand, using less and finding more right here at \nhome. Let's take up not just my amendments but any good ideas for \ndebate and consideration and votes, and let's act on the single \ngreatest challenge facing Louisiana families whom I represent and \nAmerican families across the Nation. Surely we shouldn't vote to move \nto any other topic when we still have this tremendous challenge not \nacted upon.\n  I think we shouldn't run home for the August recess to vacation or \neven to talk with our constituents when this enormously important \npending business is not acted upon. Let's stay here. Let's work. Let's \ncome together. Let's act for the American people. It is perfectly \nobvious to them that this is our greatest national challenge. This is \ntheir greatest personal and family challenge as they try to live their \nreal lives in the real world. We have to get that message and act on it \nhere in Congress.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, the Federal Government has more acronyms \nfor more Federal agencies that produce more economic statistics than \nanyone can reasonably be expected to comprehend in a single sitting. We \nhave the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis--just to name a few.\n  These agencies produce a wealth of information that we use to inform \nour policy decisions with facts and expert analysis; but I often find \nthat the best advice I get on matters of public policy comes not from \nthese experts and their reports, but from the wisdom and sincerity of \nNorth Carolinians who write to me.\n  I received a letter recently that I think gets to the heart of our \nenergy debate here in the Senate. It comes from a retiree who is living \non a fixed income from his life savings, who resides in Lake Junaluska, \nNorth Carolina, a picturesque mountain town of 3,000 situated on a \npristine mountain lake. I used to go to church camp there almost every \nsummer when I was growing up.\n  ``Too much energy,'' the letter reads, ``has gone into rhetoric and \nnot enough into actually doing something about it. We have so many \nbrilliant leaders and the ability to make major transformations, so \nlet's concentrate on action and do whatever it takes to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.''\n  My friend from Lake Junaluska is right. Indeed, too much energy in \nthis energy debate has been spent on partisan rhetoric, and not enough \non delivering real solutions to provide Americans with relief from \nthese record high gas prices.\n  Both sides bring important and worthwhile ideas to this debate. On \none side, we see a focus on conservation and cracking down on alleged \nbad behavior in the energy market. On the other side, we hear more \nabout energy exploration.\n  There is no ``silver bullet'' that can solve our energy woes. We need \nevery option on the table. We need to throw everything and the kitchen \nsink at our energy crisis. Conservation. Alternative energy. Energy \nexploration. Market fairness.\n  There is no reason we can't develop a comprehensive strategy that \nincludes the best ideas from both sides of this debate.\n  The bottom line is that high gas prices are driven by too much demand \nand too little supply. Last year, global demand exceeded global supply \nby roughly one million barrels per day. Because of that, families in my \nhome State of North Carolina are having to pay 30 percent more to fill \ntheir tanks than they did just 1 year ago.\n  To truly solve this problem, we have to tackle both the demand side \nand the supply side. We need to find more and use less.\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n  On the demand side, we need to make major investments in alternative \nenergy research and take a crash course in conservation.\n  That is why I introduced legislation last week to repeal roughly $17 \nbillion in tax breaks to oil companies, and pour that funding into \nalternative energy research. With the price per barrel of oil at record \nhighs, the market is providing petroleum producers all the incentive \nthey should need to produce more oil. So, that funding would be better \nspent by investing in alternative sources of energy that are the key to \nour energy future.\n  In the near term, we could also help decrease demand by incentivizing \nthe purchase of hybrid and other clean fuel vehicles with point of sale \nrebates and by investing in better transit systems.\n  While decreasing demand and investing in alternative and renewable \nforms of energy is certainly a necessary part of any comprehensive \nenergy solution, it is by no means sufficient. We cannot simply \nconserve our way to energy independence.\n  We must also increase supply by making better use of America's vast \nenergy resources. We should open up 2,000 out of 19.6 million acres in \nANWR to energy exploration. We should capitalize on our immense oil \nshale reserves, which could produce three times as much oil as Saudi \nArabia's proven reserves. And we should also allow the States decide \nwhether or not to permit offshore energy exploration at least 50 miles \noff their shores on the Outer Continental Shelf, where we could gain \naccess to billions of barrels of oil.\n  Of course, some will argue that bringing these energy resources \nonline will take years to complete, and won't help provide the \nimmediate relief that folks need. But, if anything, that means we \ncannot afford to let another day pass without pursuing them.\n  After all, if President Clinton hadn't vetoed legislation in 1995 to \nallow energy exploration in ANWR, our current energy shortfall would \nalready be reduced by roughly 1 million barrels per day.\n  To provide immediate relief, we can release one-third of the \nstrategic petroleum reserve to inject some much-needed supply into the \nmarkets, which will drive down prices in the near term and send a \nsignal to market speculators that the American Government is dead \nserious about lowering gas prices.\n  Because of enormous and unprecedented economic growth in developing \ncountries like India and China, it is imperative that in this debate we \nkeep our eyes fixed firmly on the ultimate goal of ending our \ndependence on foreign oil altogether. Facing an ever-dwindling global \nsupply of oil and ever-increasing global demand for energy, this is not \na goal or a debate that we can take lightly. When it comes to securing \nAmerica's energy future, partisan politics need not apply.\n  To lower gas prices and reach our ultimate goal of energy \nindependence, we need every option on the table--everything and the \nkitchen sink.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3044\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 92 times this session, which is now in its \n19th month, Senate Republicans have filibustered critical legislation, \neverything and anything to maintain the status quo. Of course, it is an \nall-time record, 92 filibusters. It is more than 100 percent of what \nhas been done in a full Congress--that is 2 years--and this has been \ndone in a year and a half.\n  For those unfamiliar with the language of the Senate, a filibuster is \na stall tactic to give a Senator more time, but it prevents the Senate \nfrom debating legislation. A filibuster is not a ``no'' vote in the \ntrue sense of the word. It is an objection to even having a vote. A \nfilibuster cuts off debate before there can even be a vote. Most \nimportantly, it cuts off negotiation and compromise.\n  Ninety-two times and more than 100 percent than has ever been done \nbefore, Republicans have filibustered America's priorities. Republicans \nhave shown no favoritism on whom their filibusters harm the most. They \nhave filibustered our troops, veterans, children, working families, \nsmall businesses, elderly, disabled, and recently stroke victims, those \nsuffering from paralysis, those suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease. \nThe list is endless. Not a single American has escaped the harm of a \nRepublican filibuster in this, the 110th Congress.\n  Perhaps our country has been most damaged by Republicans blocking us \nfrom addressing the energy crisis. CNN issued the results of a poll \nthey took over a couple days very recently. Here is how the American \npeople feel about major causes of high gas prices:\n  No. 1, U.S. oil companies. Is that any surprise with the record \nprofits being reported today by Exxon?\n  No. 2, foreign oil producers, OPEC mainly.\n  And, of course, speculators.\n  One, oil companies; two, oil producers; three, speculators, and new \ndemand from other countries, and the American people are very \nperceptive. We know there is a tremendous demand from India and China.\n  No. 5, a major cause of higher gas prices, the Bush administration.\n  No. 6, the war in Iraq.\n  So if you only heard the faint outrage of our Republican colleagues, \nyou might think it is the Democrats who spent the past 2 years blocking \nevery effort to lower gas prices and reduce our dependence on oil. But \nthe exact opposite is true. Republicans may talk about high gas prices \nand oil prices today, but they are late to the party and they have \nshown up empty-handed.\n  The one idea they have come up with lately is more coastline \ndrilling. But we all know it won't have any significant impact on \nprices, and some say in more than 20 years. That is according to the \nBush-Cheney administration, which says the change in price will be in \nthe year 2027.\n  Yesterday, in the New York Times and in newspapers all over America, \nthe most syndicated columnist in America, Tom Friedman, wrote as \nfollows:\n\n       Republicans have become so obsessed with the notion that we \n     can drill our way out of the current energy crisis that \n     reopening our coastal waters to offshore drilling has become \n     their answer for every energy question.\n       Anyone who looks at the growth of middle classes around the \n     world and their rising demands for natural resources, plus \n     the dangers of the climate change driven by our addiction to \n     fossil fuels, can see clean renewable energy--wind, solar, \n     nuclear, and stuff we haven't yet invented--is going to be \n     the next great global industry. It has to be if we are going \n     to grow in a stable way.\n\n  Friedman went on to say:\n\n       Therefore, the country that most owns the clean power \n     industry is going to most own the next great technological \n     breakthrough--the ET revolution, the energy technology \n     revolution--and create millions of jobs and thousands of new \n     businesses, just like the IT revolution did.\n       Republicans, by mindlessly repeating their offshore-\n     drilling mantra, focusing on a 19th-century fuel, remind me \n     of someone back in 1980 arguing we should be putting all our \n     money into making more and cheaper IBM Selectric \n     typewriters--and forget about these things called the ``PC'' \n     and ``the Internet.'' It is a strategy for making America a \n     second-rate power and economy.\n\n  He is not only the most well-read and the most well-spread columnist \nin America today but a man who is a prize winner for his best selling \nbooks, and his books are so tremendous because they see the world as it \nis going to be, not as it now is.\n  Their one idea, more coastline drilling, is not the answer. It is no \nwonder Senator McCain said the plan was purely psychological, the \nRepublican plan for more coastal drilling is psychological.\n  This morning we came to the Senate floor. We were going to offer some \nconsent agreements, but the time was inconvenient. I did not want to \nuse leader time and throw off the sequence of time we had. So we are \nhere this afternoon to offer Republicans yet another chance to end \ntheir obstruction and do the right thing. We will offer unanimous \nconsent requests on seven Energy bills, each one of which is extremely \nimportant, a package of bills that would lower the price we pay at the \npump while applying for the long-time transition away from oil and \ntoward clean renewable fuels of the future Tom Friedman talked about.\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n  If past is prolog, Republicans will object to each of these \nproposals. If they do, and they probably will, it will be clear again \nfor all Americans to see which party wants to only talk about our \nenergy crisis and which party wants to solve it.\n  The first I would like to offer is S. 3044, the Consumer-First Energy \nAct. This is a very thoughtful piece of legislation which ends billions \nof dollars of tax breaks for big oil companies, and if there is ever an \nopportunity to recognize why they are unnecessary, look at those \nprofits today and what they do with those profits. Do they do new \nenergy exploration? No. Do they invest in renewables? No. They buy back \ntheir stock.\n  It was announced today they made last quarter, Exxon alone, about $12 \nbillion. S. 3044 would force oil companies to invest some of their \nmassive profits in clean, alternative affordable fuels rather than \nbuying back their stock. S. 3044 would protect the American people from \nprice gouging and profiteering. It would also stand up to \nOPEC countries that are colluding to keep prices high.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 743, S. 3044, the Consumer-\nFirst Energy Act; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to this bill be printed in the Record, as if given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, this bill does not produce \nany new American energy and would increase the price of gas at the \npump. Further, I agree with Chairman Bingaman that a windfall profits \ntax is ``very arbitrary'' and ``bad policy.'' For these reasons, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n Unanimous Consent Request--Energy Price Reduction and Security Act of \n                                  2008\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am going to speak about a proposal that \nhas been at the desk for a period of time and was put together by \nSenator Bingaman which deals in a very real way with the issues about \nwhich so many of our colleagues on the other side of the floor have \ntalked.\n  First, it does increase domestic production by giving the Secretary \nof the Interior the authority to shorten lease terms and raise rental \nrates, requiring oil companies to comply with benchmarks. It would \nrequire the oil companies to drill rather than just hold property for \ndecade after decade and not produce.\n  It would also bring down prices immediately by selling about 70 \nmillion barrels of high-quality light crude in the SPR, replacing it \nlater with low-quality heavier crude.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of sales would be invested in LIHEAP. Even \nmore importantly, it reduces demand. First, building codes, 40 percent \nof our energy is used by cooling and heating buildings. Certain States \nhave put in building codes for decades and dramatically reduced demand. \nWe also have research for batteries, so we might have electric cars and \nmany other provisions.\n  I cannot go into all of them because time is narrow. Why do my \ncolleagues oppose something so rational? The bottom line is because \nthey want to do what the oil companies want: give them record profits.\n  What do the oil companies do with those profits? Do they promote \nalternative energy? Absolutely not. Do they drill domestically? We are \nhearing all this talk about drill. Look what the oil companies do with \ntheir profits. They buy back stock. That is very good if you are a big \nshareholder in ExxonMobil. It is very bad if you are a homeowner \nheating your home or a commuter driving your car.\n  It does no one any good except a handful of people, mostly very well \noff, to raise ExxonMobil stock, raise Chevron stock, raise BP stock, \nand not put that money into production.\n  Our proposal doesn't do what the oil companies want, but it increases \nproduction, domestic production, and reduces demand, exactly the slogan \nthat my colleagues are talking about on the other side of the aisle. \nBut it does it in a way not that the oil companies want but that \nAmerica wants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a bill authored by Senator Bingaman, the \nEnergy Price Reduction and Security Act of 2008, which is at the desk; \nthat the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this bill does \nnot open a single new acre for the production of American energy and, \nin fact, would place new regulations and fees on American energy \nproduction, which would raise the price of gas at the pump. For these \nreasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3335\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 68 million acres are currently open to the \noil and gas companies, Federal land leased to them for oil and gas \nexploration. You would think, from the position and the statements on \nthe Republican side of the aisle, that there was no land available and \nthat we have to find new opportunities for oil and gas companies. They \nhave 68 million opportunities they are not using today.\n  Time and time again, over the last several weeks, the position of the \nRepublicans on the energy question has come down to two or three very \nbasic things: First, the Republicans in the Senate and Senator John \nMcCain are stuck on old ideas. Secondly, they can't wait to go hat in \nhand to big oil--the oil companies--and ask them: What would you like \nus to do next? Well, the oil companies have a pretty good agenda. \nBefore President Bush and Vice President Cheney leave town, can you try \nto find some way to provide even more Federal acreage we can drill on \nmaybe in the future? We want to stock it in our portfolios and get to \nit another day. Can you make sure you do that before President Bush \nleaves town?\n  That is the Republican agenda: More acreage beyond the 68 million \nthey currently have and no vision for the future. It is an old agenda, \nan old idea. The Grand Old Party is stuck in an old way of thinking \nwhen it comes to energy.\n  The bill I am about to talk about looks to the future. It is a vision \nfor tomorrow. Of course, there is responsible exploration and \nproduction--there has to be and there should be--but it realizes that \nthe energy future of America and the world has to be different. We have \nto get ahead of the curve. As Senator Reid said in quoting Thomas \nFriedman, it is time for us to think of the energy revolution we are \nabout to engage in, one that is going to make a profound difference in \nour lives.\n  Twice this week we have given the Republicans a chance to vote for a \nreal energy package. Is it a bipartisan plan? Read this quote from 48 \nGovernors, Democrats and Republicans, across the United States.\n\n       Securing our energy future must be a priority at both the \n     State and Federal levels. We strongly urge you--\n\n  They are speaking to the Congress--\n\n     to partner with States by passing legislation on a bipartisan \n     basis to extend expiring renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency tax credits that can be enacted this year.\n\n  The Governors understand it. The American people understand it. The \nDemocrats in the Senate understand it. It is only the Republican \nSenators who continue to object.\n  Now, what are these incentives? They are incentives for renewable \nenergy that will chart a course for America to find clean energy \nsources and the creation of new businesses and new jobs so America can \nagain lead the world. The Republicans look in the rearview mirror at \ndrilling for oil because that is where the big oil companies are--their \nfriends, their allies, their inspiration when it comes to energy.\n  This bill that came before us yesterday brought in five Republican \nvotes. Only 5 out of 49 crossed the aisle and joined us to try to pass \nit. Not enough. They know it. Coincidentally, four out of five are in \ntough reelection contests. They understand when they go home that they \ncan't sell this ``drill forever'' and the mentality the Republicans in \nthe Senate have been peddling.\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\n  The bill talks about incentives for biomass and hydropower, solar \nenergy, biodiesel, advanced coal, electricity, demonstration plug-in \nelectric cars, battery performance standards, idle reduction units for \ntrucks, and so many other things that move us forward using those \nnonpolluting renewable sources of energy that are truly our future.\n  Time and time and time again, the Republicans in the Senate have said \nno, no to these incentives for renewable energy and no to our future. I \nwill give them a chance this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 767, H.R. 6049, the Renewable \nEnergy, Job Creation Act of 2008; that the amendment at the desk, the \ntext of which is S. 3335, be considered and agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask that the \nunanimous consent request be modified; that instead of adopting S. 3335 \nas an amendment, the Senate adopt the McConnell-Grassley substitute \nwhich is filed at the desk. This substitute provides the AMT patch, \nextends all of the traditional tax extenders, some of them with \nmodifications, it extends the many energy tax incentives, provides for \nMidwest disaster relief, and includes no tax increases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, the Republicans, the Grand \nOld Party that used to be the party of fiscal conservatism, refuses to \npay for these tax breaks. We have come up with an approach that is \nreasonable and accepted by the business community and that puts the tax \nburden on companies that are shifting jobs overseas. The Republicans \ncan't stand the thought of imposing taxes on companies that are sending \nAmerican jobs overseas and that is why they object to our bill and that \nis why I object to their alternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, \nyesterday, the majority leader said that legislating is the art of \ncompromise, and indeed it is. There has been discussion here about the \nGrand Old Party--my party, of which I am proud--comparing it to the \nidea that oil is in the past, that oil is an old idea, we were told, \nand Republicans are stuck in the past. The Democrats are for \nrenewables.\n  If you can find me a renewable that runs on wind or on solar, I would \nbe happy to think about the idea. But I do think that since legislating \nis the art of compromise, we ought to listen to each other's ideas, and \nthat means each side moving off its hard-and-fast position, meeting \nsomewhere in the middle.\n  Republicans are ready and willing to negotiate a true compromise, and \nI hope we can instruct our respective staffs to work on compromise \nduring August.\n  I object to the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3268\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the pending business of the Senate is S. \n3268, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act. That is currently the \npending business. That has been objected to. I would like to try, once \nagain, to see if perhaps we can do what every one of us as kids has \nbeen told by our parents to do--first things first. We need to do a lot \nof things and a lot of things well--produce more energy, produce \ndifferent energy, and conserve more energy. I understand that. I think \nalmost all of us agree with that. But first things first.\n  We have a broken oil futures market, and let me describe it. Seventy-\none percent of those who are trading in the oil futures market are \nspeculators. They don't know about oil. They do not want any oil. They \ndo not want to carry a 5-gallon can of oil. They want to trade paper \nand make a lot of money.\n  A couple months ago, the vice president of ExxonMobil says the price \nof oil should be about $50 or $55 per barrel. The CEO of Marathon Oil \nhas said the same thing. Finally, in testimony before the Congress, \nFidel Gheit, 30 years in this business at Oppenheimer and Company--the \ntop energy person at Oppenheimer and Company--said:\n\n       There is no shortage of oil. I am absolutely convinced that \n     the price of oil shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel.\n\n  In speaking of the futures market, he said:\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall, open 24/7 and \n     totally unregulated. It's like a highway with no cops and no \n     speed limits and everybody going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  The result. The price of gas has doubled in a year. There is nothing \nin the supply-and-demand relationship of oil that justifies doubling \nthe price in a year. It is because the market is broken and infested \nnow with oil speculators.\n  We say first things first. We have crafted a bill to try to wring the \nspeculation out of that market and preserve it for ordinary hedging, \nfor which it was originally created.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Stop Excessive Energy \nSpeculation Act, that we are recognizing as the pending business, we \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 882, S. 3268; \nthat the bill be read three times, passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, this bill does not provide \nany new American energy, is flawed, and, in fact, the New York Times \nrecently called it a ``misbegotten plan.''\n  Senate Republicans believe we should continue to work on the bill so \nit would provide meaningful relief from high gas prices for American \nfamilies. For this reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3186\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, no one in this country should have to \nchoose between heating their homes and putting food on the table. But \nwith oil prices rising through the roof, more and more of our low-\nincome families and our seniors today need extra help to stay warm and \nhealthy. The cost of heating oil has risen 162 percent over the last 8 \nyears, and by this winter it will have risen another 41 percent in the \nlast year alone.\n  As these oil prices have skyrocketed, some regions of the country, \nincluding some counties in my home State of Washington, have had to cut \nback on the amount of heating assistance they can provide to the people \nwho live there. The Seattle Times, our hometown paper in Seattle, is \ntoday reporting almost 100,000 people in Washington State alone will \npay hundreds of dollars more to heat their homes this winter. Many \npeople are already planning on how they are going to get by without \nheat because they can't afford it.\n  Last week, we had a chance in the Senate to double the funding \navailable to help our low-income families and seniors to afford to heat \ntheir homes this winter. The Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer Act, \nwhich is S. 3186, would have ensured our local governments were able to \ncover these additional costs and help those who need it most. We were \nall extremely disappointed that despite the fact that 13 Republican \nSenators were cosponsors of this legislation, they chose last week to \nsay no, once again, on behalf of big oil.\n  As we debate the refinements of how we are going to solve the short-\nterm crisis, it seems logical to me that we not leave behind the people \nwho are hurting the most. For seniors, low-income Americans, people who \nare truly worried, can't we come together on this one issue and solve \nit as we try to take care of the large energy crisis before us?\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. \n835, S. 3186, the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer Act; that the bill \nbe read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The minority whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be modified to add to the text of \nSenate amendment No. 5137, the Coleman offshore oil exploration and \nconservation amendment, so we can address the root cause of high energy \nprices that are hurting all Americans, particularly low-income \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to so modify her \nrequest?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object to that, and I say to our \ncolleagues that, as we continue to debate in this country, in a very \nclear manner, the different root causes and what we can do, it seems to \nme, without encumbering this in the larger debate, we ought to be able \nto at least deal with an oil heating crisis that is going to affect \nmany Americans, and therefore I renew my unanimous consent request as I \nread it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there objection to my request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I did object, and I renew my original \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington objects.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair and I object as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a few minutes left until 2:30. I \nwould, rather than take leader time, ask unanimous consent to take \nanother few minutes past 2:30. I would say to my two Republican \ncolleagues on the floor, what we would do is run over, and the next 30 \nminutes in the next block of Democratic time would be cut by whatever \ntime I use at this time. It will only be a few minutes; otherwise, I \nwill use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Kohl and Senator Specter have been \ntalking quite a bit. They both have visited with me on more than one \noccasion because they believe they have one of the answers to the \nproblems we have with oil, and that is let's do something about OPEC. \nIt is a cartel, it is a monopoly, and they have no concern for the \nAmerican people, and they are obviously in violation of antitrust laws. \nBut it is a question of whether American law can take them into \nconsideration.\n  The legislation introduced by Senator Kohl and Senator Specter in the \nform of S. 879, the No Oil Producing Exporting Cartels Act of 2007, \nwould make OPEC subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. Why shouldn't \nthey? At the present time, we only have two entities that are exempt \nfrom the Sherman Antitrust Act: baseball and insurance companies.\n  We know how we all feel about insurance companies, and how the \nAmerican people feel about them, because they violate what would be \nantitrust laws all the time, but they are not subject to it.\n  Mr. President, what this legislation is all about is let's have OPEC \nbe subject to the antitrust laws. I agree with Senator Specter. I agree \nwith Senator Kohl. This should be something the Senate does.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2264\n\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nCalendar No. 169, H.R. 2264, that the bill be read three times and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this bill does \nnothing to increase American energy independence but would increase our \nreliance on the Middle East. Further, authorizing our Government to sue \nOPEC could, as Chairman Bingaman said, ``get us into all kinds of \ntrouble internationally'' and ``is not practical.''\n  For these reasons, I object.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I yielded 8 \nminutes to the Senator from Minnesota today in order that his statement \ncould be coterminous with Senator Klobuchar. If you don't mind, this is \nthe last unanimous consent request--and let me do that by saying I \nthink all of us in this Chamber understand the way you produce energy, \nand we support virtually every mechanism and approach to produce \nenergy. Drilling for oil is one of them. But drilling a hole in the \nground is not the only way you produce energy. You can use turbine and \nblades to produce energy from the wind and produce electricity. You can \ntake energy from the Sun and produce electricity. There is biomass and \nbiofuels. There are many ways to produce.\n  The problem is we do not aspire to set any national goal or national \nstandard to require or to push that production of alternative energy.\n  I think we need something around here that is game changing. Every 10 \nor 15 years people are content to shuffle on the floor and talk about \nwhat do we do about the next box canyon we have ridden in. Then they \nsay let's drill some more. I am all for drilling, but what about other \nways of producing energy, wind and solar and the alternatives?\n  I am going to offer a unanimous consent request on an issue that has \nbeen kicking around for a long time. I know some people oppose it \nstrongly. I respect their views but respectfully they are wrong. We \nought to have a national standard--many States now have it--to provide \na renewable energy standard, saying when you are producing electricity, \na certain percentage of that should come from renewable sources.\n  This proposal at the desk requires a 15-percent renewable energy \nstandard. If we are ever going to change the game, we have to do this \nby deciding that America is going to produce energy and produce \ndifferent energy. So this would be a 15-percent renewable energy \nstandard. Many States have taken the lead. I regret they have had to \ntake the lead, but we ought to have a national set of goals and a \nnational standard to say there are a lot of ways to produce. This is \nabout producing energy for this country.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6049\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of a bill to establish the renewable electricity standard \nwhich is at the desk, that the bill be read three times and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements relating \nto this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we need more \nenergy production to reduce costs. Republicans support it, Democrats do \nnot. Tom Friedman, quoted by the Democratic leaders, is right about one \nthing, Republicans want more offshore drilling. Democrats do not.\n  Second, and I respectfully correct the majority leader in this, \nSenator McCain did not say offshore drilling is only psychological. He \nadvocates more offshore drilling both because of the energy it would \nproduce and also because, he said, it would have a positive \npsychological impact on energy markets.\n  This would increase heating and cooling costs for American homes. For \nthat reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the last half hour or so has been a \nmicrocosm of the 18 months of this Congress. Time and time again, \nDemocrats have offered solutions to our energy crisis. Each time \nRepublicans have objected. They have not come up with answers to \nspecific objections to try to reach any sort of compromise. Basically, \nthey said no. After 18 months of ignoring our energy crisis, and \nrejecting every Democratic effort--and we have talked about some of \nthem today--they now claim to have seen the light. After a year and a \nhalf, all they want to talk about is gas prices. But as we have seen, \nall they want to do is, as I refer to part of what Thomas Friedman \nsaid:\n\n       Republicans, by mindlessly repeating their offshore-\n     drilling mantra, focusing on a 19th century fuel, remind me \n     of someone back in 1980 arguing that we should be putting all \n     of our money into making more and cheaper IBM Selectric \n     typewriters--and forget about these things called the ``PC'' \n     and ``the Internet.'' It is a strategy for making America a \n     second-rate power and economy.\n\n  I did not hear John McCain say drilling was psychological. All I did \nwas\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\nread it in the press. It has been repeated time and time again.\n  I would finally say, we believe in domestic production. We Democrats, \nall 51 of us, believe there should be more American production. There \nare ways of accomplishing that. We know we cannot drill our way out of \nthe problems we have, but there are things we can do and we want to \nwork to have that accomplished. We have seen that set forth in \nlegislation that Senator Bingaman has offered. Of course we talk about \nthe 68 million acres--that was, of course, talked about here during \nthis half hour--but we also are aware of the ability the President has \ntoday to offer leases to oil-rich areas in Alaska, onshore and \noffshore.\n  We believe in more domestic production. We call it American \nproduction. Hopefully the August recess will bring some ability of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle to start working with us. I hope \nwe are going to see, a bit later today or tomorrow, a vote on a motion \nto proceed to the Defense authorization bill. That would be too bad, \nto have Republicans vote against that. That is the way we pay our \ntroops and we refine what we do for our troops. It is a very important \nbill, led by two of the Senate's fine Senators, Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner, chairman and ranking member of the committee.\n\n  We are 5 minutes over. I express my appreciation to my friends for \nbeing patient. If you care to, you can go over 5 minutes and we will \ntake 25 minutes in our half hour. OK?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we had hoped to make significant \nprogress over the last week or two to begin to address the most \nimportant issue in the country, and that is the price of gas at the \npump. Regretfully, it seems we are bogged down here in trying to move \nahead. So in order to try to facilitate progress, I have notified my \nfriends on the other side that we intend to propound a number of \nconsent agreements that virtually every Member of my conference \nbelieves would move us in the right direction and begin to address the \nNo. 1 issue in the country.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 5137\n\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of a Senate bill to address drilling in the \nOuter Continental Shelf, the text of which is identical to the \namendment No. 5137, filed by Senator Coleman to the Energy bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nreality is the Democrats have been in favor of drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf in places such as the gulf coast, including votes we \ntook here on a bipartisan basis 2 years ago. The reality is the \nRepublican proposal here will not do anything in terms of addressing \nthe gas price issue which we are facing here today because it will not \nbe effective in bringing down the price of gas. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota is on \nthe floor. The amendment I propounded in the form of a consent \nagreement was essentially the Coleman proposal to open the Outer \nContinental Shelf. It was not geared to any particular price of \ngasoline at the pump. But I renew consent for the very same proposed \nconsent agreement with one modification--that the enactment date is \ntriggered when the price of gasoline reaches $4.50 a gallon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object for the \nsame reasons we stated earlier, this again is creating a phantom \nsolution to the reality of the energy crisis and the energy crisis we \nface as a Nation, and therefore I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our good friends on the other side of \nthe aisle apparently do not believe $4.50 a gallon gasoline is \nsufficient emergency to open the Outer Continental Shelf, those \nportions of it that are currently off limits which--by the way, 85 \npercent of the Outer Continental Shelf is currently off limits. I renew \nmy consent agreement with the following modification, that the \nenactment date is triggered when the price of gasoline reaches $5 a \ngallon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject again, it is a phantom solution, and therefore I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if $5 a gallon gasoline is not an \nemergency, I am compelled to ask what is the definition of an \nemergency? Maybe it is $7.50 a gallon gasoline. Therefore, I renew my \nconsent request with the following modification: that the enactment \ndate which triggered the implementation of the amendment would occur \nwhen the price of gasoline reaches $7.50 a gallon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is \nclear the Republican leader wants to move forward with the opening of \nplaces in the Outer Continental Shelf. I would say, on the Democratic \nside, there are a number of us who supported opening places in the \nOuter Continent Shelf, including additional significant acreage in the \nGulf of Mexico, the 8 million acres that were part of the lease sale \n181. We also know there are hundreds of millions of acres in Alaska \nthat are not in a moratoria area, on which we support exploration and \ninventory of those places. What we are doing here with those triggers \nbeing proposed by the Republican leader again is not getting to real \nsolutions that deal with the energy crisis we have and not coming \ntogether in a bipartisan way to move forward to have a package of \nenergy legislation that would work for America. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to propound my consent \nagreement with a modification one more time and then I am going to \nengage in a colloquy with Senator Coleman. It is his amendment that he \nhad hoped to offer, which I initially offered consent that we take up. \nThen these additional amendments were a different trigger, these \nadditional consents were with a different trigger. I say to my friend \nfrom Minnesota, I will give our friends on the other side one more \nopportunity to maybe get their attention. Then we will discuss the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request with the modification that the \ntrigger be $10 a gallon at the pump.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, if we were moving forward with a package \nof energy legislation that would address the fundamental national \nsecurity, economic security, and environmental security issues we are \nfacing, and this were part of that kind of package, this might be very \nwell worthy of consideration, including some of the triggers that have \nbeen mentioned. But it is clear to me this is another one of the \ntactics that essentially is wanting to get this Senate and this \nCongress to the point where we simply are not going to be able to get \nto a bipartisan energy package, and so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We know why we cannot get to a bipartisan energy \npackage. The American people are saying--some 70 percent of them--that \nwe ought to open the Outer Continental Shelf, those portions that are \ncurrently off limits, and it is my understanding that 85 percent of the \nOuter Continental Shelf is currently off limits. I\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\nhave been proposing a series of consents, basically drafted consistent \nwith the Coleman amendment that would have been offered had we had a \nchance to offer it.\n  I would ask my friend from Minnesota if he would describe his \nproposal?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would say to the Republican Leader, \nfirst, I want to make it clear that if I understand the objection, the \nRepublican leader has offered an amendment that if gas reaches $10 a \ngallon, more than double the record levels, the other side is objecting \nto opening areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, areas that would yield \nat least 14.3 billion barrels of oil and 55.3 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas at a minimum--at a minimum; there are other estimates that \nsay if we opened all of these areas, up to 80 billion gallons of gas.\n  So I understand the objection and that as a result of that objection, \nwe cannot move forward on increasing the supply of oil, that we cannot \nthen move forward and open these areas on the Outer Continental Shelf \nthat could yield at a minimum over 14 billion barrels of oil. Is that \nthe result of the objection placed by the majority?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Minnesota, I think he has it \nentirely correct. I have offered a series of consent agreements here to \ngive us an opportunity to take up and pass the Coleman proposal with \ndiffering triggers, starting at $4.50 a gallon and going up to $10 a \ngallon. Our friends on the other side have objected to passing \nlegislation even with those ascending triggers, leading me to believe \nthere is opposition on the other side to opening the Outer Continental \nShelf, 85 percent of which is currently off limits--and over 70 percent \nof the American people support that--even if gasoline reaches $10 a \ngallon.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would note to the leader that, by the \nway, the Coleman-Domenici amendment also has conservation pieces in it. \nI believe we will discuss that later.\n  But as I listen to the objection from my friend from Colorado, \ntalking about phantom solutions as we look at the issue of the rising \nprice of oil, I think there is bipartisan understanding that part of \nthe problem is the basic law of supply and demand; that demand is \nincreasing, and if you want to somehow affect demand, I would take it \nthat the supply piece is the other piece. And as I understand the \nColeman amendment, this is an opportunity to increase supply.\n  I would also note that part of the discussion has been about the \nissue of speculation, that there is money going into believing that oil \nis going to be scarce in the future, and that is somehow driving up the \nprice of oil today. I would ask, then, if, in fact, we would open the \nOuter Continental Shelf, that we would increase supply, finding more \noil of at least 14 to 15 billion barrels, would that not indicate that \nin the future there will be less scarcity because we are increasing \nsupply, and would it make common sense that if there is going to be \nless scarcity, more supply, we are going to tap into America's \nresources, that would have an impact on the price of gas today?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Minnesota, it makes sense that \nif you were betting on the future, so to speak, which I guess is what \nthe futures market does, if there were signs of optimism, an indication \nthat the United States of America was going to do something within its \nboundaries to deal with this problem, it is reasonable to expect that \nthe markets would respond favorably.\n  I might add--it was not alluded to specifically by my friend from \nMinnesota, but I might add that the underlying bill which we have been \nseeking to amend is actually opposed by the New York Times, the most \nliberal newspaper in America, as being ineffectual and actually making \nthe matter worse. So clearly doing that alone runs the risk, according \nto the New York Times, of destroying or at least adversely impacting \none of America's great markets. But also refusing to amend it to allow \nsuch reasonable proposals as the Coleman amendment means we would be \nmaking an ineffectual response to the issue that is the most important \nissue in the country.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I have one more observation. First, I do \nwish to make it clear that when the Republican leader talks about the \nunderlying bill, he is talking about the majority proposal on \nspeculation, a proposal that does not do anything to increase \nproduction?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. A proposal that does nothing to deal with more \nconservation? A proposal that suggests it is going to focus on \nspeculation only, and that is what the New York Times says would \nactually do more harm than good?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Minnesota is entirely correct.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would note that this issue of \nspeculation is something that has come before the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations on which I am now ranking member and I \nwas, in the past Congress, the chair. We looked at this issue. It has \ncome before Homeland Security, a committee that works on a very \nbipartisan basis. I would tell the Republican leader that at least one \nof the witnesses has come forward and said: If we do all we can do, if \nwe do conservation, if we let the world know we are serious about \nending our addiction to foreign oil, that we are serious about not \nbeing held hostage to what Saudi sheiks or Chavez or Ahmadinejad does, \nthe suggestion is that prices could drop like a rock.\n  I am not going to suggest that I know. I would not suggest to the \nRepublican leader that in fact they will drop like a rock. But common \nsense says that if we increase production, if we do those things, tell \nthe world that we are not going to be stuck with scarcity, that we are \ngoing to use the great power of America to tap into our resources, \nthat, in fact, would have an impact.\n  I would also note, for those who say it is only going to have an \nimpact in the future, would that be such a bad thing, for this Congress \nto be looking forward to the future? We are going to have this debate \n10 years from now if we do not do anything. In 10 years, we will be \nsaying: If only 10 years ago we had opened the Outer Continental Shelf, \nwe might today not be 80 or 90 percent dependent on foreign oil. I \nwould suggest that we have the debate now.\n  One final comment. We have not talked much about the issue of natural \ngas. I represent a State which is cold. The Presiding Officer \nrepresents a State that gets very cold in the winter. I would suggest \nthat we are going to come back here in September, and the cost of \nheating our homes is going to start to go up as the leaves turn color \nand the temperature starts to drop. By October, the snows may hit. By \nNovember, they actually may be here. In December and January, it is \ngoing to be below zero. And the price of natural gas is going through \nthe roof.\n  My farmers in Minnesota have trouble today buying fertilizer and will \nnext year because folks will not speculate on what the price of natural \ngas will be.\n  I would then ask the Republican leader, that in objecting to the \nColeman-Domenici proposal, the majority is not only stopping the \npossibility of tapping into billions of gallons of oil but also \ntrillions of cubic feet of natural gas, a market that is much more \nsusceptible in the short term to increases of supply.\n  Is that the result of the Democratic objection, that we are not going \nto be able to tap into this and tell the world that there are trillions \nof cubic feet of natural gas available, and I cannot tell my folks in \nMinnesota, when it is cold in November and December and prices shoot \nthrough the roof, that we were not able to act because the Democrats \nobjected to the unanimous consent offered by the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, my friend from Minnesota is entirely correct. I \nlearned from the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, who has been \nour leader on energy issues for a number of years, that we can be \nentirely independent and sufficient in natural gas. We have enough here \nin the United States, if we would simply go get it, to take care of our \nnatural gas needs.\n\n  So, yes, we are walling off natural gas as well as oil, exacerbating \nall of these problems, driving up the price of fertilizer and every \nother product in which natural gas is used, refusing to exploit our own \nresources. It strikes the American people, and we know that by looking \nat all of the public opinion polls. It is not making any sense at all.\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\n  I thank my friend from Minnesota for his observations.\n  Mr. President, it is not only offshore that we have enormous \npotential to increase our production. It has been estimated that we \nhave three times the reserves of Saudi Arabia right here in our country \nonshore in oil shale.\n  Last year, this new Democratic Congress passed a moratorium on going \nforward with oil shale research and development. I think that \nmoratorium was a foolish thing to do. It should be lifted.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Request--Amendment No. 5253\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of the Senate bill to address oil shale leasing, the text \nof which is identical to amendment No. 5253 filed by Senator Allard to \nthe Energy bill.\n  I would further ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nremind the Republican leader that even the oil companies--Chevron Oil--\nhave said we do not even know whether the technology is out there to be \nable to develop oil shale. At the earliest, it is 2015, 2016 when we \nwill know that. We had the Assistant Secretary of the Department of \nInterior, and in his testimony before the Energy Committee, he said the \nsame thing.\n  So the consequences of moving forward with the legislative proposals \npropounded here by the Republican leader essentially would do nothing \nmore than to lock up millions of acres of land and millions of barrels \nof reserves to oil companies that already are getting the highest \nrecord profits of any company in the history of the world. That \nincludes companies such as Shell, which reported a 33-percent increase \nin its second-quarter profit on Thursday, Exxon, and all the rest of \nthe oil companies.\n  So if this is about giving the national public resources away to the \noil companies, then I would say we should support the Republican \nleader's unanimous consent. But it is not about that, it is about \ncreating a new energy frontier for America. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Hampshire is \non his feet with some observations about this objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. I guess I am a little surprised at the objection. The \nfirst objection to your first amendment was that we did not have a \ncomprehensive approach. Now you suggested another approach; we would \nadd to a comprehensive approach that appears to be objected to.\n  The gravamen of the objection appears to be that we do not know if we \ncan produce oil shale, oil from oil shale; that the technology and the \nlocation of the oil shale is not necessarily far enough along to be \nable to produce, and therefore we should not even look at it.\n  As I understand the leader's amendment, it says simply remove the \nregulation which was put in place last year which barred the Interior \nDepartment from putting out regulations which allow us to find out \nwhether the oil is there and whether we can remove it.\n  So there seems to be an inconsistency here on the reasons why people \nwould object to taking off that regulation which was put in place last \nyear by the Democratic leadership.\n  Secondly, the known reserves from oil shale are projected to be two \nto three times the known reserves of Saudi Arabia. That is a huge \namount of oil, potentially. I do not think we want to not look there \nand say we are going to throw a sheet over our head and not look at \nthis potential reserve which would give us as a nation more potential \noil reserves than Saudi Arabia, that we are not going to allow the \nDepartment of Interior to begin the process of developing regulations \nthat will, if the oil is there and if it can be used, expedite the \nproduction of that oil. That makes no sense at all.\n  As I understand, the proposal that came earlier from the Democratic \nParty was to open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is 3 days' \nworth of oil. If there is 2 trillion barrels of oil in oil shale, that \nis 40,000 days of oil. Well, I do not know. I would think the American \npeople would like to have the opportunity to find 40,000 days of oil in \nthe United States rather than have to buy it from Iran or from \nVenezuela, places that do not like us very much, even from Saudi \nArabia. I think they would like to have the money kept here in the \nUnited States.\n  Yes, the oil companies are making some big profits. They are spending \nit to look for oil also. But when they are not spending it to look for \noil, they are actually paying some dividends. Who gets those dividends? \nWell, if they are American companies, I suspect that many Americans \nare, Americans who invested in pension funds, Americans who have \n401(k)s.\n  Are we to say they shouldn't get those profits and we should, rather, \nsend them to Saudi Arabia or to Iran or to Venezuela so Hugo Chavez \ngets the profits? How absurd. On its face it is absurd. We have 2 \ntrillion barrels of oil sitting there, and all the leader has asked for \nis to lift the regulation which will let us find out whether we can \nlook for it and whether it is there.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Hampshire yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I was propounding a question to the leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to our good friend, the other side had \nplenty of time to discuss their proposal.\n  I say to my friend from New Hampshire, he is entirely correct. Why \nwould we not want to look. Maybe we don't want to look because we might \nfind something. If the potential is as vast as the Senator from New \nHampshire portrays and as other experts have indicated, it seems to me \nwe would be foolish in the extreme not to pursue this further. The \nAmerican people simply would not understand.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the Republican leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not at this time.\n  I think the American people would not understand our reluctance to \ncontinue to explore this alternative given the vast potential it seems \nto possess.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may ask the Republican leader a further question: \nHave we not been on the floor now for 2 weeks, asking for the right to \noffer a series of amendments to address these issues that could be \nvoted up or down, that would be fairly presented, where the minority \nwould have the right to present its amendments so we could present to \nthe American people the case for Outer Continental Shelf oil, oil \nshale, nuclear power, electric cars, for a variety of other options \nthat might get us out from underneath this severe issue which is the \nprice of oil? Have we not been asking for the opportunity to present \nthose amendments in a fair and open manner in the tradition of the \nSenate and been denied that right? Are we not being denied that right \none more time here today?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is entirely correct. All we are asking for \nis the way the Energy bill was handled last year, the way the Energy \nbill was handled in 2005, in which we had an open amendment process, in \nwhich Members from both sides of the aisle were given an opportunity to \noffer their amendments. Forty or fifty amendments were adopted on each \nbill. It ultimately led to a law. What we have been engaged in in the \nlast 2 weeks is not designed to lead to anything other than a check-\nthe-box exercise and move on. That is why Republicans in great numbers \nhave insisted that we stay on this subject, the No. 1 issue, that we \ncontinue our effort to both find more and use less. The only way to \nachieve that is with a balanced approach, not a sort of single-issue \napproach which is in the underlying bill.\n  In addition to addressing gas prices directly, there are also a great \nmany Members of the Senate on both sides of the of the aisle who \nunderstand we need to move in the direction of more nuclear power. A \nlot of us think the French have not done a whole lot right in recent \nyears, but one thing they have done rather well is develop a nuclear \npower industry that supplies the vast percentage of their electricity. \nHad we been given the opportunity, we would have been offering a \nnuclear power amendment.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a Senate bill to promote nuclear power \ngeneration, the text of which is identical to amendment No. 5179 filed \nby Senator Lindsey\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nGraham to the Energy bill. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I was \npersonally on the floor two or three times when Senator Reid offered to \nSenator McConnell to allow them to bring this amendment to the floor. \nThey said: No, we want to talk it over. We have so many more \namendments. Of course, time ran out. Now they are back again. We have \ngiven them ample opportunity to talk about nuclear power, to offer \ntheir amendments, offer their energy package. Each time they couldn't \nget it together. This is the gang that can't drill straight.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will use leader time to allow us to \nget up to the same 30 minutes that was used by the other side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I was wondering if the leader could \nexplain to me how the Democratic assistant leader could object to \nsomething the Senator didn't object to?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know Senator Domenici and Senator Alexander both are \nknowledgeable about the nuclear industry. I see Senator Domenici, our \nenergy expert in the Senate, on his feet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, might I say to the Republican leader, \nI am here sitting down because you and the Senators on my side are \ndoing such an excellent job of letting the American people know what \nhas been going on. It has been a thrill to listen, because I would hate \nto be on the other side. It looks as if they are very anxious to make \nsure you don't finish your statements. They would like to take a little \nbit of your time. If I were in their shoes, I would too. Because the \ntruth is, their leader changed the course for debate on energy, \nmeaningful energy amendments, when he decided he would put all the \namendments that the process would hold, he put them on so there could \nbe none offered. That is why we are here today, because no amendments \ncould be offered and voted on. Anybody who stands up and says we had a \nchance, what chance? If we would have offered something, the objection \nwould have been: The tree is full. It is out of order. I already asked \nthe Parliamentarian if an amendment would be in order, if I tendered an \namendment to such-and-such amendment, and the Parliamentarian said: You \ncouldn't offer it. So that is why none of the amendments you refer to \ncould have been offered.\n  There has been one area in which we can all stand up and say we \nlegislated in the normal way and got something good, and that is the \ncurrent set of rules regarding nuclear power. We now have 16 nuclear \npowerplant applications filed and waiting their turn to start \nconstruction. We had zero when we started this process. We need some \nadditions to that which are in the amendment you propose to make sure \nit works, to make sure this wonderful start of nuclear power for \nAmerica hits the few things it still needs to be competitive. You have \nbeen denied the opportunity to discuss it. We are not talking about \nthat, but to offer a full-fledged amendment that will require a little \nbit of debate and then vote. That is what we have been denied. That is \nwhy I am here saying the public is going to understand this. We should \nhave voted on the Outer Continental Shelf, opening it, with amendment \nand full debate. We can't do it because they won't let us. It is that \nsimple.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Madam President, what time remains on this side to achieve the 30 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 30 minutes has been consumed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will use a few more minutes of leader time. If the \nother side wants to expand their time, it would be perfectly \npermissible with me.\n  There is one other area that is important to me and to other Members \non both sides and that is coal. We have vast reserves of coal in this \ncountry. There is a promising technology we know works to turn coal \ninto liquid. We have a customer, the U.S. military. We have an \ninterested potential customer in American commercial airlines. One of \nthe amendments that would have been offered was related to coal to \nliquid.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a Senate bill to promote coal-to-liquid \nenergy, the text of which is identical to amendment No. 5131 filed by \nSenator Bunning to the Energy bill. I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \npurpose of the amendment is laudable. For those of us who work on the \nEnergy Committee, including the Senators from Montana, we recognize \nthat coal is to the United States what oil is to Saudi Arabia. There \nare ways in which we can advance the usage of coal, including coal \ngasification and carbon sequestration which we all support. But the \nproposal put on the table is not something that would get that kind of \nbipartisan support.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know the Senator from Texas is on \nhis feet. I know he has strong feelings about this issue.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I say to the distinguished Republican \nleader, it sounded as though we were almost going to get to vote. The \nSenator from Colorado spoke so passionately about the importance of \nusing coal. Of course, the big concern we have is coal can pollute. But \nthe Senator is no doubt aware of a remarkable technology that has \nactually been around a long time that can take coal and convert it to \nsynthetic fuel that the Air Force is now using to fly airplanes. Isn't \nit a fact that in terms of transportation fuels, talking about gasoline \nand diesel and aviation fuel, that represents one of the biggest \nchallenges from an energy standpoint to this country and that actually \ncoal-to-liquid technology, such as the leader described, represents one \nof the great opportunities for becoming less dependent on imported oil \nfrom the Middle East?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. Of course, I come from a big coal-\nproducing State. The amendment I sought to call up is actually authored \nby Senator Bunning, my colleague from Kentucky. We are, not \nsurprisingly, enthusiastic about this option. But putting aside the \nKentucky-specific interest, the military is looking for a reliable, \nsecure source of fuel for our planes. They don't want to be dependent \non the Middle East.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I say to the Republican leader, this is not just an \nenergy issue, this is a national security issue. Let me ask the leader, \nsince he comes from a State that produces significant amounts of coal, \nwhether these figures given to me by my staff are accurate. It has been \nreported to me that the Air Force uses about 2.6 billion gallons of jet \nfuel a year at a total cost of about $8 billion. That is $8 billion the \nUnited States appropriates and goes to the Department of Defense and \nthe Air Force to buy jet fuel. It is estimated that for every $10 \nincrease in the price of a barrel of oil, the Air Force--and we can see \nin parentheses the U.S. taxpayer--spends an additional $600 million in \nfuel costs. Do those figures I have cited sound approximately correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not an expert on the figures, but it sounds \ncorrect to me. I know the military has great desire for the kind of \nreliable, secure energy source this would provide.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Are you aware or would you have any reason to disagree \nwith the experts who say that synthetic fuels such as coal to liquids \nare competitive with $70 to $80-a-barrel oil, plus an additional 10 \npercent that would be needed to figure out how to capture and divert \nthe carbon dioxide that would be produced by the process? Do you have \nany reason to disagree with the experts on that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Those are statistics I have heard in the past. It \ncertainly underscores what a promising\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\nalternative this would be, were we willing to pursue it. I thank my \nfriend from Texas for his thoughts.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Tennessee is on his feet as \nwell.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I had a brief question for the Republican leader.\n  Nearly 2 weeks ago, when the Democratic leader brought the \nspeculation Energy bill to the floor, isn't it true that we met and \nsaid we look forward to a balanced debate where we can get a result, \nand we believe in the law of supply, as well as demand, and, therefore, \nwe think we should come up with a proposal for finding more and using \nless?\n  On the finding more side, which we talked a lot about today, we had \noffshore drilling and oil shale, which would produce over time about 3 \nmillion barrels a day. We talked about nuclear power for more American \nenergy.\n  But we have even more on the demand side, on the using less side. In \nour case, the idea was, was it not, to create an environment in the \nUnited States where, as rapidly as possible, we could encourage the use \nof plug-in electric cars. Is there not much support on the other side \nof the aisle for that?\n  So my question to the leader is: Why is it that when Republicans, \nnearly 2 weeks ago, suggested a proposal for finding more that would \nproduce 3 million more barrels a day, eventually--that is a third more \nproduction--and using less that would save 4 million barrels a day, \nwhich together would have cut in half, over time, our imported oil--why \nis it we have been unable, for the last 2 weeks nearly, to actually \nbegin to debate and adopt such amendments and produce a bill that would \nsend a signal to the world that the United States of America is taking \nan action to find more oil and to use less oil, which would bring down \nthe price of gasoline? Why have we not been able to do that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, \nI am perplexed. The American people do not understand taking a time out \nuntil next year. The senior Senator from New York, for example, was \nrecently quoted as saying we are not going to do anything about this \nuntil next year. Well, the American people are paying these high prices \nnow, and I do not think they sent us here to engage in a 2-week \npartisan battle and achieve nothing.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is entirely correct when he says our goal \nfrom the beginning, on this side of the aisle, was, as he reminds us \nfrequently--and as the sign points out--to both find more and use less. \nVirtually every member of our conference is in favor of almost every \nconservation measure you can think of.\n  Our fundamental problem in here is it seems as if the other side does \nnot want to do any finding of more. They may share our view about using \nless, but they do not want to find any more, as if somehow we could \nsimply conserve our way out of this problem. I know of not a single \nexpert in America who thinks we can, by conservation alone, solve this \nproblem and get the price of gas at the pump down.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before the Republican leader leaves the \nfloor, I would like to reconcile the remaining time allotment.\n  I understood he said we could have extra time in the next segment for \nDemocrats, to make up for the additional time used by the Republican \nside; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, that is fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, could the Chair indicate how much \nadditional time was used by the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes ten seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if I could ask unanimous consent, then, \nthat the next segment be 40 minutes on the Democratic side and then we \nreturn to 30-minute segments on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, for those who are following this debate, it is \ninteresting because a friend of mine I used to work for in politics as \na young man used to say: When politicians speak, there is a good reason \nand a real reason for the things they are saying.\n  The good reason for the position taken by the Republicans is they \nbelieve more oil put on the market is going to mean more supply and \nlower prices. It is intuitive to us, in a supply-and-demand economy, \nthat makes sense on its face. So the pillar of their argument on energy \npolicy is we have to find more places to drill. We do not have enough \nplaces to drill for oil now. If we could find more oil, there would be \nmore gasoline, and gasoline prices would come down. The logic is good. \nBut it fails to tell the whole story. It fails to account for 68 \nmillion acres of Federal lands currently leased by oil and gas \ncompanies that they have not touched. They have paid the Federal \nGovernment for this land to go drill for oil and have done nothing. The \nRepublicans never mention the 68 million acres out there that the oil \ncompanies are not using.\n  There is a second matter they never mention. If we decided today to \nstart drilling for oil on the Mall--and sometimes I think in the \nspeeches on the floor a few people might be for that--but if we decided \nto drill, they think it takes 8 to 14 years before you put the oil well \ninto production--8 to 14 years.\n  As you are paying for your gasoline each week and somebody says: Hey, \nhang on, in 14 years we are going to get this under control, you have a \nright to be a little impatient. But that is the Republican approach.\n  So who would buy this approach? Well, the people who are buying this \napproach--the real reason behind the position on the Republican side--\nthis is the oil companies' agenda. This is the oil companies' answer: \nKeep drilling, give us more land, give us more options, let us put \nthese in our portfolio--the same oil companies that are reporting not \njust recordbreaking profits for oil companies but recordbreaking \nprofits for American businesses. No businesses in our history have ever \nreported the profits they have reported.\n  Shell reports a profit jump. Despite reducing production of oil, \ntheir profits have gone up. Shell went up 33 percent this quarter; \nExxon, 14 percent--recordbreaking profits for these oil companies, and \nthe position they hold, coincidentally, is the same position as the \nRepublican Party in the Senate.\n  But an honest energy picture, one that looks forward, says we need \nresponsible exploration and production. That means we do not go into \nenvironmentally sensitive areas; we do not pollute our beaches and our \nshore communities; we do the safe and the right thing but we produce \noil and gas as we can in this country, realizing the entire inventory \nof oil in America represents 3 percent of the global supply of oil--3 \npercent--and we consume 25 percent of the oil.\n  We cannot drill our way out of this. We have to look beyond that. We \nhave tried to do that. Twice this week we brought an energy policy bill \nto the floor. Twice this week the Republicans defeated it. They refused \nto vote for an energy policy that is comprehensive, that has just not \nexploration and production in it but looks to things that are our \nfuture: more fuel-efficient cars and trucks.\n  We cannot keep driving these gas hogs. We have to drive cars and \ntrucks that are sensible, that meet the needs of our families and our \neconomy and do not consume so much gas. I think my kids and my \ngrandkids will be using plug-in hybrid cars. They will wonder why their \nold man used to use so darn much gasoline when he was growing up \nbecause they will have found ways to do it without gasoline, without \ndiesel fuel, using these batteries and using plug-in hybrids.\n  That is the future. That is what we asked the Republicans to join us \non and vote for, and they refused. We asked them to join us in creating \ntax incentives for solar power and wind power and geothermal sources, \nall of which can serve our economy, serve our businesses, serve our \nfamilies, and not create global warming. They refused. Time and again, \nthe only thing they will vote for is the oil company agenda.\n  The oil companies are pretty powerful. You may see some of their \nfolks walking the halls out here, wearing pretty nice suits and shoes. \nYou can't\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nmiss them. But that is not the future. That is the past. They have done \ntheir part. They will continue to play a role--a major role--but the \nfuture is a future of vision, looking for clean energy and good-paying \njobs right here in America, creating the kind of industry where we can \nhave growth in manufacturing jobs so families across our country have \nan opportunity.\n  The Republican view and the Democratic view are quite different. When \nwe offered them a chance to come together, they refused. They would not \ndo it. The last bill they defeated not only had the energy provisions I \nmentioned, it had a lot of other important provisions. There was \ndisaster assistance for the poor people in Iowa. There was $8 billion \nto put in the highway trust fund so we can reduce congestion on our \nhighways and create construction jobs across America.\n  It even included the Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act. Paul \nWellstone of Minnesota passed away about 6 years ago. This was his \npassion, and we have never passed this bill. We have to pass it now so \nyour health insurance covers mental illness, as it covers physical \nillness. They voted against that too. It was all part of the same bill.\n  It is unfortunate we have reached this point, but that is the point \nwe find ourselves.\n  The final word in this debate is going to be on November 4, and the \nvoters will have it. If the voters believe we need to look backward to \nthe oil company agenda, they can agree with our Republican friends. But \nif they believe we need to look forward, with responsible exploration \nand production but also incentives for renewable energy that brings us \ninto the 21st century in leadership, I hope they will consider voting \nfor those who have brought that to the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I wish to make a few comments to \nclarify some of the colloquy that went on and what I consider to be \nsome of the distortions that were spread.\n  First, there is a misconception that the minority side is trying to \nspread: that Democrats are against drilling. If you go to my State of \nColorado, you will find tens of thousands of natural gas wells and oil \nwells that are producing. If you look at the votes we have taken in \nthis Chamber, there are many of us who have said we need to go and \ndrill, and we need to explore, whether it is off the gulf coast or \nwhether it is in other areas. So for them to try to use the brand that \nwe are against the use of our conventional fuels and resources is \nsimply wrong.\n  I wish to comment on two or three specific matters. First, on the \nopening of the Outer Continental Shelf, it is true the President has \nsaid he wants to lift the moratoria. It is true Senator McCain has said \nit would have some kind of a psychological effect, perhaps, on the \nmarket. The fact is, there are some of us who say we ought to at least \nhave an inventory of what is out there on the OCS.\n  But no matter how you cut it, the Department of Energy and the Energy \nInformation Administration has said we are not going to be producing \nanything out there for 7 to 10 years. So it is not going to have an \nimpact on gasoline now. That raises the question: What is the real \nmotivation of these amendments and these agendas on the Republican \nside? It is a stalling tactic to keep gas on the minds of people \nthrough the month of August so they play it for their own political \nadvantage.\n  I think the American people expect better of us. I think the American \npeople expect us to come up with real solutions and not phantom \nsolutions. Solutions that have been proposed here are, by and large, \nphantom solutions. There can be no greater phantom solution, frankly, \nthan what we have seen countless times over the last 2 weeks: the \nassertion by my wonderful friends on the other side who have said that \nsomehow out of this shale rock--which is shale; it is not tar; it is \nnot sand; it is shale; it is rock--that somehow we are going to be able \nto develop 2 trillion barrels of oil out of that rock.\n  Well, it has been tried for about 100 years. Nobody has figured it \nout. Even the oil companies are saying they cannot figure it out right \nnow. We, contrary to the assertions made by my good friend from New \nHampshire, opened the opportunity for oil and gas companies to go in \nand see whether the technology could be developed. So we have a robust \nresearch and development program that is taking a look at whether oil \nshale can be commercially developed in my State of Colorado, where 80 \npercent of the reserves are located.\n  So I would hope, as we move forward in what is one of the most \nimportant issues in the crucible of our times, that we look to the \nfuture to find real solutions that are so important for us on energy \nbecause, at the end of the day, what will drive us to that new energy \nworld is the importance of national security, economic opportunity here \nat home, and the environmental security of our planet.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, a little earlier this afternoon, our \nleader came to the floor with colleagues and offered six different \nopportunities for the Senate to bring before it bills that include \nresponsible drilling, investments in alternatives, investments in areas \nthat will create jobs right away, which relate to my great State of \nMichigan, which is investing immediately in advanced battery technology \nresearch and development and retooling our plants for the new vehicles, \nwhich will create, within 2 years--not 15 years--changes that will \nallow us to move aggressively to hybrids and plug-in automobiles. We \nsaw legislation put forward to deal with energy speculation and what is \ngoing on in the marketplaces.\n  Each of those times, there was an objection to even moving ahead to \nconsider those bills. Twice this week, we have tried to move forward on \ntax incentives for production, for alternative energy, and other \noptions that will get us off foreign oil and bring down gas prices for \ngood. Each time there were objections. In the month of June, two other \ntimes--we can go back a year--objection, objection, objection.\n\n  Frankly, people watching the Senate get sick of this because they \nwant action. They want something to be done. The question is: Who \nbenefits by this blocking continually, by this stopping of us moving \nforward to alternatives to compete with oil companies or to tackle oil \nspeculation or windfall profits tax proposals that would require you to \npay an extra tax if you don't reinvest in alternatives or in drilling \nin America to create more supply? Who would benefit by these things?\n  I think it is very clear from the announcement in the paper today. \nToday ExxonMobil reported second quarter profits of $11.68 billion, the \nhighest ever for an American company. It did that last month--the last \nquarter: highest profits ever--ever--ever for an American company. All \ntogether, since President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, \ntwo oilmen, have been in the White House over the last 8 years, all \ntogether ExxonMobil has reached $212 billion in profits. That is a lot \nof zeroes: $212 billion in profits.\n  I wonder who benefits from the inability of the Senate to get \nagreement to move to bills that would create competition with this \ncompany or deal with oil speculation or deal with other policies that \nwould hold them accountable? It is right here. It is right here. This \nis very clear. As my kids say, it is as clear as the nose on your face \nof what this is all about. This is about an oil company agenda that has \nrun wild for 8 years, and the American people are paying a huge price. \nOur economy is paying a huge price.\n  Along with ExxonMobil, Shell has also reported profits of $11.56 \nbillion, bringing their grand total since this administration took \noffice to over $157 billion. The total combined net profits of the big \nfive oil companies since President Bush and Dick Cheney took office are \nupwards of $641 billion.\n  What have they done with those profits? Well, oil companies have \nspent $188 billion in stock buy-backs and other spending, rather than \ninvesting it in supply here at home and abroad. We have heard so many \ntimes on this floor that there are 68 million acres available right now \nfor exploration that are not being used. I have supported responsible \ndrilling as part of the solution. We know there is no silver bullet, \nbut we also know we have to be aggressively moving to the future and \nnot\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\nstuck in what is an oil company agenda for this country.\n  We also know we are in a global marketplace. Nobody knows that more \nthan the people in my great State of Michigan. We are competing in a \nglobal economy. So that as there is supply created, as there is \ndrilling, it goes into the global marketplace. If they drill in Alaska, \nit goes to China. To add insult to injury, we don't even know where the \noil will be going.\n  However, here is what we do know: In February of this year, according \nto the Department of Energy, shipments outside this country were 1.8 \nmillion barrels a day--1.8 million barrels a day. Overall, in the first \n4 months of this year, the shipments of American oil outside this \ncountry--drilling here, going somewhere else in the world--were up 33 \npercent.\n  So clearly, the great oilman who has been all over our television \nsets, T. Boone Pickens, is right. We are not going to drill our way out \nof this in a global economy where you can drill here and it can go \nanywhere to the highest bidder.\n  Here is also what we know: We know we have to get extremely serious--\nand quickly--about those things that will make a difference, such as \nbringing accountability to the energy markets and addressing \nspeculation, and focusing aggressively on those areas that will give us \nreal alternatives and competition for these guys who have been doing so \nwell.\n  To add insult to injury, we take a look at the other ways in which \nthis industry has received so many benefits from this administration. \nEighteen months ago, we heard in the New York Times that the Bush \nadministration was allowing oil and gas companies to forgo royalty \npayments. They didn't have to pay their royalty payments on leases in \nFederal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. This decision by the Department \nof the Interior can cost up to $60 billion. They were supposed to make \npayments. Those payments were waived, for whatever reason, costing us \nup to $60 billion. Sixty billion dollars is the equivalent of 38 days \nof free gas for every American. Right now, I know a lot of folks who \nwould take that gladly.\n  The reality is we have seen at every turn efforts to support this \nindustry for the last 8 years, and where has it gotten us? Where has it \ngotten us?\n  I wish to share with my colleagues some stories of folks from \nMichigan in terms of where it has gotten us--not only $4 a gallon at \nthe pump, but when we look at what has happened to real people, it is \nan outrage, where this 8 years of a policy that has put oil companies \nfirst has gotten us. We know that everybody is affected. The folks \ngoing to work are affected. Yesterday I read a letter from a young \nwoman who works after school and was concerned because she takes the \nbus to school and now the buses are being cut because they can't afford \nto put gas into the schoolbuses. What an outrage in the United States \nof America.\n  Let me share today an article that was in the New York Times. Older \npoor people and those who are homebound are doubly squeezed by rising \ngas prices and food prices because they rely not just on social service \nagencies but also on volunteers. We have heard from our home health \ncare agencies that do such a wonderful job in this country helping \npeople to be able to remain at home and allowing them to receive \nservices. In a survey of home health agencies, more than 70 percent \nsaid it was more difficult to recruit and to keep volunteers. We have \nheard that from Meals on Wheels. We have heard that from other kinds of \nvolunteer programs that go into homes to help seniors, to help the \ndisabled, to help those who need some assistance.\n  Let me share with my colleagues one letter. Mrs. Fair, who has \nlimited mobility because of diabetes, lives on $642 a month of Social \nSecurity widow's benefits, and relies on care from her son who often \nworks odd hours, especially during blueberry season. We grow a lot of \nblueberries, and they are terrific, they are the best, in Michigan. It \nsays: ``You belong in a nursing home.'' This is what her son said. ``I \ncan't take care of you.'' The delivered meals she has been receiving \nhave allowed her to eat at normal hours which helped her control her \nblood sugar levels. Last year, she lost her balance during a change in \nblood sugar and spent a month in a nursing home. With no meal delivery \nin her area now, she is going to have to find someone to pick up the \nfrozen meals from the center in the next town. She says: ``If my aide \ncan't get the meals''--a person who has been helping her--``maybe I can \nget my pastor to pick them up. I can't travel even to the drop-off \ncenter.''\n  In Union, MI, a town among flat corn and soybean farms near the \nIndiana border, Bill Harman, who is 77, relies on a home health aide to \ntake care of his wife Evelyn, who is 85 years old and she has \nAlzheimer's disease. Mr. Harman has had to use a wheelchair since 2000 \nbecause of hip problems. Unfortunately, the person who has been coming \nto their house, Katie Clark, who is 26, may have to give up her job. \nShe lives 25 miles away and drives 700 miles a week to provide twice \ndaily visits, helping Mrs. Harman dress in the morning, get to bed at \nnight, feeding her, doing chores around the house, and then she laughs, \nsaying ``putting up with a grumpy old man.'' I am sure he is not that \ngrumpy. Her weekly income of $250 is being eaten up by gas expenses, \nwhich come to $100 a week. ``Some weeks I have to borrow money to get \nhere,'' says Ms. Clark, a single mom of two, ``but they are just like \nfamily to me.''\n  For her work she receives $9 an hour and if she leaves, Mr. Harman \nhas said he will not be able to care for his wife. He said when they \nmarried, she raised his five children as if they were her own. Mrs. \nHarman started to develop Alzheimer's 8 to 10 years ago. He said, ``I \npromised her, don't worry, I will take care of you as long as I can.'' \nBut without a home health aide, he said, he was going to have to put \nhis wife in a nursing home and he probably would need to live there \nhimself.\n  In the greatest country in the world, we have folks who are not able \nto get their Meals on Wheels. They are not able to get their home \nhealth aide now. Why? Because they can't afford gas. We have school \nbuses that can't run because they can't afford gas.\n  Let me share with my colleagues one other story. Sandra Prediger, who \nis 70 years old and who still drives a car, said higher gas prices hit \nher every time she needs to go to the doctor. From her senior apartment \nin South Haven, MI, she was barely able to pay her bills because gas \nprices rose. She said: ``I try to help some of the ladies around here, \ndriving them to the doctor or to the store.'' But a round trip to her \ndoctor or the beauty shop now costs $26 in gas. She has had to ask her \nfriends to pay half. She said, ``I hate to ask because they have less \nthan I do.''\n  Her Social Security check arrives on the 3rd of the month. For the \nfirst few days before, her local gas station lets her write a postdated \ncheck to fill up. On July 2 she had no money and owed money to the gas \nstation and she knew that in a few minutes her friend would be calling \nsaying, could you please take me to the store to get the meals for my \ndiabetes. What am I going to do?\n  There is something wrong when we are in a situation where we have \nseen an agenda benefiting a special interest in this country, and in \nthe world right now, where we have seen the highest profits in the \nhistory of the country that are creating numbers such as $641 billion \nin profits and we have seniors who have to write a postdated check at a \ngas station so they can pay for gas to get themselves and their friends \nto the doctor.\n  The reality is that to be able to change that, we have to do more \nthan drill more so the oil companies can make more of a profit in a \nglobal economy. We have to be able to create a situation where there is \ncompetition with other kinds of alternative energies so we have more \nthan a choice of whatever price they put up at the pump. That is what \nthis is about. That is what the crux of this is about, because if it \nweren't about this, we would have a compromise. We would have a \nsolution. If it weren't about this, there wouldn't be objections going \non day after day after day to be able to take up legislation on this \nfloor, because under normal circumstances, if there weren't this huge \namount of money at stake, people would come together. If they weren't \nbacking up these huge interests, people would be willing to come \ntogether to be able to solve this problem.\n  There are things we can do. I am very proud to be part of a group of \npeople in\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\nthe Democratic majority who have been working very hard to create an \nalternative vision for the future. Yesterday the Senate leadership, \nincluding Senator Byrd, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nlaid out a jobs stimulus that we intend to bring forward for a vote in \nSeptember. In there is a major investment of $300 million in advanced \nbattery technology research and development. We are so close to having \nthe electric vehicle on the road and mass produced. We are so close. \nThere is work that needs to be done, but we are so close. Within 18 \nmonths to 2 years, we can have a real alternative to oil on the road.\n  Part of this package also includes a commitment to Americans and \nAmerican jobs by helping to retool and make capital available, make \ncredit available to companies to retool our plants for these new \nvehicles, so that we keep those jobs here.\n  Our companies are competing with countries right now. Come to China, \nwe will build a plant for you. Come to Korea, we will build a plant for \nyou. We want those jobs here.\n  I am very proud that the stimulus that has been put forward shows a \ncommitment to American jobs and American manufacturing. I am very proud \nthat is part of the stimulus package we will be working on and voting \non in September.\n  Around the world, everybody else gets it that it is not just about \noil and drilling. Everybody else understands. Every other country is \nracing to alternatives. Germany announced the great advanced battery \nalliance that will invest over $650 million in advanced batteries to \nhelp German automobile makers. South Korea spent over $700 million in \nadvanced batteries and developing hybrid vehicles. We are in a race \nwith them to get to the future, not the past. China has invested over \n$100 million in advanced battery research and development.\n  In the next 5 years, Japan will have spent $230 million on this \nresearch, as well as $278 million on hydrogen research for zero-\nemission fuel-cell vehicles. That is the future. That is the real \ncompetition, so when you go to the pump and look up and see that price \nfor traditional gas, you have another choice. That is the future. We \nare working very hard to get us to that future. We need a White House \nthat will help us get to that future. We need support from the other \nside of the aisle, not just to talk about it.\n  In conclusion, part of what is talked about on the other side of the \naisle in terms of supporting advanced battery research is a prize. If \nyou go out and spend all this money--and Germany spends $650 million--\nbut if you, an individual or a business in America, figure out a way to \nget the capital to do this, we will give you a prize at the end. It is \ninsulting that the presumptive Republican nominee and his colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have decided to run our economy like a game \nshow.\n  We have said we have to invest upfront in America, in American jobs. \nThat is the future. That is the only way to create the opportunity for \nschoolbuses to be able to run, for seniors to be able to get to the \ndoctor, for folks to be able to get home health, for folks to be able \nto get to a job, and to create the jobs we need in the future in \nadvanced manufacturing.\n  I hope before this week is out, our colleagues will come to the \nfloor, stop objecting, and work with us. What we know is right in front \nof us--what we know can be done to bring down gas prices and create \njobs in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           State of Paralysis\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nspeak about the state of paralysis we seem to have found ourselves in \non the Senate floor, and then also to make a brief comment about two \nnominations the Senate will be considering.\n  First, we are paralyzed, obviously. The other side of the aisle has \nvoted against a windfall profits measure for oil companies at a time \nwhen we have seen record profits for any company in American history, \nwhich has only increased. How did they get these profits? Certainly not \nby working any harder. In fact, as people have mentioned on the floor \ntoday, it seems a lot of production actually has gone down. I don't \nknow how else you define a windfall than what has happened in the price \nof oil and the profits that have gone to the oil companies over the \npast 6 or 7 years. They will not give us a vote on the rampant \nspeculation that has now taken place in the oil market.\n  I have to say at the outset that I don't have a fundamental \ndisagreement with a lot of the things that are being said on the \nRepublican side about what we need to do. I think we very much need a \ncomprehensive energy strategy in this country. I am not opposed, \npersonally, to the idea of expanding exploration for oil and gas in \nthose cases where it is appropriate, and to get down and find the \nassets that are available to us as a nation and increase our national \nsecurity. This may not be, as some people say, the answer in the \ndistant future, but it is certainly an essential transition for us as \nwe reach toward that future.\n  I personally support nuclear power and expanding nuclear power \nprograms. We have not built a new nuclear power plant in more than 30 \nyears. There has been ample comment about that on the floor. I think \nnuclear power is safe. We are the best in the world at it. The \nexperiences of the U.S. Navy at sea for at least a half century \ndemonstrate that. It is environmentally clean, and we have gotten \nbetter technology, advanced technology, in terms of taking care of \nnuclear waste.\n  I believe we can reach a point where we have cleaner coal. This \nrequires new technology. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We are \nlooking to improve national security, and we are looking for \nindependence from countries where we have seen an enormous transfer of \nwealth from the United States. This transfer of wealth is going to \nresult in better infrastructure for these other countries, and it is \ngoing to harm us in the long-term.\n  I believe we need to support conservation and alternative energy \nprograms of every sort. I went to high school in Nebraska. If you draw \na line from Canada to northern Texas, where the winds come down from \nthe Arctic Circle, you will see there is not a mountain in the way. \nThere are actually trees in Oklahoma that bend toward the south because \nof the power of those winds. I believe we must invest, in terms of \nalternative energy technologies, whether it is wind, solar, or other \nareas.\n  At the same time, when do we debate this? How do we develop a \nstrategy? What should we be doing now, today, looking into the \nimmediate future? The bill our leadership brought to the Senate floor \nis the best short-term fix, when we are talking about the incredible \nincrease in the price of oil. If you go back 6 years to when this \nCongress voted in favor of the invasion of Iraq, oil was $24 a barrel. \nThe price of oil went all the way up to $147 a barrel. It has tamped \ndown a little since then, but that is a sixfold increase in 6 years.\n  I can guarantee this is not simply a supply-and-demand issue. The \ndemand didn't go up six times in the last 6 years. There are other \ninterests, including the speculation market, that have driven the price \nof oil up that high. We have had testimony from oil companies' \nexecutives saying that, in a pure supply-and-demand environment, oil \nwould probably be at $60 a barrel. That is an issue we can affect. We \ncan affect it in the short term by regulating a market that has \ndramatically changed because of the participants in that market since \nlate 2000. I hope we can have some sort of agreement on this. We should \nhave a vote on the speculation issue. I compliment our leadership for \nhaving attempted to bring that issue before the Senate.\n\n\n                          Pending Nominations\n\n  Madam President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes about two \nnominations that are pending before the Senate.\n  First, I express my appreciation to the senior Senator from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, today for the comments he made about Kathy Stephens, \nwho has been nominated to be Ambassador to South Korea, has cleared the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, and has been waiting for a vote on \nthis floor. I know of very few people who have better qualifications to \nserve in that part of the world. I have spent a good part of my life in \nand out of Asia. She began as a Peace Corps worker in South Korea. She \nis fluent in Korean. I believe she is the best qualified person to\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\naddress all of the issues that people on both sides have expressed \ntheir concerns about, in terms of politics, the culture, human rights \nissues, et cetera. I was very gratified to see Senator Warner mention \nhis support for her nomination today. I hope we can find a way to get \nher out there doing her job in the very near future.\n  The second nomination I want to mention is that, regrettably, I am \nunable to support the nomination for the Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce. This is an individual who, in an earlier billet, at a key time \nafter the invasion of Iraq, was asked repeatedly to give answers to a \nquestion for which I personally believe there were answers. I was \nwriting about it at the time. I have very strong feelings about this. \nRegrettably, I am going to be unable to support that nomination.\n  I go back to what General Matthew Ridgway said some 50 years ago, \nwhen he was describing the role of a military adviser. He said:\n\n       He should give his competent professional advice on the \n     military aspects of the problems referred to him, based on \n     his fearless, honest, objective estimate of the national \n     interest, and regardless of administration policy at any \n     particular time. He should confine his advice to the \n     essentially military aspects.\n\n  I believe if we do not insist on this standard in the relationships \nbetween the U.S. military and the Congress, then we are going to \ncontinue to have the same difficulties that we saw with attempting to \nget straight comment out of the U.S. military as we went into Iraq.\n  There was a very wise Marine general who said, at the time I was \nentering the Marine Corps, ``It is very important in the United States \nto get the politics out of the military and to keep the military out of \npolitics.'' I believe that, if we believe in that, we need to insist \nthat those military officers who testify before the Congress abide by \nit.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                      Condolences to Simon Family\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have had the good fortune of working \nwith Senator Bingaman now for 26 years. He is such a wonderful man. His \nacademic record is as good as anyone's in the Senate. His ability to do \nlegislation is as good as anyone's in the Senate. Everybody knows what \nan easy man he is to deal with. He is now chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which is so important to what goes on in \nour country. New Mexico is so fortunate to have his service in the \nSenate. He does so much for New Mexico and, of course, for our country.\n  The reason I mention his name is that one reason Senator Bingaman \ndoes such a good job is he has a wonderful staff. I have worked very \nclosely with them. At least 70 percent of Nevada is public lands--land \nowned by the Federal Government. Only 13 percent isn't private lands. \nOver 40 percent of the State of Nevada is restricted air space. You \ncannot fly an airplane over most of the State of Nevada. It is \nrestricted to the military. So we have lots of dependence on the \nFederal Government. We are the most public land State in the country.\n  As a result of that, I have worked closely with the Energy Committee \nall these many years. One of the people I have worked closely with over \nthese years, for more than a decade, is the chief of staff of that \ncommittee, Bob Simon. He is a wonderful guy--quiet, intellectually very \nsound, a graduate of a small college in Pennsylvania called Ursinus \nCollege. He has a PhD from MIT in chemistry.\n  I have followed very closely the travails of Bob Simon these last few \nweeks because he has a son by the name of Gregory, 16 years old, who \nwas struck with a very bad bleed on the brain and died today. He was in \nthe hospital in a coma. We thought he would pull through, but he did \nnot. He died. It is devastating to Bob Simon, his wife Karen, and, of \ncourse, Anne-Marie, his daughter, and Catherine. Catherine is not here \ntoday, of course. Her brother passed away. She is in charge of the \nDemocratic pages. She works very hard in that capacity.\n\n  It is times such as these when you really understand that when we \ntalk about a Senate family, we really mean it. Bob Simon is part of the \nfamily. He works with Democrats and Republicans. He is great for \nworking on a bipartisan basis. When Senator Domenici was chairman of \nthe committee, Bob Simon was the Democratic chief of staff. The \ncommittee with the two New Mexicans as the ranking member and chairman \nof that committee, one time as chairman, one time as ranking member--\none reason that committee functions so well is because of Bob Simon.\n  There is nothing I can do other than to recognize what a good man Bob \nSimon is. There is nothing I can do to ease the pain of the Simon \nfamily, their friends, and loved ones.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend my deepest condolences to Bob Simon \nand his wife Karen for their heartbreaking loss. Being the father of \nfive children, I can only think how devastating this must be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the leader yield a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I heard the leader's comments about \nGregory. I just want to say I am aware of the situation. I feel the \nsame way the majority leader feels. I thank him so much for his \ngraciousness toward Bob and his wife. I know how tough it is on them. \nWe don't know it until something like that happens, but that is a very \nyoung, wonderful boy who died. Bob is a wonderful man. Everybody who \nknows him knows he is a dedicated, devoted father. It is just pathetic \nthat this happened.\n  I join the majority leader in every way in extending my most sincere \nregrets and hope and pray that the best will come of this. I know that \nsounds impossible, but at least we can ask for the best and that the \nLord consider them and be merciful to them.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I did not know my friend from New Mexico \nwas on the floor, but as he knows, I did mention his name and the great \nrelationship Bob Simon has had with the committee. As I mentioned, not \nknowing the Senator from New Mexico was on the floor, I will repeat \nwhat I said, that the committee has functioned very well. Two New \nMexicans run that committee, either as chairman or ranking member, back \nand forth, and they work so well together. One reason they do is \nbecause of Bob Simon. He is a very quiet, brilliant man, and it is very \nnice that Senator Domenici would say what is in his heart because we \njoin in his wishes that, as he has indicated, the Lord will look down \non his family with understanding and compassion, and hopefully, as time \ngoes by, there will be some good that comes from this tragedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, as I understand it, time now inures to \nthe Senate Republicans for--is it a half hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am here to lead off for the \nRepublicans. There are two others. Senator Brownback is here, and there \nmay be another Senator, Senator Allard. I say to them, I am only going \nto make a 2-minute or 3-minute statement and then yield to whoever \nwishes to go first. I would like them to hear what I say.\n  Yesterday, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nByrd, issued what I believe to be a very telling and extraordinary \nstatement. He said:\n\n       It became clear that an attempt to add language to the \n     supplemental----\n\n  That is the supplemental appropriations----\n\n     repealing the two-decade-old ban on offshore oil and gas \n     drilling would be successful, resulting in the necessity of \n     having to produce 60 votes on the Senate floor to strip the \n     repeal.\n       And so for that reason, the markup in the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee on two important bills that fund the \n     government was canceled.\n\n  I will say that not only does this statement contradict claims of the \nmajority about why the markup was canceled, it also crystallizes \nexactly why the last 9 days in the Senate have resulted in absolutely \nnothing. The majority is afraid of allowing the Senate to vote on \nincreasing American production. They are afraid to let that happen \nbecause a vote just might yield results.\n  We have spent 9 days debating this bill. During this time, we could \nhave\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\nconsidered dozens of amendments, just as we did on the energy \nlegislation in 2005 and 2007, and without a doubt, because the majority \nleader has taken sole control over the process, we have been held to \nzero votes. So zero votes, I say to my fellow Americans, cannot yield \nresults. When you have no votes, you cannot accomplish anything. That \nmeans you cannot add to the offshore reserve that can be made available \nfor oil and gas production. It remains as is, no matter how much is \nthere, no matter how much we could end up drilling for so the American \npeople could look out and say: By producing our own, we don't have to \nwaste all our money sending it overseas, and the price might come down.\n  My last observation before I yield to my good friends is that I \ncontinue to hear comments from the other side that say we should not be \ndrilling because all we say is drill, drill, drill, and that is the \nonly thing, and we don't need to do that; we need alternatives.\n  We can have all the alternatives we would like--and I am surely in \nfavor--but we are going to be using crude oil or something much like \ncrude oil for at least a generation--that means 20 years minimum--\nbecause we cannot get off crude oil any faster. The oil products we use \nfor our cars, our trucks, and our airplanes we cannot change over fast \nenough, so we have to use oil. And if we don't produce more of our own, \nwe all know what we are going to do is buy from others and continue to \nsend the money overseas.\n  It is not just drilling because we want to drill, drill, drill; it is \ndrilling because we don't have enough oil. And if we find more, we \nimport less. That should be good, and the American people sense it is \ngood. That is why so many of them have said let's open the offshore for \ndrilling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I would like to first thank my \ncolleague from New Mexico and ask him a question, because this will be \nthe last year he is serving in this body. He has served in it for many \nyears, very distinguished. It has been my pleasure to get to know him. \nSenator Domenici can be irascible sometimes, but he is always fair. I \nfind he will get on both sides, depending on which way he makes the \ncall.\n  I just saw this, too, that we are not having this Appropriations \nCommittee markup. I am on that committee. I am a relatively new member. \nSenator Allard is on it, and Senator Domenici has served on it in a \ndistinguished capacity for many years.\n  This is really striking. I have not seen this take place. I have not \nbeen in the Senate that long, but I wonder if my colleague has seen \nthat sort of move taking place to stop a major issue that is \nconfronting the American public?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have not seen such a thing. In fact, \nI have said--not as direct as this, but I have said that in 36 years \nbeing a Senator, through thick and thin and bills I have managed, bills \nI have amended, whatever kinds, I have never seen anything where such a \nsimple proposition--can we open lands that we own so they can be \ndrilled, yes or no--I have never seen where it takes 10 days and they \nwaste 10 days of time and still say no. I have never heard of that. Yet \nthe majority, the leader of the Appropriations Committee says in the \nAppropriations Committee there are enough votes to end the offshore \nhindrance that has been there, it says, for two decades or three \ndecades. If the amendments do that, they are awfully scared, right? \nMaybe that is why we didn't get the vote.\n  I think it is other things. I don't think Members on that side wanted \nto vote, win or lose. They didn't want to vote. Now the American people \ncan judge. That is how I see it. They can judge what happened and why.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator from \nKansas to yield because I would like to add additional remarks.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, has \ndone a fabulous job with the energy issue, not just this year when it \nis fashionable--and this is the big issue--but he has devoted his whole \nlegislative career to energy, making it available, how we can use \nresearch and technology to meet the energy needs of this country. He is \nrecognized not only by me but nearly all Members of this Senate for his \nhard work on energy. We all should appreciate that work.\n  I join in the chorus of those who have congratulated Senator Domenici \non a distinguished career. His dedication to energy--I cannot think of \nanother subject one could pick up that would have more of a long-term \nimpact on this country, whether we are talking about economic security, \nwhether we are talking about military security, or whether we are just \ntalking about a secure home where one can rely on utilities and \neverything to have a comfortable lifestyle in this country. The Senator \nneeds to be recognized for that. It is a pleasure for me to do so, as I \nhave served on several committees now with him. He is very articulate \non this subject, and he does a great job.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, and \nI will add one supplement to it because he knows this and maybe we will \njust say it together here. I did devote 10 years, with three or four \nexperts, to seeing if we could bring nuclear power back to life in \nAmerica, instead of leaving it dead, for others to use it as we sit \naround having invented it and wondering what is happening. I did work \non it for 10 years, and then when we did our big bill, we put in \nprovisions that brought it back to life. That does make you feel good. \nYou don't do that alone.\n  We never had a single vote, I say to my friend from Colorado, not one \nvote was taken on any of the bills to try to negate the provisions we \nput in for nuclear power. One would have thought 5 years ago it would \nbe the most contentious issue we could have brought to the floor. In \nthat big Energy bill, there was a whole chapter on nuclear power. \nNobody sought to amend it, change it, anything. That was really a \ncredit to the Senators who worked so hard on nuclear power, and the \nSenator was one of them. Senator Allard has always said he has been \nproud of it. I don't know about the Senator from Kansas, but I assume \nso. He has a good brain, and if you have a good brain and you are a \nreasonable legislator, you couldn't be against nuclear. You just had to \nbe one of these fringe people against everything, scared because we had \nan accident once.\n  If you are scared because you had an accident once, you would not get \nup in the morning. That is what the doctor told my mother. She didn't \nwant me to get out of bed because I had a bad knee. The doctor said: \nThe best thing to do if you don't want him to get hurt is you be his \nmaid. He can stay in bed, and you can serve him food for 25 years. Of \ncourse, he won't amount to anything. And that is true.\n  I am talking on. It is getting close to the end of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. \nI note that when the nuclear industry comes back, I hope one of the \nfirst powerplants has ``Pete Domenici'' written over the archway going \ninto it.\n  We have an excellent nuclear powerplant in Kansas called Wolf Creek. \nMy colleague recognizes this. It has been in operation for 25 years. It \nhad huge protests before it got built. People were protesting the train \nthat carried some of the main core elements into this spot. It has been \noperating efficiently, cleanly. It doesn't put off CO2. It \nwas a huge investment that has been fantastic for our whole State. And \nit was a capital expense. It was expensive on the capital side of it, \nsubstantially so, but, boy, does it run well. It has been good to see. \nAnd if we need to bring that back, we need to bring it back on a cost-\nefficient basis, but that was one of our key elements on moving this \nforward and moving our car fleet with more electricity. But we are \ngoing to need that base power generation, and we want it clean, and \nhere is a good spot to do it.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are 16 applications to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission as of the day before yesterday--16--for new nuclear \npowerplants; in some cases, two plants at one site, both construction \nand design applications. We had zero the day we adopted the new Energy \nbill. For once it seems as if we did something right; doesn't it?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I agree.\n  Madam President, I join my colleagues from New Mexico and Colorado\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\nin talking about the energy issue, and I particularly want to associate \nmyself with the comments of the Senator from New Mexico, who responded \nthat we are not just focusing on drill, drill, drill. The point of the \nmatter is two numbers. Those two numbers are 25 and 3. Twenty-five \npercent of the world's oil is consumed by the United States, and we \nproduce 3 percent.\n  Now, how long can we operate that way?\n  You can say, as my colleague from New Mexico has pointed out: Well, \nOK, we are going to get off oil. We want some alternative. Lord knows, \nI want an alternative. I want more ethanol, which is produced in my \nState. I want it produced out of cellulose. The problem is, if we \nturned off oil tomorrow, we are not in a position to produce enough of \nthat or virtually anything else. We are going to need to use oil for \nsome period of time, and that 25 and 3 ratio doesn't work--our \nconsuming 25 percent and producing 3 percent--when we could produce \nprobably a good 50 percent more. Who knows what the actual number is. \nWe know it is much higher than what it currently is.\n  For every dollar we are not spending on oil here, we are spending it \nsomewhere else. They are building these huge indoor sea complexes in \nDubai in the Middle East and lavish buildings. They are building \nislands, whole islands, beautifully designed like a palm tree. That \ntakes huge amounts of money.\n  You sit there for just 2 minutes, and you think: Where is all that \nmoney coming from, I wonder? It is coming from our consumers' \npocketbooks when people are pulling up at the gas station and paying \n100 bucks or more for gas to fill up. Hopefully, there are people who \nhave vehicles that are using substantially less than that, but the \npoint is, it is a huge transfer of wealth from here to there, and it \ndoesn't have to take place when we can produce it here.\n  I would rather that money be going to Kansas or Colorado to work on \ntheir oil shale or to Alaska or to offshore areas but certainly working \nhere. We have a Federal deficit that is taking place. What if instead \nof us shipping $500 billion overseas for oil, we were spending that \nmoney here. Then 20 percent comes into our Federal coffers. That is the \ngeneral figure. I think that is a bit high, but it is about that right \nnow. So you have $100 billion coming here in tax revenues. It is just \ncommon sense.\n  My dad farms, and I have been talking with him about this issue. He \nis paying a lot for diesel fuel because he runs the tractors on diesel, \nand he is paying more than he used to. He is saying: Why aren't we \ndoing this here? And I have a hard time explaining to him why we are \nnot doing it here, when we could do it here, when we have the capacity, \nthe ability, and the technology in the market.\n  I say: Well, some people don't want us to.\n  Well, why?\n  Well, they are scared of what is going to take place in the \nenvironment, even though we can do it environmentally sound. Someone is \ngoing to be doing it somewhere else. Are they going to do it more \nenvironmentally sound than us? I don't think so. I know they are not \ngoing to in some of the places I have seen around the world. The U.S. \nstandards are the highest in the world.\n  So I would plead with my colleagues that drilling is part of the \nanswer. It is clearly part of the answer when our numbers are 25 and 3; \nwhen we use 25 percent of the world's oil and produce 3 percent of it. \nWe have to get our numbers up. It helps to balance the trade, it helps \nour deficit, it helps our people, and it spends it here at home.\n  That is why I continue to join my colleagues in voting that we stay \non energy instead of going to other issues. I would like to solve some \nof these other issues as well, as would my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor. I want to deal with them. I want to deal with all these issues. \nBut when you pass up the biggest issue that is confronting most \nAmericans, and you don't deal with it, and for 9 days you don't deal \nwith it when you could be, we are just simply saying: Let's deal with \nthe biggest one here, and then we will be happy to deal with these \nother issues. We need to deal with these other things, but not until \nyou deal with the biggest one. If we don't deal with it now, are we \ngoing to deal with it this year? I don't think so. I don't think that \nwill happen. We are not going to get more time, nor will we have more \npolitical will the closer it gets to the election.\n  So now is the time, now is the place, now is when the American people \nwant us to deal with this matter. So I join my colleagues in continuing \nto vote this way; that we take up these amendments to increase \nproduction in the United States.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before I leave, I want to say to the Senator from \nColorado, who is standing here patiently, that he might recall that the \nSenator from New Mexico went up and visited Colorado and Utah to see \nthe oil shale before we had the big bill, where we put everything \ntogether.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I do remember.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was prompted to do that by you, to find out why we \nweren't doing anything with that shale. We found out that we didn't \nhave any leasing laws that permitted it. I recall it was at your \ninstigation that we put the first laws in the energy impact bill, the \nbig bill, allowing leases for research and development. That is what \nhas brought the development they are all worried about. It is a \nresearch and development lease.\n  Now they don't want to have any, as you put it, rules or regulations, \nso they can stop it dead after we got a good start. We understood that \nShell Oil was ready to try a new process. They were going to spend more \nthan a few billion dollars on it, and we found that out and said: Well, \nwe ought to at least give them a chance. And we did, thanks to you. But \nnow they won't let us vote on getting rid of the moratorium, so that is \ndead in the water too--that great big resource.\n\n  So I thank you.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Well, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \ngracious remarks and, again, it is a statement of his statesmanship to \nactually go and visit the site and find out what is going on. That is \nwhy he makes such a great legislator in the Senate.\n  I am with my colleagues. I am sick and tired of delays. It is time \nfor us to move ahead. I have a chart: There have been six attempts by \nthe Democrats to change the subject from $4-a-gallon gas, all while \npeople are suffering at the gas pump and we are having dramatic adverse \neffects on our economy. We are getting ready for the school year, and \nschool districts are struggling with how they are going to get fuel for \nthe school buses. We have farmers and ranchers starting to put up their \ncrops, and they are wondering how they are going to get money to pay \nfor fuel, which is a major cost. It just doesn't balance out for us.\n  So I am very concerned that we have had these six attempts to move \noff of $4-a-gallon gas when it is such a vital issue. I can't think of \nanother issue since I have been here that has had this profound an \nimpact on people's lives. We shouldn't be delaying or stopping this \nmatter.\n  There have been other subtle attempts on the other side, even if we \nmove forward, to delay the development of energy, and let me cite a \ncouple of examples.\n  One is the offshore drilling provisions, which we have in our Gas \nPrice Reduction Act on the Republican side, where we look at the \noffshore drilling--the deep ocean drilling. We have had Members stand \nhere on the Senate floor and say: Well, I am all in favor of that, but \nwe haven't gone ahead and done the seismographic studies to figure out \nwhere our deposits are.\n  Well, we have been trying for years, mostly through Senator \nDomenici's efforts, to try to get the money to do the seismographic \nstudies so we know how much and where those deposits are. But there is \ndelay before we actually get to it.\n  So Members will stand up and say: Well, I am all for offshore \ndrilling, but we need to do the studies. Well, they won't support the \nstudies and the money to get it done. Let's take oil shale, for \nexample. What we need to do is to put the regulations in place so that \nwhen the technology is developed and we are ready to move forward with \ndevelopment, we can do that in a phased process. But, no, we are not \ngoing to let the regulations go forward, which ends up being an \nadditional\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\ndelay when the technology is ready to go.\n  So I am hoping--and I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho had proposed the amendment I had made in the Appropriations \nCommittee a little earlier this afternoon--it was objected to on the \nfloor--where we said, let's move ahead with rules and regulations. Then \nin the amendment it says that we will delay development until 2011 \nbecause the technology for development won't be in place any sooner \nthan that. So that was acceptable. The Department of the Interior has \ngot the rules and regulations. They are out there for public comment, \nbut that is all the further they can go.\n  If we continue what we have been doing year after year, we have \nstopped the development of oil shale dead in its tracks. Even worse \nthan that, when it is ready for development, we will have delayed it \nthat much more because we haven't done the things up front that will \nallow the oil companies to begin to look at what their lease agreements \nmight be, as the Senator mentioned from his visit, or what the royalty \npayments might be or what the remediation issues may be when they move \nin with oil shale.\n  I happen to think the technology we are developing in Colorado is \nenvironmentally friendly, and it is not a mining operation. You freeze \nout an area of the ground, you heat out the middle of it, and you get a \nhigh-quality fuel out of there which will help us meet our energy \nneeds. The hydrocarbons we get out of the ground, I think all of us \nrealize these are nonrenewable resources. At some point in time, we are \ngoing to have to do something else other than just rely on those. But \nright now they are the bridge. They are our bridge to renewable \nenergies.\n  I have heard comments on the Senate floor against the Republicans; \nthat all we are interested in is drill, drill, drill. Republicans, to a \nperson, believe that we need to use our hydrocarbons to bridge, and \nthey understand we need the new technology. We are not saying exclude \nanything. On the other side they are saying: We will just go with \nrenewables. We will let $4 a gallon stand. Who cares. Let it go to $5. \nLet it keep going to $7.50, even to $10 a gallon. We don't care because \nthe high cost of gasoline will encourage conservation.\n  I think there are other ways we can encourage conservation, and I \nthink a lot of it is happening today. But that is certainly not the way \nto do it because it has such a dramatic adverse impact on our economy, \nand it has an adverse impact on the security of this country.\n  Both my colleague from Kansas and New Mexico talked about how all of \nour dollars are going overseas, more than $700 billion a year going \noverseas to support the economies of our adversaries. They are the ones \nwho don't support what we are trying to do: to spread democracy around \nthe world. They would like to see us go away.\n  So I think we need to take a serious look at our alternative \nenergies, and we need to act now to do something to increase \nhydrocarbons and do something to reduce the price of gas at the gas \npump.\n  There is one area of the economy that I don't think we have talked \nmuch about, and that is the trucking industry. Talk about renewables. \nWhat is going to provide the energy for trucks? What renewables do we \nhave for trucks? I know some trucking companies are looking forward to \ngoing to propane to help a little bit, but there is not much substitute \nout there on renewables for the diesel engine right now. The diesel \nengine is what we use in trains, in trucking, in farming, and it is not \ngoing to be an easy solution for us to come up with an alternative fuel \nfor diesel. We need to do what we can to hold down the cost of those \nkinds of fuels because that new technology is going to take a while to \ndevelop. We can't just shut it off today and expect our economy to \nfunction when it is such a vital part of what is happening in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note that you just used a word a minute ago--\n``bridge.'' I think you have heard me speak of the bridge. You see, the \nbridge is how you are going to get from where you are now, with an \neconomy that is using hydrocarbons to move itself, to do all kinds of \nthings; how we are going to get from there to an economy that has no \nmore of that. That is a bridge.\n  Most interesting, the bridge is going to be crude oil because the \nonly way you can get there is to stay alive, to have an economy, to \nproduce, to get things done. And to get across that bridge you have to \nhave crude oil because there is nothing else to get you there. You \ncannot put everything in parking lots and in abeyance until you find \nwhat is on the other side of the bridge.\n\n  The truth is, we have to produce crude oil for perhaps a decade. You \nsaid 10, 15, 20 years. That is my guess. Even if all these things work, \nthe automobile where you can turn it on with a switch, everything that \nwe can do, we are still going to be, what I say, stuck in the mud--the \noil mud.\n  Whether people like it or not, Americans have it right. They are \nsaying drill some more, they are not saying drill less. Six months ago, \neverybody was afraid of the word. Now they are not afraid of it because \npeople understand if you have more of that stuff called oil you might \npay less. Costs might come down.\n  I thank the Senator for his understanding, and I am pleased to be \nwith him.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague from Colorado will yield as well?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. There is another bridge I would like to talk about, \nand that is the continuing resolution. I wish to point out to my \ncolleagues these are annual limitations on drilling offshore, in the \noil shale. These are annual things put in, these limitations. There is \na building coalition and consensus of people saying I don't want those \nlimitations put on this year's appropriations. We do a continuing \nresolution as a bridge. I am warning my colleagues if this doesn't get \nvoted on and dealt with, I think you are going to see people starting \nto say: I am not willing to put that into that bridge funding into next \nyear.\n  I hope we can work this out on something on offshore drilling, on oil \nshale development of rules, before we get to that continuing resolution \npiece where this would normally, or often, be put in. People are saying \nI do not want that in this financing bill for the Government, the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his support. I \ncouldn't agree more with him. It is time we stop these tactics that are \ncausing the price of gas to get so high. Obviously, before the summer \nbreak, it doesn't look like we are going to have an opportunity to deal \nwith the issue of bringing down the price of gas. Come September, we \nare going to have to do something more dramatic than what we have at \nthis point. If it means we have to stop the continuing resolution with \nmoratorium language in it, I think at that point in time we may have to \nmake a strong stand--at that particular point in time. I predict we are \nnot going to see that much of a decrease in the cost of gasoline and \ndiesel fuel at the gas pump.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas for his comments and for his support. \nWe talked about how various aspects of the economy are being impacted \nby the high price of gas. I was at a press conference earlier. We had \nrepresentatives speak on how the poor are getting adversely impacted, \nmore than any other part of the population in the United States, \nbecause of the high cost of fuel. We had a member from the Congress of \nRacial Equality. We had Bishop Harry Jackson, who talked about the High \nImpact Leadership Coalition. We heard from the All Nations Pentecostal \nChurch of God in Christ talk about how the poor they were dealing with \nwere being so impacted by the high cost of fuel. We had a number of \npeople from all aspects of life, including veterans. We had also \nconsumer groups. We had the Farm Bureau and we had Americans for \nAmerican Energy, all there at that press conference, talking about how \nletting the price of fuel get so high was actually a war on the poor. I \nthought that was a rather dramatic way of putting it.\n  We need to think a little bit about the fact, if we allow the price \nof gas to get high like this, there is a lower income section of our \nsociety that is going to be dramatically impacted because they do not \nhave the reserve capacity to pick up the costs of fuel that is \nimpacting their lives.\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\n  We need to act now. We should not be putting it off. I have been \ndisappointed that we have not been able, as Republicans, to put our \namendments forward on the floor. The majority leader has changed his \nview--we will go up to four, we will let in some amendments--and then \nall of a sudden we are at none. We are back to the none right now.\n  We need to move forward. I see my time is expiring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes at this time, that Senator Leahy be recognized \nimmediately following me for 10 minutes, and the remainder of the time \nbe given to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nHigher Education Opportunity Act.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that I would not be speaking here today \nif it were not for the kind of assistance we will be voting on today.\n  I would not have been able to go from the small tenement apartment I \ngrew up in to the halls of the United States Senate if it were not for \nour Federal Government's commitment to educating our young people, no \nmatter what neighborhood they grow up in, no matter how much money \ntheir parents make, no matter what their ethnicity or the color of \ntheir skin.\n  I was the first person in my family to attend college, and then law \nschool, thanks to Pell Grants and Perkins loans. The fact that I could \nget a quality education and was willing to work hard-work meant that \nthe American promise was real for me. And I believe that providing \nevery child with the same opportunities I had--so they can achieve \ntheir God-given potential--should be the unalienable birthright of \nevery American.\n  Supporting our children's future isn't just a social responsibility, \nit is an economic necessity. Just a few decades ago, workers could find \na good paying job and comfortably raise a family on the strength of \ntheir high school diploma. But times have changed.\n  If we are going to stay on the apex of the curve of innovation, if we \nare going to be the economic power we were in the 20th century going \nforward into the 21st century--a century that increasingly belongs to \nthose who innovate--we have to do all we can to educate our children \nand prepare them to compete.\n  Unfortunately, we are in danger of falling behind. At the same time \nwe are seeing higher education become increasingly more important, we \nare seeing it become increasingly less affordable.\n  We are seeing students pass up the opportunity to go on for a higher \ndegree, because they are so pressured to pay their bills today that \nthey can't focus on what is best for them tomorrow. We are seeing so \nmany students who do go to college leave with two pieces of paper that \nthey will carry for the rest of their lives--their diploma in one hand, \nand the bill for their tuition loans in the other. What we need now is \na brainpower stimulus package: a brainpower stimulus package that will \nmake college more accessible and more affordable so that higher \neducation is not reserved only for the wealthy; a brainpower stimulus \npackage that will improve and modernize our Nation's colleges and \nuniversities so they will remain the greatest and most distinguished in \nthe world; a brainpower stimulus package that will protect students \nfrom unscrupulous lenders and ensure they are getting the best deals \npossible when they invest in their education with private loans; and a \nbrainpower stimulus package that will close the achievement gap, \nbecause in this great Nation, the darkness of your skin should not \ndiminish the brightness of your future.\n\n  The package we pass must honor and respect our soldiers and their \nfamilies and provide them with the same opportunity and promise that \nthey have given so much to defend.\n  Today we have the opportunity, and the responsibility, to make \neducation a national priority and commit ourselves to accepting nothing \nless than greatness from our educational system. The Higher Education \nOpportunity Act would take enormous strides to accomplish many of these \ngoals by increasing Government assistance for students, families, and \ninstitutions of higher learning. Allow me to take a moment to point out \nsome crucial aspects of this bill.\n  Recognizing the dramatic increases in tuition over the years, this \nbill would increase Pell Grants and Perkins Loans would also permit \nlow-income students to receive Pell Grants all year round, so they can \nafford to stay in school and earn their diplomas quicker. As tuition \ncosts continue to skyrocket, we need to do everything we can to ensure \nthat every child has the ability to soar to the highest heights of \nachievement.\n  In the wake of the recent student lending scandal, we must protect \nour students from deceptive loans that often leave them mired in debt \neven before they receive their diploma. This bill would establish \nstrong standards to prevent schools from playing favorites with lenders \ndue to expensive gifts they were given and ensure students are given \nthe best rates possible.\n  This bill would work to narrow the achievement gap between Caucasians \nand minorities by investing in Minority Serving Institutions, Hispanic \nServing Institutions, and enhancing vital programs such as TRIO and \nGEAR-UP.\n  It would reauthorize funding for Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities and Predominantly Black Institutions and expand their \nmasters programs, by providing $500,000 per year in mandatory funding \nto each of these institutions for 6 years.\n  This bill would also honor the dedication and commitment of our armed \nforces and their families by helping servicemembers, veterans, and \ntheir families attend and pay for college by providing interest-free \ndeferral on student loans while servicemembers are on active duty and \nin-State tuition rates if they are not stationed in their home State.\n  Finally, it would establish new college scholarships of up to $5,000 \nfor children and family members of servicemembers who have died since \n9/11.\n  When one of our brave servicemembers gives their life in defense of \nour country, they are not the only ones sacrificing--rather their sons \nand daughters; husband and wife; and often mother and father have also \ngiven the most precious thing in their lives for our country. Like \ntheir cherished loved one, they deserve more than anybody the \nopportunity and promise that makes this country so great and worth \ndefending and sacrificing for.\n\n  Our Nation faces great challenges to meet the demands of global \ninnovation and competition, but as i true with all great challenges, we \nalso have a great opportunity--an opportunity to invest in our most \nimportant resource: our children; an opportunity to spur our economy \nand develop new, innovative industries that create high paying jobs \nthat cannot be outsourced; and an opportunity to prepare our students \nand strengthen our economy so America remains a leader in the world--\nnot just during the onset of the 20 century, but throughout it.\n  A nation that is united in its purpose can answer that challenge, as \nwe have so many times throughout our history. Just as an entire \ngeneration before us was once inspired to dream new dreams of reaching \nspace and landing a man on the moon, so must we set our sights to the \nheavens and be the next great generation of leaders and innovators.\n  The time has come to make a robust, national commitment to the \neducation of our youth at all levels, from kindergarten through \ngraduate school, from technological institutes in our inner cities to \ncenters of agricultural research in the heartland.\n  New generations of doctors and lawyers, artists and engineers, \ncaptains of industry and commanders of our Armed Forces, are depending \non what we do here today.\n  This legislation has been in the works for a long time. We are a \nlittle late on the assignment, but we can still get an ``A'' for \nfinally taking the time to turn it in.\n  I certainly hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nallow us to make this happen today.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of any time I may have to \nSenator Leahy.\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey. I wish to discuss two matters that involve the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                                Immunity\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Federal court evaluating the \ncontempt charges against former White House Counsel Harriet Miers made \na very significant ruling. The court's ruling is a complete rejection \nof the Bush administration's unprecedented and unfounded blanket claim \nof executive privilege and immunity. The Court's ruling is a rebuke of \nthis White House's arrogant coverup and stonewalling, an arrogant \ncoverup designed to shield from public view the inappropriate and even \nillegal actions of this administration. It is also a reaffirmation of \nthe principle of separate, coequal branches of our Government, \nsomething that has guided our Republic since its inception and \nsomething this administration has tried to ignore by making its best \nefforts to accrue unchecked Executive power.\n  I commend Judge Bates. He is a former prosecutor, a Republican \nappointed by President Bush. I commend Speaker Pelosi and Chairman \nConyers for their steadfastness in pressing this matter.\n  I have long pointed out this administration's claims of executive \nprivilege and immunity, which White House officials have used to \njustify refusing even to show up when the Congress has subpoenaed them, \nare wrong. Last November, in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I issued a \nruling that the White House's privilege and immunity claims were not \nlegally valid to excuse Karl Rove and White House Chief of Staff Josh \nBolten from appearing, testifying and producing documents related to \nthe Judiciary Committee's investigations into the unprecedented firing \nand manipulation of U.S. attorneys. Mr. Rove and Mr. Bolten's continued \nnoncompliance with the committee's subpoenas, even after my ruling, led \nthe committee to vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. Even with \nthat, they have put themselves above the law by refusing to appear and \ntestify.\n  This week the House Judiciary Committee also cited Mr. Rove for \ncontempt. They had previously cited Ms. Miers for her failure to \nappear, as well as Mr. Bolten.\n  It is long past time for senior administration officials to abide by \nthe law and appear before Congress to offer testimony, testimony that \nis compelled by subpoena. This administration places themselves above \nthe law. What the court said is none of us is above the law, not even \nthe President of the United States, and especially not the people who \nwork for and take orders from the President of the United States. They \nare not above the law. I commend the court for making that clear.\n  In fact, the ruling by Judge Bates could not have been more plain. He \nwrote:\n\n       [T]he Executive's current claim of absolute immunity from \n     compelled Congressional process for senior Presidential aides \n     is without any support in the case law.\n\n  I will be sending letters to Karl Rove's lawyer and the White House \ncounsel to schedule Mr. Rove's and Mr. Bolten's long-overdue \nappearances before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In fact, Judge Bates \nexplained why the Bush-Cheney administration's blanket immunity claims \nwere an unjustified encroachment upon the constitutional powers of \nCongress. The judge wrote:\n\n       [I]f the Executive's absolute immunity argument were to \n     prevail, Congress could be left with no recourse to obtain \n     information that is plainly not subject to any colorable \n     claim of executive privilege.\n\n  This result, which the court concluded was ``unacceptable,'' would be \nthat the ``Executive's proposed absolute immunity would thus deprive \nCongress of even non-privileged information.''\n  Many of us have said that this is an administration that considers \nthemselves above the law, that the law applies to everybody except \nthem. Well, the court has said the law applies to them just as it does \nto all other Americans. Despite the administration's attempts at every \nturn to short circuit Congress--even the courts--from being able to \nevaluate the executive privilege and immunity claims, Judge Bates's \nconcurrence in these principles is a significant milestone.\n  I will be sending a letter today to Attorney General Mukasey. I am \ngoing to ask when he intends to withdraw the erroneous Office of Legal \nCouncil opinion from Stephen Bradbury relied upon by the White House to \njustify its noncompliance with congressional subpoenas since that \nopinion has been repudiated by a court and the court has said that this \nadministration, the Attorney General, the White House--all have to \nabide by the law. In addition, I intend to ask the Attorney General \nwhether the court decision will cause them to reevaluate the \nDepartment's memoranda and opinions that have supported overbroad and \nunsubstantiated executive privilege claims not only in the \ninvestigation of the firing and manipulation of the U.S. attorneys but \nalso in other matters, such as the claims used to block Congress when \ninvestigating warrantless wiretapping, or the leak of the name of \nundercover CIA agent Valerie Plame for political retribution, or even \nWhite House interference in the Environmental Protection Agency's \ndecisionmaking to protect corporations at the expense of Americans' \nhealth.\n  The court's decision undercuts the White House's blanket claims in \nall of these matters. The judge wrote that:\n\n       Clear precedent and persuasive policy reasons confirm that \n     the executive cannot be the judge of its own privilege.\n\n  That is why we have asked for over a year for the White House to \nprovide us with the specific legal basis for those claims and their \nvalidity. What the White House has said is they do not have to obey the \nlaw. They can break the law, they are above the law, and when they are \nasked: What do you base that on? What is it that says you are above the \nlaw and the people who work for you are above the law? their answer is: \nBecause we say so. That is it. They do not point to any statute, they \ndo not point to any case law, they do not point to anything except \ntheir own arrogance in stonewalling the people of this country who want \nto know what they are doing. That is not the way to have a nation of \nlaws. You cannot have one person decide the law will apply to you, the \nlaw will apply to me, the law will apply to everybody in this Chamber \nbut will not apply to the President or the people who work for him.\n  I will continue to ask whether the White House's continued assertion \nof executive privilege in this matter means the President takes \nresponsibility for the decision to fire well-performing prosecutors. To \ndate, after more than a year and a half, he has not done so. Instead, \nhe seeks to have it both ways: Well, ``mistakes were made''--by others, \nof course, yet somehow, executive privilege still applies.\n  The White House's other blanket assertion says there is no wrongdoing \nin the firings. We have asked: What was the basis for that? They \nprovide none. If the White House has information that led the President \nand others to discount the evidence of wrongdoing the investigating \ncommittees have gathered so far, that should be produced. Otherwise, we \nhave to conclude they do not have any and it does not exist.\n  To the contrary, the Judiciary Committee's investigation which led to \nthe resignation of the Attorney General, the entire senior leadership \nof the Justice Department, and several high-ranking White House \npolitical officials has uncovered grave threats to the independence of \nlaw enforcement from political manipulation in the highest political \nranks in the White House, including Karl Rove. The evidence shows that \nsenior officials were apparently focused on the political impact of \nFederal prosecutions and whether Federal prosecutors were doing enough \nto bring partisan voter fraud and corruption cases. It has long been \napparent that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as \npart of a cover up.\n\n  The tragic and corrupt politicization of Federal law enforcement by \nthis administration is wrong. Reports released by the Justice \nDepartment's Inspector General and Office of Professional \nResponsibility, the latest just this week, have shown the reach of the \npolitical operatives of this administration, infecting the hiring for \ncareer prosecutors and immigration judges with improper and illegal \npolitical loyalty tests designed to embed ``loyal Bushies'' throughout \nthe Department. So far, neither the Justice Department\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nnor the White House has taken responsibility. Apparently, the White \nHouse intends its excuses that ``mistakes were made'' and that there \nwere just a ``few bad apples'' to suffice. What we have uncovered is a \nwidespread effort described by the Department's own Inspector General \nas ``systemic'', one that involved the highest ranking office holders \nat the Justice Department funneling White House loyalists into career \npositions.\n  The White House's response to the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nsubpoenas has been to assert blanket claims of executive privilege and \nnovel claims of absolute immunity to block current and former officials \nfrom complying. Based on these claims, neither Mr. Rove nor Mr. Bolten \neven appeared before the Committee to respond to the subpoenas. Now, a \ncourt has said that they must.\n  The effects of the White House's assertions of privilege and immunity \nhave been unmistakable, amounting to the withholding of critical \nevidence related to the congressional investigation. And all along they \nhave contended that their blanket claim of privilege cannot be tested \nbut must be accepted by the Congress as the last word. Today's ruling \nfrom Judge Bates is a resounding rejection of this White House's \nattempt to thwart accountability and a reaffirmation of Congress's \nability to conduct oversight and the right of the American people to \nlearn the truth about their government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, those of us who serve in the Senate \nserve in a political system. John F. Kennedy used to say that every \nmother hopes a child might grow up to be President as long as they do \nnot have to be active in politics. But, of course, politics is the \nprocess within which we make decisions--a very honorable process. But \nit is not new to the political system to hear evidence of false claims. \nIn fact, it is a time-honored tradition in politics to hear at least \nsome people in striped pants stand up and make all kinds of false \nclaims.\n  It has reached, I must say, some new heights on the floor of the \nSenate in the last couple of weeks. As I was listening to some of these \nthings in the Senate, particularly on energy and some of the claims \nthat have been made, I was thinking about when I was a little boy and \nthe carnival would come to my small town of 300 people. You can imagine \nthe size of a carnival that would come to a town of 300 and actually \npitch a tent.\n  One of the things I remember about a carnival coming to town is it \nhad a sideshow. And the sideshow in every carnival, I suppose, is the \nsame. They paint the canvas on the sideshow with unbelievably bright \npaintings, and then they have a barker, a carnival barker, and they \nsay: Come in here and see the woman with two heads; come in here and \nsee the world's fatest man; come in and see the sideshow and see the \nman born with an alligator's tail. And my eyes were like dinner plates, \nthinking, boy this is going to be something. And none of that was in \nthere. I mean, it was, you know, these big old claims.\n  Well, let me talk a little about big old claims that are not true \nhere in the Senate. We have been hearing them now for 2 weeks.\n  We have an energy problem. It is a significant problem. The price of \noil and gas doubled in a year, bouncing up to $120, $140 a barrel. The \nprice of gasoline--$4, $4.50 a gallon--doubled in a year.\n  So our colleagues on the minority side come to the floor of the \nSenate. They have this voice track. It goes over and over and over; it \nis called looping. They say: Do you know what the problem is? We know \nwhat the problem is: The Democrats will not let anybody drill.\n  Well, it is an interesting discussion but not true. It reminds me of \nWill Rogers, who said: It is not what he knows that bothers me, it is \nwhat he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.\n  It is not true that people on this side of the Senate Chamber do not \nwant anybody to drill. It is simply not true. I have brought out chart \nafter chart showing so much that is open for drilling. In fact, I was \none of four Senators who helped open what is called lease 181 in the \nGulf of Mexico, 8 million acres. Four of us--myself, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Bingaman, and Senator Talent from Missouri--introduced a bill \nsaying: Let's open 8 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico that has \nsubstantial oil and natural gas deposits. Let's open that. You know \nwhat, we did it, in a bipartisan manner. And 2 years later, there is \nnot a bit of activity on that 8 million acres.\n  Our colleagues rush over to the floor of the Senate and say: Well, \nthe Democrats are at fault. They will not let you drill.\n  It is not true. There are many areas that are open for drilling, and \nwe have supported that. Oh, I do not support a goofy proposition that \nis ricocheting around here that says: You know what, let's go to the \nOuter Continental Shelf, which belongs to all of America and which is \nnot yet open, and let's let Governors of States decide whether it \nshould be opened. I mean, that stands goofiness on its head. The Outer \nContinental Shelf belongs to all of the American people. That does not \nbelong to a State. That does not belong to a Governor. That is an \nabsurd proposition.\n  So they come to floor of the Senate with their chart, and it says: \nProduce more, use less. But you know what the problem is: the actions \ndo not match the words. Let me describe what I mean by that.\n  Let me say that I support producing more. I am fine with drilling \nholes. I am fine with finding oil and gas. But our colleagues have this \nmindset of yesterday forever. Every 10 or 15 years, they shuffle into \nthis Chamber, sort of slouched over with their hands in their pockets, \nsaying: Let's drill some more. That is just yesterday forever.\n  I am for drilling, but what we ought to be doing is other things to \nchange the mix, to change our energy future. You know, almost 65 \npercent of the oil we use comes from off our shore, from the Saudis, \nKuwait, Iraq, Venezuela. That makes us enormously vulnerable. We need \nsomething that is game changing, that means different kinds of energy.\n  Yes, let's produce more, then let's produce different energy, and \nlet's conserve more as well. But when you talk about the issue of \nproduction, it is not just drilling a hole for oil. That is what our \ncolleagues believe. Production is also taking energy from the wind and \nproducing electricity. Production is taking energy from the Sun and \nproducing electricity. Production is the biofuels from corn or \ncellulose to produce gasoline and ethanol. Production is biomass and \ngeothermal. Production is all of that.\n  Now, eight times in a little over a year we have had votes on the \nfloor of the Senate to extend the tax incentives for renewable energy. \nEight times, those who come to the floor with their little charts \ntalking about producing more, eight times they have said: No, we will \nnot support it. Now, let me tell those who listen to this why they will \nnot support it--because it costs some money in the short term to \nprovide tax incentives to get people to invest in renewable energy.\n  We ought to do renewable energy in a big way. This ought to be game \nchanging. It ought to make us much less dependent on the Saudis and \nKuwaitis and others. You do that, it seems to me, by changing the \nenergy mix.\n  My colleagues do not support that on the other side of the aisle. Do \nyou know why? Because it costs money to provide tax incentives. So we \npay for that. We are deep in debt in this country, but we pay for it \nbecause it ought to be paid for in the bill we have offered. So my \ncolleagues vote against it.\n  Let me describe why. One of our pay-fors to help provide these tax \nincentives for renewable energy is to shut down this unbelievable tax \nbreak that exists by which hedge fund managers can take their billions \nof dollars and move them through tax shelters overseas and avoid paying \ntaxes to the United States of America. My colleagues oppose closing \nthat loophole. They stand with the ability to move hedge fund income \noverseas to shelter it so they do not have to pay taxes. That is \nunbelievable. I mean, part of the process in this Chamber, at least, \nis: Who do you stand for? How on Earth do you want to go home and say: \nYou know what, I decided to vote eight times against incentivizing \nsubstantial additional production of renewable energy, energy from the \nwind, from the\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nSun and so on, to make us less dependent on the Saudis. I voted against \nthat because I demand and insist that hedge fund managers have a right \nto run their income through the Cayman Islands and avoid paying U.S. \ntaxes.\n  Get a chart. If you want to get a chart, print that up in a chart and \ntake it to the Rotary Club and say: Here is who I stand with. Here is \nwhat I stand for. Explain that at home.\n  How on Earth do you get by with that? I do not understand it at all. \nYou bring a chart to the floor and say ``produce more.'' Well, let me \ntell you how you produce more--the renewable energy production tax \ncredit.\n  Let me tell you what we have done in this country. We said a long \ntime ago, 1916: If you go looking for oil and gas, we like that. We \nwant you to find oil and gas because we have an economy that needs it. \nSo you go drilling, good for you; we give you robust permanent tax \nincentives. We have done that for nearly a century. Here is what we did \nfor people who tried to do new technologies that take energy from the \nwind and the Sun and so on--a production tax credit for renewable \nenergy.\n  In 1992, we said: We will give you tax incentives to expand renewable \nenergy, kind of shallow tax incentives. By the way, they are going to \nbe short term, so they will expire. We extended them five times for a \nshort term. We let them expire three times. It was stutter, stop, \nstart, stutter, stop. It was an unbelievably pathetic approach.\n  Some of us believe we ought to go 10 years and say: Here is where \nAmerica is headed. You want to join us, we are going to be here for 10 \nyears trying to develop America's renewable energy so we can become \nless dependent on oil from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. But my colleagues from the \nminority come to floor of the Senate and have opposed it all along the \nway. They have opposed it eight times. In fact, the people who oppose \nthis have come to the floor of the Senate and said: We need more \nelectric-drive vehicles. We need to move toward plug-in hybrid \nvehicles. You bet we do. That means substantial investment in battery \ntechnology. That is in the bill, by the way, that you voted against. \nThat means substantial investment in renewables. If you are going to \ndrive electric vehicles, you are going to have to have electricity.\n  They vote against that, vote against all of this, and then come to \nthe floor and say: We need the product of this to do what we want to do \nto drive electric vehicles. It is unbelievable.\n  I have described this probably 20 times in the Senate. Perhaps some \nget tired of it, but we are trying to do something here. We have been \nstopped, which is frustrating. It is the easiest thing in the world to \nstop progress. The minority has demonstrated that now for 2 weeks. I \nhave described Mark Twain when he was asked if he would engage in a \ndebate once. He said: Sure, I would be happy to engage in a debate, as \nlong as I can take the negative side. They said: No one has told you \nthe subject of the debate. Mark Twain said: The subject doesn't matter. \nThe negative side will require no preparation.\n  It doesn't require any skill or preparation to take the negative side \nof anything. So for 2 weeks we have tried to pass legislation to wring \nthe speculation out of the oil futures market. Seventy-one percent of \nthat market is now controlled by speculators who don't want a thing to \ndo with oil. They wouldn't lift a quart of oil. They want to trade \npaper and make money. We are trying to shut down excess speculation. \nWhat we have found is our colleagues, when the question is, who do you \nstand with, they say: We will stand with the oil speculators. We will \nblock that.\n  Eight times we bring a bill to the floor that says, let's at least \nprovide incentives to try to change the plan at this point and begin \nsubstantially increasing the use of renewable energy. Eight times our \ncolleagues have voted against that.\n  Let me go through what this would have provided, what we tried to do: \na renewable energy production tax credit, solar and fuel cell \ninvestment tax credits, clean renewable energy tax credit bonds, tax \nincentives for plug-in electric drive vehicles. The list goes on and \non, all things we should be doing. Eight times we have lost the vote to \nproceed because the minority, which says they support all of this, has \ndecided they don't want to close the a loophole that allows hedge fund \nmanagers to run their incomes through the Cayman Islands and other tax \nhavens in order to avoid paying taxes. We close the loophole to help \npay for all of this, and our colleagues have an apoplectic seizure. You \ncan't do that, they say.\n  I don't understand. It is beyond me that they believe it is going to \nwork to come to the floor of the Senate and make a claim that is a \nfalse claim that somehow the majority party doesn't support drilling. \nOf course we do.\n  Let me describe it from a parochial standpoint. The biggest drilling \nplay in America right now is in eastern Montana and western North \nDakota. The U.S. Geological Survey did an assessment at my request. The \nU.S. Geological Survey and I announced about 3 months ago that that is \nthe largest assessment of recoverable oil ever made in the lower 48 \nStates; 3.6 billion barrels to 4.3 billion barrels of oil using today's \ntechnology are going to be recoverable. We have up to 75 drilling rigs \nactive right now, drilling a well about every 30 or 35 days, moving \nevery 30 or 35 days to a new well site. It is the biggest oil play in \nour country. I fully support that. It makes a lot of sense. I was the \none who got the U.S. Geological Survey to do the assessment. I was the \none who helped get lease 181 opened up, 8 million acres in the gulf.\n  It doesn't wash with me or my colleagues to have people come to the \nfloor with their little charts talking about this side doesn't support \nproduction. Of course we do. But production by drilling a hole \nsearching for black gold called oil is not the only way to produce \nenergy. We are never going to get out of this fix of needing 65 percent \nof the oil we use from the Saudis and others, unless we change the game \ncompletely. That means completely changing our energy future.\n  I have described often our situation. We have this big old planet \nthat circles the Sun. We share it with about 6.6 billion people. We \nstick straws in the planet and suck oil out, about 85 million barrels a \nday, and 21 million barrels is destined for here because we need one-\nfourth of all the oil produced on the planet. One-fourth of the oil \ncoming out of this planet every day has to come to this country because \nwe have a prodigious appetite for oil. The fact is, we need to continue \nto use oil, and will. But we need to find ways to change our energy mix \nin the future. The only conceivable way to do that is to begin \nsubstantial research dollars and to pass these kinds of tax incentives \nto move toward other kinds of energy use, solar, geothermal, wind, and \nso on. You can add up all the money we spend on this sort of thing to \nchange our energy future and make this country less dependent and more \nsecure, and it's equivalent to what the Pentagon spends in 40 days. \nThat makes no sense.\n  If we are going to invest in this country's future, we have to pass \nlegislation such as this. We can't have a Senate in which we have \npeople who fashion themselves as human brake pads coming over here to \nstop everything just because they want to support hedge fund managers \nwho want to wash their U.S. income through foreign subsidiaries and \navoid taxes. That is not a sustainable policy, to continue protecting \ntax avoidance and stopping investment in renewable energy.\n  This country can have a pretty terrific future, but we face big \nchallenges. We are not going to solve or address this country's \nchallenges unless we think in very different ways.\n  I understand there will be some perfectly content for this Congress \nto adjourn or leave town and go on the August break having done \nnothing. I will be one of those who is not content. It makes no sense \nthat there are those out there with projects on the shelf right now for \nnew wind energy farms, for solar energy applications, for geothermal \nand biofuels, all of the other renewables, and they are not going to go \nahead unless they have some notion that this country will extend the \ntax incentives for that renewable energy. On eight separate occasions, \nthe minority has come to the floor of the Senate and said, when asked, \nwill you extend these tax incentives, they have said: No, no, no, eight \ntimes. That is not in this country's interest.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4137\n\n  On behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that at \n5:30\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\ntoday, the Senate proceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, and that there be \n130 minutes for debate divided as follows: 50 minutes under the control \nof Senator Mikulski or her designee, 30 minutes each under the control \nof Senators Enzi and Alexander or their designees, and 20 minutes under \nthe control of Senator Coburn; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote on adoption of the conference \nreport, without further intervening action or debate. I note for the \nRecord that this agreement has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I know this is the Republican portion \nof the time, but until a Republican arrives, I will briefly say for 1 \nminute that I am very pleased the Consumer Product Safety Improvement \nAct of 2008 is going to be coming through the Senate. We saw over 28 \nmillion toys recalled in 2007. The Consumer Product Safety Commission \nis a shadow of its former self. This legislation is long overdue. It \nwas a bipartisan effort. Many of us worked on this very hard, including \nthe Presiding Officer. I am pleased we are able to get an agreement on \nwhat the Wall Street Journal has called the most significant consumer \nproduct legislation in 16 years. It is particularly important to my \nState where we had a 4-year-old boy die when swallowing a lead charm. \nIt was the 99-percent lead, made in China. It should never have been in \nhis hands. The lead in that charm went into his bloodstream over a \nperiod of time, in fact over a period of days. I was very proud that \nour staff, Kate Nilan and Tamara Fucile, was able to work on that \nprovision and work with the committee. That is now the first provision \nin the bill.\n  I thank the conference committee, under the leadership of Senators \nInouye and Pryor, and all the conferees who worked on this in the House \nand Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                       Appropriations Legislation\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago today, the Committee on \nAppropriations marked up three fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills. \nThose bills would provide funding for programs ranging from \nagricultural research to veterans' health care and from foreign aid to \nthe infrastructure that supports our men and women in uniform in our \nArmed Forces. While some members of the committee had concerns about \nthe overall spending levels in those bills or individual provisions \nwithin them, the committee reported the measures by broad bipartisan \nvotes. Those votes reflected the committee's collective belief that it \nhas a fundamental responsibility each year to draft, debate, and report \nto the Senate its spending recommendations for the day-to-day \noperations of our Government.\n  The markup on July 17 was the committee's fourth markup of the year \nto consider fiscal year 2009 bills. The bills reported at that meeting \nbrought to nine the total number of fiscal year 2009 bills approved by \nthe committee. There was every expectation the committee would complete \naction on the remaining three bills in July, as Chairman Byrd had \npublicly indicated. It was also expected the committee would consider a \nsecond supplemental bill.\n\n  Despite complete inaction on appropriations measures in the other \nbody and low expectations for timely enactment of the fiscal year 2009 \nbills, the committee was fulfilling its responsibility to make \nrecommendations to the Senate and moving toward completion of the only \nportion of the appropriations process under its direct control.\n  So I give Chairman Byrd credit for getting the committee as far as he \ndid, given the dim prospects for floor action. The Senate deserves to \nat least see the committee bills before making a judgment about whether \nit will allocate time to consider them.\n  Unfortunately, progress in the committee came to an abrupt halt last \nweek. The chairman announced the committee would not meet to consider \nthe remaining fiscal year 2009 bills and would not meet to consider a \nsecond supplemental. At the time, the reasons given for the \ncancellation were not clear. It was clear, however--and has been \nexplicitly admitted since--that further markups were canceled because \nthe majority did not wish to discuss, debate or vote on amendments \nrelating to domestic energy production.\n  It is virtually unprecedented in our committee to cancel a markup to \navoid a vote. The amendments that likely would have been offered in the \ncommittee are completely germane to the appropriations process. The \nappropriations bills in place for fiscal year 2008 contain at least two \nprovisions that prohibit the use of funds for certain purposes and \nthereby inhibit the development of American energy resources.\n  One of those provisions is a moratorium on further development of oil \nand gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. The other prohibits the \nissuance of regulations that would govern the development of our \nextensive domestic oil shale resources. Both of these matters would \nhave been directly relevant to a fiscal year 2008 supplemental. It is \nalso likely that one or both of these provisions would have been \ncontinued in the fiscal year 2009 Interior and related agencies \nappropriations bill, and as such would have been subject to \nconsideration by the committee.\n  Nobody is playing political games in wanting to offer these \namendments. Members interested in offering these amendments had several \nopportunities to present them during markups of the other \nappropriations bills but withheld from doing so on the promise that the \ncommittee would meet to consider the appropriate bills. I thought this \nwas the responsible thing to do, but perhaps I was wrong.\n  Members are entitled to their own views about whether the moratorium \non Outer Continental Shelf development should be continued. The same \ngoes for oil shale production. But at a time when energy prices are \ndramatically affecting our economy and challenging the budgets of \nfamilies across America, I do not think we as a Congress are entitled \nsimply to sweep the issue under the rug--or attempt to--because it is \ninconvenient. We are not entitled to continue the moratoria for another \nyear as part of a long-term continuing resolution without so much as a \ndebate or a vote.\n  In addition to increasing our domestic supply of energy, responsible \ndevelopment of the Outer Continental Shelf and of American oil shale \nwill mean billions of dollars in royalties, rents, and bonuses that \nwill be paid to States and the U.S. Treasury--money that otherwise \nwould be paid to foreign governments, many of which have policies that \nare in opposition to U.S. interests.\n  Responsible development of new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf \nand of American oil shale would not solve our energy problems \novernight, but no one is claiming it will. But if we take action now, \nperhaps we can avoid a debate 10 years from now in which we try to \nadopt quick fixes or overcome our failure to even vote on these matters \ntoday.\n  When last week's markup was canceled, all of the Republican members \nof the committee signed a letter to Chairman Byrd to express our \ndisappointment and asked that he reconsider. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2008.\n     Hon. Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n       Chairman Byrd: We are profoundly disappointed by the \n     cancellation of this week's scheduled markup of the Fiscal \n     Year 2009 Interior and Legislative Branch appropriations \n     bills, and the second supplemental appropriations bill for \n     Fiscal Year 2008. It is readily apparent that the markup was \n     canceled entirely due to the majority's unwillingness to \n     consider and vote on amendments relating to domestic energy \n     production.\n       The enactment of appropriations bills in recent years has \n     often involved departures\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\n     from the regular order. Our Committee, however, has a proud \n     tradition of successfully conducting that part of the \n     appropriations process that is under our direct control, i.e. \n     the timely consideration and markup of appropriations bills. \n     You have been steadfast this year in insisting that the \n     Committee continue in this fashion, for which we applaud you. \n     We are therefore surprised at today's turn of events.\n       Energy prices are an issue of singular importance to people \n     across the country. The American people are looking to their \n     elected representatives in Congress to offer bold new \n     policies that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil \n     by developing more domestic energy resources, and by reducing \n     the amount of energy we consume. We must act on all fronts. \n     The solution to our current problems will not come from any \n     single policy, or from any single committee. The Committee on \n     Appropriations, however, has an important role to play.\n       The Fiscal Year 2008 Interior, Environment, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act contained provisions that \n     prohibit the production of oil and gas from large portions of \n     the Outer Continental Shelf, and that prohibit the issuance \n     of regulations that are necessary for the responsible \n     development of America's vast oil shale resources in the \n     Rocky Mountain west. It is likely that the chairman's mark of \n     the Fiscal Year 2009 Interior bill would have contained one \n     or both of these provisions. As such, it would have been \n     timely and entirely appropriate for the Committee to meet to \n     consider the merits of continuing these provisions in Fiscal \n     Year 2009, and to consider whether the provisions should be \n     modified or repealed in Fiscal Year 2008. Members of the \n     Committee might well have other energy-related amendments \n     that they wish to be considered.\n       We urge you to reconsider your decision so that the \n     Committee can meet its responsibility to consider all of the \n     appropriations bills, and also do its part to help address \n     the energy challenges that face our country.\n           Sincerely,\n         Ted Stevens; Thad Cochran; Arlen Specter; Pete V. \n           Domenici; Mitch McConnell; Judd Gregg; Robert F. \n           Bennett; Richard C. Shelby; Larry E. Craig; Christopher \n           S. Bond; Kay Bailey Hutchison; Sam Brownback; Wayne \n           Allard; Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is now obvious we will go out of session having not \nfinished our work as a committee, having not met to consider \nappropriations bills that deal directly with the most pressing issues \nfacing American families today.\n  When we return in September, it is highly unlikely the committee will \nact on the remaining fiscal year 2009 bills or the second supplemental. \nBoth the majority leader and the Speaker have indicated we will \nconsider a second supplemental bill in September, but it is hard to \nimagine there will be enough time to act on that measure in committee. \nThat is a shame.\n  Yesterday, Chairman Byrd issued a press release outlining what would \nhave been in the chairman's mark of the supplemental had the committee \nmet to consider it. He outlined a bill that would appropriate some $24 \nbillion to respond to natural disasters, to improve American \ninfrastructure, and for other purposes.\n  The chairman included a number of items I had requested that are \nimportant in my State of Mississippi in our ongoing efforts to recover \nfrom Hurricane Katrina. He included a number of other items in response \nto requests by other members on both sides of the aisle.\n  While there will justifiably be concern about the total cost of this \nproposal and some of its component parts, in my view, it is a measure \nworthy of consideration in the Appropriations Committee.\n  But a press release is not a markup. It is not a draft of a committee \nbill. No Senator can amend a press release. No Senator can see the \nlegislative language that would implement the spending described in the \nrelease, and no Senator can know what provisions might be included in \nthe bill but not mentioned in the press release.\n  I am the ranking member of the committee, and I do not know these \nthings. If I thought we would return in September and hold a markup of \nthe bill, giving the Senate time to debate it fully, perhaps I would be \nless concerned. But we know time is short once we return. Based on what \nwe have witnessed on the floor in recent months, I have little \nconfidence Senators will be allowed freely to offer amendments to the \nsupplemental if it is taken straight to the floor.\n  I wish to reiterate that Chairman Byrd has done an admirable job of \ntrying to uphold the committee's responsibilities and prerogatives in \nthe face of these circumstances. We both share the view that our \ncommittee has an important and fundamental responsibility to write and \nput forth bills that support the basic operations of our Nation's \nGovernment. As a Congress, however, we are getting into some very bad \nhabits as it pertains to consideration of these bills.\n  We are completely abandoning efforts to move the regular \nappropriations bills across the House and Senate floors, something \nwhich has nothing to do with filibusters. Nobody filibustered the \nfiscal year 2008 bills that were brought to the Senate floor. When we \ndo manage to pass appropriations measures, the differences are resolved \nnot by an open meeting of a conference committee but, usually, in \nclosed-door negotiations, followed by an exchange of messages between \nthe House and Senate. Now, apparently, we are starting to cancel \ncommittee markups based on an unwillingness to take votes on difficult \nissues. They may be entirely germane.\n  So I regret these trends for the sake of our committee that is \nstruggling to maintain its tradition of bipartisan cooperation and \naction. I regret it for the sake of millions of Americans who will \nsimply not know why the Senate cannot manage to take votes and process \nits legislation and its appropriations bills in a straightforward and \nopen manner. I regret the way we are letting things slide now into an \nunusual procedure that does not reflect credit on the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are about to adjourn for the August \nrecess without having passed a single piece of legislation addressing \nthe energy crisis or the most important issue, which is the concern \nover rising gasoline prices.\n  I attended the Fourth of July parade in my home State. In Utah, there \nis also a 24th of July parade celebrating the anniversary of the time \nwhen the first Pioneer settlers came into the valley. In both parades, \nI had things shouted at me. Politicians have that experience. Usually, \nwe hope the things that are shouted at us are complimentary. In this \ncase, the things I had shouted at me in the parades were: ``Why aren't \nyou drilling? Why aren't you producing more American oil? Drill now.'' \nI said: We are discussing it. We are trying to do that. We are trying \nto get something done.\n  If there were a parade scheduled now, I would have to go back and \nsay: The Senate would not let us vote on any of the proposals to \nincrease the supply of American oil. There are proposals coming in the \nform of letters from Senators to the President of the United States \nsaying: Will you please go to Saudi Arabia and beg them to produce some \nmore oil? There are suggestions that somehow we should sue Saudi Arabia \nor members of OPEC to get them to produce more oil. But we are not even \nallowed the opportunity to vote on proposals to produce more oil in the \nUnited States.\n  A lot of my constituents are not aware that at one point, not too \ndistant in the past, America produced more oil than any other country \nin the world and controlled the pricing power over oil. We could affect \nthe world price by opening more wells in east Texas. But in the 1970s, \nthat pricing power left our shores and was transferred from the Texas \nRailroad Commission to the Saudi royal family. Now we are in the \nposture of begging the Saudi royal family to produce more oil when we \nhave the capacity to bring that pricing power back to the United States \nby producing more here.\n  I wish to talk specifically about oil shale because I understand \nthere has been an exchange on the floor about oil shale earlier, with \nthe junior Senator from Colorado saying we are not ready, the \ntechnology is not finished, and, therefore, we should maintain the \ncongressionally ordered moratorium on the Department of the Interior \nfrom promulgating the rules under which leases could be granted on \npublic land.\n  Now, let's look at that argument for a minute.\n  The Department of the Interior has released draft rules. We know what \nthey want to do. They have been prepared to do this, and are prepared \nto do it today. They cannot turn those draft rules into firm rules as \nlong as the Democrat moratorium is in place. So\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nwhen we wanted to lift that moratorium--we tried to in the \nAppropriations Committee--we were denied on a straight party-line vote. \nThe Republican leader tried to lift that moratorium here. We were \ndenied in a unanimous consent request.\n  So let's ask ourselves: What are those rules? The best analogy to \nhelp people understand what those rules are is to talk about a fishing \nlicense. If you want to catch fish, you have to get a fishing license. \nYou go in and you pay for it and it is for a specified period of time. \nNow, there is no guarantee the fish will respond to your efforts to \ncatch them. There is only an opportunity to go forward with it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. All we are talking about, with respect to the rules of \nthe Department of the Interior, is let's give companies a fishing \nlicense. If the technology is not ready, the companies will know that. \nThey will find that out very rapidly. If the technology doesn't work, \nthe marketplace will prove that it doesn't work, and companies won't \ninvest in it.\n\n  This is not a government subsidy for oil shale. This is not even a \ngovernment support of oil shale. This is simply a fishing license to \nsay: Go see if you can find some fish or, in this case, go see if you \ncan find some oil. If you can, and you can produce it at an \neconomically acceptable price and in an environmentally friendly \nmanner, then go ahead.\n  But in this body we are saying: No, we won't even let you look for \nit. We won't even let you move forward to try to find out if it will \nwork.\n  The Senator from Colorado said: We are not ready. I would say to him: \nWe are in Utah. We have a program going forward in Utah on State land \nthat shows every indication of producing oil by the end of this year. \nThe reason they can't produce large amounts of oil is that we don't \nhave enough State land to produce on a larger scale. If you are going \nto produce large quantities, you have to allow development on public \nlands, but there is a moratorium in place that says: We won't even let \nyou look at these lands.\n  The easiest thing we could have done this week in Congress would have \nbeen to lift the moratorium. The least we could have done would have \nbeen to let the Department of the Interior implement the rules and give \ncompanies an opportunity to look at the Federal lands to see if they \nwant to get a fishing license to catch some fish or, in this case, oil. \nThat is all we are asking for, but it has been objected to repeatedly \nand repeatedly.\n  If I march in a parade again, I am going to have a hard time \nexplaining to anybody why the Senate won't allow us to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7845-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7845-S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the proceedings of the House in \nthe Record of July 30, 2008.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 130 \nminutes of debate: 50 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nMaryland, 30 minutes each under the control of Senator Enzi of Wyoming \nand Senator Alexander of Tennessee, and 20 minutes under the control of \nSenator Coburn of Oklahoma.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  It is a great honor for me to be able to bring to the floor of the \nSenate the higher education conference report for the Health, \nEducation, and Labor Committee. I bring this bill to the Senate on \nbehalf of Senator Kennedy.\n  What I wish colleagues to know is that this bill is truly a \nbipartisan agreement. It was led by Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, \nthe ranking member, our colleague from Wyoming, who worked tirelessly. \nThis bill has been a work in progress for more than 5 years.\n  Early this summer, as Senator Kennedy advanced this bill, we are all \naware that he received some pretty surprising news. As he went into his \nown treatment regime, he called me and asked me to take over the \nconference report. I viewed it as an honor, I viewed it as a privilege, \nand I view it as an honor and privilege today.\n  Before I go into describing the bill and presenting it, I again wish \nto thank Senator Enzi for his work with Senator Kennedy and his \ncollegial and civil attitude in working with me to move this bill.\n  As I get ready to present this to the Senate, however, I have a \nletter from Senator Kennedy. I have been in touch with Senator Kennedy \non a regular basis, receiving his advice, his guidance, his caution, \nand his jocular wit. I know he is watching us as we begin this debate \ntoday. This is a short statement he asked me to read to his colleagues:\n\n       I'm pleased to express my strong support for final passage \n     of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. This \n     legislation builds on key measures we've approved this \n     Congress to increase college aid and make loans more \n     available for students. This bill goes even further to assure \n     that a college education is affordable and accessible to our \n     citizens.\n       This legislation comes at a time when students and families \n     need more help then ever to deal with the rising cost of \n     college. Average costs at public colleges are more than \n     $13,000 today, and $32,000 at private colleges. Each year \n     780,000 qualified students don't attend a four-year college \n     because they can't afford it.\n       Our bill takes major steps to expand college access and \n     affordability. It holds colleges accountable for rising costs \n     requiring the top five percent of colleges with the greatest \n     cost increases to submit detailed reports to the Secretary of \n     Education on why their costs have risen, and what they will \n     do to hold costs down. It simplifies the complex student aid \n     application process by replacing the seven-page Free \n     Application for Federal Student Aid with a two-page ``EZ-\n     FAFSA.'' It also expands aid for our neediest students by \n     enabling them to receive Pell Grants year-round for the first \n     time.\n       The legislation also responds to the ethical scandals in \n     the student loan industry, which the Committee documented in \n     investigations last year. It bans lenders from offering gifts \n     to college officials, and requires college to adopt strict \n     codes of conduct on student loans.\n       I'm particularly proud of provisions that help students \n     with disabilities and veterans.\n       It enables students with intellectual disabilities who \n     attend postsecondary transition programs to receive Pell \n     Grants for the first time, and provides support for colleges \n     to expand these programs.\n       The bill helps service members by enabling them to defer \n     payments on their student loans--interest-free--while they're \n     on active duty. It also allows service members and their \n     families to receive in-state tuition rates for college when \n     they move to a new state, and enables them to re-enroll in \n     college without delay when their service is complete.\n       This bill creates a lasting legacy for students and \n     families, and it wouldn't have been possible without the \n     bipartisan cooperation of the members of the HELP Committee \n     and the House Committee on Education and Labor. I commend our \n     Ranking Member, Senator Enzi, and Chairman Miller and Ranking \n     Member McKeon in the House for their strong support. I'm \n     especially grateful to my friend, Senator Mikulski, for her \n     impressive work in resolving some of the most difficult \n     issues in this bill.\n       We can be proud that with passage of the Higher Education \n     Opportunity Act, we're meeting our responsibility to help all \n     our citizens obtain a higher education. By improving their \n     lives, we also strengthen our nation and our future. I urge \n     all my colleagues to support this needed legislation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a longer statement by Senator Kennedy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008\n\n       From our earliest days as a nation, education has been the \n     mainstay of our democracy and the engine of the American \n     dream. Our Founders knew that an educated citizenry would \n     strengthen the nation and build the values and character that \n     make us Americans. They believed in the power of\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\n     education and its ability to create an even greater America \n     over the horizon.\n       In our own day and generation, we've seen an excellent \n     example of the fulfillment of the promise of that new \n     horizon, after Congress passed the GI Bill of Rights in 1944, \n     which enabled service members returning from World War II to \n     receive a college education. Hundreds of thousands did so, \n     and they went on to become the Greatest Generation. The GI \n     bill produced 67,000 doctors, 91,000 scientists, 238,000 \n     teachers, and 450,000 engineers. It funded the education of \n     three Presidents, three Supreme Court Justices and many \n     Senators who served in this very chamber.\n       Over the course of the past year, we've revitalized that \n     vision once again with the passage of two important higher \n     education bills. When Congress passed the College Cost \n     Reduction and Access Act last fall, we renewed our commitment \n     to the idea that no qualified student should be denied the \n     opportunity to go to college because of the cost. It included \n     the largest increase in student aid since the GI Bill--more \n     than $20 billion. We also increased the maximum Pell Grant--\n     the lifeline to college for low-income students--from $4310 \n     to $5400 over the next five years.\n       In addition, the Act provided new relief for students \n     struggling under the weight of their student loans, by \n     allowing loan repayments to be capped at 15 percent of \n     monthly discretionary income. We also included new incentives \n     for students to enter key professions such as teaching, law \n     enforcement, and social work, by providing loan forgiveness \n     to those who commit to public service jobs for 10 years.\n       This past spring, we passed a second bill to underscore our \n     commitment. When the crisis in the credit markets appeared to \n     be threatening the ability of students and families to obtain \n     loans for this school year, we approved emergency \n     legislation--the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans \n     Act--to make sure that loan funds will be available this \n     fall.\n       That bill increased the amount of federally-subsidized \n     loans for college students, in order to reduce their reliance \n     on higher cost private loans. We gave parents greater access \n     to low-cost federal PLUS loans, to provide an alternative to \n     private loans and home equity lines of credit. We also gave \n     the Secretary of Education new tools to ensure that lenders \n     have the funds they need to make loans to students.\n       The bill before us today--the Higher Education Opportunity \n     Act of 2008--takes even more steps to ensure that a college \n     education is affordable and accessible to our citizens.\n       A college education has never been more important than it \n     is now. Today, 60 percent of new jobs require some post-\n     secondary education, compared to just 15 percent half a \n     century ago. Yet the United States ranks only 14th in the \n     college graduation rates of all industrialized nations.\n       At the same time, college has never been more difficult to \n     afford. The cost of college has more than tripled over the \n     last twenty years. Today, average tuition, fees and room and \n     board at public colleges is more than $13,000, and it's more \n     than $32,000 at private colleges.\n       Each year an estimated 780,000 talented, qualified students \n     don't attend a four-year college because they can't afford \n     it.\n       In last year's student aid bill, we made a commitment to \n     American students and families to invest billions more in \n     student aid--especially for those who need help the most. \n     Now, with the Higher Education Opportunity Act, we're asking \n     colleges to do their part to keep costs under control. Our \n     bill requires the Department of Education, for the first \n     time, to make detailed information about college costs \n     available to students and families on its website. It also \n     requires the Department to highlight, on national lists, \n     those colleges that are doing a good job of keeping their \n     costs down, and those that are not.\n       By providing greater transparency and enabling students and \n     families to compare the costs of various colleges more \n     easily, we hope to promote an environment where colleges \n     think carefully before they raise their prices. But our bill \n     requires even more. If, over three years, a college raises \n     its prices so much that it ranks among the top five percent \n     of institutions of its type with the highest cost increases, \n     we require the college to submit a comprehensive report to \n     the Secretary of Education, detailing the steps the college \n     will take to bring its costs back under control.\n       We're also taking overdue action to rein in the high cost \n     of college textbooks. According to the U.S. Public Interest \n     Research Group, the average college student spends about $900 \n     a year on textbooks. Since 1994, textbook prices have risen \n     at four times the rate of inflation, and they continue to \n     increase. Often, students are forced to waste money buying \n     textbooks because they can only be purchased in ``bundles'' \n     with workbooks and other materials that their professors \n     don't use.\n       Our bill will reverse this trend by requiring textbook \n     publishers to ``unbundle'' textbooks and supplementary \n     materials, so students can buy only the materials they really \n     need. It will also give faculty members better information \n     about textbook costs, by requiring publishers to provide more \n     detailed pricing information. And it will require colleges to \n     include information about required textbooks in their course \n     catalogs and on their websites, so that students can shop for \n     the best prices.\n       In addition to holding the cost of college down, we're \n     doing more to ensure that students receive all the aid \n     they're entitled to by reforming the application process for \n     federal student aid. Today, the process is needlessly \n     complex. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid \n     (FAFSA)--the basic form that all students must complete to \n     determine their eligibility for federal aid--is currently \n     seven pages long. That's longer than the standard federal \n     income tax form.\n       Such complexity has unfortunate consequences for students. \n     Each year, an estimated 1.5 million students eligible for \n     Pell Grants don't receive them, either because they aren't \n     aware of federal aid or because they find the process too \n     complicated to navigate. It's time to make the process \n     simpler.\n       The Higher Education Opportunity Act will replace the 7-\n     page FAFSA with a 2-page ``EZFAFSA'' for low-income students. \n     Within five years, the longer FAFSA will be phased out for \n     all applicants. The bill also includes pilot programs to \n     simplify the federal aid applications even further. To help \n     more of our neediest students understand that college aid is \n     available for them, a pilot program will give low-income \n     students a federal aid determination in their junior year of \n     high school, rather than their senior year. We also encourage \n     the Secretary of Education to work with the IRS to share \n     income tax data, so the federal aid form can include the data \n     needed to determine a student's eligibility for college aid.\n       In addition, to ensure that this aid is directed to \n     students, we must keep them informed about their choices and \n     hold colleges and lenders accountable for giving students the \n     best loan deal possible.\n       Investigations by our Committee found that many lenders are \n     entering into sweetheart deals with colleges, offering gifts \n     to college and university employees in order to obtain their \n     students' loan business.\n       Lenders who participate in the federal student loan program \n     have offered ``educational conferences'' at luxury hotels and \n     offer free entertainment and free tickets to sporting events \n     to college officials in order to entice those officials to \n     recommend the lenders to their students. The Higher Education \n     Opportunity Act makes these practices illegal, and protects \n     students by ensuring that when a college recommends a lender, \n     it's based on the best interest of students and nothing else.\n       The bill also creates a new process with respect to private \n     educational loans--which now account for a quarter of all \n     borrowing for college--to make sure that students know what \n     low-cost Federal aid they're eligible for, and how much more \n     they really need to borrow to cover the cost of college \n     attendance with a private loan.\n       The Higher Education Opportunity Act also enhances grant \n     aid for the neediest students, adding to the dramatic \n     increase in student aid Congress approved in last year's \n     student bill. For the first time, we allow students eligible \n     for Pell Grants to receive those grants year-round, so they \n     can accelerate their courses of study.\n       But ensuring access to adequate grants and loans is only \n     one component of solving the college access crisis. We must \n     also ensure that more students are graduating from high \n     school ready for college. In 2001, colleges required one-\n     third of all freshmen to take remedial courses in reading, \n     writing, or math.\n       Because so many high school students are not learning the \n     basic skills to succeed in college or work, the nation loses \n     more than $3.7 billion a year. This figure includes $1.4 \n     billion to provide remedial education to students who have \n     recently completed high school, and $2.3 billion that the \n     economy loses because remedial reading students are more \n     likely to drop out of college without a degree, thereby \n     reducing their earning potential.\n       To address this problem, our bill includes provisions to \n     maintain the strength of the TRIO and GEAR UP programs, which \n     provide underprivileged students with the support they need \n     to go to prepare for and graduate from college.\n       We also strengthen efforts to help students with \n     disabilities enter and succeed in college. For the first \n     time, the bill allows students with intellectual disabilities \n     to receive Pell Grants and Federal Work-Study funds to \n     participate in transition programs at institutions of higher \n     education.\n       We create new grant programs to help colleges offer even \n     more of these transition programs, and make course materials \n     more accessible for students with print disabilities. We \n     establish a new center at the Department of Education devoted \n     to helping students with disabilities and their families get \n     the help and assistance they need to prepare for college and \n     go to college.\n       These provisions to help students with disabilities will be \n     one of the lasting legacies of this legislation, and I'm \n     proud we've been able to do so much.\n       I'm also proud of the steps we take in this bill to help \n     service men and women pursue a higher education. They risk \n     their lives for us every day, and they deserve whatever we \n     can give them to help them build a brighter future. Our bill \n     provides a number of new benefits for servicemembers, \n     including provisions to allow them to defer payments on their \n     student loans--interest-free--while they're on active duty, \n     provisions to help servicemembers re-enroll in college \n     without delay, and a new online clearinghouse for \n     servicemembers to learn about college benefits available to \n     them.\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\n       Our bill also takes other much-needed steps to ensure that \n     all citizens are able to enjoy the benefits of higher \n     education. As we know, discrimination has long limited the \n     opportunities of minorities and women in higher education. As \n     a result, these groups are still under-represented today \n     among graduates of institutions of higher learning, and among \n     professors, attorneys, and other professionals.\n       Decades of reports and studies document the under-\n     representation of women and minorities in higher education. \n     In 2006, a report, Faculty Gender Equity Indicators by the \n     American Association of University Professors found that \n     women are significantly under-represented among university \n     faculty--they make up just 39 percent of full-time faculty at \n     institutions of higher education, and just 34 percent of such \n     faculty at doctoral institutions. The Department of \n     Education's most recent Digest of Education Statistics \n     indicates that women continue to be underrepresented among \n     those obtaining professional degrees, such as in law and \n     business.\n       As the National Center for Education Statistics states in \n     its Enrollment in Postsecondary Institutions, Fall 2006 \n     report, minority students are underrepresented at every level \n     of higher education, with numbers dwindling further in \n     graduate and professional education. Likewise, law school \n     enrollment surveys by the American Bar Association show that \n     minorities are underrepresented among students at those \n     institutions, and among law school tenured faculty and \n     deans. This legislation takes needed steps to address this \n     under-representation of women and minorities and to help \n     make the goal of equal educational opportunity a reality \n     for all our citizens.\n       The bill also provides new support for educational \n     institutions that serve minority groups historically denied \n     access to higher education because of prejudice and \n     discrimination. These institutions--many of which were \n     founded in direct response to the refusal by other colleges \n     and universities to admit minority students--have long had an \n     indispensable role in overcoming the legacy of discrimination \n     in education that has led to under-representation of \n     minorities in academia and in legal and other professions.\n       These institutions help ensure a diverse pool of qualified \n     professionals in the nation's economy. They're particularly \n     important because they provide postsecondary educational \n     opportunities specifically tailored to students--especially \n     low-income students--who have been denied access to \n     adequately-funded elementary and secondary schools, or have \n     been educated in schools marked by racial and ethnic \n     segregation. As documented by studies and described in the \n     Committee reports, these institutions have a proven track \n     record of educating minority students. They graduate a \n     disproportionate number of the nation's minority doctors, \n     lawyers, teachers, and other professionals. They offer \n     affordable, high quality college education and job training \n     to tens of thousands of students every year.\n       In addition to these measures, the legislation includes \n     several provisions to help colleges and universities improve \n     student and campus safety. More than a year ago now, the \n     nation was shocked by the worst shooting rampage in history--\n     a shock made worse by the fact that it occurred at an \n     institution of higher education. What happened at Virginia \n     Tech was a wake-up call for Congress and the Nation--that \n     tragedy can strike anywhere, including college campuses.\n       The bill takes steps to apply some of the lessons learned \n     from that overwhelming tragedy, and ensure that students are \n     safer in the future. It helps colleges upgrade their safety \n     and emergency response systems with the latest technology, \n     and requires them to have specific procedures to deal with \n     serious situations on campus, including informing students \n     immediately when such situations erupt. These steps are \n     essential parts of the responsibility of colleges and \n     universities in protecting the students entrusted to their \n     care and we can help them do better.\n       This bill is the product of many months of hard work, and \n     it couldn't have completed without the bipartisan cooperation \n     of every member of the HELP Committee and the House Committee \n     on Education and Labor. I commend our Ranking Member, Senator \n     Enzi, for his strong support for moving this bill forward, \n     and Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon in the House \n     for their enormous contributions to this legislation.\n       I'm especially grateful to my friend, Senator Mikulski, for \n     going above and beyond the call of duty to help resolve some \n     of the most difficult issues in this bill over the past \n     several months.\n       I also commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for the \n     assistance the Banking Committee has provided on the private \n     loan provisions in the bill, and all the Members of both \n     committees for their individual contributions.\n       We owe an immense debt of gratitude as well to the many \n     staff members on both sides of the aisle who have dedicated \n     hundreds of hours to working on this legislation. I'm \n     grateful for the efforts of Dvora Lovinger and Robin Juliano \n     on Senator Mikulski's staff, and Ilyse Shuman, Greg Dean, \n     Beth Buehlmann, Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, Lindsay Hunsicker, \n     Aaron Bishop and Kelly Hastings on Senator Enzi's staff.\n       From Chairman Miller's office, I'm grateful for the efforts \n     of Mark Zuckerman, Alex Nock, Gabriella Gomez, Julie \n     Radocchia, and Jeff Appel. From Ranking Member McKeon's \n     office, I thank Sally Stroup and Amy Jones.\n       I also thank Mary Ellen McGuire and Jeremy Sharp with \n     Senator Dodd; Rob Barron with Senator Harkin; Michael Yudin \n     and Michele Mazzocco with Senator Bingaman; Kathryn Young \n     with Senator Murray; Seth Gerson with Senator Reed; Mildred \n     Otero, Latoya Johnson, and Chelsea Maughan with Senator \n     Clinton; Steve Robinson with Senator Obama; Huck Gutman with \n     Senator Sanders; Will Jawando with Senator Brown; Allison \n     Dembeck with Senator Gregg; David Cleary and Sarah Riffling \n     with Senator Alexander; Celia Sims with Senator Burr; Glee \n     Smith with Senator Isakson; Karen McCarthy with Senator \n     Murkowski; Juliann Andreen with Senator Hatch; Alison Anway \n     with Senator Roberts; Jon VanMeter with Senator Allard; and \n     Elizabeth Floyd with Senator Coburn.\n       As I mentioned, the Banking Committee provided special help \n     during this process and I thank Shawn Maher, Amy Friend, and \n     Roger Hollingsworth with Senator Dodd; and Jim Johnson with \n     Senator Shelby.\n       As always, we're grateful for the hard work of our \n     Legislative Counsels, the Senate Budget Committee, and the \n     Congressional Budget Office for helping us prepare this bill. \n     I thank Mark Koster, Kristin Romero, Amy Gaynor, and Laura \n     Ayoud from the Senate Legislative Counsel's office, Steve \n     Cope and Molly Lothamer from the House Legislative Counsel's \n     office, Debb Kalcevic and Justin Humphrey of the \n     Congressional Budget Office, and Robyn Hiestand with the \n     Senate Budget Committee.\n       And from my own staff, I thank Michael Myers, Carmel \n     Martin, J.D. LaRock, Erin Renner, Missy Rohrbach, Emma \n     Vadehra, Jennie Fay, Shawn Daugherty, Roberto Rodriguez, \n     David Johns, Michael Zawada, and Jane Oates.\n       As President Kennedy said in 1961, ``Our progress as a \n     nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. Our \n     requirements for world leadership, our hopes for economic \n     growth, and the demands of citizenship itself in an era such \n     as this all require the maximum development of every young \n     American's capacity. The human mind is our fundamental \n     resource.''\n       President Kennedy was speaking then about the aspirations \n     that gave life to the original Higher Education Act of 1965. \n     His words rang true then, and they still ring true today. We \n     can all be proud that with passage of the Higher Education \n     Opportunity Act, we're recognizing our responsibility to help \n     all our citizens obtain a higher education, not only to \n     improve their own lives, but also to strengthen our nation \n     and our future. I commend all my colleagues and their staff \n     members on both sides of the aisle for coming together to \n     make passage of this vital legislation possible.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to add to this. I won't repeat \nwhat Senator Kennedy reminds us are the good things in this bill.\n  In addition to our empowerment opportunity, which was expanding Pell \ngrants from $4,800 to $6,000, we are also making sure Pell grants are \navailable all year long, not just during the academic year, as well as \ngetting rid of the cronyism in private lending where there were \nkickbacks going on between lenders and those at colleges who were \noffering it.\n  In addition to that, one of the things I am very proud of is how we \nmet two major shortages in our country. Right now, there are the issues \nrelated to the nursing shortage. This bill recognizes the fact that \nthough there is a nursing shortage, there are now several thousand \npeople who want to go to nursing school but can't get in because the \nnursing schools either have no room, no labs, or no faculty.\n  Working together, we have been able to pass in this bill a very \nsignificant empowerment opportunity that will expand faculty and \nlaboratory capacity so that we can crack the nursing shortage code by \nmaking sure all who want to go have the opportunity to go. By the way, \nthere are 40,000 qualified applicants who could not get into nursing \nprograms. They were smart enough. They were good enough. There was even \nfinancial aid to help them, but there just wasn't room. But we are \nmaking room for them.\n  Another issue that we were able to deal with was promoting innovative \nand effective teacher preparation programs. Our Nation faces a shortage \nof high-quality K-12 teachers, and new approaches are needed to make \nsure that every child has an effective teacher. In this legislation, we \ncreate a pipeline for high-quality teachers to teach in high-need \nschools by promoting partnerships with teacher education programs in \nhigher need districts. We hold institutions of higher education \naccountable for the quality and progress of their teacher preparation \nprograms as well as encouraging them with substantial help to develop \nalternative certification programs.\n  The Presiding Officer would be interested to know that on this 25th \nanniversary of Sally Ride going into space,\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\nneither Dr. Ride nor I could teach in a Baltimore high school. Dr. Ride \nhas a Ph.D. in astrophysics, two undergraduate degrees--one in physics \nand one in Shakespeare. I have a master's degree in sociology. I think \nI am qualified to teach current events but couldn't do it. That is OK. \nWe should be qualified, but it would be darn hard to get into an \nalternative certification program.\n  I think there is a lot of talent coming out of our military, retired \npeople who are looking for second careers--an experienced core. We need \nto give them an opportunity to come into our college classrooms, \nbringing knowledge, expertise, and the kind of mentoring that goes on. \nThis is what is in this bill. It is not a laundry list of programs. It \nis about helping those young people who want to get into school, making \nsure we deal with some of the critical shortages facing our country, \nand at the same time having empowerment opportunity where we help \nimportant historic institutions, such as our Historically Black \nColleges.\n  I am going to speak about this bill in more detail, but for now I \nwish to yield to Senator Enzi, who has been such an able partner and \nwho has a particular area of expertise, because of his accounting \nbackground, in the fiscal reforms we did and a real passion for the \ncommunity college.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconference agreement of the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which \nwould reauthorize the Higher Education Act. This conference agreement \nrepresents a major victory for America's students and families. I can't \nsay enough about the tremendous role that Senator Mikulski has played \nin getting this wrapped up. I often say, on bills it takes 90 percent \nof the time to get the 90 percent done, and the other 10 percent also \ntakes 90 percent of the time. I think she did a significant job of \ncutting that other 90 percent to get the 10 percent done.\n  My only regret is that Senator Kennedy isn't here to share in this \ngreat moment. He has been working on this with me for 3 years. We \nactually worked a little bit on it before that. Without his able help \non this bill and the superb help of his staff, who have continued to \nwork on it, we wouldn't be in this position today. I will be eternally \ngrateful, though, that he asked Senator Mikulski to step in and help \nout. She has been tireless and has done a phenomenal job. Without her \nleadership, we also wouldn't be here at this moment.\n  This is an important step, and it will have an impact on the lives of \nstudents of all ages for years to come. It is much like the launch just \nover 50 years ago of the Sputnik satellite that sparked a great debate \nabout our place in the space race. The success of Sputnik sent \nshockwaves through the Nation. Russia was getting the better of us \ntechnologically, and we couldn't allow that to happen. It sparked a \nchange in our education policies, and it sparked America to do what it \ndoes best, which is to rise to the challenge with innovation and a \nmarked determination to be second to none. No longer could we rest on \nour past triumphs as a nation. We met the challenge of Sputnik through \nthe National Defense Education Act.\n  Today, we are again being challenged but in a different way.\n  Now, instead of a race for space, it is a race for knowledge and \nskills that confronts us. It is a race we dare not lose, for the stakes \nthis time are even higher. What is at risk is our strong economy. The \nsolution to this difficult problem is to make a college education more \naccessible, more affordable, and more accountable for more Americans. \nIt is more important than ever to make sure students and their families \nhave good information to use on making decisions about college.\n  We find ourselves at a time when 200 of the 230 highest wage, highest \npaying, and in-demand jobs require some college education. In this \nenvironment, it is necessary for America's students to be able to \naccess the tools and assistance they will need to complete their \ncollege education and acquire the knowledge and skills that will enable \nthem to be successful in the 21st century economy.\n  Institutions of higher education and employers have expressed their \ndissatisfaction with the fact that our high school graduates need \nremediation in order to do college-level work or to participate in the \nworkforce. Each year, taxpayers pay an estimated $1 billion to $2 \nbillion to provide remedial education to students at our public \nuniversities and community colleges. The cost to employers is even \ngreater.\n  The legislation before us will take historic steps to provide \nstudents with the tools, the means, and the power to get a higher \neducation.\n  We can all appreciate the complexity of the Federal student aid \nsystem. Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or \nFAFSA, prevents many of our students from even considering college. We \nhave taken that from multipages down to three pages--incidentally, that \nis both sides. One of the significant things is that it has kept people \nfrom even applying for financial aid, and without the financial aid, \nthey cannot go to college. In 2004, an estimated 850,000 individuals \nwho would have been eligible for Pell did not file a FAFSA. Completing \nbureaucratic financial-aid forms should not be a barrier to thousands \nof students who need financial aid to attend college.\n  This bill breaks down FAFSA to just those necessary questions to \ndetermine a student's financial need. In addition, Federal agencies \nwill be required to examine and reduce the amount of information needed \nto establish eligibility for student aid. We also have included \nsunshine and transparency requirements for institutions, lenders, and \nguaranty agencies to restore confidence in student loan programs and \neliminate the appearance of inappropriate arrangements.\n  As important as it is to increase the number of first-time college-\ngoing students, the fact is that nontraditional students are the \nstudents of the future. With seven community colleges in Wyoming, I \nknow the value of serving adult learners who are returning to college \nfor additional education and training. This agreement provides Pell \ngrants for year-round education. You can think of it as 9 months and 3 \nmonths off, but people who are in this position need to be able to go \ncontinuously until they get the certification or degree they are \nworking for. Again, this agreement provides Pell grants for year-round \neducation, so students can complete their programs more quickly.\n  One issue I have concerns with is the maintenance of effort \nprovision. I am worried that it may serve as a disincentive to States \nto reasonably allocate resources to higher education. I expect that we \nwill find the provision unworkable, and we will be back in the future \nto make technical changes to fix it. We will leave that for another \nday.\n  For students today, a higher education is no longer optional. Without \na lifetime of education, training, and retraining opportunities for \neveryone, we will not meet the 21st century challenges. This historic \npiece of legislation goes a long way toward meeting our commitment to \nall Americans.\n  This conference report is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill \nand an important accomplishment because we followed the 80/20 rule. We \nfocused on the 80 percent of the issues we could agree on, not the 20 \npercent we disagreed on. We also followed the regular order to craft \nthis bill. It went through committee and was considered on the floor. \nThe House did the same. Then we met with the House to draft a \nconference report. This process takes time, but the result is an \nimportant accomplishment for America's students and their families. \nWhat we are doing today will make a great difference in the lives of \nour children and our grandchildren for many years to come.\n  I thank all of the members of both the Senate and the House \ncommittees, and in particular Senator Kennedy for working toward this \ngoal for years and keeping his commitment that we would get this done. \nSenator Kennedy has long been a champion for education in our country. \nHe shares my determination that the education we provide to students of \nall ages will be second to none. That is a difficult challenge. When he \nand I started on this challenge to reauthorize the Higher Education Act \n3\\1/2\\ years ago, we knew there would be many bumps along the way. I \nbelieve we hit every single one of those bumps, but he provided the \nkind of leadership in committee, in the Senate, and in the Congress \nthat made it possible for us to reach this agreement today.\n  I also thank Senator Mikulski for the key role she played in assuring \nthat we reached agreement on the bill.\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\n  In addition, I acknowledge the tremendous work of Chairman Miller and \nRanking Member McKeon of the House Education and Labor Committee. There \nwere a tremendous number of meetings between us to work in a very \npositive way toward getting to this point.\n  As well, I thank Congressmen Hinojosa and Keller of the subcommittee. \nThey helped to shepherd this bill through the House so we could take it \nup on the Senate floor.\n  There are many congressional staff who worked on this conference \nreport. The breadth and importance of the issues, not to mention the \nlength of the legislation, requires many people working on it to get it \ndone.\n  I have always said that I have a staff worthy of gold medals and my \nstaff who worked on this bill have shown their gold medal status once \nagain. I must first acknowledge and thank Beth Buehlmann, my education \npolicy director. It is no exaggeration to state that without Beth there \nwould be no Higher Education Act reauthorization bill today. She truly \nwas the force to start the reauthorization 3 \\1/2\\ years ago. She \nworked tirelessly to ensure that we drafted a bill to reflect the \nchanging nature of our student bodies as well as to ensure that we, as \na Nation, will maintain our status as having the best education system \nin the world. Her team of Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, Kelly Hastings, \nand Lindsay Hunsicker is comprised of remarkable individuals who \nbrought their talents and knowledge to the forefront in this bill. I \nwould also like to thank my staff director, Ilyse Schuman, and Greg \nDean, Amy Shank, Randi Reid, John Hallmark, and Ron Hindle who also put \nin many hours and added invaluable input into the bill as well as the \noverall process.\n  I would also like to thank members of Senator Kennedy's staff for \ntheir hard work--Michael Myers, Carmel Martin, JD LaRock, Missy \nRohrbach, Erin Renner, Roberto Rodriquez, and Emma Vadehra.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank all of the other HELP Committee \nstaff for their hard work throughout this process, especially David \nCleary and Sarah Rittling of Senator Alexander's subcommittee staff. \nAlso deserving thanks are our Republican members' staff, including \nAllison Dembeck, Celia Sims, Glee Smith, Karen McCarthy, Juliann \nAndreen, Alison Anway, John van Meter, and Elizabeth Floyd, as well as \ntheir Democratic staff counterparts. Also, I would like to thank Scott \nRaab from Senator McConnell's office for helping us work through some \nof the more difficult issues in the negotiations.\n  Also deserving my gratitude is the House staff including Mark \nZuckerman, Alex Nock, Gabriella Gomez, Julie Radocchia, and Jeff Appel \nwith Chairman Miller's staff and Sally Stroup, James Bergeron, and Amy \nJones with Mr. McKeon's staff.\n  Also, with any piece of legislation that we draft, we should not \nforget the legislative counsels in both bodies who worked tirelessly to \nput this 1,000 plus page agreement together--Steve Cope, Molly \nLothamer, Mark Koster, Kristin Romero, and Amy Gaynor--who all deserve \nto be recognized.\n  I look forward to getting the conference report to President Bush for \nhis signature soon so that students and their families who are making \nplans to attend college this fall will have the benefits of this bill \nto help them.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, a member of the HELP Committee, who played a \nsignificant role in crafting this bill as it moved through our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask, through the \nChair, the Senator from Maryland if I might speak after the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I may say to the Senator two things. One, I believe \nthe agreement is that we have from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Maryland has \n50 minutes and the Senator from Wyoming has 30 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our order of agreement was that after \nSenator Enzi spoke, we would take 10 minutes for Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Reed. If Senator Reed is not here, we can then see how we can \naccommodate the Senator from Tennessee. The Senator from Tennessee was \nto go after the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you. I can wait until there is available time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n                             Gregory Simon\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndevastating loss that Bob Simon and the Simon family suffered today \nwith the loss of their beloved son and brother Gregory. Bob has been \nthe staff director of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for \nnearly 10 years, and worked with me in other capacities for a number of \nyears before that. During that period, Bob has gone through harrowing \ntimes both personally and professionally. He has always handled these \ntimes with grace, strength, and his own personal brand of dry humor. \nBob, his wife Karen, and their three other children--Stephen, Cathryn, \nand Anne-Marie--have spent countless hours at Gregory's bedside since \nGregory fell ill on July 10, exactly 3 weeks ago, and throughout that \ntime, they have shown extraordinary courage. Their devotion to Gregory \nreflects their devotion to one another as a family.\n  Greg was a really inquisitive, artistic, creative individual. He \nalways drew cartoons and comics. He didn't like math. He looked exactly \nlike Bob except with blond hair. He had Bob's temperament--he was such \na positive young man.\n  Gregory was always small for his age, but he refused to let his \nstature get in the way of anything he wanted to do. He was a fighter, \nand he fought valiantly for the last 3 weeks. In the end, though, the \nodds were too great to overcome, and Gregory died at the age of 16.\n  Mr. President, there are no words that can properly capture the pain \nthe Simons must feel now, and no words we can say that can truly \nprovide comfort. The best we can do is be sure that those who are \nbereaved know that they have our love and our prayers, and so we send \nboth in great measure to the Simon family.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about the legislation \nthat is before the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the conference report on this Higher \nEducation Opportunity Act. The title to the legislation indicates that \nthe bill is about providing greater opportunities for families to send \ntheir children to college and greater opportunities for students to \nsucceed in and graduate from college.\n  I particularly thank Chairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their \nuntiring commitment and dedication to the college students of this \ncountry. Of course, I thank Senator Mikulski as well for her leadership \nin getting this legislation to the Senate floor for a vote this \nevening.\n  Only 1 year after passing the largest student aid package in more \nthan 50 years, this body is poised to pass legislation that will take \nthe next step to make college more affordable and accessible to \nstudents and their families. There are many important provisions in the \nbill, but I will highlight just one provision in particular.\n  Native American enrollment in postsecondary education more than \ndoubled between 1976 and 2002, with almost 166,000 Native American \nstudents enrolled in higher education. Student enrollment in tribally \ncontrolled colleges and universities has increased in recent years to \nalmost 16,000 students in 2002.\n  It is important to note the critical role tribally controlled \ncolleges play in educating Native American students and the unique \neducational opportunity these schools offer Native American students. \nWe need to continue to do all we can to strengthen and support those \nschools. But that means that approximately 150,000 Native American \nstudents are enrolled in higher education in non-tribally controlled \ncolleges.\n  We know, unfortunately, that Native American students are still much \nless likely to enroll in college than their peers. Only 18 percent of \nNative American students have enrolled in college, as compared to 42 \npercent of other students. We also know, however, that Native American \nstudents are less likely\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nto persist once in college. And 77 percent of Native Americans did not \nhave a postsecondary certificate or degree, as compared with 37 percent \nof others.\n  The Higher Education Opportunity Act, the bill before us today, \naddresses the reality that the overwhelming majority of Native American \nstudents are being educated in non-tribally controlled colleges and \nuniversities and that we need to do a better job to support these \nstudents within these schools. This legislation authorizes the Native \nAmerican-Serving Non-Tribal Institutions Program to enable such \ncolleges to improve and expand their capacity to serve these Native \nAmerican and low-income individuals.\n  Right now, there are 43 colleges and universities that serve large \nNative American student populations. In my State, we have three such \nschools that serve large Native American student populations. In fact, \nthe student population at the University of New Mexico at Gallup, NM, \nis close to 80 percent Native American.\n  Native American students in New Mexico would not be the only students \nto benefit from this provision. Colleges and universities around the \ncountry would also qualify in other States, including schools in \nAlaska, Wyoming, Colorado, North Carolina, and Utah. Out of the 43 \nschools that could be eligible to benefit from the provisions in this \nlegislation, 24 of the schools are located in the State of Oklahoma.\n  I am very pleased this provision has garnered strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is a part of this very important legislation.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes funding for a long overdue \ngraduate program for Hispanic-serving institutions.\n  I thank the chairman and Senator Enzi for their strong support of \nthese provisions. I urge my colleagues to support the conference \nreport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, following our agreement and time \nallocation, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island--the \nother Senator from Rhode Island, the senior Senator, Senator Jack Reed, \nalso a member of the HELP Committee. He is a very persistent person in \nengaging in the content of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski for not only the \ntime to speak about this important measure but for her leadership. I \nparticularly wish to recognize the extraordinary contribution of \nSenator Kennedy who has been the architect of this legislation and many \nprevious reauthorizations. And I wish to give particular thanks to \nSenator Enzi whose quiet, thoughtful, and determined approach made a \ncontribution to this legislation. I thank him for his hard work.\n  I rise in strong support of the Higher Education Opportunity Act of \n2008. It will be an important way in which we fulfill our obligation to \nthe American people, and keep opportunity and hope alive throughout \nthis country. Education is truly the engine that pulls people forward. \nIt allows individuals and families to move up the economic ladder, and \nnot only for their own progress, but also for the benefit of the \ncommunities in which they live.\n  This might be one of the most important pieces of legislation we ever \nconsidered on this floor. I am proud it has been so well handled and so \nmeaningful that today we are debating legislation which I believe will \nget overwhelming support. I am particularly pleased it is being \nreauthorized at this time. We have seen an economy in turmoil. One of \nthe realizations that is taking place is that the housing sector of our \neconomy is so central to everything we do. I can imagine, as we all \ncan, that there are literally hundreds of thousands of families across \nAmerica who are counting on the equity in their homes to send their son \nor daughter to college. That equity has been diminished, if it has not \ndisappeared altogether.\n  Today we are responding to that urgent need by providing more \nassistance to families to send their children to higher education. I am \nparticularly pleased the aspects of the legislation I helped author are \nincluded in this final version. I introduced legislation called the \nFAFSA Act, which is the acronym for the federal financial aid form, to \nstreamline the financial aid application process. There will now be a \nshort EZ-FAFSA form for low-income students and families while also \nallowing students to apply earlier so they have an idea of what their \nfinancial options are as they consider college. These provisions will \nmake the sometimes daunting task of getting financial aid, I hope, a \nlittle easier and a little more efficient.\n  I am also pleased that aspects of my legislation called the ACCESS \nAct have been included. This legislation deals primarily with the LEAP \nprogram. The LEAP program is a partnership between States and the \nFederal Government to provide grants to students who need the help--not \nloans, but grants. The States put in some resources; we match those \nresources. It is a way in which we can fulfill our commitment and our \npromise to many low-income families. This legislation builds on the \nLEAP program by providing critical additional financial resources, \nparticularly resources and that will be useful for helping middle- and \nlow-income families attend college.\n  We are all concerned about another aspect of our educational system, \nand that is teacher quality. This legislation incorporates some other \nprovisions which I advanced that will help prepare teachers for the \nreality of today's classroom. I am very pleased they are included also.\n  We also included in this legislation a Perkins student loan \nforgiveness for librarians and for members of the Armed Forces. The \nPerkins program provides need-based loan assistance for students \nattending college. We are going to forgive the debt on that loan \nassistance for librarians and members of our armed services.\n  This is a wonderful act. I am pleased and proud to support it and be \na part of it. I once again thank Chairman Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and \nSenator Mikulski for their great work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, do I understand I have up to 30 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that I may \nbring demonstrative evidence on the floor and use it during my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in case anyone is wondering, these \nboxes, which are nearly as tall as I am, are the rules and regulations \nthat our 6,000 colleges and universities must comply with in order to \nreceive students who have a Federal grant or loan. As I will make clear \nin my remarks, my primary objection to the legislation I am about to \naddress is that the legislation doubles the size of this stack of \nboxes. My fear is we are undermining the quality of American higher \neducation. The greatest threat, I believe, to American higher education \nis not underfunding, it is overregulation.\n  Before I say that, let me first say a word, as has been said before, \nabout Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Mikulski. While they \nhave, among themselves, different philosophical views, I regard each of \nthem as institutions whom I greatly admire. In other words, they like \nto work within this body across party lines to get a result. I thank \nboth Senator Enzi and Senator Mikulski for the courtesy accorded me in \nthe development of this result. And as every other Member of this body \ndoes, I greatly admire Senator Kennedy for his tenacity and his \ncommitment to education. Obviously, we wish he were here tonight to \njoin us.\n  Because I admire Senator Kennedy and Senator Mikulski and Senator \nEnzi does not mean I have to admire the particular result of this work. \nAfter 4 years, the Senate has spewed forth a well-intentioned \ncontraption of unnecessary rules and regulations that waste time and \nmoney that ought to be spent on students and improving quality. It \nconfirms my belief that the greatest threat to the quality of American \nhigher education is not underfunding, it is overregulation.\n  Current Federal rules for the 6,000 higher education institutions \nthat accept students with Federal grants or loans fill a stack of boxes \nthat is nearly as tall as I am. The former President of Stanford, \nGerhard Casper, estimated\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nthat it cost these institutions from Harvard to the Nashville Auto \nDiesel College 7 cents of each federal dollar to do all the busy work \nto fill out these regulations.\n  The legislation which we are considering tonight doubles those rules \nand regulations with 24 new categories and 100 new reporting \nrequirements. These new requirements include a total of 54 so-called \ncollege watch lists which I believe will be too confusing for families \nto understand, and complicated rules involving textbooks which only \nwill prove that Members of Congress have no idea about how faculty \nmembers prepare their courses.\n  Most of these complications of rules, graduation rates in 48 \ndifferent categories, disaggregation of student reporting dates by 14 \nracial, ethnic, and income subgroups, employment of graduates of \ninstitutions will leave college administrators scratching their heads \nand create thousands of new jobs for people who know how to fill out \nforms.\n  All of this will be put on the Web, I suppose, and most of it will be \nsent to Washington, DC, for someone to read. Having once been the \nSecretary of Education myself, I do not know who will read all these \nnew regulations and all these new reports, and I don't know what they \nwould do about them if they did read them.\n  The American higher education system is far from perfect, but it is \none thing in our country that works and it works well. It is our secret \nweapon in maintaining our brain power advantage so we can keep our \nhigher standard of living and keep our jobs from going overseas.\n  The United States not only has the best colleges and universities in \nthe world, it has almost all of the best colleges and universities in \nthe world. Some are big, some are small, some are public, some are \nprivate, some are profit, some are nonprofit. They are community \ncolleges, historically Black colleges and church-affiliated \ninstitutions.\n  Tuitions range from $50,000 a year at some private institutions to an \naverage of $6,200 a year for 4-year public institutions, to $2,400 for \ncommunity colleges. In Tennessee, some cities are even making community \ncollege free.\n  Their foremost advantage, the advantage of all these 6,000 \ninstitutions, is that in a rapidly changing world, these 6,000 \nautonomous institutions are flexible and able to meet the needs of \ntheir student customers.\n  Federal support for higher education goes almost all to these \nstudents. It does not go to the institutions. A little of it does, but \nalmost all of it goes to the students who then choose the schools, \nforcing the institutions to compete, stay flexible and meet real needs. \nThat is the precisely opposite way we fund kindergarten through the \n12th grade. We give the money to elementary and secondary institutions, \ntending to freeze them into whatever they have been doing for the last \n50 years.\n  We can compare the success of our higher education system with the \nlack of success of our K through 12 system and wonder whether the \nreason might not be that in higher education, we focus on autonomy, \nchoice, and competition.\n  Generous research dollars in higher education are for the most part \ncompetitively awarded, which also helps to keep the institutions on \ntheir toes.\n  The rest of the world is busy trying to emulate the American system \nof higher education, which means other countries are creating more \nautonomy, more choices, and more competition. Yet here we are in the \nSenate today cluttering up our secret weapon with the same bureaucratic \nnonsense that has stifled excellence in universities in other parts of \nthe world and will do it here if these trends are not reversed.\n  There is a great deal of beating of breasts about how much good this \nbill does to address the problem of college costs. It is ironic that \nthe same legislation would add to tuition costs by imposing unnecessary \nregulations. And it is especially ironic that the very Members of \nCongress who are complaining the most about rising tuition costs fail \nto see that at least for public institutions, which about 70 percent of \nour students attend, Members of Congress are the cause of the rising \ncosts. This is why it is true that State support for higher education \nhas been low during this decade.\n  Between 2000 and 2006, State spending for higher education increased \nby only 17 percent, while tuition at public institutions during that \ntime was up 63 percent. It is also true that the reason tuition costs \nare up is that State spending is down.\n  But what Members of Congress seem to be missing is that the principal \nreason State support of higher education is down is because Congress \nhas mandated that States pay so much for programs such as Medicaid or \nfail to meet their commitments to programs like the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA. When the Governors and legislatures \nare through paying for the mandates for Medicaid or to make up the lack \nof the Federal Government's commitment to IDEA, there is very little \nleft for higher education.\n  When Federal requirements for Medicaid dictate that State spending \nfor Medicaid goes up 7 or 8 percent a year when the overall State \nbudget is only going up 3 or 4 percent a year, the money has to come \nfrom somewhere. States have to balance their budgets, and in State \nafter State, the money has been coming from higher education. That was \ntrue in Tennessee during the 1980s, when I was the Governor, and it is \neven more true today.\n\n  During the 1980s, my major goal was to try to help us to spend at \nleast 50 percent of our State tax dollar on education. My major \nadversary was Federal Medicaid. While I ultimately did succeed in \ngetting to 50 cents, I had to squeeze it and push it and try to control \nit, and still it grew faster than everything else in the State budget. \nI was able to do that then because Medicaid and other health services \nwere only about 15 cents of the State tax dollar. But by this decade, \n2003 and 2004, the number was 40 percent of the State tax dollars in \nTennessee went to education, not 50, and 31 cents went to Medicaid and \nhealth services. I am confident most of the cutting came out of higher \neducation, which resulted in most of the tuition increases so the \nuniversities could operate and pay their bills.\n  I would respectfully suggest that we in Congress need to start along \ntwo completely different tracks if we want to retain the autonomy, \ncompetition, and choice that has led to quality and access to American \nhigher education. First, we need to deregulate, not overregulate higher \neducation. Cut this stack of rules and regulations in half and use the \ntime and the money for students and for academic excellence.\n  Second, we need to stop loading State budgets with so many unfunded \nFederal mandates. For example, if Congress were to fully fund IDEA, the \nprogram for students with disabilities, at 40 percent of its cost, \nwhich is what Congress said it would do in the 1970s, that would add \n$250 million to Tennessee's revenue stream. I am sure much of this \nwould go straight to higher education, whose annual budget is about \n$1.2 billion.\n  More importantly, we need to give States more flexibility in dealing \nwith Medicaid costs and give them an opportunity to take steps to make \nit easier to free themselves from outdated Federal Court consent \ndecrees, which restrict the ability of Governors and legislators to \ndirect money to higher education priorities. Then, of course, there is \nthe REAL ID, another $4 billion in unfunded mandates for the States, \nand out of which pot do you think the States might take that? Higher \neducation would be my guess. Most Governors and legislators can point \nto many more unfunded Federal mandates.\n  These two steps are the best way to drive down college costs and to \nmaintain academic excellence.\n  There are major accomplishments in this bill, some of which I have \nworked on and of which I am proud. They include simplifying the Federal \nstudent aid form and allowing year-round Pell grants for students \nmaking progress toward a degree. There is a new compliance calendar, \nwhich the Secretary of Education will be required to develop, that will \nset forth all of the reports and the disclosures required under the \nHigher Education Act. I am proud to say I suggested that. In other \nwords, the new Secretary of Education will have to make a calendar \nlisting every single report that has to be complied with, so the small \nCatholic college in Baltimore might not have to hire three more people \nin to go through this growing stack of requirements.\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\n  I authored the restrictions prohibiting the Secretary of Education \nfrom regulating student learning standards or requiring accreditors to \nadopt specific measures of learning assessment, which would have been \nadditional federalizing of our 6,000 autonomous institutions.\n  There is an accountability research grant in this bill to focus \nattention on institutions making progress in measuring student \nachievement and asking the advisory committee, which has already done \nsuch good work in simplifying the student application form, to review \nthis stack of growing Federal regulations. I also sponsored the new \ndiscretionary grant program for Teach for America.\n  All these actions in this bill are for the good, as is the increase \nin the availability of Pell grants for students who need help attending \ncollege. But I cannot support a piece of legislation that so undermines \nthe excellence in higher education that comes from institutional \nautonomy.\n  I would like to offer a few letters and statements, and I ask \nunanimous consent they be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the first of these is a release today \nfrom the National Governors Association, which points out that \nGovernors are responsible for making funding decisions that serve the \nbest interests of all citizens. The Governors, in their release, say:\n\n       Maintenance of effort undermines governors' authority and \n     guarantees students and their families will be writing larger \n     not smaller tuition checks in the future. This is not the \n     answer to affordable higher education. Governors oppose the \n     higher education bill because of the negative impacts of the \n     maintenance of effort and implore Congress to vote against \n     it.\n\n  We had a vote on stripping out the maintenance-of-effort bill, but I \nlost that by one vote in the conference committee. Basically, what it \nsays is that Members of the Senate and the House will substitute their \njudgment for that of Governors and State legislators. My suggestion was \nthat if we are going to pass a bill and take credit for requiring \nStates to spend more money on higher education, whether or not they \nhave other priorities, then we might as well also go back down to our \nState capitals and join in the pain and suggest to the Governors whom \nto lay off or what school to close or what mental hospital to limit or \nwhat tax to raise because of our requirement about higher education \nmaintenance of effort.\n\n  The second letter I would like to include in the Record comes from \nthe commissioner of the Department of Finance and Administration in \nNashville. Our Democratic Governor, Phil Bredesen, who has done a great \nmany good things for higher education during his 6 years, is in the \nmidst of a budget crisis. He is reacting to the very idea that during \nthe midst of that, when he is laying off employees and making cuts in \nvirtually every program, that we would take it upon ourselves to say \nthat if he doesn't increase funding for higher education, we are going \nto cut his Federal funding. All when we ourselves are one of the \nreasons he is having a hard time funding higher education, because of \nall our unfunded mandates.\n  The third letter I would like to include is from the chancellor of \nVanderbilt University in Nashville, one of our most distinguished \nresearch universities and one of which I am proud to be an alumnus. It \nis a well-modulated letter, as you would expect from the chancellor of \nVanderbilt. The letter argues very eloquently why the autonomy, \ncompetition, and choice that characterizes excellence in higher \neducation is so important and so fragile and needs to be respected by \nus as we pass higher education bills, rather than to use a blunderbuss \nand start stacking boxes and boxes of regulations on institutions such \nas Vanderbilt.\n  Why do we think we can do a better job in the Senate making \nVanderbilt University a better university by complying with all this \nstuff, when it takes money that might be used to educate the students \nand improve academic excellence? They already have deans, vice \nchancellors, provosts, chancellors, and a board of trustees. If they \nare a public institution, they have a Governor, they have a higher \neducation commission. They have plenty of overseers. They do not need \nus.\n  Two other letters, one from the president of Duke University, office \nof the president, Richard Brodhead, an equally thoughtful letter about \nthe Federal role in higher education. I might say that North Carolina \nhas done one of the best jobs of any State in accountability for higher \neducation.\n  No one is doubting we need accountability for the money the Federal \nGovernment spends. As I mentioned earlier, the dollars we spend for \nresearch, tens of millions a year, are made accountable by being \ncompetitively granted, for the most part. The dollars we spend for \ncolleges and universities don't go to the colleges and universities, \nthey go to the students, and the students choose the school. If they do \nnot like the school or the cost of the school, they may go to another \nschool. Each of those schools has to be accredited before the student \ncan choose the school. That has been a marvelous system for helping to \ngive autonomous institutions the freedom to be good, while at the same \ntime allowing for accountability for the money we spend.\n  Finally, two letters that were written to Senator Isakson of Georgia. \nOne is from the president of the University of Georgia, Mike Adams, who \nwas president of two other colleges before he was president of the \nUniversity of Georgia. A distinguished educator. Georgia, of course, is \none of our distinguished public universities in America.\n  Finally, a letter from the President of Emory University, James \nWagner, and the president of Georgia Tech, Gary Schuster, to Senator \nIsakson, making the same objections.\n  As I said at the beginning, I admire my colleagues, I admire their 4 \nyears of hard work, and I admire their commitment to a result. My hope \nwould be we could go on two different tracks from here. One would be to \nlook for ways to deregulate higher education, not add regulations to \nit. Realize that in America, where we are worrying that this might work \nor that might work, our system of higher education, with all its warts, \nis the best in the world. The rest of the world is trying to emulate \nit. Its greatest threat, in terms of its quality, is overregulation, \nnot underfunding.\n  That leads me to the second track we go on. I hope we will be careful \nas Members of Congress that if we have a great idea for States, that we \ndon't pass it and send them the bill. Because I know from having been \nGovernor and having been president of a university and having been \nSecretary of Education, and seeing it in different areas. As a Governor \nmaking up a budget, it's pretty well set that you start with K-12. That \nis pretty well set. He then goes to prisons, and that is probably in \nthe courts. Then he does mental health. That might be in the courts \ntoo. Then he or she goes to highways, and that comes from the gas tax. \nThen they are pretty well down to the choice between Medicaid and \nhigher education. I can guarantee you that if we continue to increase \nrequirements for funding of higher education at the State level, at the \nrate of 7, 8 or 9 percent a year, when State budgets are only going up \n2 or 3 or 4 percent a year, we will significantly reduce the quality of \nour State universities and colleges. We will significantly increase the \ntuition costs that we say in this bill we would like to lower.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   National Governors Association Statement on Higher Education Bill\n\n\ngovernors Say Inclusion of Maintenance of Effort Will Raise Tuition for \n                                Students\n\n       Washington.--The National Governors Association released \n     the following statement regarding the impending vote on the \n     Higher Education Reauthorization bill:\n       ``The nation's governors are committed to providing \n     students in their states with affordable access to higher \n     education and agree that the reauthorization of the Higher \n     Education bill is a priority. However, inclusion of the \n     Maintenance of Effort (MOE) provision in the bill has \n     negative implications for states; therefore governors oppose \n     the passage of the conference report with this provision.\n       ``Governors must balance their budgets in both good and bad \n     economic times. This mandate means that states will be unable \n     to make major increases or invest one-time surpluses in \n     higher education during good times because they will be \n     penalized if forced to reduce spending during difficult \n     times. In the end, this will increase the cost of college for \n     students and their families.\n       ``Governors are responsible for making funding decisions \n     that serve the best interest\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\n     of all their citizens. MOE undermines governors' authority \n     and guarantees that students and their families will be \n     writing larger, not smaller, tuition checks in the future. \n     This is not the answer to affordable higher education. \n     Governors oppose the higher education bill because of the \n     negative impacts of the maintenance of effort and implore \n     Congress to vote against it.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                               State of Tennessee,\n\n\n      Department of Finance and Administration, State Capitol,\n\n                                     Nashville, TN, July 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     United States Senate, Via Email.\n       Dear Senator Alexander, The State of Tennessee shares your \n     concerns with regard to the MOE mandate provided in the \n     higher education bill and appreciates your efforts in \n     defending our state interests. These restrictions on a \n     state's ability to manage its way through a fiscal downturn \n     would be a terrible mistake.\n       Under Governor Bredesen's leadership, we have made public \n     education a priority. We know sufficient funding is critical \n     to achieving success in primary, secondary and higher \n     education. During the good economic times, we've increased \n     funding for higher education operating costs and put over $1 \n     billion into capital projects.\n       However, when times are tough economically, we have to \n     share the downside. When budget cuts have been necessary, \n     education programs were always last to be considered. \n     Unfortunately, Governor Bredesen has experienced two very \n     tough budget fiscal years during his six years in office, FY \n     2003/2004 and FY 2008/2009. The severe problems required some \n     base reductions in higher education's operating budgets. In \n     FY 2003-04 there was a 9 percent base reduction of \n     $101,327,200. In the current fiscal year, we were facing a \n     $464 million total shortfall, and again had to ask higher \n     education to do its part. As a result, higher education \n     received a base reduction in its operating budget of $55.8 \n     million. These reductions were not made lightly. However, our \n     constitution requires us to balance, and in a relatively poor \n     state, we have no choice but to spread the reductions as \n     broadly as possible.\n       Our economy remains uncertain. We already face numerous \n     restrictions on the state's ability to manage from our \n     federal partner. An MOE mandate that reduces our flexibility \n     even further is not warranted. We appreciate your efforts to \n     oppose this measure.\n           Warmest Regards,\n                                                 M. D. Goetz, Jr.,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Vanderbilt University,\n\n                                                    July 23, 2008.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: After nearly five years of work and \n     ten years since the last reauthorization, I understand that \n     the Higher Education Act reauthorization is nearly complete. \n     It has been a long process, and I commend the Congress for \n     its fortitude to enact the bill this year. My regret is that \n     this final product is not one that I can be proud to share \n     with the Vanderbilt campus.\n       As a new chancellor, I have the luxury, or some would say \n     misfortune, of only seeing the end result of the past five \n     years of negotiations. When I accepted the position as \n     Vanderbilt's chancellor, I did so knowing that my first and \n     most important priority is, and always will be, our students. \n     Vanderbilt's mission states:\n       Vanderbilt University is a center for scholarly research, \n     informed and creative teaching, and service to the community \n     and society at large. Vanderbilt will uphold the highest \n     standards and be a leader in the: quest for new knowledge \n     through scholarship; dissemination of knowledge through \n     teaching and outreach; creative experimentation of ideas and \n     concepts.\n       In pursuit of these goals, Vanderbilt values most highly: \n     intellectual freedom that supports open inquiry; equality, \n     compassion, and excellence in all endeavors.\n       With this mission in mind, I have been evaluating the \n     conference agreement for the Higher Education Act. While \n     there are provisions in this agreement that will support and \n     enhance our mission, there are many other provisions that \n     deeply trouble me and, I think, have the potential to \n     profoundly threaten our ability to be a ``center for \n     scholarly research, informed and creative teaching, and \n     service to the community and society at large.''\n       I believe you share my view that at the heart of the \n     American system of higher education are its autonomy and its \n     great diversity. What works for Vanderbilt may not work for \n     Rhodes College, MTSU, Volunteer State Community College, or \n     any other school in Tennessee. I firmly believe that \n     increased federal intrusion into higher education would \n     fundamentally and irreparably damage our system of \n     postsecondary education. For these reasons, I am saddened to \n     conclude that Vanderbilt cannot wholeheartedly endorse this \n     conference agreement. However, before I enumerate the reasons \n     for our reservations, I would be remiss in did not \n     acknowledge and applaud the Congress--and you in particular--\n     for preserving institutional autonomy with respect to the \n     accreditation process. As you know, this has been our top \n     priority throughout the reauthorization, and we are extremely \n     pleased by the final outcome on this issue. Vanderbilt \n     strongly supports an institution's ability to choose how it \n     will demonstrate success with respect to student achievement \n     as well as the standards by which such achievement is \n     measured. We have consistently opposed any effort to make \n     accrediting agencies agents of the federal government; in \n     particular, we believe that the Secretary of Education should \n     not be able to regulate in this area. This responsibility \n     must lie with individual institutions.\n       The issue of accreditation is of such paramount concern to \n     Vanderbilt that, had this not been adequately addressed, we \n     would have strongly considered opposing the entire agreement. \n     We are grateful that we do not have to take this drastic \n     action, and we have you--and your staff--to thank for this. \n     Without your unyielding persistence on the matter of \n     institutional autonomy with respect to accreditation, the \n     outcome would have been far different. Vanderbilt is \n     immensely proud to call you one of our own and is indebted to \n     you and your staff for your efforts.\n       Nonetheless, there is a lengthy list of provisions with \n     which we have serious concerns. We recognize that many \n     Members and staff have worked diligently on this legislation \n     for years, and we regret that more reasonable language was \n     not agreed upon.\n       Chief among our concerns are the countless number of new \n     regulations with which universities are going to be forced to \n     comply, covering such topics as peer-to-peer file sharing, \n     campus emergency notifications, data on alumni, charitable \n     gifts, student diversity, immunization records, missing \n     person reports, and lobbying efforts. These new regulations \n     will place an immense burden on institutions and carry with \n     them a heavy implementation price tag. At the same time that \n     we are trying to rein in costs, we are facing spiraling \n     expenses associated with complying with federal regulations. \n     Overregulation of higher education institutions threatens the \n     core of what makes our system successful--its autonomy and \n     its diversity.\n       We also remain concerned about provisions that could lead \n     us along the path toward federal price controls through the \n     creation of innumerable ``Watch Lists;'' a mandatory \n     Department of Education developed net price calculator; \n     mandatory ``Quality and Efficiency Task Forces;'' projecting \n     future tuition; and reporting on tuition based on income \n     categories. Vanderbilt is committed to ensuring that every \n     admitted student can afford to attend Vanderbilt, regardless \n     of their financial situation and regardless of what the \n     ``sticker price'' is. We are very proud of the fact that we \n     meet 100 percent of a student's demonstrated financial need.\n       Finally, provisions related to textbook prices continue to \n     concern us. Requirements that ISBN numbers for textbooks be \n     disclosed in course catalogs are, frankly, unworkable as many \n     courses have not finalized their textbooks at the time the \n     catalog is printed. We recognize that textbook costs have \n     grown considerably and are committed to finding ways to \n     address this; federal requirements and a ``one-size-fits-\n     all'' approach, again, fail to recognize the immense \n     diversity of our nation's colleges and universities.\n       In short, other than the accreditation language, there is \n     very little to support in this final agreement. Ultimately, \n     in my estimation, this bill will do more harm than good for \n     the students it purports to serve. Legislation that hampers \n     an institution's ability to educate its students threatens \n     our institutional mission. I am deeply troubled that the \n     conferees will agree to this woefully misguided legislation, \n     and I worry about how it will be implemented and the \n     ramifications of that implementation. Therefore, I urge you \n     to think carefully about whether this is the direction we \n     want to take postsecondary education and whether this \n     legislation supports the fundamental nature of our system of \n     higher education.\n       Thank you again for your strong and principled leadership \n     on so many issues about which we care deeply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Nicholas S.

Two years \n     ago I wrote the North Carolina congressional delegation \n     urging our representatives to vote against the House version \n     of the REA because of the significant steps the legislation \n     took toward eroding the role of trustees in institutional \n     governance and the longstanding, successful relationship \n     between the\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\n     federal government and institutions of higher education. \n     While the current legislation is somewhat more palatable, I \n     fear that it still represents a major intrusion and \n     regulatory encumbrance for higher education and that the \n     proportion of bureaucracy relative to public value will be \n     extremely high.\n       Please allow me to highlight several troublesome provisions \n     that I urge you to revise or eliminate before the bill moves \n     forward:\n       It is apparent that you have taken our concerns about the \n     inappropriateness of unnecessary federal control of \n     accreditation seriously. Including language that limits the \n     authority of the Secretary of Education from prescribing \n     standards and otherwise regulating measures of student \n     achievement success is welcome. But, the language is not \n     restrictive enough. I urge you to modify it specifically to \n     prevent the Secretary from regulating standards for faculty, \n     facilities, equipment, supplies, student services and the \n     fiscal and administrative capacity of institutions.\n       Duke takes the accreditation process with great \n     seriousness, and we use what we learn from our intensive \n     self-study, as well as external evaluations, to help guide \n     the high quality of the educational experiences we offer our \n     students. Duke is currently in the midst of its decennial \n     review with the Commission on Colleges of the Southern \n     Association--of Colleges and Universities (SACS). I am \n     impressed with the thoughtful questions the SACS team asks of \n     us regarding a wide range of issues. Maintaining this quasi-\n     independent system of assessment and assurance of quality is \n     an important contribution to the unique success of American \n     higher education. While there are areas of accreditation that \n     may need some tinkering, it is not role, nor is it wise \n     public policy, to have the responsibility of institutional \n     trustees and accreditation usurped by federal intrusion. I \n     urge you to fully close the door on the Secretary's ability \n     to dictate the measurement of standards that should remain \n     outside the scope of the federal government's responsibility \n     in higher education.\n       At a time when institutions are struggling to find ways to \n     reduce administrative costs, I am struck by the number of new \n     reporting requirements in the bill, which inevitably will \n     lead to greater bureaucracy both at the institution and at \n     the Department of Education. For example, the reporting of \n     graduation rates in 48 different student categories gives \n     pause and raises questions about the usefulness of such \n     information.\n       Penalizing institutions for increasing tuition by requiring \n     a report to the Department of Education about cost reducing \n     strategies is an egregious notion, at best. There is little \n     doubt that the quality of the educational experience Duke \n     provides does not come cheap. Our trustees invest in \n     progressive and aggressive financial aid programs to make a \n     Duke education affordable to the more than 40 percent of Duke \n     students who receive financial aid under Duke's need-blind \n     admissions policy. In the coming year alone, we are budgeting \n     more than $86 million from institutional funds to help ensure \n     that no admitted student is denied access to the Duke \n     educational experience for financial reasons. Our trustees \n     have developed over time both policies and procedures to \n     ensure that the university's budget--including our tuition \n     and financial aid programs--is consistent with the mission of \n     the university. Inserting the Department of Education into \n     this conversation eats away at the delineation between \n     governmental responsibility and institutional autonomy. \n     Please remove this provision.\n       Along those same lines, the proposed requirement to provide \n     non-binding, multi-year estimates of future tuition and fee \n     levels, is misleading and inappropriate. In order for this to \n     be of minimal assistance to an entering student, each \n     institution of higher education would need to forecast every \n     individual student's financial situation in advance. Each \n     year we reassess all of our students' financial aid packages \n     to make sure we are meeting each student's demonstrated need. \n     If their financial situation changes during the year--for \n     instance if their mother loses her job or wins the lottery--\n     the aid package is appropriately adjusted. We simply can't \n     predict what will happen to the, student, nor can we predict \n     the needs of the university as far in advance as the proposed \n     legislation would require.\n       There is much in the proposed REA that will benefit \n     students, their families, and institutions of higher \n     education, and I applaud the Congress for these positive \n     steps. As the bill works its way to passage, I urge you and \n     your colleagues to reconsider the inappropriate regulatory \n     burden that will be placed on institutions of higher \n     education if this legislation passes as currently written.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard H. Brodhead.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        The University of Georgia,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                        Athens, GA, July 16, 2008.\n     Hon. Johnny Isakson,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Isakson: As conference consideration of the \n     Higher Education Act Reauthorization progresses, I would like \n     to take the opportunity to comment on the latest draft of the \n     proposed legislation.\n       As you know, we have followed the process to reauthorize \n     the Higher Education Act very closely. We at the University \n     of Georgia appreciate that, during this process, you have \n     been an advocate for higher education nationally as well as \n     for our institution and the University System of Georgia.\n       In the latest draft, many improvements have been made, \n     particularly in the areas of accreditation, teacher education \n     reporting, and collection of data on alumni. While such \n     improvements are laudable, the legislation, in its current \n     form, still represents a major intrusion and regulatory \n     burden for higher education.\n       It is always difficult to balance the need for transparency \n     in the educational process with the burdens associated with \n     new regulations. In a time of declining state funds for \n     higher education and a need to reduce administrative costs, I \n     am concerned about the wisdom of creating new unfunded \n     mandates for reporting data from our universities. Many of \n     the new requirements contained in the draft of this bill are \n     unnecessary and/or duplicative, and they would impose \n     significant compliance costs in exchange for little, if any, \n     benefit. I fear these reporting requirements will lead to \n     greater bureaucracy both at the institution level and at the \n     Department of Education.\n       Please allow me to highlight a few troublesome areas that \n     UGA and other members of the National Association of State \n     Universities and Land-Grant Colleges are seeking to revise or \n     eliminate before the bill moves forward:\n       College Costs and Transparency: The proposed ``watch'' \n     lists in Title I of the bill for institutions that must raise \n     tuition; the reporting requirements related to the lists; and \n     the proposed provisions in Title VIII of the bill (Tierney \n     provisions) that would establish new requirements for costs \n     reporting and reducing net tuition. All of these could be \n     simplified, and Section 830 of the conference legislation \n     would place additional reporting requirements on institutions \n     with respect to costs and is inconsistent with the cost \n     provisions of Title I.\n       Multi-year Tuition Price Estimates: The Murphy-Myrick \n     Amendment would require institutions to publish non-binding, \n     multi-year estimates of future tuition and fee levels. \n     Although ``non-binding,'' these figures would create the \n     potential for ill will between universities and prospective \n     students if the state of the economy or other events force \n     institutions to take action. As you know, tuition at state \n     universities is inextricably linked to funding from the \n     state. This provision is fundamentally flawed and should be \n     addressed.\n       New Reporting Requirements: This legislation would impose a \n     host of new reporting requirements on colleges and \n     universities that would be virtually impossible to meet. For \n     example, the bill would require universities to obtain \n     information on alumni employment, salary, and graduate \n     education. Such data is very valuable, but we cannot compel \n     graduates to report it.\n       Student Diversity and Graduation Rates Reporting \n     Requirements: Institutions would be required to report to the \n     Department of Education the percentage of enrolled, full-time \n     students who are male, female, Pell Grant-eligible, and self-\n     identified members of a major racial or ethnic group. These \n     categories would also be applied to existing reporting of \n     graduation rates. Institutions would have to report \n     graduation rates in no fewer than 48 separate categories. To \n     determine Pell Grant eligibility, institutions would have to \n     demand private financial information.\n       Peer-to-Peer File Sharing/Copyright Infringement \n     Requirements: Institutions would be required to disclose \n     ``the development of plans to detect and prevent unauthorized \n     distribution of copyrighted material on the institution's \n     information technology system, which shall, to the extent \n     practicable, include offering alternatives to illegal \n     downloading.'' Although our institutions offer alternatives \n     to illegal downloading, the technology simply does not exist \n     to prevent all unauthorized distribution of copyrighted \n     material on our IT systems.\n       While it has the potential to benefit students, their \n     families, and institutions of higher education, the \n     regulatory requirements and the additional costs relative to \n     benefits are such that I would recommend that you vote \n     against this bill. We hope for a better version to come along \n     shortly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael F. Adams,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Emory University,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                       Atlanta, GA, July 14, 2008.\n     Hon. Johnny Isakson,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Isakson: As conference consideration of the \n     Higher Education Act Reauthorization progresses, we \n     respectfully write to offer our comments on the latest draft \n     of the proposed legislation.\n       As you are aware, we have followed very closely the process \n     to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. We appreciate that, \n     during this process, you have been an advocate for higher \n     education nationally as well as in the state of Georgia. \n     Specifically, we have been pleased with improvements in the \n     areas of accreditation, teacher education reporting, and \n     collection of income data.\n       While improvements have been made, the legislation in its \n     current form represents a major intrusion and regulatory \n     encumbrance for higher education. At a time when institutions \n     of higher education are struggling to find ways to reduce \n     administrative costs, we are gravely concerned about the \n     collective weight of these new federal requirements.\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\n     The draft bill would significantly increase the number of \n     federal requirements with which universities must comply. \n     Many of the new proposed requirements are unnecessary and/or \n     duplicative, and they would impose significant compliance \n     costs in exchange for little, if any, benefit. We fear these \n     reporting requirements will lead to greater bureaucracy both \n     at the institution level and at the Department of Education.\n       Please allow us to highlight several other troublesome \n     areas that we hope can be revised or eliminated before the \n     bill moves forward:\n       College Costs: The proposed 400 ``watch'' lists in Title I \n     of the bill; the reporting requirements related to the lists; \n     and the proposed provisions in Title VIII of the bill \n     (Tierney provisions) that would establish new requirements \n     for costs reporting and reducing net tuition should be \n     simplified. The proposed reporting requirements in Title I \n     and Title VIII of the bill would require ``high-cost'' \n     institutions to form cost efficiency task forces and issue \n     reports to the Department describing actions they are taking \n     to reduce costs and net tuition.\n       Tuition Price Estimates: The Murphy-Myrick Amendment would \n     require institutions to publish non-binding, multi-year \n     estimates of future tuition and fee levels. In order for this \n     to be of even minimal assistance to an entering student, each \n     institution of higher education would need to forecast every \n     individual student's financial situation in advance. \n     Furthermore, public universities are highly dependent on \n     state funding, making such estimates nearly impossible.\n       Alumni Reporting Requirements: Institutions would be \n     required to report on alumni employment and enrollment in \n     graduate and professional education programs. Although we \n     would like to have more detailed information on our alumni, \n     we cannot force them to provide us with this information.\n       Student Diversity and Graduation Rates Reporting \n     Requirement: Institutions would be required to report to the \n     Department of Education the percentage of enrolled, full-time \n     students who are male, female, Pell Grant-eligible, and self-\n     identified members of a major racial or ethnic group. These \n     categories would also be applied to existing reporting of \n     graduation rates. Institutions would have to report \n     graduation rates in no fewer than 48 separate categories. \n     Although we already collect some of this information, other \n     data, like Pell Grant-eligible, would require us to demand \n     personal financial information that our students, and their \n     parents, may not want to share with us.\n       Peer-to-Peer File Sharing/Copyright Infringement \n     Requirements: Institutions would be required to disclose \n     ``the development of plans to detect and prevent unauthorized \n     distribution of copyrighted material on the institution's \n     information technology system, which shall, to the extent \n     practicable, include offering alternatives to illegal \n     downloading.'' Although our institutions offer alternatives \n     to illegal downloading, the technology simply does not exist \n     to prevent all unauthorized distribution of copyrighted \n     material on our IT systems.\n       We have asked our staff to provide your staff with more \n     information detailing our concerns with this legislation in \n     its current form. The proposed HEA has the potential to \n     greatly benefit students, their families, and institutions of \n     higher education. We applaud Congress for these steps. \n     However, we urge Congress to reconsider the inappropriate \n     regulatory burden that will be placed on institutions of \n     higher education if this legislation passes in its current \n     form.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              James W. Wagner,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                                 Emory University.\n\n                                                Gary Schuster,\n\n                                                Interim President,\n                                  Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, under our agreement, I will yield time \nto our colleague, Senator Harkin from Iowa, but before I do, I wish to \ndo two things.\n  First, a few minutes ago we heard from our colleague, Senator \nBingaman, about the untimely death of one of Senator Bingaman's key \nstaffer's sons. Bob Simon is a staff director on his Energy Committee. \nBob Simon's 16-year-old son passed away, and he, Senator Bingaman, was \npaying an eloquent tribute about this very melancholy situation. On \nbehalf of the Senate, we would like to extend our condolences to the \nSimon family.\n  The other comment I wish to make is in response, very quickly, to the \ncomments my colleague from Tennessee made.\n  First, I would like to thank my colleague from Tennessee for his very \ncollegial and thoughtful efforts as we moved our bill through. I \nenjoyed our conversations, from talking about bluegrass and Grand Old \nOpry, we went on to high notes and higher education, and then we went \non to maintenance of effort.\n  I am sorry you took out the regulatory stack you had because it is \nbigger than I am. As we said in our conversation, I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from Tennessee to see if some of the regs \nmight be dated, arcane, duplicative, and so on and how, over the next \nyear or so, we could look forward to doing that.\n  But before I move off from the reg comment, I do wish to comment \nabout the maintenance of effort. In many ways, I understand the point \nthe Senator from Tennessee is making. My own home State of Maryland's \nGovernor O'Malley inherited a $1.7 billion budget deficit that was not \nof his making, and at the same time I understand Governors and State \nlegislators are facing real obstacles. However, we need to be \nrealistic. Congress is doing its part by increasing Pell grants, and \nfamilies can be assured that as the Federal Government increases its \ncommitment to colleges, funds will not be offset by the States.\n\n  Last night we did pass an amendment offered by another gentleman from \nMassachusetts, Congressman Tierney. What his amendment does is provide \nincentives and funds to Governors, which they can use for a broad range \nof college access activities. They would be able to access $66 million \nto States to use on a variety of very important college access \nactivities, particularly need-based grants and college prep programs.\n  But I also want to acknowledge the validity of the issues raised by \nthe Senator from Tennessee on unfunded mandates.\n  Over here we have a champion.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, may I have 60 seconds to respond?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, but I am not done with my comments so I have not \nyielded the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am sorry.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wish to comment on the unfunded mandates. The Senator \nwho will speak shortly has been a champion of the disability community \nand a leader of the IDEA community. We have been fighting to double \nIDEA and we have been trying to do it on both sides of the aisle. We \nlook forward to having the Senator's support to do exactly that. We \nlook forward to increasing the Federal role in Medicaid, particularly \nin SCHIP, which would be a very important component of Medicaid.\n  Last, but not at all least, in Medicaid, 80 percent of the money goes \nto 20 percent of the population. That 20 percent of the population that \ngets that Medicaid is primarily old or fragile people in nursing homes, \nmany of whom have serious cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's.\n  Let's get the Coburn hold off my bill to double funding for \nAlzheimer's. One of the ways to lower the cost of Medicaid is to find \nthe cure of the cognitive stretchout for people with Alzheimer's. It is \nestimated by NIH and other institutions that comment on these things \nthat we could reduce Medicaid by $5 to $11 billion a year if we could \ndo that.\n  I think we can work our way through this, but I must say, working \nwith the Senator from Tennessee has been indeed a pleasure. It has been \nbased on intellectual rigor, good conversation, excellent exchanges of \nideas. I look forward to doing more of it and trying to solve some of \nthe problems that we both strongly believe need to be addressed.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may just acknowledge the remarks of the Senator, \nI feel the same way about working with her. I am delighted we will be \nworking together to take a look at the rules and regulations that we \nimpose from here in Congress to make sure they are useful and needed. \nThe natural thing here is to add. It is also very natural for us to \nhave good ideas, but we might discover that the dean or the provost or \nthe Governor or somebody else might have a good idea as well.\n  This is one of those issues that has no partisan attribute \nwhatsoever. As far as I am concerned, the Republicans are as bad as the \nDemocrats on unfunded Federal mandates and unnecessary regulations. I \nlook forward to an opportunity to work with the Senator from Maryland \nto see if we can identify a process that makes certain that \ninstitutions are accountable for the Federal dollars, but at the same \ntime we leave them free to be excellent in their own autonomous ways.\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield to the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, also \na member of the Health-Education committee and who is a prime mover in \nthe area of expanding access for people with disabilities to be able to \nhave access to higher education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I came here to speak, obviously, in favor \nof the Higher Education Opportunity Act. Passage of this bill today \nrestores the Federal commitment to make a college education a reality \nfor Americans from all walks of life. I commend Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Enzi for all of their hard work in passing this bill. I \nrecognize and thank my good friend, Senator Mikulski, for stepping in \nand shepherding this bill to final completion the other evening.\n  The Higher Education Opportunity Act is the first reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act in 10 years. It takes clear and strong action \nto make college more affordable for low- and middle-income students and \ntheir families, our top higher education priority.\n  This legislation will provide families with accurate information on \nthe cost of college at any school, as well as hold colleges accountable \nfor skyrocketing tuition and fees.\n  I am also proud we have saved money for students by requiring \npublishers to no longer bundle unnecessary materials with their \ntextbooks, giving students the freedom to buy only what they need for \ntheir classes.\n  I have heard from students about the need to reform the unnecessary \nlong form that is required to receive Federal student aid. It is called \nthe Free Application for Federal Student Aid form--FAFSA, I understand \nis the short term nomenclature for that.\n  The bill we have here cuts through much of the redtape to immediately \nprovide a 2-page application for low-income students and to phase out \nthe current 7-page form for all students in 5 years.\n  In recent years we have seen corruption and mismanagement in the \nstudent loan arena. This bill takes strong action to root out the \nlenders' improper gifts and inducements for school financial aid \nofficers and to protect students from scurrilous private lending \npractices.\n  I am proud of the many achievements of this bill. I want to take the \ntime to highlight two initiatives included in this bill that I was \nproud to sponsor.\n  I started my legal career as a legal aid lawyer. It is an experience \nI will never forget and always cherish. Our promise of equal justice \nunder law rings hollow if those who are most vulnerable are denied \naccess to representation. But right now it is almost impossible for a \nnew lawyer, a new young lawyer, newly admitted to the bar, to make the \nchoice that I made, to work for legal aid. The average starting salary \nfor a legal aid lawyer is now about $35,000 a year. But the average \nannual loan repayment burden for a new law school graduate is $12,000. \nThat doesn't leave a lot left over for rent or food or for starting a \nfamily.\n  The Legal Aid Loan Repayment Program, which we have included in this \nbill, will make it possible for young lawyers to make a longer \ncommitment to equal justice. The program is simple. If a legal aid \nlawyer agrees to make a minimum 3-year commitment, he or she will be \neligible for up to $6,000 a year to help repay their student loan debt. \nThis is a critical step to ensuring that qualified lawyers can be \nrecruited and retained to represent low-income Americans.\n  I particularly again thank Senator Mikulski for her great leadership \nin this area, both on this committee and on the Appropriations \nCommittee, in making sure we have adequate funding for the Legal \nServices Corporation and now, in this bill, to make sure we have a \ncommitment to helping legal aid lawyers repay their student loans if \nthey want to be a legal aid lawyer for at least 3 years.\n  I am also proud this legislation includes a Realtime Writers Program, \nan initiative I have long fought for to improve the quality of life for \nmore than 30 million Americans who are deaf or have a hearing \nimpairment. As many know, my late brother Frank was deaf for all of his \nlife. I know from personal experience that access to culture and to \nnews and other media was important to him and to others in having a \ngood quality of life.\n  Closed captioning, which many of us now take for granted on our \ntelevision sets, doesn't benefit those with a hearing impairment, \nhowever. Captioning improves the quality of life of individuals seeking \nto read or to speak better, adults who may be functionally illiterate, \nimmigrants learning English as a second language and children just \nlearning to read. Captioning also helps travelers trying to get \nemergency information in loud settings such as airports or bus \nterminals or train stations. I would guess that every American at some \ntime or another relies on the captioning on their television to get \nsome kind of information.\n  As part of the 1996 Telecom Act, I offered an amendment, a \nrequirement in that bill now, that all English language television \nbroadcasts must be realtime captioned by 2006. Every television program \nmust be realtime captioned by 2006. That date has come and gone and all \ntelevision programs are still not realtime captioned. This is due to a \nlack of captioners. So what has happened is that stations all across \nthe country have asked the FCC for waivers from this requirement, which \nthey should have because we simply do not have the supply of people \ntrained to be realtime captioners. Passage of the Realtime Writers Act, \nwhich is now in this bill, authorizes competitive grants to recruit and \ntrain realtime writers to alleviate this shortage.\n  This is a very good bill. It has a lot of good things in it to help \nlow-income families and kids to be able to get to college. It \nalleviates some of the burdens, some debts kids have hanging over their \nheads when they get through. It provides, as I said, for some of the \nunbundling of textbook materials and things that students buy that they \ndo not need all of. Of course, as I said, it does a lot to weed out the \ncorruption and mismanagement in the student loan program.\n  To close here, I often speak of the necessity of having a ladder of \nopportunity for our kids in this country, a ladder of opportunity for \nall of our citizens. A college education is an essential rung on that \nladder. I am proud to support the Higher Education Opportunity Act \nwhich I believe extends that ladder of opportunity to more Americans \nwho want to better themselves, their communities, and our country with \na college education.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, and in particular \nSenator Mikulski for stepping in and helping, with Senator Enzi, to \nbring this bill to completion. Hopefully we will have an overwhelming \nvote in favor of this conference report later this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I believe under the previous order we will move to Senator \nMurkowski for 5 minutes at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the \nconference report to the Higher Education Opportunity Act. The \nreauthorization of this act, the Higher Education Act, has taken 5 \nyears and thousands of hours to complete. I congratulate Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi for guiding us through passage of the Senate \nbill and then through a long and somewhat contentious conference \nprocess. Their leadership has brought us to an achievement of which we \ncan all be proud. It is a bipartisan product that will have a positive \nimpact on the lives of American students.\n  I also acknowledge and thank Senator Mikulski for the good work she \nhas done, stepping in for Senator Kennedy during his period of absence, \nin order to help us resolve these last issues.\n  The Higher Education Opportunity Act includes many provisions that \nwill benefit students and student loan borrowers in my home State of \nAlaska. One provision of which I am particularly proud will assist \nmembers of the military, particularly those who are in the lowest \nranks. It will help them and help their spouses and their children to \nafford college or job training.\n  I had the opportunity last winter to visit Fort Richardson, outside \nof Anchorage. I met with the spouses of the deployed soldiers who were \nover in Iraq. It was kind of a townhall meeting. I was there to ask \nthem what I could do to help make their lives a little bit easier, help \nthem get through the long winter. One of them told me\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nthat the one thing that was keeping her from being able to afford to go \nto college was the money that the military pays to help offset a \nportion of their housing costs. The housing allowance prevented her \nfrom being eligible for a Pell grant.\n  Given the low rate of pay for many members of our military, \nparticularly those in the lowest ranks, they could not afford to take \non any student loan debt. So I made contact with the National Military \nFamilies Association and learned that so many military spouses are in \nthat same position.\n  So what we included in this legislation, through my provision, is \nlanguage that excludes the cost of the basic allowance for housing for \nservicemembers who live off base, as well as the value of on-base \nhousing. We exclude that from being calculated in the final \ncalculations for financial need.\n  Excluding the basic housing allowance, which in the vast majority of \ncases does not completely cover military families' housing costs, and \nthe value of on-base housing will benefit the least well paid members \nof our military and their spouses, whether they be privates, seaman \napprentices, lance corporals, airmen--those folks whose base pay is \nless than $35,000 per year. While they are off defending our country at \nwar, we want to be able to help the spouses and family members who \nremain at home.\n  I am very pleased to know that this wonderful woman I had the \nprivilege to meet last winter, and potentially thousands like her, will \nhave a better chance now of being able to attend college or obtain job \ntraining.\n  Another provision I was pleased to participate in and to author \nauthorizes a program dedicated to improving science, technology, and \nengineering and mathematics education, with a focus on Alaska Native \nand Native Hawaiian students.\n  There are three programs in Alaska, Washington State, and Hawaii. \nThey have had outstanding success using an innovative model to recruit \nand support Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students through \nengineering, science, and technology programs. These are available at \nthe University of Alaska, the University of Hawaii, and also through \nthe Maui Economic Development Board.\n  The programs' graduation rate is phenomenal. By identifying the \nstudents who have an interest in math, science, and technology while \nthey are still in middle school, helping them to graduate from high \nschool with the courses they need to be successful in those disciplines \nin college, and then mentoring them throughout the college program, \nthese entities have helped so many of our young students, Natives and \nthe non-Natives alike, to really succeed in these demanding and high-\nneed fields.\n  The Higher Education Opportunity Act includes many provisions of \nwhich Members of the Senate can be proud. Suffice it to say that before \nthe fall semester begins at many colleges around the country, we will \nhave authorized: improvements to the Federal Pell grant; changes \ndesigned to help colleges and textbook publishers take steps to make \nthe textbooks more affordable; increased and improved information about \nthe cost of college and financial aid; rules intended to increase \nstudents' safety on campus; and greater State involvement in and \naccountability to the public for the success of our teacher preparation \nprograms.\n  There are so many provisions in this legislation that I think we have \nto be proud of, and I thank my colleagues for their good work and \ncertainly urge all Members to support this legislation. And my thanks \nto those who have led this through the process: Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Enzi, and Senator Mikulski.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator from Vermont 2 minutes so he can \nmake a brief statement before he presides, and then to Senator Brown.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Brown. I will be \nvery brief.\n  In the United States today, there is a nursing shortage approaching a \ncrisis. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1.2 \nmillion new and replacement nurses will be needed by 2014. We are not \neducating enough nurses to meet this need, which is why the U.S. \nDepartment of Health foresees a nursing shortage of over 1 million by \n2020. Yet, even with such an enormous need for nurses, U.S. nursing \nschools turned away--turned away--41,000 qualified applicants for \nbaccalaureate and graduate nursing programs in 2005 because they do not \nhave the resources to train more nurses. If community college nursing \nprograms are included in these numbers, 150,000 well-qualified \napplicants are turned away each year from nursing programs.\n  The College Opportunity and Affordability Act includes an important \nnew program which will enable our colleges to train more nurses to meet \nthe nursing crisis. It provides extra capacity for nursing students in \na very simple, efficient, and cost-effective way.\n  The nursing provision in title VIII provides colleges, community \ncolleges, and universities a grant for each additional student their \nnursing program enrolls over their previous average enrollment. The \nnursing program gets a $3,000 grant for each additional student, money \nwhich will help defray the increased cost required to teach and train \nthat student. With this program in place, nursing programs can expand \nto admit an additional 10,000 student nurses each year, or more, at \nmodest costs.\n  I thank Chairman Mikulski, and I thank Huck Gutman of my office for \nhis outstanding work over the last year. This is an outstanding \nprogram, and we are going to begin to address a serious problem.\n  I yield for Senator Brown.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I control the time. I now yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. I wish to thank Chairman Kennedy, Ranking Member Enzi, and \nespecially Senator Mikulski for her terrific work, and their staffs. \nJ.D. LaRock was especially helpful; Erin Renner, Carmel Martin, and \nMissy Rohrbach. I wish to give special thanks to Will Jawando in my \noffice for his terrific success on this legislation. He celebrated the \nsuccess of the full conference committee, which was earlier this week, \nby taking the Maryland bar for those 2 days during the actual passage \nof the conference committee.\n  The conference report before us takes important steps toward breaking \ndown the barriers to higher education by addressing affordability and \naccess. With college costs at alltime highs, family income and student \naid simply have not kept up.\n  In my home State of Ohio, between 2001 and 2006, the cost of \nattendance has increased 53 percent at 4-year public colleges. Yet the \nmedian income in Ohio, household income, increased only 3 percent. We \nknow the purchasing power of the Pell grant has fallen dramatically. \nStudents and parents are finding it harder and harder to figure out a \nway to finance their education. But our bill, as we know, increases \nPell grants to $8,000 by 2014, enabling thousands of low-income and \nfirst-time students to attend institutions of higher education. For the \nfirst time, low-income students can receive Pell grants year-round, \nallowing them to accelerate the completion of their degrees.\n  The Free Application for Federal Student Aid required for the receipt \nof Federal student aid is currently seven pages long and acts too often \nas a barrier for students seeking college aid. We have begun the \nprocess of taking care of the complexities and the bureaucracy of that.\n  In the last 2 years, I have held about 110 roundtables around my \nState, in 75 of the 88 counties, listening to people telling me what we \nshould do with higher education and other issues.\n  Last Memorial Day, I met with veterans who were also students at \nCleveland State University. I met with them at a veterans hospital and \nheard directly about their experiences transitioning from the \nbattlefield to the classroom.\n  This bill takes steps to ensure student veterans get the assistance \nthey need. It authorizes funds for campuses to create Centers of \nExcellence for Veteran Student Success. It is modeled after a program \nat Cleveland State University. It will allow schools to provide student \nveterans with a one-stop shop for assistance with financial aid, with \nclass selection, with VA benefits, and with other transitional issues.\n  In addition to the unique challenges many student veterans face, \nothers have their academic career interrupted by deployments. When \nstudents head\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\noff to war, they know they will be given the time and support they need \nnow, because of this legislation, without falling unnecessarily behind \nacademically or financially when they return to their life as a college \nstudent.\n  By allowing servicemembers to defer payments, interest free, on \nFederal student loans while serving on Active Duty, we have removed a \nfinancial penalty for student veterans.\n  I would also like to thank the committee and the chairman for working \nwith me to include several other provisions in the conference report. \nAmong them is a program that creates an early childhood educator \nworkforce development system to ensure that all children are taught by \ngreat teachers in their developmental years. I spoke with the head of \nOhio Head Start today in Dayton, who is very excited about what this \nwill mean for Head Start students in all of Ohio.\n  Also included was a program that helps increase the enrollment rates \nof rural students at institutions of higher education.\n  Finally, provisions are included that will reauthorize the \nUnderground Railroad Educational and Cultural Program and establish a \nPerkins loan forgiveness program for our nation's firefighters. We did \nit for the nurses, teachers, and police officers. We inadvertently left \nout firefighters in the bill last year. This takes care of that.\n  While there are many other issues we must address in higher \neducation, including the rise in private student loans, this bill makes \nimportant progress on assisting needy students, increasing \naffordability for all, and enhancing protections for our servicemembers \nbecause of this legislation, because of Chairman Mikulski's work. It \nmeans a whole lot of working-class kids, a whole lot of poor kids, a \nwhole lot of middle-class kids will be able to go to college. It will \nbe easier for them to finish their college degrees, not drop out with \nhuge student loans. It will enable most of these students to graduate \nwithout the onerous burden of huge student loans.\n  I thank Chairman Kennedy and I thank Ranking Member Enzi for their \nwork. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Oklahoma has up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will assure everyone I will not take 20 \nminutes.\n  First of all, let my thank all of those on the committee who worked \non this bill.\n  The Higher Education Act of 1965, HEA, authorizes the Federal \nGovernment's major Federal student aid programs, as well as other \nprograms which provide institutional aid and support. HEA also \nauthorizes services and support to disadvantaged students, and to \nstudents pursuing international education and certain graduate and \nprofessional degrees. The last time the act was reauthorized was over a \ndecade ago, in 1998.\n  The Senate passed HEA reauthorize on in July of 2007, with a vote of \n95-0. The House of Representatives passed their version February 7, \n2008, with a vote of 354-58. The final conference agreement is the \nproduct of nearly 6 months of work between the House and the Senate.\n  The Higher Education Act conference report, by the numbers, is nearly \n1,200 pages, authorizes for appropriation of roughly $3.7 billion, \ncreates 65 new programs, requires 24 new government studies, and \nrequires the Department of Education to create and publish 26 different \nlists with information from more than 6,463 schools.\n  This bill seeks to address an enormous concern for many American \nfamilies and students who are struggling to afford the cost of a \ncollege education. During the 2006-2007 academic year, more than $130 \nbillion in financial aid was distributed to students in the form of \ngrants, Federal loans, work-study, and tax credits and deductions. \nHowever, this financial aid is hardly keeping pace with the increasing \nrate of tuition.\n  According to the College Board, from 1996 to 2006, tuition rose 51 \npercent at 4-year public colleges and universities, after adjusting for \ninflation. Furthermore, according to the U.S. Department of Education's \nNational Center for Education Statistics, the average rate for \nundergraduate tuition and fees has nearly tripled over the past decade.\n  No one argues that the cost of college is rapidly rising, or that \nCongress, the States and institutions of higher education should \nexamine this issue and work together to increase access and \naffordability for students. However, we must ask ourselves, is this \nbill the right solution? This bill dramatically increase general \nFederal financial aid to students through the following:\n  Increase the Pell Grant maximum from $5,800 to $8,000 at a cost of \npotentially $1.6 billion per year;\n  Permits students to receive Pell Grants year-round at a cost of $2.6 \nbillion over 5 years;\n  Increases the loan fund for Perkins loans at a cost of $1 billion \nover 5 years;\n  Expands deferment for PLUS Loans and accrued interest would reduce \ndirect spending $75 million over 5 years; and\n  Extend Federal loan forgiveness to the following groups--at a cost of \n$10.9 billion over 5 years: Public-sector employees (including Federal \nGovernment employees in Washington DC), nutrition professionals, mental \nhealth professionals, medical specialists, dentists, STEM employees, \nphysical therapists, occupational therapists, superintendents, \nprincipals and other administrators, fire fighters, librarians, early \nchildhood educators, nurses, foreign language specialists, speech \nlanguage pathologists, school counselors, and others.\n  Dramatic increases in Federal student aid may sound like a helpful \nsolution at first. However, research shows that increases in government \nfunding only lead to further increases in tuition. According to a \nreport by the Cato Institute, for every dollar increase in Pell Grants, \nprivate 4-year colleges increased tuition by more than two dollars.\n  The findings of the College Board in ``Trends in Student Aid 2007'' \nare even more astounding. The College Board reported that student aid \nincreased by about 82 percent over the decade from 1997 to 2007, and \nFederal loans increased by 61 percent. Interestingly, this increase in \naid covered about two-thirds of the increase in tuition at private 4-\nyear colleges and almost all of the increase in tuition at public 4-\nyear institutions.\n  These statistics demonstrate that both public and private \nuniversities are increasing tuition at the same pace--if not faster--\nthan the Government increases funding. If we truly wish to make college \neducation more affordable for students and families, we must focus on \nwhy tuition is increasing, despite increased subsidies from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  A July 31 editorial in the Washington Times discusses the correlation \nbetween increased government funding and rising tuition. The editorial \nstates of the higher education conference agreement.\n\n       This bill would do nothing to rein in rampant tuition \n     inflation, by far the biggest problem in higher education. \n     Indeed, by giving students yet more taxpayer-furnished aid, \n     it will just keep exacerbating the problem . . . Just look at \n     the numbers: It's no coincidence that while the inflation-\n     adjusted price of college has gone up roughly 70 percent over \n     the last two decades, aid per-student rose almost 140 \n     percent.\n\n  The best way to make improvements in higher education is to begin \nremoving the Federal Government from the equation. When Congress and \nthe U.S. Department of Education interject themselves into education \nmatters, the result is generally less competition and individual \ncontrol, more bureaucracy and an ultimately an inferior outcome.\n  The American Council on Education states that the higher education \nconference agreement ``would create a huge number of new reporting and \nregulatory requirements . . . Complying with these new unfunded \nmandates will take time and will increase the administrative costs \nfacing colleges and universities.''\n  Rather than increasing the role of the Federal Government in \nsubsidizing and regulating higher education, Congress should create \nincentives for families to save money and ease tax burden for students. \nFederal education tax credits and the Federal tuition tax deductions \ngenerated $5.9 billion in savings for taxpayers in 2006.\n  The Higher Education conference agreement does more than expand \nfinancial aid for students. The bill authorizes 65 new programs, many \nof\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\nwhich are duplicate, wasteful and unnecessary. By authorizing \nappropriations for these programs, Congress is allowing them to take \nfunding away from student aid. Consider the following examples of \nmisplaced priorities in the bill:\n  Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna Memorial Archives: Provides a grant to \nthe University of Hawaii Academy for Creative Media for the \nestablishment and maintenance of memorial archives--such sums as \nnecessary;\n  Campus-Based Digital Theft Prevention: Provides grants for schools to \ndevelop programs to prevent illegal downloading and distribution of \nmusic, movies and other intellectual property--such sums as necessary;\n  Pilot Program for Course Material Rental: Provides grants for college \nbookstores to operate textbook rental programs--such sums as necessary;\n  Off-Campus Community Service: Authorizes work study grants to \ninstitutions for recruiting and compensating students to supplement off \ncampus community service employment--such sums as necessary;\n  University Sustainability Programs: Provides grants to establish \nsustainability programs and practices on campus. The term \n``sustainability'' is not defined in the bill--such sums as necessary;\n  Modeling and Simulation Programs: Establishes a task force to study \nmodeling and simulation and to support the development of the model and \nsimulation field--such sums as necessary; and\n  Teach for America: Authorizes a 5-year grant to Teach for America, \nInc. for $20 million in FY 2009, $25 million for FY 2010 and such sums \nfor each of the four succeeding fiscal years.\n  It is important to note that if a Federal audit of Teach for America \nrecently found that the organization did not properly account for \n$775,000 in Federal funds. The Department of Education Inspector \nGeneral found that Teach for America was unable to provide documents to \nsupport roughly half its claimed spending. The New York Times reported \nthat there was no documentation that any teachers actually attended and \ncompleted the class or that there even was a class. Rather than \ncleaning up the waste, Congress authorizes $45 million for the \norganization.\n  According to a July 11 CBS Evening News report titled, ``Teach for \nAmerica Gets Schooled; Organization That Trains Teachers Gets a Failing \nGrade for Its Accounting Skills,'' after the audit, Teach for America \ntried handing over some newly-found documents, but it didn't help. The \nInspector General said they contained ``significant discrepancies.''\n  Another important way to help contain the skyrocketing costs of \neducation is to simply ensure taxpayers' dollars and students' tuition \nare directed towards educational purposes, and not lobbying or \nearmarks. We cannot continue to earmark millions of dollars to \nuniversities with billion dollar endowments, while students and \nfamilies struggle to afford the cost of college.\n  The total cost of earmarks for colleges and universities exceeded $9 \nbillion between 1995 and 2003. At the same time, average annual tuition \nat public 4-year institutions increased by 137 percent, from $2,357 to \n$5,836. The Chronicle of Higher Education recently reported that \nCongress set aside a record $2.3 billion in pet projects for colleges \nand universities last year, $300 million more than in 2003, when the \ntotal was $2.01 billion.\n  Furthermore, in 2005 and 2006, colleges and universities spent more \nthan $127 million on lobbying activities. This amount could have paid \nthe full tuition for more than 21,760 students to attend public \ncolleges and universities. Most students struggling to pay for housing \nand tuition may not be able to afford a tutor, much less a lobbyist. \nThey should not, therefore, be forced to pay higher tuition so their \nschool can hire Washington lobbyists.\n  Nobody who listened to Senator Alexander can come away saying we have \nnot done what we need to do. And this is certainly a compromise piece \nof legislation.\n  But it is very worrisome to me that the only thing rising faster than \nthe cost of health care in this country, other than gasoline in the \nlast year and a half, is the cost of a college education. The only way \nwe can compete globally is with an educated workforce. We have to ask \nourselves the question, Why is it costing so much? Could it be the 10-\nfoot tall--now with the passage of this bill--group of regulations that \nrequire billions of dollars to comply with every year that has taken \naway from the educational opportunities in this country?\n  I think another thing that was not addressed in the bill that should \nhave been added in the bill is the fact that we have had over $9 \nbillion worth of earmarks in the higher ed bill over the last 7 years. \nThat is $9 billion that did not get prioritized. It was put in in the \ndark of night, inside a bill, inside an appropriations bill, that did \nnot go out on the basis of merit, did not go out on the basis of a \ncompetitive grant.\n  And when the American people hear that $127 million was spent last \nyear by colleges and universities to lobby this place, is it not any \nwonder that we are spending $9 billion on earmarks?\n  I also want to spend a moment talking about realtime writers. I held \nthat bill; am still in opposition to it. I know it is in the bill. That \nis the way things work around here. I am going to lose that. But I want \nyou to ask yourself the question: If there is greater demand for \nrealtime writers and we are seeing the salaries rise and we are seeing \nthe numbers start to come in, why in the world are we going to create a \nprogram to pay for it when the market is going to create the demand and \nthe pay to get people to do it? We are going to blow that money because \nthose people are going to go do that because the amount of money that \nis being paid for someone to do that is rising. So we are going to get \nin the middle of the economics of that. We are going to create a false \nlevel of it because we are going to train them. Now, do you know what \nis going to happen? Everyone who is a realtime writer now is going to \nmake less money in the future.\n  So we are going to disown the economics of supply and demand, much \nlike we are doing on energy, and we are going to put a grant program \nin, we are going to make sure these people are there, but everyone who \nis doing it now is going to make less money, and then we are going to \nhave an overage. And so then what is going to happen is the people who \nwent out and did it on their own and invested in it, they are going to \ngo look for another job because we did not trust what has made this \ncountry great, which is the idea that if there is a demand, someone is \ngoing to fill the supply, and if they do not, the price is going to \nrise. So we have put that in this bill.\n  It will be a part of the bill. It is going to become law. But we are \ngoing to waste that money. It is shortsighted. It is wasteful. This \nbill creates 65 new Federal Government programs. Thirty-six reports are \ndemanded from this bill, and it gets rid of six programs. Of the \nprograms we create, nary a one has a metric on it so we can measure it \n2 years from now to know whether what we did was right or wrong. In \nOklahoma we call that peeing into the wind. It is going to come back on \nus.\n  As to the cost of a college education, we are seeing families \nsqueezed by $2,400 a year in energy costs because we didn't act when we \nshould have acted on energy, and we are not acting now. So they have \nless resources. Even with the wonderful increase in Pell grants and \neverything that we have done in this bill, the cost of a college \neducation is going to rise about 9 percent a year. They can't keep up \nno matter what we do with Pell grants.\n  The better part of wisdom would be to ask the question: Is what we \nare doing really making a difference to increase the availability of a \n4-year education or a 2-year education post high school?\n  The maintenance of effort in this bill will kill every community \ncollege in Oklahoma because they design programs for certain things and \nthen walk away from them because there is not a demand for them \nanymore, whether it be for a new business, a new industry, or a new \narea where there is a shortage, and then they walk away. Now they have \na maintenance of effort requirement. There is no exemption on that. You \nhave killed one of the best things we have in Oklahoma, which is our \ncommunity colleges. You are going to strangle them with this \nmaintenance of effort. Now they will be very hesitant to create a new \nprogram that\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nwill make a big difference in the lives of Oklahomans, even though they \nwill only run the program for 2 years because they will have to \ncontinue to fund it to be able to get anything else from us. It is \nshortsighted.\n  I will not go on. I know everybody who worked on this bill is well \nintentioned. Their heart is in the right place. They want us to have \nbetter educational opportunities. They want us to be able to afford it. \nThey want greater excellence in terms of academia. I just don't think \nwe did it. If we didn't do it, we are not going to be able to measure \nbecause we don't have any metrics.\n  The hope would be that maybe we could learn from this exercise. Maybe \nwe ought to put in metrics. If we are going to create 65 programs, \nmaybe we ought to think about getting rid of 65 instead of 6, and maybe \nwe ought to measure the effect of what we are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. PRESIDENT, I am pleased to support passage of the \nconference report reauthorizing the Higher Education Act of 1965. This \nlaw is the main Federal law governing higher education in this country \nand authorizes a number of important federal programs including Pell \ngrants and other need-based grant programs as well as Federal student \nloan programs. This conference report, the Higher Education Opportunity \nAct, will improve college access and affordability for our nation's \nstudents in a number of ways including, raising the authorized level of \nPell grants, allowing Pell grants to be awarded on a year-round basis, \nand simplifying the financial aid application process. Congress has \nbeen working on revisions to the Higher Education Act for many years \nand it is welcome news that Congress has finally completed its work on \nthis important, if imperfect, legislation.\n  Access to postsecondary education is becoming more and more important \nin this increasingly competitive 21st century. In Wisconsin and around \nthe country, we continue to see a significant gap in which students can \nafford to obtain a higher education and which students cannot, with \nstudents from low income and middle class families increasingly unable \nto attend college due to escalating costs and less availability of \nfinancial aid. Furthermore, students increasingly have to turn to \nfederal and private student loans to cover the costs of a higher \neducation because of declining grant aid. Some of these students are \nthen saddled with heavy debts upon graduation from college, which \nimpact what sort of career decisions and life choices they can make for \nthemselves.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have made increasing funding \nfor the federal Pell grant program one of my top higher education \npriorities. I have worked with Senators Kennedy, Collins, and Coleman \nto lead efforts to increase funding for the Pell grant program as part \nof the yearly budget and appropriations process. I am pleased that the \n110th Congress has taken some important steps to boost the availability \nof Pell grants for our Nation's students. Soon after the 110th Congress \nconvened in January of 2007, we passed a continuing resolution funding \nthe government for fiscal year 2007. As part of that continuing \nresolution, we increased the maximum award for the Pell grant for the \nfirst time since 2003, from $4,050 to $4,310.\n  As part of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act which was signed \ninto law last September and the fiscal year 2008 omnibus appropriations \nbill, Congress further increased the maximum Pell grant award from \n$4,310 to $4,731. These recent increases in the maximum Pell grant \naward represent a good step to improved access to higher education for \nour Nation's students most in need, but much more remains to be done. \nThis conference report builds on these efforts to boost the Pell grant \nprogram, by increasing the authorized levels for the maximum Pell grant \naward to $8,000 by 2014 and by allowing students to use their Pell \ngrant awards year round. I will continue to work to help ensure that \nCongress appropriates funds for the Pell program consistent with these \nnew authorized levels.\n\n  This conference report also reauthorizes another critical need-based \ngrant program, the federal TRIO programs, which include Upward Bound, \nStudent Support Services, Ronald McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement, \nand Talent Search programs, among others. Every year, students who have \nparticipated in TRIO programs at Wisconsin's universities come out to \nWashington to meet with myself or my staff to discuss how the various \nTRIO programs are improving access to higher education and providing \nsupport services once these students have enrolled in college. These \nstudents' testimonials illustrate how important the TRIO programs are, \nand have guided my yearly efforts to work to boost Federal funding for \nthe TRIO programs. I am pleased that this conference report also \nincludes language based on previous legislation I introduced that \ndefines the terms ``different campus'' and ``different population'' for \npurposes of administering the federal TRIO program. The language \nincluded in this bill ensures that higher education institutions with \nbranch campuses geographically apart from each other, like some of the \ncampuses in the UW System, can compete on an equal footing for these \nimportant TRIO grants.\n  This conference report also includes language to modify the \napplication progress for Federal financial aid in order to make it \nsimpler for students and parents to complete the process. I often hear \nfrom students and parents in Wisconsin that applying for financial aid \nis a time consuming and confusing process and this legislation should \nhelp to simplify the process for Wisconsin's families. This legislation \nestablishes a two-page FAFSA application for certain low-income \nstudents and broadens the use of this simplified FAFSA to other \nstudents within the next few years. This legislation also improves the \nprocess whereby students can reapply for financial aid so that they do \nnot have to fill out a new FAFSA every time they want to apply for \nadditional financial aid. Many of Wisconsin's students fill out these \nFAFSA forms every year and I hope that the new provisions in this \nconference report can make the FAFSA application process less \nburdensome in the coming months and years.\n  This conference report also retains language from the Senate-passed \nbill to ensure that the grants for training of teachers will promote a \nwide range of teaching skills, including measuring students on \ndifferent forms of assessment, such as performance-based measures, \nstudent portfolios, and formative assessments. In an era of increased \naccountability at the local, State, and Federal level, we need to do \nall we can to promote more responsible and accurate assessment of \nstudents in our K-12 schools.\n\n  I remain concerned about the increased use of high-stakes \nstandardized testing at the K-12 level, including using high-stakes \nstandardized tests to make decisions regarding school accountability. \nBy broadening the definition of student learning and teaching skills as \nthis new title II language does, we can better ensure that teachers are \ntrained to more accurately and responsibly measure student achievement \nthrough alternatives to high-stakes standardized testing. I hope that \nCongress can build on these efforts to promote better and more \nresponsible assessments of our Nation's students when we reauthorize \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act by providing increased \nfunding for the development of these types of assessments as well as \nthe teacher training that is needed to implement these assessments in \nour classrooms.\n  The student loan industry has also seen some tumultuous times over \nthe past 2 years, with a number of abuses involving lenders and some \nfinancial aid administrators brought to light as well as ongoing unrest \nin the lending business due to the current instability in our credit \nmarkets. While we should do all we can to boost Federal funding for \ngrant aid so that students are not as dependent on student loans to \nfinance their higher education, we also need to make certain that our \nNation's students have access to Federal student loans to help cover \nany unmet costs they face. Wherever possible, we should help students \nparticipate in the various Federal student loan programs before making \nthem turn to private loans, which do not offer our students as many \nsafeguards as the Federal student loan programs. Earlier this year, \nCongress passed a law designed to help\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nensure students' continued access to Federal loans in the upcoming \nschool year and this conference report seeks to help prevent certain \nabuses in the student loan markets from happening in the future. For \nexample, this conference report requires schools and lenders to create \ncodes of conduct governing their lending practices and relationships. \nThis legislation also bans lenders and colleges from accepting gifts as \npart of their student loan business. I cosponsored many of these \nprovisions in Senator Kennedy's standalone legislation, the Student \nLoan Sunshine Act, and I am pleased that these provisions were included \nin this conference report.\n  I know a number of colleges are concerned about the increased \nreporting requirements in this legislation related to college costs and \ntuition increases. These reporting requirements and the provisions \ncreating searchable college cost lists and Web sites are designed to \nimprove access to information for students and their families. This \nsort of information is important to Wisconsin families deciding which \ncolleges they can afford. I hope that these provisions can be \nimplemented in a reasonable way that addresses the concerns of our \nNation's universities while ensuring that students and their families \nhave access to this valuable information.\n  This legislation has broad bipartisan support and it is good news \nthat we were finally able to reach agreement on this reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act. The conference report Congress is set to pass \nthis week strengthens a number of existing Federal student aid programs \nand creates new programs to boost access to and affordability of higher \neducation for America's students who wish to attend college. With the \nnew school year set to begin in about a month, I hope that the \nPresident will quickly sign this legislation into law and that the \nDepartment of Education will work to implement this legislation in a \nfair and responsible manner.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a topic that \nhas been important to me for some time the role of veterinarians in \nsafeguarding the public health. Yesterday, the Senate passed the \nHigher-Ed bill which contained historic language improving veterinary \neducation in this country. This language has important implications for \nhuman health. We have been overdue to invest in veterinary medicine as \na national asset. Today, there are only 28 colleges of veterinary \nmedicine across the Nation which collectively graduate a mere 2,500 \nveterinarians per year.\n  Unfortunately, this number is insufficient to meet demand and leaves \nour Nation vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases such as west nile \nvirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, Monkeypox and Avian \nInfluenza although there are numerous other examples of animal-born \ninfectious diseases, some of which could be used as biological agents \nin a terrorist attack.\n  To meet the critical shortage of public health veterinarians and to \naugment the ability of veterinary expertise to guide public health, I \nintroduced the Veterinary Workforce Expansion Act, S. 746, this \nCongress and the two previous Congresses. I am pleased that part of the \nVeterinary Workforce Expansion Act made it into the higher-ed \nreauthorization.\n  The language in the higher-ed bill will establish a new competitive \ngrant program for capital improvements to allow veterinary medical \ncolleges to expand and graduate more veterinarians trained in public \nhealth. As both a veterinarian and a member of the HELP Committee, I \nhave seen first-hand the links between human and animal health. A half-\ncentury ago, more people appreciated this too and we were able to all-\nbut eradicate malaria and other animal-born infectious diseases with \ntechniques such as mosquito control and inoculations.\n  Veterinarians are uniquely qualified to address high-priority public \nhealth issues such as animal-to-human transmission of infectious \ndiseases because the curriculum in veterinary medical colleges is \nsignificantly different from that of other health professions. In \naddition to the basic biomedical sciences and the surgical and medical \ntraining that physicians receive, veterinarians receive extensive \ntraining in population medicine. Veterinary colleges also provide a \nbroad, multispecies, comparative medical approach to disease prevention \nand control, which is fundamental to understanding the transmission and \nlife cycle of infectious disease agents, especially those that animals \nshare with humans.\n  Although I hope awareness of the part veterinarians play in promoting \npublic health will improve, I want to note that I am by no means the \nfirst Government official to recognize the importance of veterinarians \nin public health practice. Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, noted that, ``Eleven \nof the last 12 emerging infectious diseases that we're aware of in the \nworld have probably arisen from animal health sources.'' CDC estimates \nthat more than 60 percent of all infectious organisms that are harmful \nto people are transmissible between humans and animals. In addition, \nmore than more than 75 percent of newly emerging infectious diseases \nfitj into this category and, even more important, more than 80 percent \nof biothreat agents of concern are shared between animals and man. \nThese are the harmful biothreat agents most likely to be used in a \nbioterrorism attack.\n  So in closing, I would like to thank Senators Kennedy, Enzi, \nMikulski, and Burr for working with me to include this program in the \nbill. I am grateful for their hard work and support. My hope is that \nthrough this new grant program, veterinary colleges will be able to \nfulfill the needs of the communities that they serve and on a national \nlevel will augment the expertise of other public health specialists in \npreventing or mitigating the effects of possible pandemics or \nbiological terrorist attacks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the \nreauthorization of the Tribally Controlled College or University \nAssistance Act of 1978, which is included in H.R. 4137, the Higher \nEducation Reauthorization and College Opportunity Act of 2008.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I worked \nclosely with the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and \nthe House of Representatives to ensure that provisions enhancing tribal \ncolleges and universities were included in the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Opportunity Act.\n  H.R. 4137 reauthorizes the Tribally Controlled College or University \nAssistance Act of 1978. Additionally, it will authorize two tribally \ncontrolled postsecondary career and vocational technical institutions: \nUnited Tribes Technical College and Navajo Technical College. Both of \nthese institutions are critical to strengthening tribal higher \neducation and providing the necessary resources for Indian students.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of tribal colleges and universities \nbecause of the benefits they provide to both the community and the \nindividual student. There are 36 tribal colleges and universities \nthroughout the United States. I am very fortunate to have 5 of these \ntribal colleges in my State of North Dakota.\n  Tribal colleges and universities offer a wide range of accredited \nprograms from business administration to nursing. In addition to \ncollege-level courses, tribal colleges and universities also offer high \nschool completion programs, job training, and college- preparatory \ncourses.\n  These colleges and universities are essential to their communities, \noften serving as community centers, libraries, tribal archives, career \nand business centers, economic development centers, public meeting \nplaces and childcare centers.\n  Because most tribal colleges and universities are located on or near \nIndian reservations, they provide a greater level of access to higher \neducation for a group of Native students who would otherwise be unable \nto attend college.\n  Approximately 28,000 American Indian and Alaska Native students \nattend tribally-controlled colleges and universities across the \ncountry. Characteristics of American Indian students enrolled in tribal \ncolleges differ from those of most other undergraduate students: \nStudents attending these schools often come from geographically \nisolated communities with high unemployment rates where the average \nfamily income is $13,998.00. This is 27 percent below the Federal \npoverty level. Most students attending tribal\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\ncolleges are the first generation in their family to go to college. \nAmerican Indians who earn a bachelor's degree or higher can expect to \nearn two times as much as those with a high school diploma and four \ntimes as much as those with no high school diploma.\n  I am committed to finding ways to strengthen tribal colleges because \nthey are truly a success story in Indian country. The reauthorization \nof the Tribally Controlled Colleges or University Assistance Act is a \nstrong step in that direction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, access to higher education is increasingly \nimportant in a competitive, global economy where training beyond a high \nschool education is frequently required. On average, a student who \nearns a bachelor's degree will earn 70 percent more annually than a \nstudent who has only a high school diploma.\n  Last year, Congress approved more than $17 billion in new Federal aid \nfor college students, the largest Federal investment since the GI bill \nwith the enactment of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. This was \na great victory for students and families all across America, including \nmy home State. Michigan will receive over $80 million in new assistance \nabove the current $429.8 million for the upcoming academic year and an \nadditional $689.6 million over the next 5 years.\n  However, we still need to do more to help students achieve their goal \nof attaining a college education as college cost continues to rise. The \nlegislation before us, the conference report of the Higher Education \nOpportunity Act of 2008, is another major step forward to support \nstudents and families in this endeavor. It contains several important \npolicy changes to increase access to college and help protect students, \nfamilies and taxpayers from high college cost and unmanageable debt.\n  It expands need-based grant aid further by increasing Pell grants, \nfrom $4,800 to $6,000 for 2009 and to $8,000 for 2014; and allows \nstudents, for the first time, to receive Pell grants year-round, to \nhelp them accelerate the completion of their degrees. The legislation \nalso creates the Grants for Access and Persistence, GAP, program, a new \nmatching grant program to allow States to increase need-based grant aid \nto students. This will give a major boost to the 5.3 million students \nwho qualify for the Pell grant, 182,000 in Michigan.\n  The bill enhances and strengthens TRIO and GEAR UP, proven programs \nthat help students, many of whom are first generation college-bound, \nprepare for and succeed in higher education. It expands required \nactivities with a special focus on improving students' financial and \neconomic literacy, and encourages student enrollment in challenging \nsecondary coursework and professional development.\n  The legislation also replaces the complex, 7-page Free Application \nfor Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, with a 2-page EZ-FAFSA; bans lenders \nfrom offering gifts to college officials as a condition of making \nstudent loans, and requires colleges to adopt a code of conduct \nregarding student loans; promotes innovative and effective teacher \npreparation programs for new and prospective teachers; and creates a \npipeline for high-quality teachers to teach in high-need schools by \npromoting partnerships between teacher education programs and high-need \ndistricts.\n  The bill also makes college a reality for more students with \ndisabilities through a number of new initiatives, including supporting \nmodel demonstration projects to make college course materials more \naccessible; and expands and strengthens nursing faculty by creating a \nnew grant program to help nursing schools enroll more students.\n  Finally, this legislation also includes a much-needed amendment \nintroduced by Senator Durbin, which I cosponsored, that creates a \ntargeted student loan repayment assistance program that will bolster \nthe ranks of attorneys in this country's criminal justice system. It \nwill provide up to $10,000 a year in student loan forgiveness for those \nwho will work a minimum of 3 years as State or local criminal \nprosecutors or as State, local, or Federal public defenders. This would \nbenefit many young law graduates who want to take a job as a young \nprosecutor or public defender, but find it difficult to do so because \nof a mountain of student debt. The need for this amendment is apparent. \nProsecutor and public defender offices throughout the country are \nhaving serious difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified \nattorneys. In a recent survey, over a third of prosecutor offices \nnationwide reported problems with keeping attorneys on staff. Over 60 \npercent of prosecutor offices that serve populations of 250,000 or more \nhave reported serious problems with the retention of attorneys. The \nstory is the same for public defender offices. Another recent survey \nfound that over 60 percent of State and local public defender offices \nreported difficulty in attorney recruitment and retention. When \nprosecutor and defender offices cannot attract new lawyers or keep \nexperienced ones, their ability to protect the public is compromised. \nCaseloads become unmanageable, cases can be delayed or mishandled, \ncrimes may go unprosecuted, and innocent defendants may sit in jail.\n  A student's access to higher education ought not to depend on his or \nher family's income. Working families and aspiring students across this \ncountry are struggling to obtain the financial resources to secure a \ncollege education. Low and middle income students who have managed to \nenter and stay in college are graduating with unprecedented levels of \ndebt. This legislation, coupled with the legislation Congress passed \nlast year responds to this crisis.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Higher \nEducation Opportunity Act of 2008 that would renew major programs that \nensure our Nation's students have access to a college education.\n  This important legislation would increase grant aid to our neediest \nstudents, provide new measures to address rising college costs, and \nwould reform the student loan system so that it better serves students.\n  Students and their families in California and nationwide are \nstruggling to pay the growing costs of a college education.\n  Specifically, this bill will increase Pell grants from $4,800 to \n$6,000 for 2009 and to $8,000 for 2014. Over 625,000 California \nstudents rely on Pell grants to afford college.\n  It will allow low-income students, for the first time, to receive \nPell grants year round, including summer school. This will help \nstudents complete their degree programs more quickly.\n  It will allow military servicemembers to defer payments, interest \nfree, on Federal direct loans while they are on active duty. Our \nservice men and women risk their lives for our Nation and deserve to \nnot have to worry about paying their student loans while they are on \nduty.\n  It will authorize the U.S. Department of Education to award \ncompetitive grants for Teacher Preparation Programs that help recruit \nand retain high-quality teachers in high-need schools.\n  It will require the U.S. Department of Education to publish detailed \ndata about college pricing trends on its website to ensure more \ntransparency.\n  It will simplify student financial aid forms by creating a new 2-page \nform for low-income students, and phase out the current 7-page form \nwithin 5 years.\n  It is critical that we help make college more affordable and \naccessible for students at a time when they are taking on more debt to \npay for school.\n  More than half of California students who graduate from 4-year public \ncolleges have debt averaging over $12,000.\n  Nearly 1 year ago, the President signed into law major legislation \nthat provides over $17 billion in new grant aid to low-income college \nstudents--$2.5 billion of which would go to help California's students. \nAnd the key reforms in the renewal of this Higher Education legislation \nbefore us today will further help ensure that college is more \naffordable for our young people and that they receive the education \nthey deserve to succeed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, education is at the core of America's basic \npromise--that all Americans should be able to make the most of their \npotential.\n  Every young person should graduate from high school, and every young \nperson who works hard and wants to go to college should be able to \nafford it. And all Americans should be able to get the skills they need \nto succeed throughout their lives.\n  Today, I am supporting the Higher Education Opportunity Act \nconference report because it will advance key reforms that will address \nthe soaring\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\nprice of a college education and remove obstacles that make it harder \nfor qualified students to attend college. This legislation is an \nimportant step forward for students and their families. It will help \nreduce their college costs and will help expand the future growth of \nour economy.\n  This legislation would not have been possible without the leadership \nof Senator Edward M. Kennedy who has tirelessly dedicated his time in \nthe Senate to helping children and their families gain increased access \nto education. It is another victory for Senator Kennedy, whose record \nof achievement in the Senate has helped benefit the lives of virtually \nevery man, woman and child in the country. As we adopt this \nlegislation, I want Senator Kennedy to know that we miss him, that we \nare thinking of him as he recovers from his illness and we congratulate \nhim on this important accomplishment.\n  The Higher Education Opportunity Act will hold colleges more \naccountable for increasing costs and will simplify the federal \nfinancial aid application process. The legislation will make textbook \ncosts more manageable for students by helping them plan for textbook \nexpenses in advance of each semester. It will increase college aid and \nsupport programs for veterans and military families. This legislation \nwill ensure equal college opportunities and fair learning environments \nfor students with disabilities. It includes new measures to curb \nunethical practices in the student loan industry, increasing federal \ngrant aid to our neediest students, and strengthen college pipeline \nprograms.\n  The Higher Education Reauthorization Act will help ensure that all \nAmericans can make the most of their God-given talents. Educating our \nchildren is a key part of ensuring a strong economy in the future. It \nwill help make college affordable for all and expand lifelong learning. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wanted to affirm my support of the \nHigher Education Act, which will help many young Americans realize \ntheir dream of a college education.\n  As president of West Virginia Wesleyan years ago, I saw firsthand \nthat given the opportunity, student will perform to the highest degree. \nOur goal as legislators should be to provide quality, affordable \neducation for every American. While we have done a good job giving high \nschool students the opportunity to attend higher education, the time \nhas come to do more to make it affordable.\n  Tuition rates have steadily increased over the last few years while \nour Nation's financial aid programs have failed to keep up, causing \ncollege students to graduate with higher amounts of debt than ever \nbefore. In West Virginia alone, the cost of college education has \nincreased at least 30 percent since the 2000-2001 school year, while \nthe median family income of most West Virginians has increased only 13 \npercent. Additionally, the percentage of higher education that is paid \nfor with grants has decreased significantly, from 77 percent in 1975-\n1976 to just 20 percent in 2004-2005.\n  The Higher Education Act before us today will modernize the financial \naid system. The act will revitalize title IV loans, including Pell \ngrants. Pell grants help over 35,000 West Virginia students attend \ncollege, a value of $92 million annually. An increase in assistance is \nneeded to help students cope with the rising cost of tuition. The bill \nwill invest $20 billion to improve Pell grants. The loan amount will \nincrease approximately $500 next year, and in 2012, the maximum Pell \ngrant should be $5,400. These improvements will allow more low-income \nstudents to have the opportunity to pursue higher education that before \nwould have been out of their reach.\n  An important provision in the act will protect students by giving \nthem greater access to information about their loans by requiring \nstudent loan providers to be up front about terms and rates. This new \nlaw will reduce interest rates on Federal student loans, allowing \nstudents to graduate college with less debt and on a stable financial \nfoundation. The law even addresses the real concern about the rising \ncosts of textbooks with balanced provisions to disclose prices.\n  The act would also increase TRIO funding and provide better tools to \nencourage high school students to apply for college. Every year, I meet \nwith TRIO leaders and students from across the state of West Virginia \nabout the importance of this program. The Higher Education \nReauthorization Act allows our dedicated TRIO counselors to focus on \ntutoring, college exam preparation, and assisting students with \napplication and financial aid applications. West Virginia has 30 TRIO \nprograms which will benefit by the increase in the grant duration and \nfunding. This increased support, will better enable the 8,000 plus West \nVirginian TRIO students to reach their potential in high school, and \nachieve their goal of pursuing higher education.\n  Another vital part of this legislation is the emphasis it places on \nsciences and mathematics. The greater assistance and grant money going \nto students who study science and mathematics, will ensure that our \nNation has a group of educated individuals who are ready to handle \nfuture challenges.\n  To support our troops and their families, this legislation allows \nservice members to defer payments on loans, and stop interest on \nFederal direct loans while they are on active duty. It will ensure that \nmilitary benefits do not count against service members' eligibility for \nFederal grants and loans they need to pay for college. It will provide \nfor easy reenrollment for service members when they return from duty \nand go back to school.\n  The Higher Education Reauthorization Act will provide opportunity to \nstudents in West Virginia and throughout the country. This bill also \nencourages public service and puts a new emphasis on science and math, \ncauses that I have long promoted. This is an important bill and I \ncommend my colleagues and the leadership for forging bipartisan \nconsensus to enact this legislation that should inspire students to \npursue their dreams of a higher education.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, I was pleased to vote in favor of \nthe conference report to accompany the College Opportunity and \nAffordability Act, H.R. 4137. I congratulate my colleagues, \nparticularly my good friend, Senator Kennedy, for their dedication and \nbipartisan efforts in moving this vitally important legislation \nforward. It is imperative during these difficult economic times, to do \nall that we can to help students achieve their educational goals by \nmaking college more accessible and more affordable. This legislation \nwill assist students and their families in Hawaii and across the Nation \nby, among other things, simplifying the Federal financial aid \napplication process, increasing the amount of Federal grants to \nstudents and their families who need them most, providing more \nauthority to regulate private student loan lenders engaged in predatory \npractices, and holding colleges accountable for growing tuition rates.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a senior member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I was also pleased to support this \nlegislation which will make higher education more accessible for the \nmen and women who have volunteered to protect and defend our Nation. It \nincludes a provision allowing the members of our Armed Forces to defer \ntheir payments, interest free, on Federal Direct Loans while they are \non Active Duty and making reenrollment easier for service members who \nleft college to join the military. It also benefits the families of our \nsoldiers and sailors who have also sacrificed so much. First, by \nproviding new scholarships for the children and family members of \nservice members who have died since 9/11. And, second, by providing \ninstate tuition for members of the military and their dependents who \nhave lived in a state for more than 30 days.\n  This legislation also incorporates several provisions which will \nspecifically benefit students in Hawaii. These include the \nauthorization of the creation of the Henry Kuualoha Giugni Kupuna \nMemorial Archives at the University of Hawaii as a repository for \nNative Hawaiian historical artifacts and the expansion of authorized \ngrant programs for Native Hawaiian Institutions to include education \ndesigned to improve financial literacy. It also clarifies that Native \nHawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are eligible for the Federally \nfunded McNair Scholars Program. In addition, it benefits our State by \nauthorizing the development\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nand expansion of programs to improve science, technology, and \nmathematics education specifically focused on meeting the educational \nand cultural needs of Native Hawaiian students.\n  Today, more than ever, a college education has become a key to future \nopportunities and financial stability. A student who desires to attend \ncollege should not have to delay or give up their dreams of a higher \neducation because of the cost.\n  With the passage of this bill today, we are helping students achieve \nthis dream and I applaud its passage. Now, it is time for the President \nto sign this critically important bill into law and make it a reality.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last year, as Democrats took control of the \nCongress, we made college affordability and access one of our top \npriorities.\n  In the fall, we completed work on the first part of that promise--the \nCollege Cost Reduction and Access Act. This landmark legislation \nprovided nearly $20 billion in new student aid and benefits, including \na significant increase to the Pell grant and a reduction in student \nloan interest rates, which went into effect last month, providing a \ntangible benefit to college students across this country.\n  It's been a full decade since the Congress last reauthorized the \nHigher Education Act. Today, as a result of a strong bipartisan effort, \nwe take up the final piece of our commitment to make a college \neducation more affordable and accessible.\n  Among other key provisions, this conference report addresses the \nscandals that have tainted the student loan industry. Through increased \ndisclosure requirements, a prohibition on payments and gifts from \nlenders to colleges and financial aid administrators, and new \nrestrictions on preferred lender lists, we are finally putting an end \nto these unacceptable practices, and making sure that the student loan \nsystem works in the best interests of our students.\n  Just as importantly, the Higher Education Opportunity Act tackles the \nrising costs of college. Despite the billions in new student aid and \nbenefits we approved last year, if college costs continue to rise at \nthe rate they have been--nearly tripling over the past 20 years--higher \neducation will continue to remain further and further out of reach for \ntoo many Americans.\n  I am pleased that students in Nevada have the good fortune of a state \nuniversity system with some of the lowest tuition costs in the nation. \nBut the same is not true everywhere and this bill will hold colleges \nand universities accountable if their costs increase too dramatically. \nIt also ensures that students and parents have the information they \nneed to make objective decisions based on the cost of college, and \nattempts to rein in the high cost of textbooks, by requiring greater \ndisclosure of prices and purchasing information.\n  On the issue of costs, the Federal Government has raised the bar in \nits commitment to higher education. While statehouse budgets are \nundoubtedly strained in these difficult economic times, I am hopeful \nthat these efforts will not result in a reduced State commitment to \nmaking sure that a college education is affordable. I am concerned, \nalong with students and college administrators in my own State, about \nharmful budget cuts to colleges and universities in Nevada. The Federal \nGovernment is doing its part for students, and I hope State governments \nwill continue to do the same.\n  To further assist students, the bill authorizes an increase in the \nmaximum Pell grant to $6,000 in 2009 and $8,000 by 2014, and makes it \navailable to college students year-round, instead of just during the \ntraditional academic year. This is particularly important for low-\nincome, nontraditional students in Nevada--those juggling college, jobs \nand a family--or for those students at community colleges taking summer \ncourses so they can finish their degrees.\n  Additionally, to help low-income and first generation students, this \nlegislation strengthens the GEAR UP and TRIO programs, programs which \nhave helped thousands of young Nevadans achieve their dream of a \ncollege degree.\n  A final point I want to highlight is the simplification of the \nfederal financial aid form--the FAFSA. Currently seven pages long and \nprobably more complicated than filling out a tax return, the bill \ncreates a two-page ``EZFAFSA'' for low-income kids, and phases out the \ncurrent form within five years. This will help get federal aid to the \nstudents that need it most.\n  While Senator Kennedy and Enzi, and the entire HELP Committee deserve \nenormous credit for their work to move this legislation forward in a \nbipartisan way, I also want to thank my friend from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, who stepped into some very big shoes with Senator Kennedy's \nabsence, to help get this bill across the finish line.\n  Combined with our efforts last year, passage of the Higher Education \nOpportunity Act reaffirms our commitment to making sure higher \neducation is affordable and accessible for students across America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the Senator from Illinois 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland. What a great job she \ndid pinch hitting for our friend Ted Kennedy, with Senator Enzi, \nbringing this bill to the floor tonight and the conference report. \nThere are three or four provisions in here I worked hard to include, \nand I think they are going to help provide an affordable college \neducation.\n  You would be surprised to know that about one-fourth of the expense \nthat college students face when they go to college is for textbooks. \nTextbooks cost twice as much as ordinary books. Until we put this \nprovision in, students couldn't go on Amazon and other places to find \ndiscounts. Now they will be able to. They will have the information so \nthey can search for the most affordable books. We make the publisher \nsplit up the books into pocket parts and CDs so they don't bundle them \ntogether, and students can buy only what they really need.\n  Secondly, I have been working for years with my friends who are \nprosecutors and public defenders. Kids graduating from law school today \nhave a mountain of debt. They can't afford, usually, to take a job as a \nyoung prosecutor or public defender. We have a student loan forgiveness \nprogram in here. It went through the Judiciary Committee, now through \nthe HELP Committee. It will provide up to $10,000 a year in student \nloan forgiveness for those who will work a minimum of 3 years. That is \nthe way to build the professionals we need as both prosecutors and \ndefenders. It is the John R. Justice Act. It is one that will help our \nNation and help the enforcement of law all across the country.\n  I also have a provision to help campuses deal with insecurity and \nterrorism. We have seen too many instances of violence on campus. This \nwill provide for coordination on campuses to develop plans to keep \ntheir students safe. That is something every parent wants to feel when \nthey leave their kids at school.\n  These are all steps in the right direction. I thank all those who \nworked on this bill. Most of us in the Senate would say flat-out we \nwouldn't be here today were it not for higher education. It has become \na more difficult challenge for today's students. This bill is going to \ngive those students a helping hand. I will be happy to cast my vote in \nfavor of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, who \nalso chairs the Banking Committee. On behalf of all of us who worked on \nthis bill, I thank Senator Dodd for helping us resolve some very \nserious issues that existed between the Banking and Education \nCommittees on the student loan issue. His steadfastness and work with \nSenator Shelby actually helped us bring this bill to the floor. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me return the compliment by commending \nour colleague from Maryland, who has taken on the Herculean task in the \nabsence of our colleague from Massachusetts, of shepherding, along with \nSenator Enzi, this very important piece of legislation. My compliments \nto Mike Enzi, the Republican leader on this issue, along with Barbara, \nand the House leaders--George Miller, with\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\nwhom I was elected to Congress many years ago--and the members of the \nHouse Education Committee.\n  This is a very important bill. A few days ago we passed the housing \nbill to make a difference for people facing foreclosure. We tried to \npass legislation dealing with low-income energy assistance. I remind my \ncolleagues, the Presiding Officer led the effort on that issue, and we \nwill come back to it.\n  Education costs are critical to address. This bill is sweeping in its \nreforms, making a difference for average Americans and their families \nto deal with those costs and allow them to achieve the goal of a higher \neducation, which not only has tremendous advantage for them \nindividually but for us, as a country. It is a small price to pay for \nthe reward we receive. The GI bill, which was adopted during World War \nII, is another example of this sort of effort, providing 8 million \nAmericans benefits. Over the years it cost a lot of money, but the \nbenefit to our country has vastly exceeded the cost of that program. \nThis bill is like that one in many ways. This bill is not inexpensive, \nbut it provides benefits to our country.\n  I am particularly proud of a number of provisions. One is the Pell \ngrant increase, up to $8,000, which will help us in dealing with the \ncost of a public education, though not close enough when it comes to \nprivate education. The Patsy Mink Fellowship Program, which I am proud \nto have authored, creates scholarships and makes it possible for young \nwomen and minorities to become college professors, and addressing the \nvery small number of women who are providing a college education. The \nprovisions designed to get colleges and universities to control their \ncosts, including both transparency and incentives for schools who \nsucceed in this endeavor. I am also proud of the improvements we have \nmade to TRIO and GEAR-Up and the expansion of child care in this bill.\n  Lastly, as my friend and colleague from Maryland pointed out, the \ninclusion of the Private Student Loan Transparency Improvement Act, \nwhich Senator Shelby and I, along with 19 other members of the Banking \nCommittee authored unanimously, will make a difference when it comes to \nprotecting student borrowers from excessive debt. These provisions \nrequire lenders to provide more accurate and timely information to \ntheir customers about interest rates, terms and conditions of their \nprivate loans, and prohibits documented private student lending \npractices that have harmed students and their families, keeping them \nfrom obtaining the most competitive and affordable student loans.\n  The bill also ensures that private lending is done on the fairest and \nmost transparent terms. It prevents kickbacks and co-branding that may \nallow steering of students to specific lenders, and it guarantees \nborrowers time to consider their options and shop around for better \nterms without losing the loan they have been offered. These are very \nimportant steps.\n  Finally, I end where I began. None of this would have happened \nwithout the senior Senator from Massachusetts who has dedicated his \nlife to working families. This bill is yet further testimony to his \ncommitment to those constituencies, the people of this country. We have \nmissed him terribly lately, but he had a champion in the Senator from \nMaryland. If I had to pick one person to replace Ted Kennedy, I would \nchoose Barbara Mikulski every day of the week. She did a fabulous job \non behalf of students and their families. We thank her immensely. I \nknow my friend from Massachusetts is watching tonight, and he thanks \nher as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I won't use nearly that much time, and I \nwould be happy to share with my colleague, if she wants to make some \nclosing remarks as well.\n  I rise to summarize why the Higher Education Opportunity Act is a \nmajor victory for America's students and their families and for our \nfuture economic security. Simply put, it ensures that a college \neducation, which is the gateway to the future for working families and \nfor businesses, will be within their reach in the years to come.\n  I thank those who have made their comments earlier: the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn, and the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, \nwho pointed out some things that still need to be done in the area of \nhigher education. It would have been nice to have been able to do them \nin the bill.\n  One of those is deregulation. If we have that much paper, that many \nbillions of dollars' worth of paper that need to be done, it is time \nfor us to appoint a task force to evaluate their usefulness. I did that \nwith some of the elementary education issues the first year I was here, \nand we found that every single paper that was submitted to the \nDepartment of Education was looked at to be sure that every blank was \nfilled in and every ``t'' was crossed and every ``I'' was dotted. Our \ndisappointment was that they were then filed away and nobody made any \nuse of them.\n  We were able to get rid of some of those forms. Obviously, this is an \neven bigger opportunity.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma pointed out the lack of metrics for \nprogress in these areas. Although there are new programs, past \nexperience has been that many of them do not get funded because they \nhave to come out of discretionary funds. They are good ideas that \nprobably will never happen. But it would be a good idea to have metrics \nin there so we can gauge how well things are doing. We have a law that \nprovides for that kind of measurement and requires each agency have a \nprogram to set up the guidelines by which we can measure, and then they \nare required to measure. I have noticed over the years that there are a \nnumber of agencies that are actually failing their own evaluations. We \nnever do anything with that, which is another challenge.\n  Our country is being challenged today, and it is a challenge we \ncannot afford to lose. We are engaged in a race for knowledge and \nskills, and the nation that wins will have a head start on building a \nstronger economy. The solution to this challenge is to make a college \neducation more accessible, affordable, and accountable for all \nAmericans. That is what we are trying to do in the Higher Education \nOpportunity Act.\n  In this era of rising college costs, students and families must have \ngood information to use when making decisions about which college to \nattend, how to finance their college education, and how to manage their \nstudent loans once they are out of college. This agreement is about \ngood information, sunshine, and transparency. College is no longer an \noption. It is a necessity. Most good jobs today require some college. I \nwant to make sure everyone has access to the education and training \nthey will need to be successful in the global economy. This legislation \ngets us much closer to that goal.\n  I am pleased to say that with the passage of this agreement, we will \nhave completed the work of two of the four pieces that make up Federal \neducation and training policy.\n  Late last year we finished Head Start. Today we will finish higher \neducation. We still have more work to do because we must reauthorize \nand improve the Workforce Investment Act so that our workers have the \nskills they need to be successful in an increasingly skill-driven \neconomy. That leaves reauthorizing No Child Left Behind to complete our \neducation task.\n  Mr. President, as this debate on this legislation comes to a close, \nit is necessary to thank those who have worked long and hard on this \nbill. First and foremost, I thank Chairman Kennedy for his commitment \nto keeping this process bipartisan, and working with me and all of my \nRepublican colleagues on the HELP Committee throughout this entire \nprocess, lately by telephone, but with the same passion and enthusiasm.\n  I also thank Senator Mikulski for taking the helm and getting us to \nthe finish line when others might have given up.\n  Because this has been a bipartisan, bicameral process, I want to \nthank our House counterparts--Chairman Miller, Ranking Member McKeon, \nCongressman Hinojosa, and Congressman Keller--for their commitment to \nworking with us to find ways to reach\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nan agreement on issues that many thought would be impossible to \nachieve.\n  There are many other Members I wish to thank for contributing the \ntime and effort they did to make sure we were putting together good \npolicy. It is difficult to single out just a few. I have to immensely \nthank every single Senator who is on my committee, both Republican and \nDemocrat. That is where we share ideas. That is where most of the \nchanges in the bills are made. That is where people are able to get \ntogether and debate at length their ideas for how to make things \nbetter. And we do.\n  I thank Senators Alexander, Burr, and Coburn for their comments. They \nhave disagreements on some of the key issues in the conference report, \nbut, nonetheless, they continued to work to reach a resolution and \nimprove the final product.\n  There are many congressional staff who worked on this conference \nreport. The breadth and importance of the issues, not to mention the \nlength of the legislation, requires many people working many hours to \nget it done. Actually, it is not only many hours or many days or many \nweeks or many months--but this one has been many years.\n  I have always said I have a staff worthy of gold medals, and my staff \nwho worked on this bill have shown their gold medal status once again. \nI must first acknowledge and thank Beth Buehlmann, my education policy \ndirector. It is no exaggeration to state that without Beth, I do not \nthink there would be a Higher Education Act reauthorization today. That \nis what I hired her for several years ago. She truly was the force to \nstart the reauthorization 3\\1/2\\ years ago. She worked tirelessly to \nensure that we drafted a bill to reflect the changing nature of our \nstudent bodies, as well as to ensure that we, as a nation, will \nmaintain our status as having the best education system in the world.\n  Her team of Ann Clough, Adam Briddell, Kelly Hastings, and Lindsay \nHunsicker is comprised of remarkable individuals who brought their \ntalents and knowledge to the forefront in this bill.\n  I also thank my staff director, Ilyse Schuman, and Greg Dean, Amy \nShank, Randi Reid, John Hallmark, and Ron Hindle, who also put in many \nhours and added invaluable input into this bill as well as the overall \nprocess.\n  I also thank members of Senator Kennedy's staff for their hard work: \nMichael Myers, who has been tireless on this and has provided the kind \nof leadership that coordinated it through some of these difficult \ntimes; Carmel Martin, the expert on education; JD LaRock; Missy \nRohrbach, who, incidentally, had twin babies today, a boy and a girl. \nIt is my understanding she is doing well. She worked while pregnant and \nhelped to get this pregnant bill done. I also thank Erin Renner, \nRoberto Rodriguez, and Emma Vadehra of Senator Kennedy's staff.\n  Additionally, I thank all of the other HELP Committee staff for their \nhard work throughout this process, especially David Cleary and Sarah \nRittling of Senator Alexander's subcommittee staff. Also deserving \nthanks are our Republican Members' staff, including Allison Dembeck, \nCelia Sims, Glee Smith, Karen McCarthy, Juliann Andreen, Alison Anway, \nJohn van Meter, and Elizabeth Floyd, as well as their Democratic staff \ncounterparts. Also, I thank Scott Raab from Senator McConnell's office \nand Jim Johnson in Senator Shelby's office for helping us work through \nsome of the more difficult issues in the negotiations.\n  Also deserving my gratitude is the House staff, including Mark \nZuckerman, Alex Nock, Gabriella Gomez, Julie Radocchia, and Jeff Appel \nwith Chairman Miller's staff, and Sally Stroup, James Bergeron, and Amy \nJones with Congressman McKeon's staff.\n  Also, with any piece of legislation that we draft, we should not \nforget the legislative counsels in both bodies who worked tirelessly to \nput the 1,500-page agreement together. They are Steve Cope, Molly \nLothamer, Mark Koster, Kristin Romero, and Amy Gaynor, who also deserve \nto be recognized.\n  It has been 10 years since the last major reauthorization. I believe \nit was worth the time and the effort to get it to this point. The \nchanges we make today will affect today's students and students for \ngenerations to come.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time to the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  We are now heading to our wrap-up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of 48 letters in \nsupport of the bill be printed in the Record. They range from the \nAmerican Association of State Colleges and Universities, to the United \nStates Student Association, to the Chamber of Commerce, and many \nothers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Letters of Support Received for Higher Education Opportunity Act\n\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities, \n     State Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO), U.S. \n     Public Interest Research Group/United States Student \n     Association, United Negro College Fund, Association of Jesuit \n     Colleges and Universities, Council for Opportunity in \n     Education, Thurgood Marshall College Fund, National \n     Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education \n     (NAFEO), National Council for Community and Education \n     Partnerships (NCCEP), National Council of La Raza, National \n     Education Association, American Federation of Teachers, \n     American Indian Higher Education Consortium, National Down \n     Syndrome Society/National Down Syndrome Congress, National \n     Federation for the Blind, and Consortium for Citizens with \n     Disabilities.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Bar Association, \n     American Association of University Women, American \n     Association of School Administrators, American Association of \n     Colleges of Teacher Education, Career College Association, \n     Council of Graduate Schools, National School Board \n     Association, National Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators, National Association for the Education of \n     Young Children, New York State Education Department, \n     University of North Carolina, California State University, \n     Midwestern University, Student Loan Servicing Alliance, and \n     National HEP/CAMP Association.\n       Hispanic Education Association, Center for Law and Social \n     Policy (CLASP), Direct Loan Coalition, Massachusetts \n     Institute of Technology, Endicott College (MA), College \n     Summit, Motion Picture Association of America, National \n     Association of College Stores, Legal Action Center, EdInvest, \n     International University of Nursing, St. George's University \n     School of Medicine, University of Phoenix, Massachusetts \n     Educational Opportunity Association, St. Matthew's \n     University, and Saba University School of Medicine.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I too thank the very hard-working staff \non this bill. There have been many compliments of me tonight, but I \ncould not have done what Senator Kennedy asked me to do without the \nvery able help of Senator Kennedy's staff. Senator Enzi articulated \nthem by name, but especially Mike Myers, Carmel Martin, JD LaRock, and \nothers. I could not have done it without them. Also, I say to Senator \nEnzi, we could not have done this without you. I worked with you on \npensions and I knew how solid our relationship was and how carefully \nyou pursue these matters. Senator Kennedy said you were a prince of a \nguy to work with, and he was absolutely right. I extend my thanks to \nyou and to your professional staff as well.\n  There were also other Democrats who worked on the bill on our side--\ntwo who could not speak tonight, but I acknowledge the very hard-\nworking role of Senator Obama, who was a very aggressive advocate on \nmany of these issues, along with Senator Clinton.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the staff \nthank-yous be printed in the Record so we do not forget one person who \nhelped make this legislation possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   List of Staff Thank-You's for HEA\n\n       Senator Kennedy: Michael Myers, Carmel Martin, J.D.

Mr. President, I also thank our colleagues in the \nHouse. Congressman Miller and Congressman McKeon were absolutely \nstalwarts in working with us. Congressman Miller and I had daily \nconversations on how to move this bill forward, and it was both \nfruitful and productive, and what the Congress should be.\n  A word about working with my colleague, Senator Enzi. We had \ndisputes. We had issues. We had things that had to be worked out. You \nheard some of them this evening from the Senator from Oklahoma, the \nSenator from Tennessee. But at the end of the day, the day was over. We \nwould be able to work and follow that kind of Ronald Reagan-Tip O'Neill \nrule that when the day was over, the dispute was set aside. We went \nhome and thought about what we could do to move this bill.\n  I wish the whole Senate could work the way we worked on this bill, \nstarting with Senator Kennedy's leadership, and Senator Enzi's, as they \nheld the hearings, listened to us, and included us. We need to do more \nbipartisan work. When all is said and done, we have to start doing \nthings and less saying things. Because one of the great things I like \nabout this bill is it achieves a very important American freedom.\n  Our Constitution explicitly guarantees many rights: the freedom of \nspeech, the freedom of assembly, the freedom of religion, the freedom \nof press. But implicit in our Constitution, our Declaration of \nIndependence, and all of our documents, all of our beliefs, and all of \nour values, is we believe in the freedom to achieve, that in the United \nStates of America you can be anything you want to be, and you have \naccess, and should have access, to an opportunity ladder that enables \nyou to participate in the American dream.\n  We are a country whose values say: Dream about what you can be and \ndream about what you can contribute. And when you want to follow that \ndream, you should not be barred from it because of the size of your \nwallet. Your dream should only be shaped by the size of your talents.\n  I think this bill today, tonight, will advance this whole freedom to \nachieve, this opportunity ladder for our young people. I am very \nhonored to participate in it. I am very honored Senator Kennedy asked \nme to take on this conference. But we could not have advanced this idea \nwithout Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy is a giant in this institution and in this \ncountry. His whole life has been devoted to access to opportunity, \naccess to education, access to health care, that there be no barriers \nin the area of civil rights where people were sidelined or redlined.\n  So tonight, as we move to the adoption of this bill, I say to my \ncolleagues here, I urge the adoption of this bill.\n  I want Senator Kennedy to know many of us today, and while he has \nbeen recovering from his illness, have worn these blue armbands. They \nsay: ``Ted Strong.'' Well, we know Ted is strong.\n  So, Ted, this is for you tonight.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the adoption of the \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I understand that the actual vote on the \nconference report will occur at a time to be determined by our \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 4137 be set aside; and the Senate \nnow proceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 4040, the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission Act; there be debate on the \nconference report until 8 p.m. this evening, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that at 8 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to vote on adoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4040, that upon disposition of that report, the Senate then resume the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 4137 and the Senate proceed to vote \non adoption of the report, without further intervening action or \ndebate; that prior to the second vote, there be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nMembers, there will be two votes at 8 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7867-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7867-S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will lay before the Senate the \nconference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4040), to establish consumer product safety standards and \n     other safety requirements for children's products, having \n     met, have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement \n     to the amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment and the Senate agree to the same, signed by all of \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 30, 2008.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the conference report for H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product \nSafety Improvement Act of 2008.\n  Today is a great day for American families. This bill is the first \nstep toward revitalizing an important safety agency and restoring \nconfidence in the safety of consumer products for years to come.\n  Media reports and consumer advocates have called this bill the most \nimportant consumer product safety legislation in a generation. I call \nit legislation that is long overdue. The Consumer Product Safety \nCommission--Commission--is a small agency with an exceptionally broad \nand important charge, as the name suggests, the protection of \nconsumers, particularly children from dangerous products. The \nCommission is responsible for ensuring that the more than 15,000 \nproducts--everything from infant cribs to all-terrain-vehicles--are \nsafe to use. Every year, more than 28,000 Americans die and an \nadditional 33 million are injured by consumer products. These numbers \nare too high, and an effective CPSC with increased funding, staff, and \nauthority is essential to reducing these losses.\n  I am very pleased that many of the key provisions which originated in \nthe Senate, such as the searchable database, whistleblower protection, \nphthalates restrictions, mandatory toy safety standards, and all-\nterrain vehicle safety standards were included in\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nthe final bill. Several of these initiatives faced significant initial \nopposition from the administration, industry, and indeed, from the \nchair of the Commission itself, and I am pleased that we have come \ntogether in the House and the Senate to overcome these challenges.\n  H.R. 4040 restores needed resources and authority to the Commission. \nStarting in fiscal year 2010, the bill would authorize $626 million \nover a 5-year period to provide the agency the manpower and the \ntechnology it needs to police a complex consumer marketplace. The \nlegislation would restore the CPSC to a full complement of five \nCommissioners in order to expand expertise, maintain continuity and \navoid the losses of quorum that have plagued the agency in recent \nyears.\n  In addition, State attorneys general gain clear authority to bring \ncivil actions to seek injunctive relief for clear violations of \nstatutes enforced by the CPSC. Creating a joint enforcement \nrelationship with the states has proven to be successful in the area of \nconsumer protection, and this collaboration would provide CPSC a strong \npartner to help protect American families in a meaningful way.\n  H.R. 4040 would require manufacturers to use independent labs to test \nchildren's products and to certify their compliance with mandatory \nsafety standards, including the mandatory toy safety standard \nestablished in the bill. This new toy standard would provide the CPSC \nwith necessary enforcement tools to keep dangerous toys out of the \nhands of children.\n  Essential and groundbreaking provisions that will improve the health \nof every child include the bans of lead and certain phthalates from \nchildren's products. Dangerous substances have no place in children's \nproducts. This legislation provides a significant shift in policy in \nfavor of children and. Children have no business being used as guinea \npigs or becoming victims of the expediency of the manufacturing \nprocess.\n  Our bill also would provide better information to consumers and the \nCPSC. It would create a searchable, publically available database of \ninformation from nonindustry sources, such as hospitals, child care \nproviders, public safety agencies, and consumer reports about product \nhazards collected by the CPSC. The database would provide consumers \nwith potentially life-saving information, in an organized and timely \nfashion, which would better equip them to assess product safety risks \nand hazards. To aid in the Commission's enforcement mission, H.R. 4040 \nwould provide whistleblower protections for employees of manufacturers \nof consumer products when they find and report violations of consumer \nproduct safety laws.\n  Reconciling the differences between the House and the Senate was no \neasy task, but I had no doubts that the work of the committee would \ncome to a timely and successful conclusion. The Senate conferees worked \ncountless hours since the passage of the Senate amendment last March. \nSenator Pryor authored the original Senate bill reported by the \nCommerce Committee, which became the backbone of the Senate amendment \nto H.R. 4040. His stewardship and attention to the details of this bill \nwere essential to negotiating the conference report with the House. I \nalso commend my good friend Senator Ted Stevens. Without his guidance \nand support, the Senate amendment would not have passed, and we would \nnot have this groundbreaking legislation before us today.\n  I would also like to recognize several Senators who were not \nconferees for their contributions to the original Senate amendment and \nfor working with the conference committee on the provisions they \nchampioned in the Senate. Senator Nelson was the leader in crafting \nmandatory toy standards and the independent third party testing mandate \nin the Senate bill. Senator McCaskill's work on the whistleblower and \nthe inspector general provisions helped convince the conferees to \nprovide whistleblower protections to millions of workers in the \nconsumer products sector. Finally, Senator Feinstein's amendment to ban \ncertain phthalates from children's products was the foundation of the \ncompromise provision that was ultimately accepted by the conference.\n  I thank my friend Congressman John Dingell, the chairman of the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, who has shown his legislative skill and \ncare for the American people for more than 50 years. His partnership \nwith me this Congress has led to the passage of two monumental bills. \nWe worked together to increase fuel economy standards last December, \nand to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission today.\n  The conference committee staff have labored on a nonstop basis since \nMay. I want to thank David Strickland, Alex Hoehn-Saric, Jana Fong-\nSwamidoss, Mia Petrini, and Jared Bomberg of my Commerce Committee \nstaff for a job well done. I would also like to thank Paul Nagle, \nRebecca Hooks, and Megan Beechener of the Republican Commerce Committee \nstaff, and Lloyd Ator and Christopher Knox of the Commerce Committee's \nOffice of Legislative Counsel.\n  I also wish to recognize the efforts of the following staff of the \nSenate conferees: Erik Olson, Bridget Petruczok, Price Feland, Kate \nNilan, Tamara Fucile, Brian Hendricks, and Peter Phipps; the House \nEnergy and Commerce Committee staff: Consuela Washington, Judy Bailey, \nChristian Fjeld, Andrew Woelfling, Valerie Baron, Brian McCullough, \nWill Carty, and Shannon Weinberg; and House legislative counsel Brady \nYoung.\n  I would also like to thank CPSC Commissioner Thomas Moore and Michael \nGougisha and Pamela Weller of his staff for their assistance.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this conference report, and I \nlook forward to the President signing this landmark measure into law.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my house and senate colleagues \nfor their hard work and dedication these past months as we have worked \nfor a bipartisan, bicameral consumer product safety bill. This is a \nproduct of a bipartisan effort in both chambers and I am proud to have \nbeen a part of it. This final product will provide essential resources \nto a commission badly in need and help ensure the safety of our \nchildren from hazardous products.\n  The number of toys coming from overseas has increased greatly, while \nthe resources of the Consumer Product Safety Commission have decreased. \nThe result is unsafe products making their way to our store shelves and \ninto our homes. We all remember the wave of recalls last year. Passage \nof this bill will help assure consumers that products are safe.\n  This bill provides the commission with $626 million over the next \nfive years and directs it to significantly increase the number of \nstaff, also adding to the number of CPSC employees stationed at our \nports of entry inspecting products for safety defects.\n  In addition to these increased resources, the CPSC will have greater \nauthority to punish violators of its statutes. The amount the CPSC can \ncollect in civil penalties for a single violation will be raised to \n$100,000, with a maximum penalty cap of $15 million. And, as a way to \nensure compliance, state attorneys general will have authority to \nenforce particular violations of CPSC statutes, including violations of \nconsumer product safety rules, regulations, standards, and bans, as \nwell as product recalls.\n  I am pleased that the all terrain vehicle (ATV) provision that I \nincluded in the Senate-passed bill remains in this final bill. For many \nAlaskans ATVs are the primary means of transportation in the summer. \nMore than a third of the ATVs sold in 2006 came from overseas--many \nATVs from overseas do not meet our safety standards. ATVs injured over \n146,000 people in 2006, and approximately 39,000 of those injuries were \nto children under 16. This bill requires all ATVs, both foreign and \ndomestic to be subject to the same safety standards.\n  Additionally the bill establishes tough lead standards and calls for \nsafety rules for durable infant and toddler products such as strollers \nand cribs. Selling, reselling, offering or providing for use any of \nthese products not meeting our new safety standards will be illegal. \nConsumers will also have the option of registering their purchases so \nthey can be notified in the event of a recall.\n  Consumers are purchasing more products over the internet or through \ncatalogues, and it is sometimes difficult to ascertain a product's \ndangers by the photo online.\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\n  Advertisements providing a direct means of purchase will be required \nto contain a cautionary statement. By including these statements, \nconsumers, will be able to make an informed decision when purchasing \nproducts for a young child.\n  I congratulate everyone who worked so diligently on this bill. It \ntook some time, but we have a solid bill to send to the President that \nwill better protect our children and give the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission the resources it has been missing.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nthe conference report on legislation to accomplish the urgent task of \npreventing dangerous consumer products--especially those intended for \nchildren--from entering the country or reaching store shelves. The \nconference report contains a wide variety of measures that, taken \ntogether, deserve our support because they will greatly bolster \ndefenses against hazards that must not reach American homes.\n  I want to commend the chief sponsor of the bill, Senator Pryor, for \nhis leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure to work with him.\n  We all remember last year's alarming and, too often, tragic stories \nof product hazards and recalls that demonstrated the need to strengthen \nprotections for consumers, particularly children. Unfortunately, those \ndangers continue. In 2008, new Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nCPSC, recalls have included 19,000 baby rattles that present choking \nhazards, 685,000 wireless helicopter toys whose batteries can catch \nfire, and 91,000 horseshoe-shaped magnet toys whose coating contains \nhigh levels of lead.\n  Lead, as we know, is a particular concern because of its use in \nplastics and paints can expose children to the risk of serious nervous \nsystem damage and other health effects. The conference report's \ndramatic reduction in the permissible lead content in products marketed \nfor children under 12--starting at 600 parts per million and ratcheting \ndown to 100 parts per million over 3 years--is just one example of the \nbill's aggressive pursuit of safety.\n  Even with these tighter restrictions on lead content, we must \ncontinue to pay special attention to imported products that violate our \nsafety rules. As we have seen with the lead issue, the bulk of toys \nsold in American stores come from China, where cases of careless or \nunscrupulous factories or suppliers using cheaper lead paints in \nviolation of factory or official standards make clear the need to \nupgrade our ability to police safety violations in global supply \nchains.\n  I am, therefore, pleased that the conference report contains four key \nprovisions from the Senate-passed bill, S. 2663, that emerged from an \nin-depth investigation conducted by my staff on the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee. Combined with important \nenhancements to CPSC authorities and funding provided in the conference \nreport, these four provisions will ensure that unsafe imported consumer \nproducts, including toys and clothing that endanger our Nation's \nchildren, are effectively screened at the border and, when necessary, \ndestroyed.\n  Last August, I asked my HSGAC staff to review the effectiveness of \nFederal safety standards governing children's toys and clothing. The \ncommittee investigators conducted numerous interviews of manufacturers' \nrepresentatives, retailers, consumer advocacy groups, and Federal \nregulatory agencies, and visited a manufacturer's testing lab and two \nports. Their findings confirmed several weaknesses in our current \nconsumer product safety regime; namely; the CPSC is understaffed, \ninadequately resourced, and lacks crucial authorities needed to fulfill \nits mission; voluntary standards applicable to many classes of products \ncan be useful in quickly addressing safety issues, but lack the full \nforce of law; and the inability to effectively enforce safety standards \nat our ports limits our Nation's ability to stop hazardous imported \nproducts from entering the American marketplace.\n  My staff investigation made it clear that our border inspections \nregime must target and intercept foreign products that fail to meet \nU.S. safety standards. As our committee found, Customs and Border \nProtection currently lacks the authority to seize and destroy dangerous \nimported products even if the agency suspects that an unscrupulous \nimporter turned away at one port might attempt to bring these products \nin through another U.S. port.\n  The committee's investigation also revealed that coordination and \ninformation sharing between CBP and CPSC were often ad-hoc--providing \nCBP with little useful information that would allow its agents to \ntarget shipments that are more likely to contain dangerous goods.\n  The provisions that I authored, and worked with Senators Inouye, \nStevens, and Pryor to include in the bipartisan reform bill that the \nSenate passed, specifically target problems with unsafe imports by \nensuring that CPSC and U.S. Customs and Border Protection work \neffectively together to keep unsafe consumer products out of our \ncountry. These provisions: authorize CBP to seize and destroy dangerous \nconsumer products entering our ports, long before they reach store \nshelves or American homes; enhance information sharing between CPSC and \nCBP so that inspectors at our Nation's ports can focus their resource \non the most risky shipments, targeting products, manufacturers, and \nimporters with poor consumer-safety records; task CPSC with developing \na comprehensive risk assessment tool to help CBP quickly evaluate \nimported products that might violate our Nation's safety standards; and \ndirect the CPSC to develop a plan to ensure that Commission employees \nare assigned to the National Targeting Center at CBP to increase \ninteragency collaboration in evaluating the potential risks of inbound \nshipments for potential safety issues.\n  I am pleased that the conferees retained these provisions in their \nreport. They will help the CPSC and Customs and Border Protection \nidentify dangerous products that enter our ports and prevent them from \nreaching American homes.\n  Other measures in this conference report--increased staffing and \nfunding for the CPSC, tougher civil and criminal penalties for \nviolations of safety laws, a ban on reselling recalled products, \nenhanced whistleblower protections, safety certifications, and product \ntracking labels--will also strengthen the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission's ability to protect American consumers. With the new \nauthorities in this bill, the CPSC will be able to work more \neffectively with importers, retailers, consumers, and industry \nassociations to develop and enforce product-safety standards.\n  This legislation will make a real difference in protecting America's \nchildren and other consumers from hazardous toys and other products.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the conference report.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 4040, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. As \nmany of my colleagues know, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or \nCPSC, is responsible for protecting children and families against \nunreasonable risks associated with 15,000 consumer products. Over the \npast year, Congress has worked to improve the ability of the CPSC to \nensure the products in their jurisdiction are safe for children and \nfamilies across the Nation. The legislation before us today will \nprovide increased funding and expanded authorities for the CPSC to \naccomplish their mission.\n  This conference report is a comprehensive measure that reflects \nmonths of hard work on both sides of the aisle and between both \nChambers. It is a compromise measure that reflects the give and take of \neach Chamber and each party. It is a bipartisan measure, demonstrated \nby the fact that the House of Representatives voted 424-1 on Wednesday \nin favor of this conference report.\n  Among the many items in this report, it takes a tough stand on lead \nin children's products by banning lead in products made for children 12 \nand younger in 6 months, setting a maximum threshold of 600 parts per \nmillion, ppm, which is reduced over time to 100 ppm after 3 years.\n  The conference report includes a significant increase in civil fines, \nwith a maximum fine of $15 million, more than 8 times the current \nmaximum, and it raises the per violation penalty cap to $100,000 from \nthe current level of\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\n$8,000. It also includes language to consider the economic impact on \nsmall businesses when levying a fine. Further, it toughens criminal \npenalties on bad actors who commit ``knowing and willful'' violations \nof product safety laws by making them eligible for up to 5 years in \nprison, fines, or both.\n  The conference report establishes testing and certification \nrequirements for children's products made for those ages 12 and under \nbefore they are sold in the U.S. It also accredits third party labs to \ndo such product testing, including qualified proprietary labs.\n  The conference report includes a searchable consumer database that \nthe CPSC will have on-line in 2 years. It will contain minimum \nreporting requirements for data to be posted, including: a description \nof the product; identification of the manufacturer; a description of \nthe harm related to the use of the product; the submitter's contact \ninformation; and verification that the submitted information is true \nand accurate. Companies would have ten business days to review whatever \ninformation is slated to go on the database, and post their own \ncomments. If necessary, the CPSC would remove inaccurate material and \nredact confidential information.\n  The report gives authority to the CPSC to pick the recall remedy that \na business must follow, to either replace the product, repair the \nproduct, or refund the consumer's money. It also makes it illegal to \nsell a recalled product, or export a recalled product without explicit \npermission. Further, it requires tracking labels for children's \nproducts and packaging where it is practicable, to make sure products \nare identifiable for more effective recall purposes.\n  Under the report, all foreign and domestic-made all-terrain vehicles, \nor ATV's, will be required to meet the same mandatory safety standards. \nIt also bans the sale of new 3-wheeled ATV's in the United States.\n  On one of the more contentious items dealt with in the conference, a \ncompromise was reached earlier this week to ban three specific \nphthalates, and place an interim ban on three other phthalates while a \nformal health assessment is done. Once complete, the CPSC would \nconsider the findings of this assessment and conduct a rulemaking to \nsee if the interim ban should stay in place or be removed.\n  Finally, the conference report provides a significant increase in the \namount of funding available to the CPSC. Beginning in fiscal year 2010 \nand running through fiscal year 2014, the agency is authorized to \nreceive a total of $626 million. A specific authorization for travel is \nincluded in the overall funding level to meet the ban placed on travel \npaid for by outside groups. Given the new and expanded authorities the \nCPSC will be required to undertake, this level of funding will meet \nthose needs.\n  Mr. President, the American people expect the CPSC to protect them \nfrom dangerous toys and household products and ensure the consumer \ngoods they use every day are the safest possible. Congress is giving \nthem the tools to meet that goal.\n  I would like to extend my thanks and congratulations to Senator \nInouye, who chaired this conference committee, for the bipartisan \nprocess in which the conference was run, and how this report was \ncrafted. I would also like to thank my fellow conferees--Senators \nPryor, Boxer, Klobuchar, Stevens and Hutchison--for their hard work and \ndue diligence in putting together a measure that should enjoy the \nsupport of a majority of our colleagues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for H.R. 4040, the Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act. The conferees have reached a \nresponsible compromise that makes important reforms to the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission, CPSC, that are long overdue that will make \nproducts safer for consumers and children.\n  This bill takes important steps to shore up a weak and ineffective \nConsumer Product Safety Commission. As a grandfather and consumer, I am \nappalled at the lack of resources and enforcement authority of the CPSC \nand its inability to adequately protect our children, our food supply \nand the general public from harmful or contaminated products.\n  We can and should be doing much more to protect the American \nconsumer. As was recently underscored by the alarming number of \nchildren's products with high lead content, contaminated pet food, and \ndefective imported tires, there are a lot of cracks in the systems that \nwere supposed to be watching out for consumers.\n  We need to know our children's and grandchildren's toys are safe. We \nneed to know that the food we import is not tainted with harmful \nchemicals. We need to know the products we buy will not harm us or our \nchildren. I believe it is the government's basic responsibility to \nprotect the public.\n  Those who work for the companies that make these products may often \nbe in a position to detect and prevent serious problems or injuries \nbefore they occur. I am pleased that this bill includes important \nprotections for corporate whistleblowers that will encourage employees \nto come forward about violations and defective products without the \nfear of retaliation by their employer.\n  Many of the defective and contaminated products are imported. Even \nwith its current limited resources and reach, CPSC recalled \napproximately 150 tainted products from China in 2007 including tires, \ntoys, baby cribs, candles, bicycles, remote controls, hair dryers, and \nlamps. Imagine how many more contaminated or defective products are \nslipping through the cracks and reaching American consumers without \nbeing detected.\n  We are being deluged by cheap imports from China and elsewhere. We \nshould at least be making sure the products we import are not \ncontaminated or dangerous. That is why I wrote to President Bush \nrequesting that his administration investigate dangerous products that \nhave been imported from China. We need to strengthen our agencies and \nlaws so that products that do not meet our health and safety standards \nare stopped at our borders. To do this we need to give the CPSC the \nnecessary tools and resources, including more manpower to adequately \ninspect imports.\n  This bill makes the legislative changes needed to give the CPSC the \nnecessary tools and resources to improve on its past poor performance \nand reassure consumers that there will be more oversight of the \nmarketplace in the future.\n  This bill will: increase overall funding for the CPSC ; increase CPSC \nstaffing; prohibit the use of dangerous phthalates in children's toys \nand child care articles; streamline product safety rulemaking \nprocedures; ban lead beyond a minute amount in products intended for \nchildren under the age of 12 and require certification and labeling; \nincrease inspection of imported products so we are not allowing \nrecalled or banned products to cross our borders; increase penalties \nfor violating our product safety laws; strengthen and improve recall \nprocedures and ban the sale of recalled products; require CPSC to \nprovide consumers with a user-friendly database on deaths and serious \ninjuries caused by consumer products; and ban 3-wheel all terrain \nvehicles, ATVs, and strengthens regulation of other ATVs, especially \nthose intended for use by youth.\n  The legislation has the strong support of consumer, scientific and \npublic health organizations. In a letter to Senate leaders, key \nrepresentatives of these groups called H.R. 4040, a ``ground-breaking \nmeasure, which will help ensure that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission (CPSC) has the resources and regulatory authority it needs \nto protect consumers and repair our long-broken product safety net.''\n  Organizations supporting the bill include the following, among \nothers: Thomas H.

Mr. President, I fully support many of the changes that H.R. \n4040, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, makes to \nensure that America's consumers are safe. However, one of the main \ngoals of the bill is to provide the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nCPSC, with the tools and resources it needs to protect American \nconsumers. Although this conference report does take some steps towards \nthat end, it simultaneously hurts businesses without providing \ncommensurate benefits to consumers. For this reason, I will vote \nagainst the conference report.\n  The CPSC was created in 1972 to establish a single set of product \nsafety regulations for manufacturers and distributors to follow \nthroughout the country. This conference report, however, includes a \nsection that would expand the power of state attorneys general to bring \nactions on behalf of their own states against businesses they believe \nviolate federal consumer protection statutes mandated by the CPSC. \nGiving 50 attorneys general discretion over consumer product safety \nlaws would lead to 50 different interpretations of the law, and, thus, \na confusing patchwork of safety standards that would make it more \ndifficult for the CPSC to enforce uniform, national policies. Moreover, \nin recent years, some State attorneys general have used their positions \nto garner national attention to advance their careers. I am worried \nthat this conference report leaves enough discretion to the state \nattorneys general to enforce CPSC rules that would tempt some to file \nfrivolous lawsuits that could ultimately undermine the effectiveness of \nthe CPSC.\n  The conference report also keeps intact a requirement for the CPSC to \ncreate a public database of product-related complaints. This public \ndatabase provides the opportunity for parties to post false information \nonline, and allows minimal oversight by the CPSC or an opportunity for \nmanufacturers to defend themselves. Inaccurate information about a \ncompany's product on a government-endorsed website could irrevocably \nharm a company's reputation, and I cannot support such a provision.\n  I also oppose the section in the conference report that would extend \nnew whistleblower protections to millions of employees of consumer \nproduct manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Under this bill, \nonce an employee notifies the CPSC of an action he ``believes to be'' a \nviolation of a consumer product safety regulation, the employer faces a \nfine if it discharges or takes any negative action against the \nemployee. Including such a provision would grant any disgruntled \nemployee a powerful incentive to report erroneous or unsubstantiated \ninformation as an alleged product safety violation in order to insulate \nhimself from unrelated disciplinary actions. There is no reason for \nsuch a provision except to dramatically unbalance the employee-employer \nrelationship, and the failure to fix this section after repeated \nattempts causes me even greater concern that it has little to do with \nlegitimate whistleblowers and more to do with hamstringing employers \nfrom dealing appropriately with problem employees.\n  It is unfortunate that I am forced to vote against this conference \nreport because I do believe the CPSC's resources ought to be bolstered. \nHowever, this conference report carries with it too many of the \nproblems that existed when the bill left the Senate.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support \nof the H.R. 4040 conference report.\n  The issue of consumer product safety--and particularly the safety of \ntoys and other children's products--has long been an important issue \nfor me.\n  Over the last few years, however, we've seen ample evidence that the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission's authority to protect the public \nwas not up to the task. This breakdown in authority was made crystal \nclear by last year's ``summer of recalls''--when we saw recall after \nrecall of children's products, including:\n  Children's jewelry and toys covered in lead paint. Toys with \ndetachable magnets that can cause fatal intestinal obstructions. \nStuffed animals with small parts that can detach and become a choking \nhazard. A children's craft kit containing beads that--when swallowed--\nmetabolized into the same chemical compound as GHB, the date rape drug.\n  Unfortunately, I saw some of the impacts of harmful toys first hand. \nLast July, I visited with a team of emergency room doctors in Tampa who \ntreated children with intestinal obstructions due to magnets that had \ndetached from toys. In some cases, the doctors noted that the \nintestinal obstructions were so severe that the children had to undergo \nsurgery to remove the blockages.\n  Invasive surgery like this is scary for most adults--so you can only \nimagine what it was like for a 4- or 5-year-old to go through something \nlike this.\n  That August, I also visited with a family in Jacksonville who left \ntwo of their children in a room with a disco ball toy. The disco ball \ntoy later overheated, caught fire, and emitted enough carbon monoxide \nto kill both children.\n  After visiting with the families of these children, I also learned \nfirst hand about the weaknesses in our product safety laws--and the \ngeneral failure of leadership at the CPSC. This regulatory breakdown \nwas highlighted by the fact that the CPSC had only one full time \nemployee--who worked in this cramped, antiquated lab--responsible for \nensuring the safety of our children's toys.\n  Quite frankly, I was outraged by this--and last summer I introduced \nS. 1833, the Children's Product Safety Act, which would, require third-\nparty testing of toys and other children's products.\n  These third-party testing requirements were incorporated by Senator \nPryor into the Senate version of the CPSC Reform bill--along with an \namendment I offered in the Commerce Committee that would mandate the \nfirst mandatory safety standards for toys.\n  And I am very pleased that they are included in the final conference \nreport.\n  Taken together, these provisions will ensure that toys and other \nproducts intended for children 12 and under will be tested by a \nrigorous third-party screening process that is continuously updated to \naddress new and emergency hazards. And that is a big victory for \nAmerica's families.\n  I would like to thank the members of the conference and the staff of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee for all of their hard work on this issue.\n  This legislation will help ensure that we never face another ``summer \nof recalls.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and get it to the White \nHouse as soon as possible.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Consumer Product Safety Bill, while \nwell intentioned, will do little to improve consumer product safety.\n  Since when should the Government be held responsible for the safety \nof consumers when time and time again the Federal bureaucracy has \nfailed in its other safety obligations and responsibilities?\n  In 2005, Hurricane Katrina was a stark and sad reminder that a \nbloated, inefficient, and incompetent bureaucracy does not have the \nability to protect citizens.\n  Just last year, the interstate bridge collapse in Minnesota reminded \nus all of the misplaced priorities of the Federal Government. Instead \nof ensuring\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\nthe structural soundness of bridges, politicians were more concerned \nwith their earmarks, and diverted funds away from bridges such as the \none in Minnesota for their own political benefit.\n  In another example of Government incompetence, the census is \ncurrently in grave peril of not completing its constitutional duty \neffectively and on time. This speaks volumes about the inefficiencies \nof our Government, as we have 10 years to prepare for the census with \nover two centuries of experience to draw upon to execute this \nresponsibility.\n  This bill is a perfect example of politicians rushing to legislate on \na problem that really isn't there in order to pat themselves on the \nback to try to curry favor with their constituents in an election year.\n  The truth is the paranoia and hysteria currently with consumer \nproduct safety is not proportional to the reality of the situation. \nNancy Ord, Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, stated \nin January, ``Last year was marked by intense media scrutiny of the \nagency and of toy recalls in particular . . . the coverage reached \nnear-hysteria level, And then, of course, some politicians, sensing a \npossible political issue, jumped on the bandwagon.''\n  While there has been a rise in product recalls, in a sense, the \nrecalls are themselves a positive sign, as dangers were identified by \nmanufacturers and products were removed from the market.\n  More importantly, these product recalls have not translated into dire \nhealth consequences, as there has been little evidence of any \ndeterioration in overall product safety. There were few if any reports \nof consumer injuries from the recalled products. Although the number of \ninjuries from toys increased somewhat in 2006, injury rates generally \nhave decreased since 2001. Also, lead poisoning cases are at historic \nlows in many areas.\n  Regardless, many of the companies that fall under the CPSC umbrella \nhave raised the levels of their own self-policing. Wal-Mart has \nannounced that this month it will require independent lab testing for \nall new toys as well as those it reorders. Mattei and others have ended \nthe use of certain kinds of batteries. And the Toy Industry Association \nhas worked with the Commission on a plan to test toy safety in the \ndesign and manufacturing process as well as the final product.\n  The political reaction to the problem, like most Government \nsolutions, is to throw money at it.\n  While some statutory upgrades are needed, almost doubling the size of \nthe agency, as this bill does, will not eradicate or drastically \nimprove the issue.\n  As we have seen time after time, when Government throws money at a \nproblem, rarely does it improve a situation, and more often than not, \nit further complicates and aggravates the problem.\n  In addition, there are also a lot of unintended consequences in this \nbill, as it is a trial lawyer giveaway. While the dramatic increase in \nauthorization is troubling, the provisions that subject businesses to \nthe wrath of the trial lawyer and plaintiffs bar are far more \nproblematic as they will raise the cost of doing business, hurt or \ndestroy small businesses, and could further exasperate an already \nunstable economy.\n\n  Authorizing State attorneys general to initiate lawsuits, creating a \nconsumer product safety database, and drastically increasing fines are \nfree giveaways to trial lawyers that will do little for consumer safety \nand will unnecessarily damage small businesses.\n  Allowing State attorneys general to bring lawsuits on behalf of their \nresidents for violations of consumer safety rules would reverse 35 \nyears of successful policy experience.\n  Overzealous State attorneys general will now have the authority and \ndiscretion to interpret safety regulations and could unilaterally on a \nwhim rule a business is noncompliant and could then hand over expensive \nlawsuits to their trial lawyer's cronies who are notoriously close with \nState law enforcement officials.\n  State attorneys, then, would be hard-pressed to deny politically \nactive State trial lawyers to sue companies when the litigation will \nnot cost the State a dime and could, in many cases, bring the attorney \ngeneral positive publicity.\n  This provides false incentives for overzealous attorneys general and \nwould run precisely counter to the CPSC's policy of carefully balancing \ncost and benefit in making safety regulations.\n  Lawsuits, which are expensive, adversarial, and often drawn out, can \nbe an impediment to a successful long-term relationship that maximizes \ncompliance and safety.\n  State attorneys general should not have the power to reduce the \neffectiveness of the CPSC's efforts by undermining its balanced \napproach to enforcement.\n  Another free giveaway to trial lawyers is the creation of a consumer \nproduct safety database. The database is estimated to cost $10 million, \nwhich accounts for over 10 percent of the Commission's budget.\n  This section requires the CPSC to establish a Web site to post any \ncomplaint, regardless of accuracy or merit, from consumer groups or \nindividuals.\n  While on the surface the database appears to aim to educate and warn \nconsumers about potential product defect or harm, the reality of it is \nfar from effective. It is highly doubtful that many consumers will know \nabout or even care to peruse a Government Web site to validate whether \na product is safe prior to purchase, especially considering the claims \nare not verified prior to posting.\n  What the database does provide in much more practical terms however, \nis a centralized, consolidated data source where law firms, unions, and \nlobbyists are given access to cherry-pick consumer reports for \npotential lawsuits.\n  There is already a consumer product database, called lawcash.com, \nthat consolidates consumer product complaints.\n  The Web site brags that its database provides consumers ``the \ninformation you need and the access you deserve to find out if you are \neligible to claim your share of billions of dollars distributed yearly \nthrough thousands of class action lawsuits.''\n  This reveals the true motives for such ``consumer product \nbatabases,'' and accordingly the Government has no role in serving as a \nconduit of information that promotes hit job lawsuits.\n  This cumbersome endeavor will divert funds and resources from efforts \nthat actually go toward consumer safety and redirect it toward \nmaintaining a Web site that will only contain inflammatory information \nthat unions and lawyers can utilize to sue businesses.\n  The bill drastically increases maximum civil penalties more than \ntenfold and the individual violation more than twentyfold, subjecting \neach product that wrongfully enters the market to a $100,000 fine. The \nthreat of a $100,000 fine will cause many small manufacturers and \nretailers who commit only minor violations to declare bankruptcy.\n  Additionally, faced with these hefty fines, this provision could \nerode the healthy and productive relationship between businesses and \nthe Commission.\n  Faced with bankruptcy, many businesses would be much less inclined to \nvoluntarily report violations and as a consequence would not receive \nthe proper guidance to fix the problem, subjecting the business and its \nemployees to potential harm.\n  While allowing increases in frivolous lawsuits and drastically hiking \nup the fines for businesses may allow Senators to tout to the public \nthat they are tough on consumer safety, these actions are unlikely to \nimprove the situation, and more importantly, the unintended \nconsequences would be to increase the cost of doing business, impairing \neconomic and job growth at a time when our economy desperately needs \neconomic and job growth.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask today to speak on the Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act of 2008.\n  I commend the conferees for ironing out the differences between the \nHouse and Senate passed versions of this bill that will deliver to the \nAmerican people strong and much needed reform to consumer product \noversight. I was proud to be a cosponsor of the Senate version, and I \nwould like to thank and congratulate Chairman Inouye for his leadership \nand Senator Pryor for his extraordinary work in crafting this \noutstanding, bipartisan bill.\n  Over the last several years the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nhas become a shell of its former self, with a noticeable void in \nleadership. Dangerous goods and toys have fallen into\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nthe hands of our most vulnerable population while the CPSC has looked \nthe other way. This act, however will prevent the CPSC from shirking \nits responsibility and ignoring its obligation to make America safe.\n  This act will provide the Consumer Product Safety Commission with the \nauthority an resources it needs to be more effective in its critical \nmission to protect consumers. Quite frankly, the current product safety \nsystem is broken, and the CPSC is in desperate need of reform. Too many \nunsafe goods are reaching the shores of the United States. Too many \ndangerous products are finding their way into the hands of American \nconsumers, and all too often, young children.\n  We worry about our kids when they are in class, when they are walking \nor driving home alone, even when they surf the Internet. We should not \nhave to worry that the toys they play with might be hazardous to their \nhealth, or god forbid, even fatal.\n  The effectiveness of the CPSC has been severely undermined by years \nof budget and personnel cuts and, as a result, has been unable to keep \nup with globalization of the marketplace. This bill will reverse those \ntrends and give the CPSC the budget and the tools it desperately needs \nto again become an effective force for consumer protection.\n  Protecting consumers, and especially children, is a priority, and the \nbill takes a tough approach to products that might threaten their \nhealth and safety. Imports of untested children's products will be \nprohibited, and mandatory third-party testing of children's products \nwill be implemented. Tracking labels for children's products will help \nparents tie safety recalls and alerts to prior purchases. Children's \nproducts containing lead and certain plastic additives will be banned. \nA new Chronic Health Advisory Panel will be created. Finally, the sale \nof recalled products will be prohibited.\n  The CPSC must do a better job of getting hazardous products off the \nshelves and out of consumers' reach and these provisions will give the \nCPSC the tools to do just that. Manufacturers, importers, and retailers \nwill be required to do their part as well or face serious consequences. \nThe bill provides for increased criminal and civil penalties for those \nwho knowingly and willingly violate product safety laws. It also gives \nState attorneys general the means to enforce Federal safety standards \nand get dangerous products off the shelf. Protections for \nwhistleblowers are also included in the bill, so that employees who \nidentify dangerous products along the supply chain can come forward \nwith vital health and safety information without fear of reprisal.\n  These and other provisions of the CPSC Reform Act represent \ncommonsense solutions to keeping consumers informed and safe from \ndangerous products. The bill will also ban industry-sponsored trips, \nwhich have the perception of unduly influencing CPSC officials.\n  Passage of this bill is vital if we hope to rebuild, reform, and \nrevitalize the CPSC. The CPSC must be re-equipped to do its job of \nenhancing product safety and protecting kids and consumers from unsafe \nproducts.\n  The Federal Government must again become an effective force for \nconsumer protection. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act is a \nfirst step--and a vital one at that.\n  Ms. BOXER. Mr. President, in a Senate where recently it has been so \nhard to get things done, Democrats and Republicans have come together \nin a bipartisan manner to produce a strong conference report that is a \nvictory for children and families.\n  I have a message for American parents everywhere who are concerned \nabout the safety of their children's toys, ``We have heard your \nconcerns, and today, Congress has acted.''\n  The Senate is about to approve landmark consumer legislation to \nprotect our kids from dangerous children's products and hazardous \nsubstances.\n  I want to thank Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, Senator Pryor \nand their staffs for all of their hard work and dedication to this \nimportant bill.\n  As both a parent and a grandparent, I have been incredibly distressed \nby the seemingly endless stream of reports about defective and \ndangerous children's toys and products.\n  Consumers Union dubbed 2007 ``The Year of the Recall'' after 45 \nmillion toys and other children's products were recalled. Recalls \njumped 22 percent for the 9-month period that ended June 30 of this \nyear.\n  Clearly, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has not been able to \nkeep pace with the growing market of consumer products many of which \nare now manufactured abroad.\n  For too long we have asked this agency, which has a staff of \napproximately 400 charged with overseeing the safety of 15,000 consumer \nproducts, to do too much with grossly inadequate resources and \nenforcement tools.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 addresses those \nresource problems and finally brings the CPSC's enforcement powers in \nline with those of other Federal agencies charged with protecting the \npublic.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 includes a strong \nban on lead and phthalates, requires testing of all children's products \nthat must meet mandatory toy standards, and for the first time, \nincludes a public, searchable national database on the CPSC website of \nall consumer complaints filed with the CPSC so consumers can be better \ninformed about dangerous products.\n  The bill also strengthens the Consumer Product Safety Commission's \nauthority to recall products, increases enforcement authority for \nAttorneys General, includes stronger civil and criminal penalties for \nviolators, bans industry sponsored travel, and provides whistleblower \nprotections for employees of manufacturers, private labelers, \nretailers, and distributors.\n  I want to thank the conferees for including two provisions I authored \nin committee.\n  The Labeling Requirement for Advertising Toys and Games requires \nproducts sold over the Internet or in catalogues to list any cautionary \nstatements, such as choking warnings, in their advertisements.\n  These labels would normally be visible when the products are \npurchased in the store but oftentimes are not visible to the consumer \nwhen sold over the Internet or in catalogues.\n  My second provision requires manufacturers of durable infant or \ntoddler's products to provide consumers with postage-paid registration \nforms with each product so consumers can be better informed if the \nproduct they bought is eventually recalled.\n  This provision was based on a bill by Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky \ncalled the Danny Keysar Child Product Safety Notification Act.\n  Danny Keysar was a 16-month-old child who died when his Playskool \nTravel-Lite portable crib collapsed--5 years after the CPSC had ordered \nit off the shelves because it was dangerous. Danny was tragically the \nfifth victim to die due to the faulty design of this crib and a sixth \nchild died 3 months later.\n  From 1990 to 1997 more than 1.5 million portable cribs with a similar \ndangerous design were manufactured. A total of 17 children have been \nkilled by these types of cribs.\n  Neither Danny's parents nor a caregiver at the daycare where the \naccident occurred were aware of the recall. State inspectors who had \nvisited the daycare a week before were not aware of the crib's recall.\n  Our provision will provide parents with a method for receiving these \nvital recall updates that could save their child's life.\n  I was also pleased to work closely with Senator Klobuchar, \nRepresentative Waxman, and other conferees to get a strong ban on lead \nin toys and other children's products to protect our kids from \ndangerous lead contamination.\n\n  I also want to thank Chairman Inouye and Senator Pryor for their \nleadership and support on this issue.\n  We all know that lead poisons the brain and nervous system, can \ndecrease IQs, and cause behavioral problems, and that it is especially \ndangerous to children.\n  Let me tell you about Colton Burkhart, a 4-year-old boy from Oregon \non a family camping trip who became violently ill from lead poisoning \nafter he swallowed a medallion from a necklace bought in a 25-cent toy \nvending machine. The medallion turned out to be 39 percent lead, which \nhad elevated his blood lead level to a potentially\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\nfatal level of 123 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, more than \n12 times the CDC's lead poisoning level of concern.\n  Jarnell Brown, another 4-year-old boy was brought to the hospital \nemergency department in Minneapolis, Minnesota complaining of vomiting. \nBelieving that the child had a stomach virus, he was released. The next \nday, Jarnell was rushed to the hospital after having suffered a seizure \nand respiratory arrest. Jarnell later died. An autopsy revealed that he \ndied of acute lead poisoning from a heart-shaped charm from a bracelet \nthat his mother had gotten free with her Reebok sneakers. The charm was \nfound to contain 99.1 percent lead. Reebok recalled 300,000 bracelets \nworldwide as a result.\n  The many recalls of lead toys and products over the past year have \nhighlighted the need for action.\n  This legislation puts into place a ban on lead in children's products \nthat gets increasingly stringent over 3 years, and that will help \nensure that we protect our kids today and in future generations from \nthe scourge of lead poisoning.\n  In addition, Senator Feinstein, Representative Waxman and I \nsuccessfully fought, shoulder-to-shoulder, for a ban on dangerous \nphthalates in many children's products.\n  Studies show that phthalates are endocrine disruptors linked to \nreproductive abnormalities in male babies and many experts believe that \nthe accumulation of exposures to multiple phthalates presents a risk to \ndeveloping fetuses and young children.\n  Phthalates have been banned from many children's products in the \nEuropean Union since 1999, and at least nine other countries have \nfollowed suit in an effort to better protect children from harmful \nhealth effects of these chemicals.\n  My home State of California was the first in the Nation to prohibit \nphthalates in many toys and child care products, and Washington State \nand Vermont have taken similar actions.\n  In addition, major retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, and Toys ``R'' \nUs have already begun to take phthalate-containing children's products \noff their shelves.\n  China, which manufactures 85 percent of the world's toys, reportedly \nhas created a separate manufacturing line for products intended for \nexport to nations that ban phthalates.\n  This legislation will permanently ban three of the most dangerous \nphthalates, DEHP, DBP, and BBP from all children's toys and child care \narticles.\n  In addition, it imposes an interim ban on three other dangerous \nphthalates, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP, in children's toys that can be put in \nthe mouth, and in childcare articles. That ban can only be altered \nafter a detailed scientific review.\n  Of course, nothing in this bill undercuts the Commission's authority \nto go beyond the specific products listed in this section's ban, or the \nspecific phthalates listed in the ban, in any additional action the \nCommission takes under its regulatory authorities.\n  States such as California that have been leaders in protecting \nchildren by restricting toxic phthalate alternatives, are protected.\n  I also want to thank the conferees for working with Congressman \nWaxman and myself to protect State warning laws related to consumer \nproducts, such as California's Proposition 65.\n  We are so pleased to see the final conference report clarifies that \nState and local toy and children's product requirements in effect \nbefore the date of enactment of this legislation are not preempted.\n  This bill is so important to the health and safety of our children \nand families. I want to again thank my colleagues on both the House and \nSenate side for all of their efforts on this legislation.\n  We can't risk one more child's injury or tragic death due to faulty \ntoys or children's products. I am glad to hear that the President has \nagreed to sign this legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act of 2008. This legislation makes a number \nof long overdue changes and improvements in the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission and their ability to protect children and other consumers. \nIt will impose mandatory toy safety standards, in place of the current \nvoluntary standards; create an online database, which parents and \nconsumers can search for reports of safety problems; provide \nwhistleblower protections to employees of manufacturers, retailers and \ndistributors to promote prompt reporting of any safety hazard; and \nauthorize a much needed funding increase for the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission to ensure that these reforms are carried out.\n  Most importantly, this legislation bans the use of six phthalates in \nmany children's products and child care articles. It will ban the use \nof more than .1 percent of three phthalates--DEHP, DBP, or BBP--in toys \nfor children ages 12 and under and childcare articles for children ages \n3 and under; and place an interim ban on the use of more than .1 \npercent of three additional phthalates--DINP, DIDP, and DnOP--in any \ntoy that can be placed in a child's mouth or a child care article for \nages 3 or under.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission will convene a Chronic Hazard \nAdvisory Panel, CHAP, to fully examine the science on the effects of \nphthalates and any phthalate alternative. After this study, they will \ndetermine whether the interim ban should remain in place.\n  I believe they will find that the ban is essential to the protection \nof children's health.\n  Let me say, it is about time. The United States is often behind the \nrest of the world when it comes to chemical policy. The same has been \ntrue for phthalates. These chemicals have been restricted in at least \n31 nations, including European Union--27 countries--Argentina, Fiji, \nJapan, Korea, and Mexico.\n  It took action from three States--California, Washington and \nVermont--before we have reached this point.\n  It took voluntary action from the country's largest toy retailers: \nWal-Mart, Toys ``R'' Us, and Target, all of which have announced that \nthey will stop selling products that contain phthalates.\n  With the passage of this legislation, parents throughout this country \nwill have the same assurances as parents in the E.U., in Argentina, in \nJapan, and all of these other counties. They will be sure that the toys \nthey give their children do not contain a dangerous plasticizer.\n  And make no mistake, these chemicals are dangerous. When children \nchew on toys filled with phthalates, these chemicals leach from the \ntoy, and into their bodies. Phthalates have been linked to a variety of \nreproductive defects.\n  The science on phthalates is still evolving. But today, we are acting \nout of precaution: removing potentially dangerous substances from \nproducts until they are shown to be safe.\n  Our current system for dealing with chemicals requires that \nregulators show that a chemical is dangerous before it can be removed \nfrom the market. We have this backwards: the burden should be placed on \nthe manufacturers to prove to us that the chemicals they want to put in \neveryday items are safe. Our children should not be guinea pigs for \nuntested chemicals.\n  The interim ban on three phthalates marks a departure from this \nlongstanding ``use chemicals first, ask questions later'' approach. \nThese chemicals will be permitted back into toys only if they are \nproven to be safe, the very hallmark of the precautionary principle.\n  We need to move fully in this direction. It is my belief that \nchemical additives should not be placed in products that can impact \nhealth adversely until they are tested and found to be benign. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to see that we exercise the same \ncaution with all chemicals.\n  This is a sea change in our Nation's chemical policy, and \npredictably, we faced strong opposition from industry. Many people \ncontributed to this victory here today, and I would like to mention a \nfew.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Inouye, Senator Stevens, and Senator \nPryor for their steadfast support throughout this process.\n  This would not have been possible without my home State colleagues, \nSenator Boxer and Congressman Waxman. They supported this from the \nbeginning, and their work ensured that the best product possible \nemerged from conference.\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\n  David Strickland, Alec Hoehn-Saric, and the Commerce Committee staff \nhave been invaluable. They worked long nights and weekends to reach an \nagreement on this provision, and I appreciate it.\n  Kristin Wikelius and Chris Thompson of my staff, who quickly learned \nabout this issue and worked hard to move this through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Dozens of grassroots groups from across the country supported my \namendment and rallied their members to do the same. I will ask to have \na list of these groups printed in the Record.\n  This Coalition was led by the Breast Cancer Fund, based in my home \ncity of San Francisco. Their work, expertise, and support made this \nhappen.\n  On another matter central to children's health, I am very pleased \nthat this bill includes a provision that I sponsored to require \nsecondhand cribs that are sold and used in the marketplace to have the \nsame product safety standards as new cribs.\n  This bill will close a loophole in consumer product safety standards, \nand help reduce injuries and deaths that come from used cribs that have \nmissing or broken parts.\n  Currently, U.S. consumer product safety standards apply only to new \ncribs and not to the sale or commercial use of secondhand cribs, which \ncause most crib-related infant injuries and deaths.\n  The measure included in the conference report would prohibit \ncommercial users, such as thrift stores and resale furniture stores, to \nsell, resell or lease unsafe used cribs that are structurally unsound, \nand prohibits hotels, motels, and daycare centers from using unsafe \ncribs, and adds secondhand cribs to the list of child and infant \nproducts covered by the Consumer Product Safety Act, the law that \nalready applies to new cribs and other children's products.\n  The safety standards for secondhand cribs will now match the safety \nstandards for new cribs, including crib slats should be no more than \n2\\3/8\\ inches apart to prevent infant from slipping through the slats \nand corner posts should not be higher than 1/16 inches above the end \npanels of the crib which prevents infant's clothing from becoming \ntangled on the crib.\n  Every year, more than 11,300 children require hospital treatment from \ncrib-related injuries and over 30 children die from injuries sustained \nin cribs.\n  Most of these injuries and deaths occur in secondhand cribs that have \ndangerous features.\n  The language included in this conference report is similar to \nproposals that Representative Ellen Tauscher and I have worked on for \nmany years.\n  I am very pleased that this legislation will help give parents the \npeace of mind that secondhand cribs are just as safe as brandnew cribs.\n  The phthalate ban, the expansion of crib safety protections, and the \nentire Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act are hard-fought \nvictories for children and all of those concerned with their safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this conference report, \nand I urge the President to sign this into law the moment it lands on \nhis desk. We have waited years to take action against chemicals like \nphthalates, and we should not wait any longer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of groups supporting my \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 27, 2008.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington \n         DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Vice Chairman, Committee on Commerce Science and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington DC.\n     Hon. John Dingell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joe Barton,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, Chairman \n     Dingell, and Ranking Member Barton: The undersigned \n     organizations wish to express strong support for including \n     Senator Feinstein's amendment in the final version of the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act (CPSCA). \n     Senator Feinstein's amendment would prohibit the manufacture, \n     sale, or distribution in commerce of certain children's \n     products and child care articles that contain phthalates. By \n     eliminating unnecessary exposure to phthalates in children's \n     products, the United States would join the European Union and \n     14 separate countries in requiring the safest toys for its \n     children.\n       Over the last several decades, children have faced an \n     increasingly challenging time just making it through what \n     should be normal stages of growth and development. Of \n     particular concern are chemicals found to have negative \n     health impacts that are in products children use every day. \n     Of primary interest to the undersigned is the use of \n     phthalates, present in a variety of children's products \n     including soft plastic toys and teethers, which have been \n     linked to developmental problems, such as premature breast \n     development in girls, male genital defects, and reduced sperm \n     quality.\n       Alternatives to phthalates already exist and are on the \n     market. Some major manufacturers have already taken the \n     responsible path toward eliminating these hazards from their \n     products and major retail outlets such as Wal-Mart and Toys-\n     R-Us are requiring that the products on their shelves be \n     phthalate-free. Yet, there currently are no laws in the U.S. \n     prohibiting the use of these chemicals, and no way for \n     parents to know whether the products they buy will help--or \n     hinder--their child's development.\n       States have already started taking action on this issue. \n     California and Washington already prohibit the use of \n     phthalates in children's products and almost a dozen states \n     have introduced similar measures. It is time for the federal \n     government to ensure that children in all 50 states receive \n     protection from unsafe chemical exposures in the toys they \n     chew on and play with everyday. Several states have also \n     taken the lead on protecting the health of their citizens \n     from unsafe chemical exposures in other consumer products. \n     The undersigned organizations are especially appreciative of \n     Senator Feinstein's inclusion of a ``savings clause'' in her \n     amendment that would prevent the federal preemption of state \n     efforts to enact stricter toy protections and regulate \n     phthalates more strictly in other product categories.\n       The undersigned organizations strongly urge the CPSC \n     Conference Committee to include the Feinstein Amendment \n     prohibiting the use of phthalates in children's toys and \n     childcare articles in the reconciled version of the House/\n     Senate Consumer Product Safety Commission Reform Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       AAIDD (American Association on Intellectual and \n     Developmental Disabilities).\n       Alaska Community Action on Toxics.\n       Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.\n       AWHONN (Association of Women's Health, Obstetric & Neonatal \n     Nurses).\n       Breast Cancer Action.\n       Breast Cancer Fund.\n       Center for Environmental Health.\n       Center for Health, Environment and Justice.\n       Citizens for a Healthy Bay\n       Clean New York.\n       Clean Water Action Alliance of Massachusetts.\n       Coalition for Clean Air.\n       Commonweal.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       Consumers Union.\n       CREHM (Chicago Consortium for Reproductive Environmental \n     Health in Minority Communities).\n       EarthJustice.\n       Endometriosis Association.\n       Environment California.\n       Environmental Health Fund.\n       Environmental Working Group.\n       Greenpeace.\n       Health Education and Resources.\n       Healthy Building Network.\n       Healthy Child Healthy World.\n       Healthy Children Organizing Project.\n       Illinois Maternal and Child Health Coalition.\n       Illinois PIRG.\n       INCIID (InterNational Council on Infertility Information \n     Dissemination, Inc.).\n       INND (Institute of Neurotoxicology & Neurological \n     Disorders).\n       Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.\n       Institute for Children's Environmental Health.\n       Kids in Danger.\n       Learning Disabilities Association of America.\n       Maternal and Child Health Access.\n       Minnesota PIRG.\n       MOMS (Making Our Milk Safe).\n       MomsRising.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       Olympic Environmental Council.\n       Oregon Center for Environmental Health.\n       Oregon Environmental Council.\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility- San Francisco Bay \n     Area Chapter.\n       Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California.\n       Planned Parenthood Golden Gate.\n       Planned Parenthood of Mar Monte.\n       Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.\n       PODER (People Organized in Defense of Earth & her \n     Resources).\n       Project IRENE.\n       Public Citizen's Congress Watch.\n       RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.\n       Safe Food and Fertilizer.\n       SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective.\n       Sources for Sustainable Communities.\n       The American Fertility Association.\n       The Annie Appleseed Project.\n       US PIRG.\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\n       Washington Toxics Coalition.\n       WashPIRG.\n       WHEN (Women's Health & Environmental Network).\n\n\n                        WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Arkansas. The whistleblower protection provision \nis an enforcement cornerstone of this legislation because it creates a \nlegal right for private employees to help enforce consumer protection \nlaws. It is important to underscore the Senate's intent that this \nprovision builds upon ``best practices'' in whistleblower laws.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is correct. The whistleblower provision should be \ninterpreted broadly and consistent with ``best practices'' to achieve \nthe law's purpose. For instance, ``employee'' is defined broadly to \ninclude individuals in any dimension of the employment concept: \nincumbent or former employees. It protects all individuals who have \nreceived compensation to engage in activities for which the corporation \nis responsible. The law's purpose may not be circumvented by hair-\nsplitting interpretations that plug safe channels for witnesses to \ndisclose relevant evidence of safety hazards.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Furthermore, it is not Congress's intent to \nsubstitute these whistleblower protections for other preexisting rights \nand remedies against unfair employment practices.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes. Consistent with long-established Supreme Court case \nlaw see e.g., English v. General Electric, 496 U.S. 270, 1990--these \nrights do not cancel or replace preexisting remedies, whether under \nother overlapping congressional statutes, State laws, State tort claims \nor collective bargaining agreements.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Companies should also not look to override the \nwhistleblower protections through nondisclosure policies or agreements \nsuch as company manuals, prerequisites for employment or exit \nagreements.\n  Mr. PRYOR. There should be no confusion that the rights for protected \nactivity created by this statute are the law of the land. They \nsupersede and cannot be canceled or overridden by any conflicting \nrestrictions in company manuals, employment contracts, or exit or \nnondisclosure agreements.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Thank you for engaging in this colloquy with me to \nreaffirm the rights conveyed in the whistleblower provision. This \nprovision is one of many in this legislation that reflects on the skill \nyou have demonstrated in guiding this bill through the Congress.\n\n\n                               preemption\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I rise to discuss with Senator Pryor, the distinguished \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Insurance, and \nAutomotive Safety, and lead sponsor of the Senate legislation, the \npreemptive effect of certain provisions in H.R. 4040.\n  I am pleased that the bill protects State warning laws related to \nconsumer products or substances, such as California's Proposition 65. \nThe conference report clarifies that any such warning laws in effect as \nof August 31, 2003, are not preempted by this act or the Federal \nHazardous Substances Act. This important clarification effectively \nharmonizes the four statutes that are enforced by the Commission. Other \nlaws enforced by CPSC, including the Consumer Product Safety Act, \nclearly do not preempt or affect State warning requirements like \nProposition 65. The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, however, is \narguably ambiguous as to its effect on State warning requirements. I am \npleased that we have eliminated this ambiguity with this conference \nreport and harmonized all of the Commission's statutes on this point.\n  I yield to Senator Pryor, and ask: Is it also your understanding that \nnothing in this legislation or any of the laws enforced by the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission will preempt or affect Proposition 65 in any \nway?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, that is my understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My second inquiry relates to the bill's provisions on \nphthalates. I am pleased that the language preserves the ability of \nStates to regulate phthalates in product classes that are not regulated \nunder this legislation, as well as States' ability to regulate \nalternatives to phthalates, such as other chemical plasticizers that \nmight be used as substitutes to the phthalates that will be removed \nfrom toys under this law. I yield to Senator Pryor and ask, is it your \nunderstanding this law does not preempt or affect States' authority to \nregulate any alternatives to phthalates that are not specifically \nregulated by the Commission in a consumer product safety standard?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, that is my understanding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also ask the distinguished floor manager Senator Pryor \nto confirm my understanding that the third-party testing provisions of \nthe conference report have no preemptive effect on State or local \ntesting related requirements. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, the bill leaves such authority to impose testing \nrequirements in place without preemption.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Finally, I wanted to confirm my understanding that the \nconference report makes it clear in section 106(h)(2) that State or \nlocal toy and children's product requirements in effect prior to \nenactment of this bill are not preempted by this legislation or by the \nConsumer Product Safety Act. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. PRYOR. My colleague is correct. The legislation does not preempt \nor otherwise affect State or political subdivision requirements \napplicable to a toy or other children's product that is designed to \ndeal with the same risk of injury as the consumer product safety \nstandard, if such State or political subdivision has filed such \nrequirement with the Commission within 90 days after the date of \nenactment of this act.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield now to the author of the measure, \nSenator Pryor of Arkansas, the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the first thing I want to say is this is a \ngreat bill. It is something every Senator should be proud of, because \nwhat we saw in 2007 was a record number of product recalls. In fact, \nlast year, there were 45 million toys that were recalled. Every single \ntoy was made in China that was recalled last year.\n  Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there. In 2008, we are 29 percent \nahead of the schedule we set back in 2007. So this problem is not going \naway. This is a great bill, and this is a classic example that \nbipartisanship works.\n  We did this bill the way bills ought to be done. We worked it out in \ncommittee. I see that Senator Stevens walked onto the floor. He played \na vital and important role in the committee process and afterward. We \nworked together with Democrats and Republicans, and the House worked \nwith the Senate. It has been a great example of how things can and \nshould work around here.\n  We added third-party testing for toys. We added a new database for \npeople to search to look at complaints about products. We give the \nAttorney General the ability to follow what the CPSC has done and get \ndangerous products off the shelves. We add whistleblower protection, so \nif people in the private sector know about a dangerous problem and \nreveal that, they don't lose their jobs. We increase civil penalties to \nmake sure these companies--especially the ones who are repeat \noffenders--will know the CPSC has the authority to enforce what they do \nand make them feel the pain of that. We ban lead in children's \nproducts.\n  We move the commission, which used to be a five-member commission and \nis now down to three, back to a five-member commission.\n  We change the rulemaking process so that the authority rests with the \nCPSC again and not with the industry.\n  I could go on and on about the great things in this legislation. I \nknow my time is short. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to make sure I thank the people who \ndeserve the lion's share of the credit. Senator Stevens was critical. \nHe came in at a very important time, early in the process, and helped \nshape the bill and helped to get us from a Democratic bill to a \nbipartisan bill that got us to where we are today. In fact, the House \nvoted last night 424 to 1 to pass this.\n  I also thank Senators Sununu and Hutchison. Senator Inouye, chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, was fantastic. Senator Boxer was great; she\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nwas very focused on several issues. Senator Klobuchar, although a new \nSenator, had a positive impact on the process. It was an honor to work \nwith them. Also I thank several House Members, of course, including \nChairman Dingell and Congressman Barton, fantastic partners over there, \nwho worked hard to get this done. And also Speaker Pelosi weighed in at \nthe end to make sure we got it done.\n  Maybe more important than all of us is the staff. We have a lot of \nstaff sitting on the back benches. They have spent countless hours on \nthis bill. They have been here weekends, in the evenings, and they have \nbeen haggling over every word, comma, and paragraph. I am so grateful \nto all of them.\n  The people on my staff include Andy York and Price Feland. When you \nlook at the Commerce Committee, there is David Strickland, Alex Hoehn-\nSaric, Jana Fong Swamidoss, Mia Petrini, and Jared Bomberg. They were \ngreat. Of course, on the Republican side are Paul Nagle and his team, \nincluding Megan Beechener, Becky Hooks, Bridget Petruczok, Erik Olson, \nKate Nilan, Tamara Fucile, Brian Hendricks, and Peter Phipps.\n  Also, I thank the CPSC commission. They helped as did their staff. \nCommissioner Moore, and Michael Gougisha and Pam Weller of his staff, \nas well as Jack Horner of the acting chairman's staff, all of these \npeople played a key role in getting us to this very good bipartisan \npiece of legislation.\n  As I said, this is something of which the Senate and House can be \nvery proud. Today, the White House announced they will sign the \nlegislation. This is a major victory for the American people. Again, we \nfollowed the rules, we followed the correct process here. We got this \ndone and we are going to make a big difference in the American \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I will turn it over to my colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas. \nFirst, I have to say he was dogged in his determination to work out \nthis bill. It was a very long conference, with many issues. It was \ncomplicated. The importance of it was paramount in both of our minds.\n  I also want to say that on something this hard, the leadership of our \ncommittee was the driving force. Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, \nthe chairman and vice chairman of our committee, worked so hard, along \nwith their staffs, to make sure the process kept going, that we never \ngave up. The conference lasted for months. I cannot say enough about \nSenator Inouye and Senator Stevens and the partnership on this \ncommittee that produced this great bill.\n  Then Senator Pryor and Senator Sununu, chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, also worked diligently and hard to make sure we took \neveryone's views into consideration. We tried to make compromises, even \non some of the very toughest issues. That was just in the Senate. And \nthen we also had the House. I feel very good about this result.\n  Again, the approval of this bill by very diverse groups shows this is \na very good bill. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Consumer \nFederation of America, and the Retail Industry Leaders Association all \nwere at the table working with us to try to make sure we accommodated \nthe safety needs of consumers--especially the parents of small \nchildren--and the needs of retailers and manufacturers to be able to \nproduce products that consumers can safely purchase.\n  In this bill, we have a considerable emphasis on children's toys. \nThat is what caused us to start looking at whether we had enough \nmanpower in the Consumer Product Safety Commission. So I think \nchildren's toys are a very big part of the emphasis in this bill.\n  Let me talk about another few points in the bill. We authorize \nsignificant upgrading and modernization of the equipment and labs used \nby the commission to provide for more personnel, including more \npersonnel at ports of entry and in foreign countries, to improve \ninspection of manufacturing facilities abroad and the products brought \ninto our country from abroad.\n  We establish the most comprehensive lead safety standards that we \nhave seen to date for toys and the paint manufacturers use on toys. \nThese standards are implemented responsibly to give manufacturers time \nto adapt, without compromising safety. The standards also allow for use \nof alternative detection and measurement methods to improve the \naccuracy and efficiency of testing paint on small surfaces.\n  We also strengthen enforcement by increasing civil and criminal \npenalties and providing a limited role for State attorneys general to \nwork in concert with the commission to enforce commission actions in \nthe States. This is a huge improvement--one that Senator Pryor, a \nformer attorney general, was very aware that we could have better \ninformation, because the attorneys general in all of the States know, \nperhaps more urgently and more rapidly, when a product is deficient. So \nwhen they can step in and take an action based on the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission regulations, that is very helpful to expanding the \nreach.\n  We can also point to other areas where we made compromises. The \nbottom line is this is a very good bill. Maybe you don't like \neverything in it. I agree. I didn't get everything I wanted in the \nconference, nor did anyone else. But as I said, this was a months-long \nconference committee. It was a bill that passed the Senate with many \namendments.\n  The Senate bill was vastly improved in the conference. We could not \nhave done that without many hours--and weekend hours--of staff support. \nThe Senator from Arkansas pointed out the number of staff who did such \na great job. I want to say that on our side, Christine Kurth, Paul \nNagle, Megan Beechener, Rebecca Hooks, and my own staffer, Bryan \nHendricks, did a great job of working with the Democratic staff to \nforge the compromises.\n  On the Democratic side, I thank David Strickland, Andy York, Price \nFeland, and Jana Fong Swamidoss. I think we did a great job with the \nhelp of the experts on our staffs.\n  Mr. President, with that, I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Senator Hutchison said something that is \nvery important. We did focus on toys. Toys capture the imagination of \nthe American public because no parent or grandparent wants to buy \nsomething and give it to a young child which could harm or, in some \ncases, kill them. That is the type of thing that grabs the headlines. \nLet me tell you, a couple of levels deeper, one of the ways we make \ntoys safer for kids all over this country. What we did in this \nlegislation is we established a statutory toy standard. Once we have \nthat standard, and allow the CPSC to modify it over time, once that is \nin the statutes, that means we can test for that standard.\n  This bill has mandatory toy testing. For the first time ever, we are \ngoing to test these toys to make sure they meet the U.S. safety \nstandards before they are ever sold in the marketplace.\n  If you think about a recall, a recall is a very uneconomical--I will \nuse that term--and inefficient way to find a dangerous product. So the \nmanufacturer comes over here with a product--many cases from overseas--\nand it is distributed, sold, and it injures someone, and the recall \nhappens, and these products are all over America. We are streamlining \nit and making our marketplace more efficient and better for people all \nover this country.\n  I will end where I started. I see Senator Sununu here, who played a \nvery key role. All of the Senators helped in some ways. Again, I will \nend where I started, and that is that this is a great piece of \nlegislation. It really is. The American people will be so pleased with \nthe work we have done to get this passed and get the President to sign \nit. It will make a big difference in everyone's lives all over this \ncountry. Again, it shows what we can do if we work together to solve \nour problems.\n  I am very honored and privileged to have Senator Inouye designate me \nas the lead guy on our side to do this, and to watch Senators Stevens \nand Inouye work together. They set the pace on this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 4040.

Mr. President, the Republican leader and I have had a \nnumber of conversations today. We know the caucuses on his side and my \nside are tired. We have had a very difficult few weeks. We have a few \nmore things to do this work period. That work period can be a matter of \nhours or it could be the next day.\n  Most would like to finish it tonight. If we could move up the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to the Defense authorization bill, we \ncould do that tonight. The issue, it turns out now, is how long that \ndebate would take. On our side we need 10 minutes. Senator Levin wanted \na half-hour. He cut that back to 10 minutes.\n  If we could have some agreement on the other side that we could take \n10, 5 minutes, whatever is appropriate, we could finish that tonight \nand basically finish the work of the Senate for this work period and \ncome back, renew our struggles in September.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we move to the Defense authorization \nbill, that the motion to invoke cloture on that that was set for the \nmorning, that we would do that following 10 minutes of debate \ncontrolled by the Senator from Michigan. The chairman of the committee \nwould control 10 minutes, and whomever the Republican leader designates \non his side would control whatever time they feel appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, the majority \nleader, we are prepared to vote right now.\n  A number of Members are prepared to have a vote immediately. I think \nwe all understand what we are voting on. I am not sure many of our \nMembers think any further debate about the whole issue of whether to go \nto the Defense bill at this particular time would be enlightened by any \nadditional debate.\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\n  We have a number of Members who have plans who know how to vote and \nwould be happy to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bill is worth spending 10 minutes on \ntonight. This is the Defense authorization bill. For heavens' sake, can \nwe not set aside the frustrations we all have on this other issue and \nat least support our troops and come together and unify behind our \ntroops?\n  Can we not at least set a time to take up the Defense authorization \nbill, which is critically important? We cannot do this on the \nappropriations bill. It would be legislating on an appropriations bill. \nThis is a pay increase, special benefits, the BRAC implementation. This \nhas to do with whether families are going to get support, whether we \nare going to hire nurses. This is the men and women in uniform who are \nin harm's way.\n  The suggestion is, we cannot spend 10 minutes to debate on whether to \ntake up an authorization bill. We have never not passed an \nauthorization bill. By law, we must pass an authorization bill or else \nall the authorities which are critically important to the men and women \nin uniform are not going to be passed.\n  This cannot just be another vote, another vote which divides us \nRepublicans from Democrats. We have to unify behind this bill. Senator \nWarner and I and the members of the Armed Services Committee have \nworked month after month after month to get this bill up. This bill has \nbeen on the calendar for 3 months.\n  If we do not decide to take up this bill or have a place fixed to \ntake up this bill when we get back, we are going to have 3 weeks of an \nongoing debate on a critically important subject, I agree, energy, but \nthen we will never get to the men and women in uniform.\n  This is not our bill. This is their bill. Let's vote to take it up \nand set a place, a firm place, where we can protect the men and women \nin uniform. They are overstretched. The equipment is running out. It is \nworn out. We owe them this. Set aside these differences for a few \nminutes, just a few minutes, and agree to take up this bill.\n  If we cannot take it up now, fix a time when we can take it up. That \nis my plea. I know Senator Warner will join in this plea. This cannot \nbe a partisan vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I do not know if the Senator took 10 minutes, but I think \nwe heard the speech.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May Senator Warner be recognized for a few minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think the majority leader made a good \npoint. I think we have heard the speech. Of course, we will not be \npassing the bill before recess. This vote will be about whether we stay \non the No. 1 subject in America and whether we then do the Defense \nbill.\n  It appears to me as if we have had the suggestion, and I say to my \ngood friend, the majority leader, why do we not now have the vote?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think that is appropriate, and I ask \nconsent from everyone here that Senator Warner have a few minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. I do \nhope I can say one word. To my leadership, I have explained to you I \nwill soon conclude 30 years in this Chamber.\n  Having served with 264 Senators in that period of time, I say thanks \nto each and every one of them. But in that period, I think half my time \nhas been devoted to issues relating to national security and the Armed \nServices. I checked the records of the committee. We have had 42 \nconsecutive bills authorizing funds for the armed services of the \nUnited States. This will be the 30th of those bills that I have \nparticipated in, in bringing to the floor and, hopefully, getting a \nstrong endorsement of this body.\n  I fully recognize the issues my colleagues have foremost in their \nmind at this moment. Not a one of them is against our national defense, \nnot a one of them by their votes now could be challenged as to their \npatriotism and devotion to the men and women of the Armed Forces of \nthis country.\n  But I will vote to go forth now, in an effort to support the cloture \nmotion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, our good friend, Senator \nWarner, has, of course, been a leader on this issue throughout his \ntenure in the Senate, and we respect his views. He has been a strong \nsupporter of a strong national defense.\n  But the issue before us tonight is whether we are going to continue \nto try to solve the No. 1 issue in the country, and that is the price \nof gas at the pump. It is not whether we will do a Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee shares my view, \nthat the first thing we ought to do is stay on the subject of energy, \nstay on the subject of getting the price of gas at the pump down, and \nthen do the Defense authorization bill.\n  I am authorized to speak on behalf of the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, our colleague, Senator McCain, who shares my view \nthat at this particular moment, the most important issue related to the \nnational security of our country is to stay on the subject of energy, \nfinish the job, and then, as Senator Warner and Senator Levin have \nsuggested, do the job of passing the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a unanimous consent pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of a unanimous \nconsent request for the Midwestern flood tax relief bill sponsored by \nthe Senators of several Midwestern States, including Senator Harkin of \nmy State, Senator Durbin, Senator Obama of Illinois, and other \nmidwestern Senators.\n  I rise to seek fairness and equity for people in the Midwest who have \nbeen hurt by floods, and I would say fairness and equity as measured by \nhow Congress responded to the natural disaster of Katrina, New Orleans, \net cetera.\n  I remember back in September of 2005, after that terrible catastrophe \nof August 29, what happened in New Orleans. Within the week after we \nwere in session, after Labor Day, we had appropriated $60 billion. \nWithin 3 weeks after that--I was chairman of the Finance Committee--we \nvoted out of committee a tax equity bill that changed provisions of the \nTax Code to encourage employers and businesses and people to stay there \nand weather it out.\n  What we did, we did without asking any questions. And now we seek the \nsame tax relief for the States of the Midwest that have had the same \ntype of catastrophe happen to them. I would measure catastrophe by a \n500-year flood in the city of Cedar Rapids, IA, which won't be the same \nas it was prior to the flood.\n\n  So we have entered this legislation for consideration. We have worked \nit out with a lot of people who were involved in it. We worked closely \nwith Senator Baucus's staff, with the staff of Ways and Means, trying \nto satisfy\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\neverybody. We think we have a consensus.\n  Here it is, 6 weeks after the floods hit, and Congress has not acted. \nCongress should act. In other words, shouldn't the people hurt by the \nnatural disaster of the Midwest have the same consideration as the \npeople of New Orleans and those with other catastrophes? We are not \ngetting it. It is very clear that when our disaster is not on \ntelevision for 2 months in a row, like the disaster of New Orleans was \non television for 2 months in a row, somehow Congress is absentminded \nabout what happened in the Midwest.\n  So we face things like arguments from staff of some of the people in \nthe other body that, well, this disaster wasn't anything like what \nhappened in Katrina or you hear things like, well, we need to offset \nthis bill. When I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the \npeople in New Orleans were hurting, we did not ask for offsets. We did \nnot play political games with the legislation we eventually passed, \nlike some efforts this Midwest Tax Flood Relief Act ought to be \nconnected with extenders or with AMT or something like that. We got the \njob done. We didn't worry about it.\n  I come before this body tonight to ask for consideration of this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3322\n\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance \nbe discharged from further consideration of S. 3322 and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Grassley amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that the bill be held at the \ndesk pending House action on the companion measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am \nspeaking on behalf of Senator Baucus. I note that the Senator from Iowa \nrealizes the bill that was before us yesterday, S. 3335, would not only \nhave taken care of his State of Iowa, which truly deserves disaster \nassistance, but also my State of Illinois and all of the States that \nfaced that disaster problem this year. Unfortunately, it did not pass; \notherwise, it would have been on its way to the House yesterday. Had we \nreceived more than five Republican votes, it might have passed the \nHouse and be on its way to the President. But the decision was made on \nthe Republican side of the aisle not to vote for that measure that \nwould have helped Iowa, Illinois, and all of the States.\n  The measure Senator Grassley brings before us leaves behind victims \nof disasters in States of Nevada, Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, \nMississippi, Tennessee, and Texas--to name a few--who would receive no \nrelief under Senator Grassley's bill but would have under the bill he \nopposed. So it is sad. I wish this could have been resolved yesterday \nwith the vote if the Republicans would have joined us. Unfortunately, \nthey did not. We will have to take this matter up when we return. I \nhope we can find a way to help all of the victims, not just in the \nMidwest but all across the country, which is the tradition of the \nSenate and the House. Regretfully, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I point out that what the Senator from \nIllinois described is an amendment that would not have responded to the \nMidwest in exactly the same way as we responded to Katrina. It would \nnot have been as beneficial. It also did not contain the same 25 \nprovisions we did for New Orleans, which were in that tax bill to help \nthem.\n  I think we have a situation where we ought to respond the same way we \ndid for Katrina. We are not doing it because the disaster in the \nMidwest is as bad. When we thought about Katrina, we didn't argue with \nother people about going back and taking care of disasters that \npreviously happened. We took care of what was before us.\n  Right now, the flood of the Midwest is before us, and we ought to \nhave the same equity and fairness that, when we had a Republican \nCongress, we gave to New Orleans. Whether we have a Democratic Congress \nor a Republican Congress, that should not make any difference. We are \nbeing treated differently when the Democrats control the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor about 7 minutes. I will try to do it in less time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the majority whip for being on the \nfloor tonight. I am one of the reasons why he is here, so I beg his \nindulgence at this time.\n  The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act was first introduced \nin the 109th Congress. The Republican sponsor at that time on our side \nof the aisle agreed to the offsets in that bill. That wasn't agreed to \nby the other side, so that bill wasn't passed. Although the offsets \nwere accepted, it was still opposed.\n  Over the past 5 months, two press conferences have highlighted my \n``obstruction'' of this bill and questioned my motives for holding it. \nI sent two letters to the prime sponsors of the bill and to the \nmajority leader offering to negotiate a compromise on the bill. None of \nthose were ever responded to. No sponsor ever contacted my office in \nthe 110th Congress to try to work on this. Instead, I chose to work, \nbecause I couldn't get a response, with Alvin Sykes, a wonderfully \nincredible man, who is behind this bill. He has my utmost respect and \nadmiration.\n  I will submit for the Record an article dealing with his incredible \nlife story and his commitment and arduous work for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I reached a compromise with Mr. Sykes and the Emmett \nTill Campaign for Justice, whose board of directors has endorsed our \ncompromise language.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an e-mail we got from Mr. Sykes be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Alvin Sykes.\n     To: Bacak, Brooke.\n     Sent: Thu July 31, 2008.\n\n       Dear Senator Coburn:, First allow me to extend our \n     appreciation and admiration for you and your staff's \n     assistance and communication with us concerning S. 535 the \n     Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. While we still \n     believe that the hold that you placed on our bill was not the \n     good way to effect the institutional change in the manner \n     that the United States Senate does business we do appreciate \n     the open lines of communications and respect that your staff, \n     in particular Brooke Basak and Tim Tardibono, have shown us \n     in negotiating with us on proposed language and conditions \n     that would address your concern and minimize the loss we have \n     suffered from going this route. Therefore our Board of \n     Directors has voted to endorse a unanimous consent agreement \n     that would include the latest draft language that rectifies \n     the concerns with the controversy over the Attorney having \n     authority to reprogram funds from one congressionally \n     directed fund to another by elleviating all reference to \n     reprogramming and replaced with prioritizing spending request \n     if Congress does not fully fund the Till Bill. Furthermore we \n     support you having the right to submit this language as \n     amendment in the cloture vote process as long as the floor \n     debate time is limited and that you would not replace your \n     hold on our bill if your amendment fails. Nothing in this \n     request is meant to criticize the Senate Leadership on the \n     enormous work that they have done to craft and advocate for \n     the passage of this bill especially the good work of Patrick \n     Grant in Senator Dodd's office and Darrell Thompson in Senate \n     Majority leader Harry Reid who has kept hope alive on this \n     historic bill. However we firmly believe that truth and \n     justice can be best achieved by opening and maintaining \n     effective lines of communication and searching for a win-win \n     justice seeking solution. We further believe that since you \n     started this by placing your hold on our bill you should be \n     the one to finish it.\n       Therefore the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, Inc. request \n     that you make an overture to the Democratic Leadership and \n     the sponsors of the Till Bill by introducing the Emmett Till \n     Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, as proposed amended, under \n     the unanimous consent agreement outlined above tonight in the \n     interest of time, truth and justice.\n       Sincerely, in the pursuit of justice,\n           I am,\n\n                                                  Alvin Sykes,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                Emmett Till Justice Campaign, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7882-S7883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUESTS\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent to \ncall up and pass the modified Emmett Till Unresolved Civil Rights Crime \nAct, where it is paid for by taking money that is not appropriated. \nThis is the problem everybody had, not offsetting. What this bill will \ndo is, if we don't appropriate--and we won't this year, because we are \ngoing to have a continuing resolution--this will allow that money to be \ndivided out in three categories in the Justice Department, which the \nJustice Department is accepting from both legal salaries, the FBI, and \nthe U.S. Marshals--all the people working on these unresolved civil \nrights cases. I ask unanimous consent that it be called up and passed \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, earlier \nthis week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, we considered a package of bills, \nsome 35 bills that had been held for a lengthy period of time--for \nmonths--which could have been considered, amended, changed, and brought \nforward. They were held with no chance for any kind of movement. This \nwas one of them.\n  Sadly, this is a bill that has been considered and passed by the \nHouse of Representatives and has been out there for more than a year. I \nwould like to see the bill passed--I would. But the fact that the \nSenator from Oklahoma worked out his differences with some person, as \nwell intentioned as it may be, doesn't escape the reality that this \nbill has been the subject of hard work by a lot of Senators and \nCongressmen. Unfortunately, it was subjected to a hold by a Member on \nthe Republican side. I hope that, in good faith, when we return, we can \nreturn to this bill. I would like to see this and all 35 bills in the \npackage passed and taken as seriously as the Senator from Oklahoma is \nnow taking this bill.\n  Unfortunately, at this moment, I must object.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is sad to note that this could not pass \ntonight. We could accomplish what everybody claims to want. The fact \nthat nobody was willing to work on this bill, but held it without \ncompromise and without offsets, it is the same issue again. We are \ngoing to grow the Government and not get rid of waste. There is $2 \nbillion in waste a year in the Justice Department. Yet we are going to \ngrow this program and not pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I also note for the Record that I spoke with Senator Dodd \nabout the bill tonight. He had no objection whatsoever and he agreed \nwith the compromise. He is the chief sponsor on that side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I call up and ask unanimous consent to pass a \ncompromise bill on child exploitation. The bill, S. 3344, is the \nProtecting Children from Pornography and Internet Exploitation Act of \n2008.\n  I had a conversation with Senator Biden this evening. He is in full \nagreement with this. He understands that others on his side of the \naisle might not be in agreement. He is the chief sponsor of that bill. \nOur bill gives everything that was included, plus the SAFE Act, which \neverybody agrees needs to be a part of any approach we make. The \nauthors on the other side of the aisle took a $1.3 billion \nauthorization and compromised and lowered that. We compromised by \naccepting that spending on the basis that we would add the SAFE Act to \nit. This bill has been changed in substance in no way other than that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be called up and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, This is another bill of \nthe 35 that have been held for an indefinite period of time by the \nRepublican side of the aisle. We offered a package which had included \nmeasures for medical research, which has been held for an indefinite \nperiod of time on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  This bill which, ironically, was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, which Senator Coburn and I both serve on--I believe it was \nreported unanimously--is a bill that deals with child exploitation. I \nbelieve it is a bill that deals with Internet pornography, if I am not \nmistaken. It is something which should have not only gone out of \ncommittee unanimously, but it should not have been subject to the holds \non the Republican side of the aisle for reasons that are not explicit. \nIn desperation, an effort was made to bring these to the floor and ask \nfor a bipartisan response and to pass them in a timely way. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma voted against that, as did most of the Senators on his \nside.\n  Many are now coming to the floor trying to revive the bills they \nvoted against a couple days ago. I wish the same level of interest and \neffort would have been taken during the period when these bills \nlanguished subject to their hold. At the last minute, virtually right \nafter the Senate has adjourned and left, it is not fair to bring these \nup. I hope we can do this as soon as we return.\n  At this moment, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an extension \nof my time as I go through the rest of these. I will be as brief as \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I also note, again, there were hard efforts to work this \nout. The fact is, the majority has decided that all the bills will be \nin one package, regardless of the efforts we have worked on.\n  I also make the statement that this came out by a voice vote from the \nCommittee. I didn't vote ``yes'' on the bill in the committee. No. 2, \nthere is no requirement that a Senator, even if he votes for a bill in \ncommittee and is assured he can work on the bill after the committee, \nis obligated to support a bill that comes out of his committee.\n  The next unanimous consent request I have is on this same bill, S. \n3344, titles I and IV, which include the PROTECT Act and the SAFE Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those two sections be called up and \npassed. They are identical; nothing has changed and there is nothing \ncontroversial. Again, I ask unanimous consent that they be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I understand the \nembarrassment and pain the Senator feels having voted on these bills--\n--\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, shouldn't an objection to the bill be \nstated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is no embarrassment or any pain on \nmy part to try to do this. I have worked on these bills to try to do \nwhat I thought was right. I reject any statement that I am embarrassed. \nI have no pain about this. I am proud of the work I have done in trying \nto stop excessive spending and when we have appropriate programs to \nfavor that spending through offsets of other wasteful spending.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up and pass subtitle D of S. 3297, \nthe Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act. This was never held by \nanybody on our side. It was never objected to by anybody on our side. \nThere was never a hold and never an objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent right now that we pass that one bill. Even if \nyou want to play politics, the point is, here is one we can do tonight. \nNobody has ever objected to it in the Senate. We can pass and still \nhave the 34 or 33 bills. Here is one we can make a difference with \ntonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up and pass this item.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, this was part of the 34, \n35 bills in a package that was held. For reasons I cannot explain, some \nMember on the Republican side did hold it. That is why it was put in \nthe package.\n  The Senator voted against the package, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up and \npass subtitle E of S. 3297, the Enhancing the\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nEffective Prosecution of Child Pornography Act. This is a bill that \nalso was never held on our side of the aisle.\n  Again, I make the same argument that, in fact, we can do something \ntonight. There is no controversy surrounding this bill, no controversy \nabout what we should be doing. I ask unanimous consent that we pass \nthis item.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, same argument, same \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the majority whip for his patience \nin dealing with this business tonight.\n  I will end my remarks with the following: What we have had in the \nSenate this past week is an attempt to change the Senate to the House. \nThe Senate's tradition is debate and amend. Every one of the bills I \nhave had a hold on, I proudly hold those bills. I have notified \neveryone involved in the legislation on why I was holding those bills. \nThe fact that we had no response to negotiate any sort of compromise \nwhatsoever on those bills tells us there was no good intent in the \nfirst place to try to pass those bills.\n  Let the record show that the Emmett Till bill could have been passed \ntonight, supported by the very people who started this bill in the \nfirst place, who started the effort to get it passed, who endorsed our \nefforts and, in fact, it was denied.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me just say I do respect the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. He and I have worked together. I do respect the fact \nthat when he puts a hold on a bill, he is public about it. There are \nmany people who sneak around here who hold legislation and hope they \nwill never be discovered. Senator Coburn from Oklahoma does not take \nthat position. I respect him for that. I may disagree with him on many \nsubstantive issues, and we do disagree, but I do respect him for his \napproach.\n  Let's be very honest about this situation. These 35 bills are bills \nwe wanted to pass. They are bills passed out of committee. They are \nbills sponsored by Democrats and Republicans. They are bills we tried \nto bring up by unanimous consent that were held by the Republican side \nof the aisle. In our frustration over these holds, we packaged them \ntogether and asked Republicans to join us and pass them in a bipartisan \nway.\n  Each and every one of these bills had virtual unanimous affirmation \nin the committees to which they were referred, and most of them had \npassed overwhelmingly with bipartisan votes in the House.\n  But now we have a situation where individual Senators--and it is the \nright of every one of us as Senators--are deciding: I will just take a \ncluster of these bills and hang on to them. I will let my staffers look \nthem over. We will get back to you in a few weeks, maybe a few months, \nmaybe never. That abuses the process.\n  I believe if someone has a serious problem with a bill, has a \nmisgiving, they should announce their hold and the reason for the hold, \nand, I guess, out of respect for the sponsor, to go forward and explain \nwhat the problem is. If it can be resolved, fine, and if it cannot be, \nso be it.\n  I also want to say this: What is wrong with calling up these bills \nand those who don't like them voting against them? That is their right \nto express their displeasure on the record. But to hold the bill--if I \ncan't have it my way, no one gets a chance to vote--I think pushes it \nto the extreme. To do that occasionally in your senatorial career, I \ncan understand. But to make that the business of the Senate is to \nguarantee total frustration.\n  Today in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I couldn't help but \ninterrupt the proceedings and ask what the point was of deliberating on \nbills if some of the same Senators who were going to vote for those \nbills out of committee were going to hold them once they came to the \nfloor and really make sure they never had a chance to be passed into \nlaw. That is fact. That is what has happened.\n  Because of the pain that has been caused by these earlier votes where \nRepublicans have come to us privately and said: We are sorry we voted \nthis way; some of these bills are bills we really wanted to vote for, \nnow they have come to the floor and tried to pick them off one at a \ntime and reduce the pain and--I will use the word ``embarrassment,'' \nalthough Senator Coburn says neither applies to him. I think for some \nof his colleagues there is embarrassment that they would vote against a \nbill to establish a national registry for victims of Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, that they would put a hold on a bill that was designed to deal \nwith paralysis, the Christopher Reeve bill, in an attempt to honor this \nman and all he did and try to help quadriplegics across the country; a \nbill cosponsored by Senator Cochran and Senator Kennedy to deal with \nstroke victims, that they would put a hold on that; a hold on a bill in \nwhich I have a great interest dealing with postpartum depression.\n  The belief on that side of the aisle is, it is all right; we can hold \nthem until they are exactly the way we want. That has gone on too long, \nfor months and even longer.\n  When it comes to some of these bills relating to criminal sections, \nsome of these should be passed in a hurry. I don't know any one of us \nwho does not want to deal with Internet pornography that threatens our \nchildren and grandchildren, kids in our communities. We had this bill \nready to go. This bill should have been passed quickly, and it was held \non the Republican side of the aisle until we had to bring it up in this \npackage and then voted against, voted not to bring it forward.\n  In their frustration, they have now tried to come out at the close of \nthe week and have something to point to: I tried to come back on the \nfloor, I tried to bring the bill up, but Democrats objected. The true \nstory is those bills have been held up for months. They have been held \nup on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I sure hope my colleagues will understand they cannot run the Senate \nthe way each one wants to run it. We cannot let every single Senator \ndecide the agenda of this Senate or it will be dysfunctional and \nchaotic and many good pieces of legislation will never see the light of \nday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7883-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, St. Ignatius High School is a private, Roman \nCatholic, Jesuit high school for young men located in Cleveland, OH. \nThe school is renowned for its high standards of academic excellence, \nwith nearly 100 percent of its graduates attending colleges and \nuniversities within one year of graduation.\n  Under the leadership of Rev. Tim Kesicki, S.J., and his predecessor, \nFr. Robert J. Welsh, S.J., this high school works hard to produce \nstudents who are open to growth, intellectually competent, loving, \nreligious, and committed to doing justice. In summary, a St. Ignatius \nstudent is a ``man for others.''\n  Each year, Saint Ignatius High School presents its annual John V. \nCorrigan '38 Distinguished Alumnus Award to a graduate with notable \nachievements who has used his talents and skills for those in need, \nconsistent with the paramount objective of Jesuit education the \nformation of ``Men for Others.'' The award recognizes an accomplished \ngraduate who serves as a positive role model for the students of St. \nIgnatius High School.\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\n  I am quite proud and most pleased to announce that the 2008 John V. \nCorrigan '38 Distinguished Alumnus Award was presented to the one of \nthe Senate's very own, Mr. Terrence E. Sauvain, who currently serves in \nmy office of the President pro tempore as a senior advisor.\n  I have been very fortunate to have had Terry as a member of my staff \nfor so many years. In every task I have asked him to undertake, \nincluding 2 years of service as the secretary to the minority leader, \nTerry has performed his duties with courtesy, dedication, efficiency, \nand diligence. In every position, he has gone above and beyond the call \nof duty in performing the work of the Senate, assisting my \nrepresentation of the people of West Virginia, and serving the best \ninterests of the Nation, and for all this, I am truly grateful.\n  Terry Sauvain also served as the 14th staff director of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, since the committee was formed in 1867. In \nthis role, Terry directed a great team of professional analysts with a \ngoal of ``sharpening the issues'' so that Senators were able to make \nbipartisan, responsible, and fiscally prudent decisions on Federal \nGovernment spending amounting to $1 trillion per year. Terry's \noutstanding service to the Senate has earned him a variety of honors, \nincluding the Nyumbani Medallion of Hope for his work supporting me in \nthe humanitarian fight to bring relief to children with HIV/AIDS in \nAfrica.\n  I heartily congratulate Terry Sauvain and his family on his receipt \nof this award.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in the most recent \nissue of St. Ignatius Magazine concerning this award be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Terrence Sauvain Honored for Distinguished Public Service\n\n                            (By Paris Wolfe)\n\n       This past February, Terrence Sauvain '58 received The \n     Honorable John V. Corrigan '38 Distinguished Alumnus Award \n     for notable achievements in his profession.\n       During the selection process, the award committee asked \n     former award recipient Fr. Thomas Acker, S.J., '47, about \n     Sauvain. ``He was glowing about Terry, and all he's done,'' \n     says Steve Gerba '89, committee chair.\n       Sauvain spoke to students during his visit to Cleveland. \n     ``He shared insight into government,'' Gerba recalls. ``He \n     couldn't say enough about good education as a career \n     foundation.''\n       In August 2002, Wheeling Jesuit University recognized \n     Sauvain's career achievements. The university conferred an \n     honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree on Sauvain in the \n     presence of U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, U.S. Rep. Alan Mollohan \n     and Fr. Acker, president emeritus of Wheeling Jesuit \n     University. The degree recognizes Sauvain's contributions to \n     the United States through a distinguished career in public \n     service under Byrd's leadership and mentoring.\n       Sauvain considers himself fortunate to have served Byrd, \n     master of the appropriations process, as the Senate \n     Appropriations committee staff director. He was only the 14th \n     person to serve in that capacity since the committee was \n     founded in 1867. As staff director, he was the senator's \n     right arm in reviewing budgetary expenditures of $1 trillion \n     annually. For his service to the senator in the humanitarian \n     fight to bring relief to children with HIV/AIDS in Africa, he \n     was awarded the Nyumbani Medallion of Hope.\n       Throughout his 43 years of public service, Sauvain has \n     tried to live the lessons he learned at Saint Ignatius and \n     the University of Notre Dame. He has always been impressed by \n     the Prayer for Generosity that Saint Ignatius students \n     recite, and he is convinced that those whom we most admire \n     have demonstrated personal sacrifice and dedication to duty, \n     which require a great measure of personal generosity.\n       Sauvain earned a master's in government from George \n     Washington University in 1971. Capt. Sauvain, USCGR ret., \n     served 30 years in the Coast Guard Reserve, his ``second \n     job,'' where he specialized in joint Coast Guard and National \n     Guard counter-drug operations. He is the recipient of the \n     Coast Guard Meritorious Service Medal, the National Guard \n     Eagle Award and the National Guard Association Patrick Henry \n     Award.\n       In 2006, the University of Notre Dame honored him with The \n     Reverend John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C. Award for distinguished \n     public service. In 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard's commandant \n     presented him with a Distinguished Public Service Award.\n       He and his wife, Veronica, have three children: Marie \n     Robertson (James), Catherine and Terrence Jr.--all lawyers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7884-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7884-S7885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow \nSenator, a friend, and a true Southern gentleman, Senator Jesse Helms, \nwho passed away on July 4, 2008. He was a man resolute in his beliefs. \nI have heard many say here in the Senate, as well as outside the \nCapitol Grounds, that regardless of what you thought about his position \nor opinion, you always respected Senator Helms for standing up for what \nhe believed.\n  As a master of the Senate parliamentary procedures, he did not \nhesitate to use this knowledge as a tool when he thought it was \nnecessary to get his point across. While inevitably these tactics might \nhave frustrated some of his colleagues from time to time, Senators \ncouldn't help but marvel at his courageous defense of his beliefs, and \nthey never doubted that Senator Helms would treat them with respect. I \nhave heard from those close to Senator Helms, and experienced it \nmyself, that he was true to his belief that standing up and defending \none's opinion was never to be confused with, or providing a reason for, \nanimosity towards one's opponents.\n  His kindness and respect did not stop with his colleagues in the \nSenate. Senator Helms was a true advocate that Senators were here to \nrepresent and serve their constituents regardless of any party \naffiliation, and his office was known for its impeccable constituent \nservices. His beliefs and service to his fellow citizens not only \nendeared him to those he served or those he served with, but also to \nthose that had the privilege to serve on his staff. I don't think he \neven referred to them as his staff but as his Senate family--the Helms \nSenate family.\n  His dedication to his staff is exemplified by the number of his \nstaffers that went on to serve in important positions in federal and \nstate government and in the private sector, having been ``tutored and \ntrained'' in the discipline of Senator Helms. An excellent example is \nRobert Wilkie, now serving in the Defense Department as Assistant \nSecretary for Legislative Affairs.\n  Respect for Senator Helms extends well beyond these Senate halls to \nacross the globe. Senator Helms' experience with foreign policy started \nwith his service in the U.S. Navy during World War II and continued \nwith his efforts to reform the United Nations. His effect was no less \nprevalent when he was the first legislator to address the U.N. Security \nCouncil. I was privileged to witness his stalwart performance.\n  It goes without saying that the Senate, this Nation, and the State of \nNorth Carolina are better today because of Senator Helms. I extend my \nmost heartfelt condolences to the Helms family and his friends.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the \ncontributions and service of one of the true giants of the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina was one of the longest serving \nand most distinguished Senators in the history of our Nation. During \nhis time in the Senate, he was known as a strong advocate for his \ncauses and was one of the most tenacious fighters this body has ever \nseen. Senator Helms knew what he believed, why he believed it, and he \nwas always prepared to fight strenuously for his cause.\n  On those occasions when the Senate was prepared to promote ideas with \nwhich he disagreed, Senator Helms proved to be one of the most adept at \nslowing the body to a crawl. It was a trait that endeared him to many \nof his supporters and was a source of much consternation for his \ndetractors.\n  However, if there is one accomplishment for which Senator Helms will \nbe long remembered and greatly admired, it is his steadfast warnings \nand commitment to fighting the scourge of communism. Not a day went by \nthat Senator Helms was not concerned about the spread of communism \naround the globe.\n  Like President Reagan and South Carolina's own longstanding Senator \nStrom Thurmond, Senator Helms understood that communism was an evil \nideology and, at its most basic form, a means of enslaving millions of \npeople. As a nation of freedom-loving people, we had a responsibility \nto stop its spread.\n  The struggle against communism continued for decades with Senator \nHelms playing a leading role in encouraging our Nation to confront this \nevil. Eventually, the hard line he took\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\nagainst communism, along with Reagan, Thurmond, and others, was \nvindicated. The Berlin Wall tumbled and the Soviet Union collapsed.\n  Today, communism has been discredited and millions of people have \nbeen freed from its bonds. Senator Helms, and the other strong anti-\nCommunists, deserve our thanks for their steadfast fight and eventual \nvictory over communism. It would not have been possible without their \nhard work.\n  In closing, I was saddened to hear of the passing of Senator Helms \nand I want to take this opportunity to send my condolences to his \nfamily and friends. I also want to express my sincere appreciation for \nhis long service in the U.S. Senate and to the Nation he loved.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay tribute \nto my late colleague from North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms. I look \nback upon his career in the U.S. Senate and remember a true champion of \nconservative values; a Senator who stood by his convictions with a \ntenacity for which he will long be remembered.\n  Senator Helms was initially introduced to public service by his \nfather, who served their North Carolina community as both the fire \nchief and the chief of police. After working in print, radio, and \ntelevision journalism and serving on the Raleigh City Council, Jesse \nHelms decided to run for Senate in 1972 and proved his political mettle \nby defeating three opponents to win the seat.\n  Senator Helms spent the next 30 years serving five terms in the \nSenate, leaving behind a legacy of uncompromising and unapologetic \nconservatism. He could boast of many accomplishments during his career, \nincluding being dubbed ``Senator No,'' a moniker he earned for standing \nstrong against issues he felt threatened the conservative agenda. \nSenator No chaired the Agriculture Committee from 1981-1987 and the \nForeign Relations Committee from 1995-2001, where he had a hand in \ncultivating many important pieces of legislation. His firm stance \nagainst tyranny led to successful negotiations and passage of a bill to \nassist Cuban citizens, organized efforts to bring more countries into \nthe NATO alliance, and supported the development of a missile defense \nsystem to defend our allies abroad.\n  Senator Helms also made his presence known on the national campaign \ntrail where played a pivotal role in fostering the conservative agenda \nin Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign in 1976. His efforts were so \neffective he was asked to participate again in 1980. Clearly ``Senator \nNo,'' a moniker he earned for standing strong against issues he felt \nthreatened the conservative agenda, helped the future President shape \nhis conservative message.\n  Senator Helms and I may have differed on many issues, but I respected \nhis wide array of knowledge and the vigor with which he defended them. \nI am glad to say I served in this chamber with Jesse Helms and will \nalways honor his passion for life and dedication to service in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, President William McKinley once said, \n``That's all a man can hope for during his lifetime--to set an \nexample--and when he is dead, to be an inspiration for history.''\n  Of all his accomplishments during his lifetime, the example that \nSenator Jesse Helms set for treating others rises above everything \nelse. During my first term in the Senate, I had the privilege of \ntraveling to Mexico as part of a congressional delegation with Jesse \nHelms. I saw his kindness and sincerity in the way he treated everyone, \nregardless of position. The foreign dignitaries received the same \nrespect and consideration as staff. Not enough Senators treat members \nof their staff like members of their family, but Jesse Helms did. And \nthat gentleness extended to all who came into contact with him.\n  The kindness with which he touched so many lives stands in stark \ncontrast to the harsh and tough image which many had of Jesse Helms. \nSeen as rough and hard-hitting, a more fitting description of Jesse \nHelms is that he was a steadfast believer in the principles of America. \nJesse Helms was the voice, sometimes the lone voice, of a centuries' \nold vision of a sovereign United States committed to freedom, a strong \nnational defense, and free enterprise. He was willing and able to stop \nbusiness in the Senate when the strength of our Nation was threatened.\n  But to those whose lives were personally touched by Jesse Helms, \nprogress was never paused. Instead, Jesse Helms was a conduit of \ndemocracy and opportunity. Generations of Cubans, Taiwanese, Iraqis, \nand Africans will always remember the support that a Senator from North \nCarolina dedicated to their causes.\n  And countless North Carolinians will remember the meaningful impact \nthat Jesse Helms had on their lives as their advocate to a sometimes \nunyielding government bureaucracy. One constituent from Raleigh noted \nher Senator's efforts on behalf of her aging parents. She remembered \nher mother saying if there was a problem that couldn't be resolved, \n``Call Jesse Helms. He won't stop until he gets it solved.''\n  His commitment to his constituents speaks volumes about Jesse Helms's \npassion for his job and the people who elected him. He always \nremembered who he represented and why. And he always remembered that we \nensure the strength of our Nation by inspiring young people to continue \nthe work of generations of patriots. He never turned away young men and \nwomen looking for advice and often engaged them in dialogue. Time and \nagain he told them to stand up for their principles. And then he showed \nthem by example.\n  Very few Americans in our Nation's history have risen to the level of \naccomplishment and reverence as Jesse Helms. During three decades in \nthe Senate, he set an example for all Americans as he always stood by \nhis principles and extended kindness to friend and foe. Now he is an \ninspiration for history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7885-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7885-S7886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PROTECTION ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that, last night, the Senate \nunanimously passed the Former Vice President Protection Act, H.R. 5938, \na bill to ensure that former Vice Presidents and their immediate family \nreceive Secret Service protection for 6 months after they leave office. \nI am especially pleased that this important legislation includes key \nprovisions of the Leahy-Specter Identity Theft Enforcement and \nRestitution Act, a critical cyber crime bill that unanimously passed \nthe Senate last November. I urge the House of Representatives to \npromptly take up and enact this important criminal legislation.\n  Although the Secret Service has provided protection to former Vice \nPresidents over the last 30 years, through a variety of temporary \ngrants of authority, this legislation will provide clear authority for \nthe Secret Service to provide such protection for the first time. The \nmen and women of the Secret Service perform the very difficult job of \nprotecting our current and former leaders exceptionally well. I am \npleased that this legislation will help the Secret Service to carry out \nthis important mission.\n  This bipartisan legislation also includes important cyber crime \nprovisions portions of the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution \nAct to protect the privacy rights of all Americans. The anti-cyber \ncrime provisions in this bill are long overdue. A recent survey by the \nFederal Trade Commission found that that more than 8 million Americans \nfell victim to identity theft in 2005. In addition, a new report by the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development encourages \ndemocratic governments around the world to more aggressively fight \nidentity theft by enacting stronger cyber crime laws and stiffening the \npenalties to deter potential cyber-criminals.\n  The key anti-cyber crime provisions that are included in this \nlegislation will close existing gaps in our criminal law to keep up \nwith the cunning and ingenuity of today's identity thieves. First, to \nbetter protect American consumers, the legislation provides the victims \nof identity theft with the ability to seek restitution in Federal court \nfor the loss of time and money spent restoring their credit and \nremedying the harms of identity theft, so that identity theft victims \ncan be made whole.\n  Second, to address the increasing number of computer hacking crimes\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\nthat involve computers located within the same State, the cyber-crime \namendment eliminates the jurisdictional requirement that a computer's \ninformation must be stolen through an interstate or foreign \ncommunication in order to federally prosecute this crime.\n  Third, this legislation also addresses the growing problem of the \nmalicious use of spyware to steal sensitive personal information, by \neliminating the requirement that the loss resulting from the damage to \na victim's computer must exceed $5,000 in order to federally prosecute \nthe offense. The bill carefully balances this necessary change with the \nlegitimate need to protect innocent actors from frivolous prosecutions \nand clarifies that the elimination of the $5,000 threshold applies only \nto criminal cases.\n  In addition, the amendment addresses the increasing number of cyber \nattacks on multiple computers by making it a felony to employ spyware \nor keyloggers to damage 10 or more computers, regardless of the \naggregate amount of damage caused. By making this crime a felony, the \namendment ensures that the most egregious identity thieves will not \nescape with minimal punishment under Federal cyber-crime laws. The \nlegislation also strengthens the protections for American businesses, \nwhich are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves, by \nadding two new causes of action under the cyber-extortion statute--\nthreatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer \nand demanding money in relation to a protected computer--so that this \nbad conduct can be federally prosecuted.\n  Lastly, the legislation adds the remedy of civil and criminal \nforfeiture to the arsenal of tools to combat cyber crime, and our \namendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review its \nguidelines for identity theft and cyber crime offenses.\n  Senator Specter and I have worked closely with the Department of \nJustice and the Secret Service in crafting these updates to our cyber-\ncrime laws, and the legislation we add as an amendment to the Former \nVice President Protection Act has the strong support of these Federal \nagencies and the support of a broad coalition of business, high-tech \nand consumer groups. The bill as amended to include these critical \ncyber-crime provisions is a good, bipartisan bill that will help to \nbetter protect our Nation's leaders and to better protect all Americans \nfrom the growing threat of identity theft and other cyber crimes.\n  Again, I thank the bipartisan coalition of Senators who have joined \nSenator Specter and me in supporting this important bill. I urge the \nHouse of Representatives to promptly enact this important criminal \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7886-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7886-S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HABEAS CORPUS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month's 5-4 Supreme Court decision in \nBoumediene v. Bush reaffirmed our core American values, and served as a \nstinging rebuke to the Bush administration's flawed power grabs over \nthe last 6 years. The Bush administration's repeated attempts to \neliminate meaningful review of its actions by the Federal judiciary \nhave again failed to withstand Supreme Court review. This decision is a \nvindication for those of us who have maintained from the beginning that \nthe administration's detention policies were not only unwise, but were \nalso unconstitutional.\n  In the wake of the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001, toward the \nbeginning of President Bush's first term in office, this country had an \nopportunity to come together to show that we could bring the \nperpetrators of heinous acts to justice, consistent with our history \nand our most deeply valued principles. I and others reached out to the \nWhite House to try to craft a thoughtful and effective bipartisan \nsolution.\n  Instead, this White House, supported by the Republican leadership in \nCongress, pursued its goal of increasing executive power at the expense \nof the other branches. In so doing, they chose a path that disregarded \nbasic rights, lessened our standing in the world, trampled some of our \nmost deeply held values, and brought us no closer to delivering justice \nto those who have injured us.\n  At a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which explored the \nmistakes and missed opportunities of the past few years, we heard from \nWill Gunn, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel and the former chief \ndefense counsel of the Military Commissions. He believes that ``many of \nour detention policies and actions in creating the Guantanamo military \ncommissions have seriously eroded fundamental American principles of \nthe rule of law in the eyes of Americans and in the eyes of the rest of \nthe world.'' Kate Martin, the Director of the Center for National \nSecurity Studies, said that the administration's decision to ignore the \nlaw of war and constitutional requirements had proved to be \n``disastrous,'' and that ``[d]isrespect for the law has harmed, not \nenhanced, our national security.''\n  I agree with these sobering assessments. I think that we are less \nsafe as a result of the Bush administration's policies.\n  Some of us have tried in vain for years to move this country away \nfrom this destructive course, but, ironically, it has taken a \nconservative Supreme Court to remind this administration that the \nPresident's claim to unlimited power to override our laws is wrong. \nBoumediene is only the latest example of the Supreme Court decisively \nrejecting the administration's illegal and misguided policies.\n  In 2004, the Supreme Court decided two habeas-related cases Rasul and \nHamdi. In those cases, the Court rejected the Bush administration's \nreckless and ill-advised attempts to deprive citizens and noncitizens \nof their right to challenge their indefinite detention in Federal \ncourt. I said at the time that these decisions ``reaffirm the \njudiciary's role as a check and a balance, as the Constitution intends, \non power grabs by other branches.'' I also called on the Republican-led \nCongress to ``stop acting as a wholly owned subsidiary of this \nadministration and to exercise its constitutional responsibility to \nrein in White House unilateralism and overreaching.''\n  The following year the Republican-led Congress attempted to overrule \nthe Supreme Court's Rasul decision by passing the Detainee Treatment \nAct, DTA. I spoke out against the habeas-stripping provisions contained \nin the DTA. I warned that ``in order to uphold our commitment to the \nrule of law, we must allow detainees the right to challenge their \ndetention in Federal court.''\n  This effort to prevent people from using habeas procedures to \nchallenge the basis for their detention in Federal court backfired. In \na later decision in the Hamdan case the Supreme Court rejected the view \nthat the DTA stripped the courts of jurisdiction over pending habeas \ncases. I applauded the Hamdan decision at the time as a ``triumph for \nour constitutional system of checks and balances.''\n  But once again, instead of following the Supreme Court's repeated \nreminders that our Government must respect our Constitution and laws, \nwithin weeks of the Hamdan decision, the last Congress, acting in \ncomplicity with the Bush administration, hastily passed the Military \nCommissions Act in the run-up to the 2006 mid-term elections. That bill \nsought, once again, to strip access to Federal courts for noncitizens \ndetermined to be enemy combatants or who were merely ``awaiting \ndetermination.'' It aimed to take away habeas rights not just for \ndetainees held at Guantanamo Bay, but also potentially for millions of \nlawful permanent residents working and paying taxes in this country.\n  I voted no. These were my words then:\n\n       Over 200 years of jurisprudence in this country, and \n     following an hour of debate, we get rid of it. My God, have \n     the Members of this Senate gone back and read their oath of \n     office upholding the Constitution? [W]e are about to put the \n     darkest blot possible on this Nation's conscience.\n\n  Regrettably, the Federal appellate court in Washington, DC the same \ncourt whose limited review was supposed to serve as a substitute for \nthe Great Writ fumbled its opportunity to set things right. It held \nthat the jurisdiction-stripping provisions did not violate the \nConstitution.\n  Those of us who recognized that Congress had committed a historic \nerror when it recklessly eliminated the Great Writ of habeas corpus \ntried to reverse what had been done. But even with the support of \nseveral Republican Members of this body, Senator Specter and I fell 4 \nvotes short of the 60 votes\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nrequired to overcome a Republican filibuster of our effort last year to \nrestore habeas rights by adding the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act as an \namendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  In its Boumediene decision, the U.S. Supreme Court fulfilled its \nconstitutional responsibility--a responsibility in which so many others \nhad failed and upheld the Constitution and our core American values. \nAfter Boumediene, the administration's record in the Supreme Court on \nhabeas is now 0 for 4. Four times it has sought to erode the time-\nhonored habeas right that protects the liberties our forebears fought \nand died for. And four times the Supreme Court has repudiated these \nill-advised efforts.\n  One cannot help but wonder where we would be in the fight against \nterrorism today had the Bush administration spent more time trying to \ncatch and try terrorists, and less time trying to erode our time-\nhonored constitutional traditions.\n  What did a majority of the conservative Supreme Court actually say in \nBoumediene? First, it reiterated that the Constitution extends to \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba. So the Bush administration's cynical gambit to \nhouse detainees just miles from the Florida coast to avoid judicial \nscrutiny and accountability for its conduct has failed as a matter of \nconstitutional law. As the opinion of the Supreme Court correctly \nrecognizes, the basic protections represented by the Great Writ ``must \nnot be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to \nrestrain.''\n  Second, the Supreme Court held that the administration's detention \nprocedures put in place back in 2005 are a constitutionally inadequate \nsubstitute for habeas corpus. The Court found that the so-called \ncombatant status review tribunals established to determine if detainees \nheld at Guantanamo Bay have correctly been identified as enemy \ncombatants are hopelessly flawed. I have maintained all along that it \nis unfair and un-American to detain anyone without judicial recourse \nbased on proceedings that do not allow those held even the most basic \ndue process rights.\n  Third, the Supreme Court held that the provisions of the Military \nCommissions Act that strip away all habeas rights for the Guantanamo \ndetainees and others are unconstitutional.\n  The Supreme Court's opinion written by Justice Kennedy is quite \neloquent and moving. While recognizing the executive authority and \nresponsibility to apprehend and detain those who pose a real danger to \nour security, Justice Kennedy went on to note:\n\n       Security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom's first \n     principles. Chief among those are freedom from arbitrary and \n     unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that is secured \n     by adherence to the separation of powers.\n\n  He wisely counsels that the Constitution is fundamental, that ``[o]ur \nbasic charter cannot be contracted away,'' and that the Constitution is \nnot something the administration is able ``to switch on and off at \nwill.'' He rightly concludes:\n\n       The laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and \n     remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security \n     can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled \n     within the framework of the law. The Framers decided that \n     habeas corpus, a right of first importance, must be a part of \n     that framework, a part of that law.\n\n  The Supreme Court reaffirmed American values, our fundamental \nadherence to our Constitution and the rule of law, and our great \nstrength in so doing.\n  What is surprising is not that the U.S. Supreme Court would follow \nthrough on the earlier holdings of its opinions by Justice O'Connor and \nJustice Stevens, himself a decorated combat veteran, but that the \ndecision was not unanimous.\n  Justice Scalia's dissent reads like a threatening partisan statement \nfrom Vice President Cheney's office rather than an independent judicial \nreview of the case. He uses language about Islam that was rightly \ncondemned as wrong and counterproductive by this administration's own \nintelligence community, and he repeats the administration's tragically \nmistaken mantra by lumping the various factions of Islam, including \nthose in Iraq, as a monolithic ``enemy'' collectively responsible for \nthe attacks on the United States on September 11. Most disappointing is \nthat his hyperbolic rhetoric is hard to square with his own \nacknowledgement in the 2004 Hamdi case that habeas corpus is ``the very \ncore of our liberty secured in our Anglo-Saxon system of separation of \npowers'' and that ``indefinite imprisonment on reasonable suspicion is \nnot an available option of treatment for those accused of aiding the \nenemy, absent a suspension of the writ.''\n  What role should Congress play as the Federal judiciary begins to \nimplement the Boumediene decision? According to Attorney General \nMukasey in his recent remarks on the future of habeas, Congress should \njump in the fray again in an election year. Although he does not even \nhave legislation to propose, he asks Congress to act hastily to \nminimize judicial oversight and maximize executive power. The Attorney \nGeneral seems to have adopted the Bush administration's mantra: ``Don't \ntrust the courts.''\n  The Attorney General has it exactly wrong. Congress made a mistake in \n2005 when it bent to the will of the Bush administration by passing the \nDetainee Treatment Act, which created the detainee review process that \nthe Supreme Court has now determined is hopelessly inadequate. Congress \nmade a mistake in 2006 when it bent to the will of the Bush \nadministration by passing the Military Commission Act, which, as we now \nknow, violated the U.S. Constitution in its efforts to stop the Federal \ncourts from reviewing executive detention decisions.\n  It would be foolish to bend to the will of the Bush administration \nonce again to try to weaken or circumvent the Boumediene decision. \nWorse, by hastily legislating now, we would risk perpetuating the \nterrible policy judgments of years past that have led us so far astray \nin the fight against terrorism.\n  I trust our Federal courts to get it right. Had we relied on them to \ndispense American justice, perhaps we would have accomplished more in \nthe fight against terrorism over the last several years. Our courts \nhave proven themselves up to the task of trying the likes of Zacarias \nMoussaoui and Jose Padilla in difficult, complex and sensitive federal \nproceedings where unlike the restricted rights available in habeas \nproceedings these defendants enjoyed the full panoply of constitutional \nprotections. These men now stand convicted of terrorism-related \noffenses and they will spend the rest of their lives in prison, as they \nshould. Just as I would not have questioned Attorney General Mukasey's \nability to deal with terrorism-related prosecutions when he was a judge \nin Manhattan, I do not question the ability of the Federal judges in \nWashington, DC, to handle the habeas petitions from the detainees in \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba responsibly and diligently--particularly where our \ncourts have proved up to the task in so many actual criminal trials.\n\n  I was particularly disappointed to hear the Attorney General attempt \nto play on Americans' fears by suggesting that, in the wake of a \nSupreme Court decision affirming our core values, our national security \nwill be somehow jeopardized if Congress does not act. He knows that no \ndetainee has been set free as a result of the Boumediene decision, and \nthat the government will have ample opportunity to justify its \ndetention decisions on favorable standard of proof. He knows that \nFederal courts have successfully conducted terrorism cases using \nprocedures derived from the Classified Information Procedures Act to \nensure that classified information is safeguarded, and there have been \nno leaks of information where those procedures have been employed. And \nhe knows that the federal court in Washington, DC, is taking steps to \nstreamline and consolidate habeas proceedings to avoid unnecessary \nlitigation.\n  In fact, the Federal bench in Washington, DC, is working hard to \nfollow the rule of the Supreme Court by ensuring a prompt, safe and \norderly disposition of the 250 or so detainee habeas petitions. The \njudges, the Department of Justice, and lawyers for the detainees are \nnow working to resolve key issues that will allow the cases to proceed \nin the months ahead.\n  The court has also taken steps on its own to consolidate common \nissues before one judge former Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan--to \nstreamline the review process as much as possible. In the meantime, for \nthose detainees who have been charged under the law of\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nwar, the district court has ruled that the military commissions may \nproceed as planned, and that the right to habeas corpus will \ncrystallize only once there is a final judgment.\n  The Bush administration can hardly complain if it takes the Federal \ndistrict judges presiding over these habeas cases some time to resolve \nthem. After all, it was the Bush administration that tried to avoid \ncourt scrutiny at all costs for the last 7 years. The Supreme Court \nhaving rejected this effort, the courts must now be permitted to do \ntheir jobs.\n  Is there anything that Congress should do at this time? One thing \nthat Congress could and in my view should do is to pass the Habeas \nCorpus Restoration Act that Senator Specter and I introduced in the \nwake of the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act, and with which we \nsought to modify the Military Commissions Act. A bipartisan majority of \nthe Senate voted with us last year when we were seeking to add it to \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, but we were forestalled \nby a filibuster. I trust that those who said they were not ready to \njoin us last year because of the pendency of the Supreme Court case \nwill join us now and do the right thing. It was Congress's mistake to \npass the habeas stripping provisions of the Detainee Treatment Act and \nthe Military Commissions Act, and we should correct it by passing our \nbill to amend the law. The Supreme Court has already declared those \nprovisions unconstitutional and ineffective. In my view, it is a shame \nthat the Supreme Court had to step in before we corrected our mistake.\n\n  These unconstitutional habeas-stripping provisions are a blot on the \nSenate, and on the Congress, and should not reside in our laws. We \nshould reverse the Senate's action and correct its error. I do not want \nto see another Senate apologize years down the road for passing laws \ndesigned to strip habeas rights, as we have seen belated apologies for \nAmerica's treatment of Native Americans, the internment of Japanese \nAmericans, and other grievous errors in our past. I do not want a \nfuture Senate to look back with shame or have to issue an apology for \nunconstitutional legislation coming from this great body. Congress \nshould pass the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act.\n  Thereafter we will need to join together in the weeks and months \nahead to rethink the misconceived legal framework that has been devised \nby this administration. We will need to work together--with each other, \nwith the House and with the new administration--to supplement our laws, \nconsistent with our Constitution and core values, and to restore our \nleadership in the world and more effectively defend our Nation. We can \nrecapture the bipartisanship that we demonstrated in the days \nimmediately following 9/11 and move forward, not as Democrats or \nRepublicans, but as Americans.\n  The Supreme Court was explicit that its decision in Boumediene only \nreached the unconstitutional attempt to strip habeas corpus review from \nthese detainees and that the Detainee Treatment Act and combatant \nstatus review tribunal process remain intact.\n  Likewise, the Attorney General and Department of Justice have said \nthat the military commissions will continue, and a federal judge in \nWashington, DC, recently ruled against a detainee's effort to secure \nhabeas review before his military commission was to commence.\n  I think we will need to review both processes. The military \ncommission system is so deeply flawed that after close to seven years \nit has only just started its first trial. The world will never view \nthose proceedings as fair or consistent with the rule of law. We are \ntoo strong and confident a nation to seek vengeance or be driven by \nfear. America is great in part because it does not shirk from its legal \nobligations but embraces them and lives by them. When America acts, as \nit did, to circumvent the law by holding prisoners off shore, to \ncontract out torture to third parties, or to suspend the Great Writ, we \nare not the America envisioned by our Founders and preserved by every \nprevious generation of Americans.\n  I look forward to working in the next session with Senator Feinstein \non her initiative to close the Guantanamo Bay facility, and begin to \nerase the damage it has done to the United States' reputation around \nthe world. She has sponsored legislation to move us in that direction. \nI want to commend Senator Whitehouse for his legislative proposal to \nestablish a congressional commission to make nonpartisan \nrecommendations to Congress on how best to proceed in the future. I \nknow that Senators Durbin and Specter introduced military commission \nbills back in 2002, around the same time that I did. We will need to \nwork across committee lines and across the aisle, to involve not only \nthe reconstituted Department of Justice, but also the Departments of \nDefense and State as we go forward. We will need to reconsider where \nelse we went wrong and how to set the entire system on better, stronger \nfoundations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7888-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The secretary of the Air Force, Stuart \nSymington, consolidated and centralized the investigative services of \nthe U.S. Air Force to create an organization that would conduct \nindependent and objective criminal investigations. Since 1948, the \nOffice of Special Investigations has evolved to meet the changing needs \nof the Air Force. It has matured into a highly effective war-fighting \nunit while maintaining the standards of a greatly respected Federal law \nenforcement agency. The Office of Special Investigations has truly \nadapted to fulfill the needs of the U.S. Air Force in the 21st century.\n  At present, 3,200 men and women serve in the Air Force Office of \nSpecial Investigations. In more than 220 offices around the globe, \nthese men and women perform the investigative work of the U.S. Air \nForce wherever and whenever they are needed. I am proud to be counted \namong the alumni of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I \nserved as a young lieutenant in the Office of Special Investigations \nfrom 1951 through 1953 and was assigned to the Pennsylvania, West \nVirginia, and Delaware District. My experience allowed me to serve my \ncountry, hone my investigative skills, and prepare for a career in law \nand in Government.\n  It gives me great pleasure, to recognize and salute the Air Force \nOffice of Special Investigations on the occasion of its 60th \nanniversary.

As I stated on the Senate floor Monday, July 28, it is my \ninclination that the majority leader called for a vote on cloture on \nproceeding to this bill in order to dislodge the pending legislation on \noil speculation. By using his position of power, he seeks to force the \nSenate to prematurely move away from the No. 1 issue facing the people \nfrom my State and the Nation namely energy legislation.\n  I did not support cloture to move to the Reid omnibus bill not \nbecause I do not support many of its provisions, rather because I \nbelieve we should complete work on energy legislation before moving on \nto other matters. Further, I am seeking my right as a U.S. Senator to \noffer amendments to a bill in a fair and balanced legislative process.\n  For instance, Senator Kohl and I had a bipartisan amendment prepared \nto offer to the speculation bill that would have brought OPEC nations \nunder U.S. antitrust laws to prohibit them from meeting in a room, \nlowering production and supply, and thus raising prices. Unfortunately, \nthis effort was denied by the majority leader's blocking of amendments \nby filling the so-called amendment tree, disallowing mine and a number \nof other amendments that ought to be considered.\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\n  This procedure is nothing new for this majority leader who has filled \nthe amendment tree on 15 occasions in the current 110th Congress, \nsurpassing all other majority leaders in modern history. As a result of \nthe majority leader's curtailing Senate procedure and amendments, I \nhave been faced with voting against cloture on measures I would have \nordinarily supported including this past Saturday's vote on LIHEAP. I \nhave also opposed cloture in instances such as the Lieberman-Warner \nglobal warming bill which was considered the first week of June--2 to \n6. In that case, the majority leader filled the amendment tree at the \nfirst opportunity and filed cloture on the bill without ever allowing \nconsideration of amendments. The 5-day debate culminated in a fait \naccompli cloture vote that failed on June 6.\n  Most recently, I voted against cloture to move to the Reid omnibus \nbill that was a conglomeration of legislation that has been described \nas non-controversial and may benefit a wide variety of interests. As I \nstated on the Senate floor on Monday, July 28, I am supportive of most, \nif not all of the substance in this bill. In fact, I am a cosponsor of \nsix of the items.\n  I support and have worked to pass a number of the Judiciary \nCommittee-related bills in the proposed omnibus. For example, I am an \noriginal cosponsor of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection Act, S. \n2982, which makes changes in the grant program for centers for runaway \nyouths. I am also a cosponsor of the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment \nand Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2008, S. \n2304, which would provide grants for the improved mental health \ntreatment and services provided to offenders with mental illness. In \naddition, I am a cosponsor of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights \nCrime Act, S. 535, which authorizes funding to solve pre-1970 civil \nrights crimes. Moreover, in committee, I supported a Federal commission \nto commemorate the bicentennial of the writing of the Star-Spangled \nBanner and the War of 1812, S. 1079.\n  Additionally, I voted in favor of the following child protection \nbills which were passed by the Judiciary Committee: The Combating Child \nExploitation Act of 2008, S. 1738, which authorizes grants to combat \nchild exploitation; and the Drug Endangered Children Act of 2007, S. \n1210, which extends a grant program directed at drug-endangered \nchildren.\n  I directed my staff to work to clear the child exploitation bills \nfrom the omnibus package in the same manner I worked to pass the Adam \nWalsh Act without extraneous add-ons during the 109th Congress. To that \nend, my staff worked with Senator Coburn's staff to draft a proposed \ncompromise child exploitation bill that includes the key provisions of \nthe child pornography and exploitation legislation in the proposed \nomnibus, as well as important legislation to strengthen the powers of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the SAFE Act, \nwhich was omitted from the omnibus bill.\n  My support is also invested in efforts to maintain the natural beauty \nof the Chesapeake Bay Watershed while simultaneously preserving its \nresources for the communities it serves. S. 2707, The Chesapeake Bay \nGateways and Water Trails Network Continuing Authorization Act, will \npermanently authorize appropriations for these vital programs. I \ncosponsored this legislation because I believe it is a critical \norganization whose mission to protect the bay is vital for the \ncommunities affected by this watershed.\n  Another environmental act I have fervently supported and of which I \nam an original cosponsor, is S. 496, the Appalachian Regional \nDevelopment Act Amendments of 2008. The bill renews the Appalachian \nRegional Commission for 5 years--2007-2011--and authorizes $510 million \nto be appropriated over that timeframe for the Commission's economic \ndevelopment activities in distressed rural counties.\n  Numerous health care provisions I have worked hard for can also be \nfound in this package, including S. 1382, which establishes a registry \nof those suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, better \nknown as Lou Gehrig's disease. The registry will gather data about \nthose who are diagnosed with the disease to better understand and \nresearch the illness. As Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education--LHHS--Appropriations Subcommittee, I support \nresearch and an ALS registry. I worked to provide $39 million for NIH \nresearch of ALS in 2008 and $2.8 million to plan the ALS registry.\n  I am also a cosponsor of S. 1183, the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act, to expand paralysis research at the National Institutes \nof Health, NIH, and set up a network to allow patients and their \nfamilies to quickly learn the result of clinical trials on paralysis \nrehabilitation drugs. The LHHS fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill \nprovided $64 million for NIH spinal cord research.\n  The package also included bills, H.R. 3112, S. 1810 intended to \ncreate a new Federal grant program to pay for information and support \nservices regarding Down syndrome and other prenatally or postnatally \ndiagnosed conditions. While awaiting these authorization bills, I have \nworked with Senator Harkin to get a jump start on these much-needed \nactivities by including $1 million to establish the congenital \ndisabilities program in the fiscal year 2009 Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations bill. In addition, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee provided \nalmost $1 million to the CDC in fiscal year 2009 for awareness \nactivities related to Down syndrome.\n  One of the bills, H.R. 477, would permit the issuing of grants to \nstates for stroke care systems. As ranking member of the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to increase CDC funding for \nheart disease and stroke activities in the States to over $50 million \nand NIH funding for stroke research to over $340 million in fiscal year \n2008.\n  Another bill, S 1375, would establish a grant program for services to \nmothers suffering from postpartum depression. As ranking member of the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with Chairman \nHarkin to include $4.9 million for a first-time motherhood initiative \nwithin the maternal and child health block grant.\n  I also support S. 675, the Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2007. \nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires 100 percent closed \ncaptioning for all new English broadcast programming by January 1, \n2006. That deadline has come and gone. There are not enough real time \nwriters and captioners to meet this unfunded mandate out in the \nworkforce. Furthermore, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires 100 \npercent closed captioning for all new Spanish broadcast programming by \nJanuary 1, 2010. America is very far from achieving this goal. S. 675 \nwill assist with training the workforce to provide closed captioning \nfor the 30 million Americans who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.\n  I support H.R. 3320, the Support for the Museum of the History of \nPolish Jews Act of 2007, which requires assistance from the Department \nof State to support the development of a permanent collection at the \nMuseum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, Poland. It is in the \nnational interest of the United States to encourage the preservation \nand protection of artifacts associated with the heritage of U.S. \ncitizens who trace their forbearers to other countries and to encourage \nthe collection and dissemination of knowledge about that heritage. Most \nrecently, I traveled to Poland on August 27, 2007, and observed fist \nhand the importance of museums that examine Poland in WW II, \nspecifically the Polish uprising and the Home Army. The Museum of the \nHistory of Polish Jews will complement the current museum facilities in \nWarsaw by preserving and presenting the history of the Jewish people in \nPoland, which had the largest Jewish population in Europe at the \nbeginning of World War II.\n  Having outlined a number of priorities and areas of support I have \nwith this omnibus bill, let the record show that I support the package \nas a whole. However, as evidenced by my vote against cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to the bill, I believe the energy situation is too \nimportant to set aside until we have completed or frankly even started \nour work on it by allowing amendments to be considered. It has been \nsaid on this floor that explaining opposition to this omnibus bill to \nour constituents will be difficult. While this premonition may have \nsome merit,\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\nI trust that the people of Pennsylvania and the Nation will support \nefforts to deal with high energy prices and encouraging the kind of \nopen and fair debate that leads to better policies across the board.\n  I reinitiate my suggestion that the Senate stay in session during the \nmonth of August, if the majority leader would hold a legitimate session \nthat provides the kind of deliberation that has led many to call the \nU.S. Senate ``the greatest deliberative body in the world.'' Members of \nthis body should be prepared to work as long and hard as necessary in \norder to reach a solution to the energy crisis not based upon political \nappeasement, but results. It is time we allow debate and compromise to \nreverberate through this chamber as we find areas of agreement in the \nbest tradition of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7890-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF JAMES A. WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, \nintend to object to proceeding to any unanimous consent agreement \npertaining to the nomination of Mr. James A. Williams to be the \nAdministrator of the General Services Administration.\n  The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs voted to \nreport the Williams nomination favorably to the full Senate on July 30, \n2008.\n  I oppose this nomination because of Mr. Williams's actions in \nconnection with the renegotiation of a contract with Sun Microsystems \nin August-September 2006. I have outlined my concerns about this matter \nin detail in a speech on the floor on July 24, 2008. That statement \nappears on pages S7272-S7274 of the Record.\n  Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have \nrequested to be notified of any unanimous consent agreement that would \nallow for the consideration of the nomination of Mr. James A. Williams \nto be the Administrator of the General Services Administration, GSA.\n  I intend to reserve my right to object to any such request.\n  I expressed my opposition to this nomination in a floor statement on \nJuly 24, 2008, and in a letter to the chairman of the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs on the same date. My letter \nto Chairman Lieberman appears in the Record on page S7273 at the \nconclusion of my speech.\n  My opposition to this nomination is based on the results of an in-\ndepth oversight investigation conducted by my staff in 2006-2007. This \ninvestigation examined the actions of Mr. Williams, former \nAdministrator Doan, and several other senior agency officials in the \ncontract negotiations with Sun Microsystems, Inc. in May-September \n2006. There were: No. 1. allegations of fraud on the Sun contract that \nwas being renegotiated; No. 2. Mr. Williams and Ms. Doan had knowledge \nof the alleged fraud; and No. 3. allegations that Mr. Williams and Ms. \nDoan had improperly interfered in the ongoing negotiations and put \npressure on the contracting officer to sign what was considered a bad \ncontract. I presented the findings of this investigation in a floor \nstatement on October 17, 2007, which appears on pages S12952-12954 of \nthe Record.\n  At Mr. Williams's hearing on July 25, the committee did ask him some \ntough questions about his knowledge of the alleged fraud and his role \nin the Sun contract negotiations. However, Mr. Williams's response was \nless than complete, and there was little or no followup by the \ncommittee. I am preparing followup questions for Mr. Williams, asking \nhim for more details.\n  All the evidence developed in my oversight investigation points to \nthe existence of serious unresolved issues involving Mr. Williams role \nin this matter. Based on what I know today, I do not believe that Mr. \nWilliams should be promoted to high office. He placed the well-being of \nthe GSA before the interests of all the hard-working American \ntaxpayers, who he was sworn to protect. There needs to be some \naccountability in the Federal contracting system for blunders and \nmissteps during the Sun contract negotiations.\n  I may have more to say on this subject at a later date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7890-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7890-S7893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYMENTS TO PHYSICIANS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have been examining several doctors at \nuniversities across the country to see if they are complying with the \nfinancial disclosure policies of the National Institutes of Health. I \nask unanimous consent to have my latest letters to Stanford University \nand to the National Institutes of Health printed in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.\n     Dr. John L. Hennessy,\n     President, Stanford University, Office of the President, \n         Stanford, CA.\n       Dear Dr. Hennessy: First, I would like to thank you for \n     your prompt attention to the matter involving payments made \n     by pharmaceutical companies to Dr. Alan Schatzberg, Chairman \n     of the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford University \n     (Stanford/University). Investigators with the Senate Finance \n     Committee (Committee) believe that the following chart \n     provides a better representation of Dr. Schatzberg's \n     disclosures to Stanford and company reports to the Committee.\n       Committee investigators understand that differences in \n     reporting requirements and accounting methods may result in \n     differences between Dr. Schatzberg's reports and reports from \n     companies that can only be explained in writing. The \n     Committee understands that Stanford will provide a \n     comprehensive response to the initial letter sometime soon, \n     which will include these details. Stanford has notified the \n     Committee that any discrepancies in the chart are most likely \n     due to differences in accounting between Stanford and the \n     various companies contacted by the Committee.\n       As Stanford pointed out in a public statement, there was an \n     error in the chart that the Committee sent to you regarding \n     payments from Eli Lilly to Dr. Schatzberg in 2007. That chart \n     stated that Dr. Schatzberg had ``not reported'' this money \n     when in fact he had. Therefore, this letter is being placed \n     in the congressional record to correct the official record.\n       Stanford also noted that Dr. Schatzberg's reports on \n     payments from Eli Lilly in 2004 include compensation of less \n     than $10,000 for advisory board activities and $10,000 to \n     $50,000 for honoraria for papers, lectures and consulting. \n     This also matches the footnote in the Committee's chart and \n     appears to capture all the monies reported by Eli Lilly \n     ($52,134) for that year.\n       However, Committee investigators still have concerns \n     regarding Johnson & Johnson's report of paying Dr. Schatzberg \n     $22,000 in 2002. According to Stanford's statement, ``Dr. \n     Schatzberg did disclose this payment to the university and \n     also reported it to the Committee. He disclosed the \n     $22,000 payment from Jannsen, the wholly-owned subsidiary \n     of Johnson & Johnson that made the payment.'' The reason \n     that we continue to be concerned is because Dr. Schatzberg \n     reported less than $10,000 from Jannsen for academic year \n     2002 (September 2, 2001 through August 31, 2002) and less \n     than $10,000 for academic year 2003 (September 1, 2002 \n     through August 31, 2003). Johnson & Johnson did not \n     delineate payments from subsidiaries such as Jannsen when \n     it reported the information to the Committee. Johnson & \n     Johnson reported a payment of ``fee for services'' of \n     $22,000 to Dr. Schatzberg on August 19, 2002. Even noting \n     differences in accounting methods, Dr. Schatzberg's \n     reports on Jannsen do not appear to fully explain the \n     discrepancy.\n       Inconsistencies also appear among the payments reported to \n     us by Eli Lilly in 2002. Eli Lilly reported paying Dr. \n     Schatzberg $19,788 that calendar year. However, Dr. \n     Schatzberg reported that he received less than $10,000 from \n     Eli Lilly for academic year 2002 (September 2, 2001 through \n     August 31, 2002) and more than $10,000 for academic year 2003 \n     (September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2003). Noting possible \n     differences in accounting methods, Dr. Schatzberg's reports \n     on Eli Lilly may explain the discrepancy, but only if one \n     combined the 2002 and 2003 academic years.\n       Further, based on documents in our possession, it appears \n     that Wyeth paid Dr. Schatzberg for testifying as an expert \n     witness in 2006. This work was in response to lawsuits \n     brought against Wyeth regarding its antidepressant, Effexor. \n     As Dr. Schatzberg wrote in an undated expert report on behalf \n     of Wyeth, ``My hourly rate for review of materials or for \n     testimony is $500.'' Dr. Schatzberg was apparently an expert \n     witness in at least two cases for Wyeth, but payments for \n     this work cannot be found in his reports of outside income to \n     Stanford. Therefore, I would appreciate your clarification of \n     Dr. Schatzberg's expert witness fees and how they are \n     recorded on Stanford's financial disclosure forms.\n       Thank you again for your continued cooperation and \n     assistance in this matter. I look forward to a complete \n     response to outstanding questions in the near future. If you \n     have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Paul \n     Thacker at (202) 224-4515.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E.

CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 222 of S. Con. Res. 70, the 2009 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other levels in the \nresolution for legislation improving education, including legislation \nthat makes higher education more accessible or more affordable. The \nrevisions are contingent on certain conditions being met, including \nthat such legislation not worsen the deficit over the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or the period of the total of \nfiscal years 2008 through 2018.\n  I find that the conference report to accompany H.R. 4137, the Higher \nEducation Opportunity Act, satisfies the conditions of the reserve fund \nfor improving education. Therefore, pursuant to section 222, I am \nadjusting the aggregates in the 2009 budget resolution, as well as the \nallocation provided to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, after more than a decade of decline, the \nnumber of children and teens killed by firearms is again increasing. I \nwould like to take a moment to break down some of the statistics that \ncontribute to this alarming fact. An analysis of firearm violence data \nby the Children's Defense Fund found that 3,006 children and teens were \nkilled by guns in 2005. This marked the first time that more than 3,000 \nkids were killed by firearms in many years and the first yearly \nincrease in the number of children's deaths since 1994. Broken down, \nthis amounts to 1 child or teen dying every 3 hours in America, 8 \nchildren a day, or 58 children every week.\n  Firearms are the cause of death of more children between the ages of \n10 and 19 than any other cause except car accidents. In 2005 alone, a \nshocking 69 preschoolers were killed by firearms. Between 1979 and \n2005, gun violence took the lives of over 104,000 children and teens.\n  A closer look at these 3,006 tragedies show 1,972 children and teens \nwere homicide victims, 822 children and teens committed suicide, and \n212 children and teens died in accidental or undetermined \ncircumstances; 2,654 were boys and 352 were girls; 404 were under the \nage of 15, 131 were under the age of 10, and 69 were under the age of \n5.\n  More than five times as many children and teens suffered nonfatal gun \ninjuries during the same period.\n  Mr. President, these staggering statistics cannot and must not be \nignored. We must strengthen our gun laws to limit children's assess to \nguns. As a father and a grandfather, I urge my colleagues to take up \nand pass sensible gun safety legislation so that this frightening trend \nwill not continue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7893-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7893-S7895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, In mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate\n.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I have a 2001 Hyundai Elantra, well maintained, until \n     lately--I can no longer afford much [periodic maintenance]. \n     In any case, it gets approximately 35 mpg. It now costs me \n     over $50 to fill the tank. My wife works 32-35 hours per week \n     at [Walmart] in Ontario, Oregon. She makes $10 per hour, \n     since it's in Oregon. [She drives more than] 18 miles each \n     way to work.\n       My doctor at [the Veterans Administration hospital] is 86 \n     miles one way. My wife's orthopedic doctor is in Nampa--\n     roughly 50 miles. [She has another doctor] in Meridian--\n     roughly 68 miles each way. I am disabled on Social Security \n     disability. I receive army retirement and VA disability, \n     partially offset by my retired pay.\n       Thank God and Walmart, I get a slight discount on household \n     expenses at Walmart.\n       We're talking $200 per month, or more, for gasoline. Do \n     something besides talk! Drill Here--Drill Now--Pay Less!\n     Taro.\n                                  ____\n\n       I doubt you will use this story because it will not help \n     support the corporate energy giants or their lobbyists and it \n     will not reaffirm the status quo as I believe Washington \n     wants to continue to do.\n       We are paying more for energy at our house, just like \n     everyone else. It costs us more to drive to work, to visit \n     family, to\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\n     take a vacation and to keep our home because of high \n     gasoline, electricity, and natural gas costs. Food costs us \n     much more, too.\n       But we are taking action ourselves to reduce the costs and \n     contribute helping solve the larger question about global \n     warming and what we are doing to our own environment. We \n     bought a hybrid car to reduce gas consumption. We bicycle to \n     work. We turn off lights when we leave the room. We turn down \n     the temperature of our water heater. We contribute to our \n     utilities green energy program. We recycle, reuse, and \n     restore. We invest in only green energy and companies that \n     are forwarding a future that is not dependent on fossil fuels \n     and that gives back to the people and resources they depend \n     on. And we buy only food that is grown in as sustainable way \n     as possible to support the best farmers and the practices \n     they use. We support farmers who are stewards of the land.\n       And I know high fuel prices are making Americans use less \n     gas, drive less, and think more before they get in the car \n     and take a trip. The same is happening all across America, \n     even previously unresponsive corporations like Walmart and \n     Chevrolet and Ford and General Motors are taking actions to \n     curb fuel costs, use less fuel, make more efficient cars, and \n     save energy because the rising prices and changing energy \n     markets affect their bottom line. The only ones who are not \n     taking any action are those who are making a profit from high \n     energy prices.\n       The fact is, changes in the world of energy prices and \n     changes in our perspective on how humans are affecting the \n     environment we live in are changing too. And people are \n     taking action rather than wait for our unresponsive and \n     partisan public officials to do something.\n       If you do anything or want to take any action, promote \n     energy conservation in any and all ways and renewable energy \n     production in all its forms. Under no circumstances should we \n     further exploit the fossil fuel resources this country has. \n     We will need them in the long term so they are investment in \n     our future and best kept where they are and their \n     exploitation now would only speed the further decline of this \n     country and our global environment.\n       If you want to promote nuclear energy, then any proposal \n     and supporter of such a bill should also volunteer their land \n     and the land of their family for the storage of nuclear waste \n     (the Idaho National Lab does not count). . . Or such \n     proponents should volunteer to move next to the site that \n     will store such waste. If you or anyone else can pass that \n     red face test, then I would support moving ahead with such \n     legislation.\n       I think, first and foremost, you should pass a cap and \n     trade bill on carbon. It is the only way in which we can \n     develop a viable economy and take advantage of the new \n     opportunities offered by the challenges of energy in the \n     future and preserve the planet in which we live.\n       I also think that the profits being afforded to energy \n     companies as a result of increasing costs to citizens should \n     be taxed. No one wants to remove corporate profits but record \n     profits and changes in markets to provide for this are \n     opportunities for providing funding for new and important \n     initiatives without undue loss of corporate profitability or \n     returns on investments to shareholders.\n       The ``problem'' with America is that we do not want to \n     sacrifice our future for the short term economic gain of a \n     few short years and the short term political gains one party \n     or the other can make. We are not like China in that way and \n     if we stoop to competing with them at that level, we not only \n     destroy the environment but lose our values and what we stand \n     for. This has been the approach of the current administration \n     and its party and it is something we need to excrete out of \n     our system as soon as possible so that we can once again \n     embrace the democratic principles and public trusts this \n     country was founded on.\n       I wish you luck and I hope you can see your way to what \n     needs to be done. We all will be doing what we can out here, \n     in the land of the free and home of the brave.\n           Respectfully,\n     Gregg.\n                                  ____\n\n       I work at the site and drive 100 miles roundtrip. Our union \n     per diem has not [increased] in years to stay current with \n     the outrageous gas prices. It has also affected my being able \n     to go to Island Park to the lot my parents bought in 1970 and \n     has since been willed to me. I used to make weekend trips \n     every week but cannot even afford to buy gas to pull the \n     trailer up to the lot, let alone pull the boat up and buy gas \n     for it. I am the Job Supervisor for Construction on the Tank \n     Farm Closure Project and have received several recognition \n     awards for my work and just won the Eagle Award for the Tank \n     Farm. Maybe I can sell them and get money for gas to continue \n     going to work. We need to build Generation IV reactors and \n     start getting our own oil and not depend on foreign countries \n     that can't stand us to begin with.\n     Larry, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like many Americans, my husband and I have tried to support \n     the American economy by buying U.S. branded products; but as \n     we are getting to within seven years of retirement we need to \n     make our retirement savings a top priority. We calculated the \n     cost of owning our Ford vehicles and compared them to the \n     overall cost of a Toyota Prius using $3.20 a gallon gas cost. \n     The Prius won by a nose, so we bought one last year. This \n     year we traded in our last Ford for another Prius. We have \n     been able to keep our retirement savings at the same level \n     because of these purchases. This, of course, means we can no \n     longer haul the larger loads or go into the back country on \n     the unimproved roads like we did before the cost of gas \n     became unreasonable. We have made accommodations; but the \n     changes have limited our recreation choices. These are \n     minor issues compared to the families who cannot make \n     these changes because they have mortgages that are now \n     close to the value of the property due to the falling real \n     estate market and their other costs have risen with the \n     price of gas. These people are being squeezed from all \n     sides.\n     Kathleen.\n                                  ____\n\n       [Thank you for not passing the climate change bill] that \n     was one of the stupidest bills I have seen. It is no wonder \n     the approval rating is so low. Keep up the good work--and \n     keep those [other Members] in line--It will take some time, \n     but they will be out [of office soon].\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       We have seen the prices of not only gas, but groceries, \n     going up and up. Because we need to continue to buy gas in \n     order to keep doctors' appointments, get our son to work, go \n     to church and the grocery store, etc., we have had to \n     purchase less food. The fruits and vegetables are now priced \n     so high, we are unable to include them in our diet. As you \n     know, these are essential for our health! We live on Social \n     Security--and that does not go up!! It is becoming more and \n     more of a struggle just to pay our utilities, prescriptions, \n     and insurances. We would love to be able to drive out of \n     state to visit our children, but cannot afford to drive that \n     far. On top of all of that, our property taxes are going up! \n     We pay our bills, then wonder just what we will eat for our \n     next meals! It is almost to the point that one of us (both in \n     our 70s) will have to find a job.\n       Thanks for listening to people like us.\n     Karol, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       We need to look for alternative fuel. Perhaps now since it \n     is hitting our pocket books we will be more willing. Please \n     stay out of the environmentally-sensitive areas; no need to \n     destroy our environment for short term gain.\n           Thank You,\n     Asa.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was retired and had to go back to work due to the higher \n     energy prices and increases in the cost of food.\n     Albert.\n                                  ____\n\n       While you sit high and mighty in your posh and air-\n     conditioned jobs, listen in on how two teachers in Idaho have \n     to get by so we can pay our taxes to pay your well-padded \n     salaries . . .\n       Both my wife and I are State Certified Teachers. Both of us \n     are highly-educated (myself with a Master's in Education from \n     University of Idaho and my wife with a Bachelor's in Special \n     Education from Boise State University). Neither of us can \n     find jobs teaching here in the Treasure Valley because school \n     districts are cutting FTE's in order to spread their already \n     overly-inflated budgets in multiple directions. We have a \n     baby on the way with no medical insurance and no way to \n     qualify for aid as we are considered too wealthy, because we \n     both were teaching last year.\n       Life is getting interesting for us as we have cut all of \n     our spending in our budgets to buy gas for our little VW bug. \n     We no longer can afford to drive to the movies, as that is \n     gas we need to look for work. We no longer spend money on \n     luxury items, as that is money set aside to buy gas to get to \n     work. We no longer eat out, as all restaurants are rising \n     their prices in order to keep up with their own costs. That \n     is also money we need for gas to get back and forth to work. \n     We work to feed the car now, not each other. We eat Top \n     Ramen, macaroni & cheese, and salads (fine, yes, but it gets \n     old after a while), because we can no longer afford to eat \n     the healthier foods because all of the stores have raised \n     those prices to just outside of our reach. For us, it is \n     now about survival . . . not living.\n       You politicians need to understand just whose money you are \n     spending when you schedule your flights and eat your meals \n     and then bill it to the people. You need to look at your own \n     waistlines and paychecks and consider taking a pay-cut like \n     we do. You are not there to get rich! You are not there to \n     build your career! You are there to represent us! That is it!\n       Consider cutting your own spending by brown bagging lunch \n     from your own home budgets and kitchens, instead of ordering \n     and charging it as a tax write-off. Consider video \n     conferencing more often instead of bouncing back and forth \n     across the nation in an airplane for your meetings. \n     Conference call like the rest of us! Ride a bike when you can \n     or a motorcycle or scooter and become the leading example you \n     originally set out to be!\n       Please understand, from where we are you are an unnecessary \n     expense on our taxes. If the government cannot afford to pay \n     its bills, it should stop spending! Not raise more revenue by \n     raising more taxes.\n       We the People are looking at a government out of control. \n     As stated in the Declaration of Independence:\n       `` . . . that to secure these rights, Governments are \n     instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from those \n     governed,--That\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n     whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these \n     ends, it is the right of the People to alter or to abolish \n     it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on \n     such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to \n     them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and \n     Happiness.''\n       This government is bent on overburdening its citizens. \n     According to the Declaration of Independence, such government \n     should be ``altered or abolished.''\n       Please do not get me wrong and think I'm anything but a \n     patriotic American. Indeed, I spilled my own blood for this \n     country of mine! I fought a war of bone cancer in the U.S. \n     Navy, causing me to lose my right tibia. I have been fighting \n     for twenty years for a right knee replacement, but I am told \n     I cannot have one because of Veterans Administration policy \n     and budgets. I received a Purple Heart at Balboa Naval \n     Hospital, but it does not show on my DD-214. Am I bitter, \n     yes! But, I still love my country!\n       There are countless millions of people out here (outside of \n     your 3-piece suits and luxury cars--outside your sphere of \n     influence) who feel just as I do, but there seems to be \n     nothing we can do about it. Vote yes, sure, but ultimately it \n     is you who make the decisions right, wrong, indifferent, fair \n     or not fair.

Jimmy Carter and his lies about \n     a shortage are still around. It is you and our Congress that \n     has caused this problem. You allowed the Environmental \n     Protection Agency and Department of Environmental Quality and \n     all the environmentalist to control your thinking and votes. \n     I do not think I am wrong in my facts, am I? Your fuel taxes \n     and so-called regulations are taking the U.S. economy down. \n     We will soon be controlled by foreign economies if we do not \n     take our own resources and begin using them. You know we are \n     the 3rd largest oil producer in the world yet we use so much \n     foreign oil that it has become a joke? We had over 500 years \n     of oil and natural gas reserves in the 70's. Can you tell me \n     what happened to them? Do not answer me unless you have the \n     facts about the info from the 70's. I hope you will stand up \n     and be counted when it comes to the controlling liberal \n     environmentalists' whining and crying. I truly believe you \n     can get this done and soon.

I am still \n     working, at a [lower] salary than I once commanded. This \n     fiasco on gasoline and diesel prices has caused me to wonder \n     if I will ever be able to retire.\n       I own a motor-home; having traded in my one-ton diesel \n     pickup and a 5th wheel trailer due to the screaming increases \n     in diesel fuel. Now I cannot travel at all the way we had \n     planned and hoped. All of my immediate family is in the \n     Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas areas--it may be that for \n     some of my family I may never see them again. Selling the \n     motor home is foolish at this juncture in that I can never \n     hope to even almost recoup my investment.\n       It is essential that Congress immediately find and drill \n     for oil anywhere in our own territories. At the same time, \n     there should be major tax breaks given to those that can \n     provide a) sensible alternative fuels or b) major \n     improvements in the internal combustion engine. Nuclear \n     energy has been stupidly legislated out of the future as \n     well.\n       My concern is that when we had the majority and the \n     President, we did not seem to have the leadership that could \n     provide the increase in oil search, production and \n     refinement. Now it seems that we may no longer have the \n     Presidency and for sure will not regain the majority in the \n     legislature. It is my firm belief that the opposition will \n     choke our economy to death with continued pressures on \n     ethanol or taxation on larger vehicles--all under the wing of \n     left-wing partisanship.\n       Substantial increases in the supply, while changing the \n     demand via alternative fuels, seem to be the only sensible \n     way to go.\n     Al, Hayden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7895-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7895-S7896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING GOVERNOR ANNE ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart for the \nloss of one of Texas' strongest, most influential women, Anne \nArmstrong. More importantly, I rise today to honor and commemorate her \nincredible service to Texas and the Nation as a whole.\n  To understand what kind of a woman Anne Armstrong was, you first need \nto understand where she came from. A valedictorian graduate of Vassar \nin 1949, Anne's career started out, not in politics, but on a ranch in \nsouthern Texas' Kenedy County with her husband Tobin.\n  Although she was born in Louisiana, Anne quickly took to Texas life, \nand enjoyed working on one of Texas' historic ranches, settled in the \n19th century. Owning a ranch taught Anne to be tough when necessary, \nand always polite. She also learned how to talk politics with her \nhusband and his friends, and quickly proved to have a sharp insight \ninto the issues facing our country.\n  Although her family always came first, Anne's passion for politics \nled her to become the Kenedy County Republican Party chair. From there \nshe took off, serving next as Texas Republican Party chair, and \neventually as the first woman ever to cochair the Republican National \nCommittee.\n  One year later Anne made history again when she became the first \nwoman ever to deliver a keynote address to a national party convention.\n  But Anne's service was never about the notoriety, it was about \nimproving the government of America. In a time when a woman in politics \nwas almost unheard of, Anne Armstrong forced herself into the game, and \nproved that she belonged there. She became the first ever woman to hold \na Presidential Cabinet Position, serving as an adviser to Nixon and to \nFord.\n  When President Ford joked at her swearing-in that his wife was \n``always needling'' him to appoint women to higher positions, Anne \nquickly retorted ``I have the feeling Abigail Adams would have been \njust as excited as Betty Ford and I.''\n  In her role Anne worked to further advance the roles of women in \nAmerica. She established the White House Office of Women's Programs, an \noffice dedicated to recruiting and assisting females in obtaining \npolitical appointments and high level government employment. Her work, \nas well as her example, helped lay the groundwork for countless women \nwho have followed her. I know that my colleague, Senator Hutchison, \nattributes much of her success to Anne's example and mentorship.\n  After serving in the White House, Anne again made history as the \nfirst female Ambassador to the United Kingdom. During that time, Anne \nArmstrong nearly became the first woman on a Presidential ticket, as \nshe was considered by President Ford for the vice presidency.\n  In what would be her last national position, Anne served at the \nrequest of President Reagan on the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board. She served as the first and only female chair to that \nboard, and served under both Presidents Reagan and Bush.\n  Utimately, Anne Armstrong was an adviser to four different \npresidents, a mentor to many of today's prominent politicians, and a \nbeloved friend to all who had the pleasure of working with her. In \n1987, recognizing her distinguished service, President Reagan awarded \nAnne with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  But as passionately as Anne Armstrong worked in politics, nothing \ncould take priority over her family. After serving in national politics \nfor roughly 20 years, Anne returned home to her ranch and her family in \nKenedy County.\n  Even after such a remarkable career in politics, Anne Armstrong could \nnot resist the call to serve her community. When she passed away on \nWednesday, Anne Armstrong was still serving as the county commissioner. \nAt the age of\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\n80, battling cancer, Anne Armstrong continued to serve her beloved \ncommunity, her home of Texas.\n  Whether as a mother, a wife, a rancher or a politician, Anne \nArmstrong's commitment and dedication was unmatched. Without a doubt, \nTexas, and the Nation as a whole, is richer for her service.\n  Anne's legacy is survived by her 5 children and 13 grandchildren--as \nwell as the countless others whose lives she touched. That is why I \nhave come today to introduce a resolution honoring the life and service \nof a pioneer of women in politics, and a great Texan, Mrs. Anne \nArmstrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7896-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING DAY OF THE AMERICAN COWBOY\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nAmerican Cowboy. This distinguished body saw fit to designate July 26 \nas the Day of the American Cowboy. I cosponsored this resolution and \nwould like to take this opportunity to recognize this iconic figure.\n  Around the globe, the American Wild West is known. To many it means \ncowboys, ranchers, cattle, horses, outlaws, and gunfights. But it was \nalso homesteading and pioneering. These folks helped establish the \nAmerican West, expanding our territories while creating a lasting \nculture and way of life, passing down the traditions of honesty, \nintegrity, courage, compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and \npatriotism from generation to generation. The cowboy spirit is the \nbackbone of our great Nation, exemplifying strength of character, sound \nfamily values, and good old-fashioned common sense.\n  The enduring lessons and virtues of the American cowboy are as \nprevalent as ever in towns all across America. As a young boy growing \nup in northern Colorado, agriculture and livestock were an integral \npart of everyday life. Coming from a community where I saw the strong \nmoral character and drive to succeed that modern ranchers exhibit, I \ncan speak to how vibrant the cowboy spirit still is today in America's \nheartland.\n  In many ways, it is the unexpected places where you find the \ninfluence of cowboys that amaze us and show the true breadth of their \nimpact. Originally known for their tough and rugged way of life on the \nGreat Plains, the American cowboy has a magnetism that has drawn some \nof this Nation's most talented writers, architects, artists, and poets \nto devote their work to the tradition of the cowboy.\n  I am pleased to be a part of continuing this tradition with the \ndesignation of July 26 as the Day of the American Cowboy and hope we \nwill honor the legend of these American heroes with our continued \nsteadfast, hard work and dedication to this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7896-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7896-S7897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WAYSIDE RESTAURANT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to one of \ncentral Vermont's finest community gathering spaces, the Wayside \nRestaurant. Over the past 90 years, the Wayside has built its \nreputation around the State of Vermont as a quality establishment where \nneighbors enjoy a country style breakfast, a quick business lunch, or a \nwell-rounded family dinner. The Wayside represents the needs of the \ncommunity with affordable and diversely pleasant fare.\n  In 1918, when Effie Ballou opened the small soup and sandwich \nrestaurant, she never expected it would become what it is today. The \nWayside serves around 1,000 customers a day, and with 160 seats, is \nalways filled with loyal customers. Vermonters from all walks of life \nfrequent the Wayside for authentic Vermont cooking. Politicians, \nprofessionals, farmers, elderly people, and families all gather here to \neat, mingle and enjoy where they can choose a booth or saddle up to the \nhorse shoe diner top.\n  The Wayside's menu offers more than 200 items, plus an additional \nlist of specials, all new every day. These daily specials are memorized \nby the true blue patrons who line up at the doors before 6:30 a.m. \nUnique delights such as fresh native perch, only served in season, is \nbreaded and fried. Traditional Yankee entrees are always accompanied by \nfreshly baked pies, breads and donuts.\n  One of Vermont's landmark eateries, the Wayside Restaurant sparks \ncommunity admiration through its history of public service. A major \npart of the Wayside's success is its history of family ownership. Karen \nGalfetti and Brian Zecchinelli are second-generation owners and \noperators. The couple's dedication and hands on approach are what sets \nthe tone of the establishment, aided by their home's location right \nnext to the restaurant. Working together as a family, the Zecchinellis \nstrive to create a comfortable atmosphere and affordable service for \nthe community; as such they represent the heart of working America. \nProviding excellent benefits for employees, most of whom have been \nthere for decades, the philosophy behind the Wayside reflects the kind \nof values that strengthen our country. The Zecchinellis' dedication was \nrecognized in 2005, when the U.S. Small Business Administration named \nthem best Family-Owned Small Business of the Year.\n  Without the Wayside, to invite folks into Vermont, we would be \nmissing not only the chance to connect with our next door neighbors, \nbut the opportunity to support a long-time establishment that has \nalways kept the interests of its customers at the heart of its \nexpansion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Times \nArgus detailing their 90 years of success be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         [From the Times Argus]\n\n                           Wayside Turning 90\n\n                            (By Susan Allen)\n\n       Montpelier/Berlin (literally).--In 1918, the Armistice was \n     signed, ending World War I.\n       A legend--Ella Fitzgerald--was born.\n       A first class postage stamp cost 3 cents.\n       And, of course, the Boston Red Sox won the World Series.\n       That same year, Effie Ballou opened The Wayside Restaurant, \n     straddling the Montpelier/Berlin town line--not the 160-seat \n     local institution that has become something of a landmark in \n     Central Vermont, but a small, take-out joint that more \n     closely resembled a snack bar.\n       ``In the early days, there were no seats inside the \n     restaurant,'' said Brian Zecchinelli, who married into the \n     restaurant business in 1994 when he tied the knot with Karen \n     Galfetti--whose family bought The Wayside in 1966 from the \n     Fishes (who bought it from Effie Ballou in 1945).\n       ``Mrs. Ballou would make some soup at the house, donuts, \n     bring them down and reheat them,'' Zecchinelli said.\n       Today's Wayside serves around 1,000 customers a day--more \n     in the summer, fewer in the winter. Most are locals and many \n     are regulars who eat there so often they know the day of the \n     week by the restaurant's regular daily special.\n       But The Wayside has become more than a place local \n     Vermonters go for a good, affordable meal (Zecchinelli \n     recently mailed a letter to lawmakers reminding them they can \n     eat three meals a day there for about $20).\n       Many statewide and local politicians make sure there's at \n     least one Wayside stop on the campaign tour. Zecchinelli said \n     that's because so many Vermonters from all walks of life can \n     be found there--plenty of votes to woo.\n       ``It's just such a cross section of the community eating \n     here,'' Zecchinelli said. ``Plumbers, lawyers, teachers, bank \n     presidents . . . the whole mix of customers. You've got rusty \n     old trucks and shining Mercedes in the parking lot.''\n       The Wayside was also a hot spot for state workers until \n     some years ago. That was due, in part, to the employee meal \n     reimbursement plan that allowed workers to expense meals \n     eaten outside Montpelier. So, Zecchinelli said, some would \n     eat at tables on the Berlin side of the restaurant so they \n     could expense their meal--until an auditor discovered that \n     while the town line passed through the property, the entire \n     restaurant was inside the Montpelier city limits. No more \n     expensing.\n       Asked what makes the restaurant so special, ``You always \n     say you have good employees and good customers,'' Zecchinelli \n     said.\n       But, he said, the reality is something different. It's the \n     house. Ballou lived in a house on the hill just behind The \n     Wayside. When she sold the restaurant to Joseph and Amy Fish \n     (their son George and his wife Vivian took it over in 1954), \n     the house went with the deal.\n       And when the Galfettis bought the restaurant in 1966, they, \n     in turn, got the house, as did Karen and Brian when they took \n     over.\n       ``Since Day One, the house was always with the \n     restaurant,'' said Brian Zecchinelli. ``So the owners have \n     always been very hands-on. . . . The fact that the owner has \n     always been able to skip down to The Wayside to give folks a \n     hand, be there during hours when you're busiest.\n       ``If other businesses want to put a house on the property, \n     go for it,'' he advised.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n       Brian, who previously worked at Milne Travel and Rock of \n     Ages, never expected to go into the restaurant business. \n     Although Karen had also worked elsewhere--E.F. Hutton and Co. \n     and Smith Barney in Burlington--she knew The Wayside was \n     probably in her future.\n       ``It was something I tried and I liked. We've enjoyed it,'' \n     Brian Zecchinelli said. ``We're been so active in this \n     business that we can tag team each other.''\n       The Galfettis and Zecchinellis have put seven additions on \n     the restaurant over the years, and although customers have \n     urged him to expand, Brian said the current size of 120 \n     tables feels like the number to stay with, ``a comfortable \n     size.''\n       He said the best thing about owning The Wayside has been \n     the customers, who truly respond to good food. ``You're only \n     as good as your last meal,'' he quipped.\n       The toughest thing, he noted, has been meeting the bottom \n     line.\n       ``The challenge is keeping costs in line so we can continue \n     to be an affordable place for people to gather,'' he said. \n     Almost everything is made on site. The kitchen is large and \n     the smells of freshly baking bread (almost all bread, except \n     English muffins and rye, are made at the restaurant). Daily \n     specials include full turkey meals, roast beef, maple-cured \n     McKenzie ham and more.\n       On virtually any day of the week, any time of the day, the \n     parking lot is packed, most of the cars, trucks and \n     motorcycles carrying Vermont license plates.\n       Zecchinelli said his favorite moment during his years as \n     Wayside owner was the Red Sox rally he hosted after the Sox \n     won the 2004 World Series, noting the last time his team had \n     won was the year The Wayside opened--1918.\n       ``We argued whether The Wayside has been the curse or the \n     Bambino,'' he joked.\n       The restaurant rolled back prices that day, and more than \n     3,000 people came in to celebrate, ``mostly Red Sox fans, but \n     some employees were in Yankee jerseys. That's OK because \n     we're baseball fans.''\n       What will happen to The Wayside in the future, one wonders? \n     It's impossible to know for sure.\n       But, Zecchinelli pointed out, his son Jay has been working \n     the register since he was 4.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7897-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today because I am proud \nto see the Senate pass two strong, bipartisan bills that will provide \nmuch needed relief to families across the country; the College \nOpportunities and Affordability Act of 2008 and the Consumer Product \nSafety Improvement Act of 2008.\n  Congress first passed the Higher Education Act more than 40 years \nago, guided by the principle that no qualified student should be denied \nthe opportunity to attend college because of the cost. Today, the cost \nof college has more than tripled. Tuition at 4-year public colleges in \nMinnesota has increased 100 percent in just the past 10 years.\n  I believe that investing in higher education pays extraordinary \ndividends, I am proud to provide real help for students and their \nfamilies to make college more affordable. By passing this legislation \nwe continue our fight to gain stronger Federal support for higher \neducation opportunities--because our future success as a State and a \nnation depends on making sure that quality education is accessible and \naffordable.\n  I am also so happy to see Congress pass comprehensive product safety \nlegislation. Inspired by the story of Jarnell Brown--a 4-year-old boy \nin Minnesota who died after ingesting a charm that was 99 percent \nlead--I have worked for the past year on authoring and promoting the \nlead provision of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008. \nIn the past year and a half, over 13 million toys have been recalled \nbecause they contained harmful lead, and I am proud to say that this \nbill finally gets that substance out of children's toys.\n  As one of the conferees of this legislation, I signed the final \nconference report that was sent to the floor today, and I have been a \nstrong supporter of this legislation since the beginning. This \nlegislation is the most sweeping consumer product safety reform in \ndecades, and I am glad that we have finally voted this evening to \nprotect our children and protect our public.\n  On August 1, 2007, the Minneapolis I-35W bridge spanning the \nMississippi River collapsed. The 1-year anniversary of this tragedy \nwill be recognized across my State tomorrow. I am traveling home to \nhonor the victims and their families, and to recognize our heroic first \nresponders. By returning to Minnesota, I will not be in Washington, DC, \nto vote on the adoption of either the College Opportunities and \nAffordability Act of 2008 or the Consumer Product Safety Improvement \nAct of 2008 conference reports. Had I not returned to Minnesota, I \nwould have voted in favor of both of these important pieces of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7897-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   HONORING HOOSIER OLYMPIC ATHLETES\n\n Mr. BAYH.

With his expertise in atmospheric \nsciences, Dr. Morgan was especially well-equipped to advise me on \nglobal climate change issues.\n  As the Environment and Public Works Committee held a number of \noversight hearings on climate change last year, Dr. Morgan provided \ncareful analysis of witness testimony as well as probing questions. \nWhen Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Warner advanced their landmark legislation, \nAmerica's Climate Security Act, few offices could rely on the expertise \nthat Dr. Morgan lent this Senator. And when Ms. Boxer brought the \nlegislation to the floor, Dr. Morgan had convinced me that a broad-\nbased science program of monitoring and analysis was needed. Although \nblocked from offering my scientific monitoring amendment on the floor, \nDr. Morgan has provided us with a solid framework that I intend to see \nas part of climate change legislation considered next year.\n  In addition to his expertise on atmospheric science issues, Dr. \nMorgan provided comprehensive support to me on the full range of issues \nthat came before the Environment and Public Works Committee. Of special \nnote has been his work on bills to control harmful mercury emission and \nanother bill to simplify and automate the tracking system for hazardous \nwastes in this country.\n  Dr. Morgan has been an integral part of the Projects Team in my \noffice and a valued friend and colleague to my permanent staff.\n  As he prepares to return to his academic duties, Dr. Morgan goes with \nmy sincere thanks and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7898-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7898-S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF RAY JOHNSON\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Ray Johnson who \nis retiring on September 1, 2008, from the Delaware State Pension \nOffice after an amazing 39 years and 10 months of service to the people \nof Delaware. Ray literally has dedicated his life to helping tens of \nthousands of State employees, educators, and others prepare for their \nretirement. It is now my privilege to thank him for his dedication to \nthem, to commend him for a life well lived, and to wish him the very \nbest of luck throughout his own retirement.\n  I met Ray on my first day as State treasurer in November of 1976 at a \ntime when the State Pension Office was part of the State Treasurer's \nOffice. He was one of the original Pension Office employees, having \nserved for the office since its creation. Because of his long tenure \nwith the office, Ray has served as the go-to person for just about any \nissue that ever arose within the office. His deep understanding and \nknowledge of the workings of the office, whether it be in the \ninvestment sector or the calculation of retirement benefits, made him a \nvaluable resource for not only the people he served but to his \ncoworkers, as well.\n  Ray began his career in public service on November 1, 1968, as the \nfirst senior accountant for the State Budget Commission. There, he \ndeveloped the initial accounting system to track and recoup previous \nadvancements made from something called the Advanced Land Acquisition \nand Advanced Planning Funds. His efforts recouped millions of dollars, \nresulting in additional interest earnings that were used to make \nadvanced purchase deposits on many of the State's public park lands \nthat are enjoyed by our residents and visitors today.\n  In 1971, Ray was selected to be the fiscal administrative officer for \nthe newly created State Pension Office. In that role, he developed many \nof the rules, regulations, and procedures that are still used there \nsome 35 years later.\n  In the late 1980s, Ray helped lead the effort to computerize the \nState Pension Office, enabling its staff to become more productive and \nto provide better service to 25,000 employees, as well as to 5,000 \npensioners and their families. Many of the administrative policies \ndeveloped by Ray are still in place today and continue to make a \npositive difference in the lives of one generation of retirees after \nanother.\n  It was not just Ray's depth of knowledge and his years of experience \nthat attracted people to him in the Pension Office. It was his giving \nand caring personality, as well. He always brought a ready smile to the \nworkplace each day. Ray was hard pressed ever to refuse help to anyone \nwho requested it. He would answer calls and questions at all times of \nday and mentored new workers in his free time. Ray served as a father-\nfigure to many employees, too, dispensing advice to those who asked for \nit or, sometimes, just lending a sympathetic ear. His compassion for \nand loyalty to his work, to his colleagues, and to those they served \nmade him an especially worthy recipient of the Pension Administration \nAward--the highest award given in the Pension Office and an award \nbestowed upon him by the vote of his peers.\n  Ray continually worked to better the retirement system for the people \nhe served as well as the people with whom he worked. For example, when \nRay moved to the State Pension Office in 1971, all calculations for \nretirement benefits were done by hand--a long, tedious process for the \nemployees. Ray recognized the inefficiency of this system and took it \nupon himself to automate the calculation of benefits, a step that would \nreduce the workload for many of his coworkers, as well as provide the \npeople they served with a more accurate method of determining benefits.\n\n  One of the special things about Ray was that he was not only \ninterested in helping any person he could, but he strove to help every \nperson who had a concern or issue. If he did not have the answer--which \nwas rare--he would search tirelessly for one from any resource he could \nand would never allow anyone in need to go without some form of \nassistance. If a person had questions about retirement and his call was \nanswered by Ray, he or she was sure to complete that conversation with \na solution or, at the very least, a direction of where to go to find a \nsolution.\n  In addition to his extensive knowledge of State pension law and of \nthe workings of the State Pension Office, Ray's success in his career \ncan largely be attributed to his genuine love for his work. He was \nalways truly interested in the workings of the State Pension Office and \nfound it both challenging and satisfying. Ray embraced and took full \nadvantage of the opportunity to develop the State Pension Office from \nthe ground up. A very humble human being, he took pride in his tireless \nefforts to make the office what it is today. He worked diligently to \nmake Delaware's retirement system a model for the Nation, not just \nbecause it was his job, but because he genuinely cared about every \nperson who contacted that office with questions and concerns about \ntheir retirement.\n  Of all of these accolades, Ray says:\n\n       Although I have been involved in recommending, developing, \n     or implementing many enhancements in policies and processes \n     during my tenure, I am most satisfied in knowing that I have \n     been able to serve the Office, fellow staff members, and the \n     taxpayers of the state to the best of my ability and have \n     helped make the retirement process more efficient, effective, \n     and easier for all involved.\n\n  Ray Johnson is one of the most dedicated and hard-working people with \nwhom I have ever had the honor of working. He has earned every day the \nadmiration and affection of his colleagues and the gratitude of the \npeople they have served for four decades. His loyalty and his sense of \nservice have been and remain a source of inspiration to me and to those \naround him. It is with a genuine sense of honor and joy that I extend \nmy heartfelt congratulations to Ray. I wish him a long and happy \nretirement to share and enjoy with his equally accomplished wife \nClaudia and their children, Randy and Donna. On behalf of the people of \nDelaware, let me thank the three of you for sharing with the people of \nthe First State your husband and your father.\n  Let me close by saying that I envy--just a little bit--all of the \nfree time he will now have for fishing and relaxing with long walks on \nthe beach with those he loves. It is my hope that he\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nwill enjoy his own retirement as much as those whom he helped now enjoy \ntheir own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7899-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEVE THOMPSON\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor Steve Thompson, \nhis stellar career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \ndedication to solving our most difficult natural resources problems \nthat he has demonstrated time and again throughout his career. Thompson \nis retiring on August 4 after 32 years with the Service.\n  I know Steve as the regional director of Region 8, formerly the \nCalifornia and Nevada Operations Office, CNO, a job he assumed in 2002. \nFrom the regional headquarters in Sacramento, CA, he oversaw Service \nprograms in California, Nevada, and Klamath Basin that administer the \nEndangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act and managed 51 \nnational wildlife refuges and 3 national fish hatcheries.\n  His many honors include being chosen in 1994 as the first ``Refuge \nManager of the Year'' by the National Audubon Society and the National \nWildlife Refuge Association. Even more notably, in September 2007, \nThompson earned the Distinguished Executive Award, the highest \nPresidential Rank Award given to career senior executive service \nemployees and the first time a Service employee has been so recognized.\n  I have worked now with Steve on many issues, including the Cargill \nsalt ponds purchase and ongoing restoration, efforts to restore the \nKlamath River, habitat conservation planning, and CALFED. For his \ndedication to help find a way to purchase the Cargill salt ponds, Steve \ncan feel pride at the migratory birds that now have a place to rest in \nSan Francisco Bay on their long journeys along the Pacific flyway.\n  For his utterly tireless work to find a way to restore the Klamath \nRiver, we do not yet know what result will ensue. But thanks to Steve's \nleadership, we perhaps have a once in a generation opportunity to \nrestore the River and its fisheries while providing certainty to \nfarmers.\n  What I always found with Steve is that he is completely dedicated to \nfinding that straight and narrow path through the bureaucracy to \nactually solve our biggest natural resource problems.\n  Others might find reasons why a solution can't be found or why it \nmight be imperfect from some idealized perspective. Steve just \ndedicates himself to finding that solution.\n  He is a straight shooter. He tells you what he is going to do to \nsolve a problem, and then he gets the job done.\n  All of us who care about California's natural resources will miss \nhim.\n  Steve, I want to congratulate you on your years of remarkable service \nto our Nation's fish and wildlife and the people who value them. I hope \nyou can now enjoy a little fishing and a few quiet moments to \ncontemplate what you have so honorably protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7899-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RETIREMENT OF IOWA STATE SENATOR MICHAEL CONNOLLY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay homage to Senator \nMichael Connolly on his retirement from the Iowa Senate after 30 years \nof distinguished public service. Mike admirably represented the \ncitizens of Dubuque, IA, for 10 years in the Iowa House and 20 years in \nthe Iowa Senate. He combined a passionate love for his community with \nprogressive politics and a strong work ethic.\n  When Dubuque fell on hard times after the farm crisis of the 1980s \nand a loss of manufacturing jobs, Mike Connolly was there to ensure \nthat the State of Iowa was a partner in the economic and cultural \nrenaissance of the city. If you visit Dubuque today, you will find one \nof the most beautiful and vibrant cities in the Midwest. That did not \nhappen by accident. Senator Connolly and other community leaders formed \nthe Greater Dubuque Development Corporation, emphasizing the attitude \nthat everyone would have to pull together to move the city forward. As \nthey say, the proof is in the pudding, and I encourage you, Mr. \nPresident, and all of my Senate colleagues, to visit this jewel of a \ncity on the Upper Mississippi.\n  Senator Connolly is an educator by training, and although his \ninfluence has been feld in most of the education legislation of the \npast three decades, his interests and work have been broad and diverse.\n  As chairman of the Transportation Committee, Senator Connolly boosted \nfunding to make roads and bridges safer, and developed a new funding \nformula that recognized the need to enhance the transportation network \nlinking the State's urban population centers. The construction of four-\nlane roads between Dubuque and Waterloo, Cedar Rapids and the Quad \nCities, has led to economic growth throughout the northeast and east-\ncentral portion of Iowa.\n  Senator Connolly also spurred an effort to beautify Iowa's roadways \nthrough promotion of the Resource Enhancement and Protection--REAP--\nprogram, which included ongoing funding for the Integrated Roadside \nVegetation Management Program, a partnership between the University of \nNorthern Iowa and Iowa counties to plant prairie grasses and flowers \nalong the State's thoroughfares. The program pays homage to Senator \nConnolly's father, who was a road laborer with a sixth-grade education \nwho worked and saved so his children could receive a college education.\n  Senator Connolly also helped modernize Iowa's election laws as \nchairman of the State Government Committee, including passing election \nday voter registration legislation and requiring that paper trails be \nincluded with electronic voting machines. He used his position on the \nWays and Means Committee to give working Iowans a tax break by removing \nthe sales tax from utility bills.\n  He was also a leader in the legislature helping to pass antibullying \nand civil rights legislation that will help protect generations of \nIowans to come. It would be difficult, indeed, to catalog all of \nSenator Mike Connolly's legislative achievements; suffice it to say he \nhas been one of the most dedicated, hard-working and productive members \nin the history of the Iowa General Assembly.\n  Iowans, especially those in the greater Dubuque community, will miss \nMike's leadership. But I know he will continue to be involved in the \ncivic life of our State and nation. His wonderful wife Martha has been \na true partner with him these many years, and his accomplishments are \nhers as well.\n  I wish Senator Connolly a long and happy retirement, with plenty of \ntime to spend with his accomplished children, Maureen and John. Thank \nyou, Mike, and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7899-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7899-S7900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE WINNER SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Winner \nSchool District for its exceptional support to their National Guard and \nReserve Employees. The Winner School District is one of 15 employers \nselected from across the Nation to receive top honors as a 2008 \nSecretary of Defense Freedom Award. The Freedom Award is the highest \nrecognition given by the Department of Defense under the auspices of \nthe Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve to an employer for their \noutstanding support to their National Guard and Reserve employees.\n  The school district was nominated by 2LT Derris Buus of the 155th \nEngineer Company, South Dakota Army National Guard. Buus had glowing \nremarks for his employer, ``The School District has always supported me \nand my family during times of deployment or training. Mary Fischer and \nJim Drake have all made it a point to ensure that my family had \neverything they needed during my absence. They always made it very easy \nfor me to pursue my career in the SDARNG as well as my career as an \neducator.''\n  The Winner School District provides a pay supplement for the entire \nlength of deployment for its Guard and Reserve employees. Deployed \nemployees received numerous care packages from the school board and the \nstudents. Daily e-mails were sent to deployed employees from students, \nteachers, principals, and the superintendent. Returning servicemembers \nteach the same grade and in the same classroom as they did prior to a \ndeployment.\n  School board members also aid the families of deployed employees. \nSchool board members mowed lawns, took children to athletic events, and \nin one\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\ninstance, tended to an expectant mother throughout her pregnancy.\n  The Winner School District is a shining example of patriotism, and it \nsets a golden example for all employers to follow. I hope we all may \ntake to heart the excellence and dedication of the Winner School \nDistrict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7900-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF BRIAN BEAMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Bringing \nthe Missouri River to the people of Pine Ridge will have an enormous \nimpact in the overall quality of life of tribes and residents in the \narea. I have been pleased to work on this project with tribal leaders \nand residents during my tenure in Congress.\n  I commend the Oglala Sioux Tribe Rural Water Supply System, the \nconcerned tribal officials, and residents who have worked tirelessly, \nsome since the 1960s, to bring a clean drinking water source to the \npeople of the Pine Ridge Reservation. The event on August 20 is an \nopportunity for everyone to celebrate the hard work and commitment \ninvolved in making this dream a reality, while looking forward to the \ngreat results that Missouri River water will bring to future \ngenerations. The impacts will be positive, they will be far-reaching, \nand they will be impressive.\n  Again, congratulations to the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux \nTribe Rural Water Supply System on this historic event. People have \nwaited a long time for this day to come, and I am glad it is finally a \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7900-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 90TH BIRTHDAY OF DR. MAURICE ALBERTSON\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I wish today to make a statement \ncelebrating the 90th birthday of Dr. Maurice Albertson, a Colorado \ncitizen whose compassion for his fellow human beings is evident in his \nevery accomplishment.\n  Dr. Albertson has dedicated his career to enhancing the quality of \nlife of people all over the world. The success he has had in reaching \nthis goal is not just a matter of personal pride, but of global \ntriumph. It is with great pleasure that I wish him a happy birthday.\n  Dr. Albertson began his career as a professor of civil engineering at \nColorado State University in 1947. He is responsible for the \ndevelopment of CSU's large and prestigious water resources management \nprogram and was named as director of the Colorado State University \nResearch Foundation.\n  Dr. Albertson's accomplishments outside of the university are even \nmore impressive. At the request of the Southeast Asia Treaty \nOrganization, he established a graduate school of engineering in \nBangkok, Thailand. Known today as the Asian Institute of Technology, \nDr. Albertson's creation still thrives.\n  Dr. Albertson and two colleagues, Ed and Miriam Shinn, convened an \ninternational conference at CSU on the subject of sustainable village-\nbased development in the developing world. The conference was attended \nby over 350 persons from 34 nations. Following the conference, Dr. \nAlbertson and the Shinns founded Village Earth, an international \nnongovernmental organization that provides training to communities and \norganizations in the methods of sustainable participatory development. \nTo date, Village Earth has helped hundreds of people in 15 countries to \nlift themselves out of poverty.\n  And perhaps most impressively, Dr. Albertson played a pivotal role in \nthe formation of the Peace Corps. In 1960, Dr. Albertson and his team \nwon a contract from the U.S. State Department to undertake a \ncongressional study of the feasibility of creating a Point Four \nInternational Youth Corps. The following year, Dr. Albertson coauthored \nNew Frontiers for American Youth: Perspective on the Peace Corps with \nPauline Birky and Andrew Rice. This work was embraced by Sergeant \nShriver and the Kennedy administration as the concept paper for \ncreation of the Peace Corps. Dr. Albertson continued to work closely \nwith the Kennedy administration in launching the Peace Corps, which has \nbenefited countless volunteers and residents of developing countries \nworldwide.\n  Dr. Albertson has served as a consultant to the World Bank, the \nUnited Nations Development Program, the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, and many other agencies dealing with development issues. \nHe has been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, the Colorado Governor's Award of Merit for \nScience and Technology, and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from \nColorado State University in 2006 in recognition of his exceptional \ncontributions to industry and developing nations.\n  From such an extensive list of achievements, it is abundantly clear \nthat Dr. Albertson has had an industrious and meaningful 90 years.\n  Dr. Albertson, I am inspired by the life that you have led. Our State \nand our Nation are blessed to have you as a citizen.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify the deduction for use of a portion of a residence as a home \noffice by providing an optional standard home office deduction; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \noffer a drastically simplified alternative for home-based businesses to \nbenefit from the home office tax deduction. The U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA's, Office of Advocacy designated reforming the \nhome office tax deduction as one of its top ten Regulatory Review and \nReform initiatives for 2008. By establishing an optional home office \ndeduction, the Home Office Tax Deduction Simplification and Improvement \nAct of 2008 would take a strong step toward making our tax laws easier \nto understand. I thank Senator Conrad for joining me to introduce this \ncritical bill.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I continually hear from small enterprises across \nMaine and this nation about the necessity of tax relief and reform. \nDespite the fact that small firms are our economy's real job creators, \nthe current tax system places an entirely unreasonable burden on them \nas they struggle to satisfy their tax obligations.\n  Notably, according to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, the American public spends \napproximately 9 billion hours each year to complete government-mandated \nforms and paperwork. A staggering 80 percent of this time is consumed \nby completing tax forms. What's even more troubling is that companies \nthat employ fewer than 20 employees spend nearly $1,304 per employee in \ntax compliance costs, an amount that is nearly 67 percent more than \nlarger firms.\n  Turning to the legislation I am offering today, the Internal Revenue \nCode presently offers qualified individuals a home office tax deduction \nif they use a portion of their home as a principal place of business or \nas a space to meet with their patients or clients. That said, although \nrecent research from the SBA indicates that roughly 53 percent of \nAmerica's small businesses are home-based, few of these firms take \nadvantage of the home office tax deduction. The reason is simple: \nreporting the deduction is complicated.\n  A 2006 survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, NFIB, Research Foundation found that approximately 33 percent \nof small-employer taxpayers try to comprehend the tax rules governing \nthe home office tax deduction, but only about half of those respondents \nbelieve that they actually have a good understanding of the rules. As \nDewey Martin, a Certified Public Accountant from my home State of \nMaine, so aptly said in recent testimony before the Senate Finance \nCommittee, ``Many small business owners avoid the deduction because of \nthe complications and the fear of a potential audit.''\n  With a morass of paperwork attributable to the home office deduction, \nthe time-consuming process of navigating the tangled web of rules and \nregulations makes it unsurprising that so many small business owners \nforego the home office deduction. So to encourage the use of the home \noffice tax deduction, the bill we are introducing today would establish \nan optional, easy-to-use incentive.\n  Turning to specifics, our bill would direct the Secretary of the \nTreasury to establish a method for determining a deduction that \nconsists of multiplying an applicable standard rate by the square \nfootage of the type of property being used as a home office. The \nproposal would also require the IRS to separately state the amounts \nallocated to several types of expenses in order to reduce the burden on \nthe taxpayer. It is vital that the IRS clearly identify the amounts of \nthe deduction devoted to real estate taxes, mortgage interest, and \ndepreciation so that taxpayers do not duplicate them on Schedule A. \nFinally, the bill makes two changes designed to ease the administration \nof the deduction: First, to reflect an economy in which many business \nowners conduct business or consult with customers through the Internet \nor over the phone versus face-to-face, our legislation takes these \nentrepreneurs into account by allowing the home office deduction to be \ntaken if the taxpayer uses the home to meet or deal with clients \nregardless of whether the clients are physically present. Second, our \nbill would allow for de minimis use of business space for personal \nactivities so that taxpayers would not lose their ability to claim the \ndeduction if they make a personal call or pay a bill online.\n  I would be remiss not to note that the bill we are introducing today \nis the result of the dedicated efforts of various groups and \norganizations, which have worked with Senator Conrad and me on a \nconsensus approach to improve the current law home office tax \ndeduction. In particular, it is significant to note that the IRS \nTaxpayer Advocate Service strongly backs this bill. In fact, the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate, Nina E. Olson, sent my office the following \nstatement regarding our legislation: ``In my 2007 Annual Report to \nCongress, I made a similar proposal to simplify the home office \nbusiness deduction. I am pleased that Senator Snowe and Conrad's \nproposed bill reflects the gist of my legislative recommendation. \nReducing the burdensome substantiation requirements for employees and \nself-employed taxpayers who incur modest home office costs would make \nthe home office business deduction simpler and more accessible to \nthem.''\n  My office also received an endorsement of the bill from the National \nFederation of Independent Business. Dan Danner, the organization's \nExecutive Director, said the following: ``Currently only a small \npercentage of home-based businesses in the U.S. take advantage of the \nhome-office deduction because calculating the deduction is \nunnecessarily complicated. NFIB small business owners have advocated \nfor a simpler, standard home-office deduction for years. The Snowe-\nConrad legislation gives home-based businesses the option to deduct a \nlegitimate business expense with minimum hassle. This commonsense \nchange to the tax code will reduce tax complexity and help many home-\nbased businesses take advantage of this deduction.'' Additionally, the \nSBA's Office of Advocacy added: ``The SBA Office of Advocacy reviewed \nthe legislation and supports it.''\n  In closing, according to the SBA's Office of Advocacy, America's \nhome-\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\nbased sole proprietors generate $102 billion in revenue annually. With \nthis in mind, it is absolutely critical to endow these small firms with \nas much relief from burdensome tax constraints as possible so that they \ncan focus their efforts on developing the products and services of the \nfuture, as well as creating new jobs. The confusion over the home \noffice business tax deduction, in my estimation, can be easily solved \nby passing this legislation. I urge all Senators to consider the \nbenefits this bill will provide to thousands of small business owners, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact it in a \ntimely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize and expand the Northwest Straits \nMarine Conservation Initiative Act to promote the protection of the \nresources of the Northwest Straits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Northwest \nStraits Marine Conservation Initiative Act. This bill will reauthorize \nthe Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative, which promotes \nthe protection and restoration of the marine waters, habitats, and \nspecies of the Northwest Straits region of Puget Sound in Washington \nState in order to achieve ecosystem health and sustainable resource \nuse.\n  The Northwest Straits region makes up 60 percent of the Puget Sound's \nshoreline and includes the marine waters, nearshore areas, and \nshorelines of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and of Puget Sound from the \nCanadian border to the southern end of Snohomish County. This region \nrepresents a unique resource of enormous environmental and economic \nvalue to the people of the United States and, in particular, of the \nregion surrounding the Northwest Straits. However, in the last several \ndecades, habitat health, water quality, and populations of commercially \nand culturally valuable species found in the Northwest Straits have \nsharply declined. During the 20th century, extensive development, a \nlegacy of lost or abandoned fishing gear, land conversion, loss of \nnative sea grass, and invasive species have destroyed once intact \nnative habitats in its ecosystem.\n  In 1997, I partnered with former Congressman Jack Metcalf and brought \nopposing stakeholders together to create an advisory commission to \naddress regional and local issues in the marine environment. Many were \nskeptical of our efforts, but our work created an innovate model for \nrestoring and protecting marine habitats. As a result, the Northwest \nStraits Initiative was created to provide funding to help citizens \ndesign and carry out marine conservation projects driven by local \npriorities and informed by science and the Initiative's goals and \nbenchmarks.\n  The Northwest Straits Initiative is composed of volunteer-based \nmarine resources committees in 7 counties, as well as over 100 members \nrepresenting residents, tribes, businesses, fishermen, boaters, and \nscientists. It has logged thousands of volunteer hours and completed \nhundreds of projects, demonstrating that citizen involvement in marine \nresource conservation and restoration is powerful, effective, and \nnecessary. And the program has accomplished a lot: thousands of \nderelict crab pots and fishing nets have been removed, miles of forage \nfish spawning habitat have been surveyed, hundreds of thousands of \nnative Olympia oysters have been planted, marine stewardship areas have \nbeen designated, nearly 1,000 tons of creosote wood has been removed, \nand dozens of stewardship and public outreach programs have been \ncompleted.\n  The authorization of the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation \nInitiative will ensure the continuation of this successful and \ninnovative regional approach to marine resource restoration and \nprotection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3374. A bill to establish a commission on veterans and members of \nthe Armed Forces with post traumatic\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\nstress disorder, traumatic brain injury, or other mental health \ndisorders, to enhance the capacity of mental health providers to assist \nsuch veterans and members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Ron \nWyden to introduce a bill that will help improve the lives of our \nveterans who are suffering from a mental illness. The Healing Our \nNation's Heroes Act of 2008 is an important bill and I look forward to \nits passage. Senator Wyden has been an ally for me in the struggle to \nensure veterans, particularly those who are struggling with a mental \nillness, get the care that they need. It is an honor for me to work him \nto ensure our Nation's heroes are not forgotten.\n  Our work together on this bill began last summer when I called a \nSpecial Committee on Aging field hearing at the Portland Veterans \nAffairs Medical Center in our home state of Oregon. At that hearing, \nSenator Wyden and I heard the testimony of officials from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, as well as local leaders who \noperate programs that support our veterans' mental and physical health \nneeds. I also held roundtables in my state on the issue and a follow-up \nhearing in Washington, DC in October, 2007 to further examine the scope \nof the issues and barriers facing our veterans in need of care. At this \nhearing, we were fortunate to have former Senator and World War II \nveteran Bob Dole testify. Senator Dole is a decorated war hero who has \nfought for decades to ensure that our servicemembers and veterans have \nthe proper supports they need. His insight and knowledge of the issues \nfacing our veterans, both young and old, were instrumental in helping \nus to draft this legislation. Without the input of countless people who \ntold us of the problems faced by their loved ones and their own \nstruggles with the current system, we could not have made this bill \npossible.\n  In our Nation today, we have nearly 24 million veterans, about 40 \npercent of whom are age 65 and older. The Veterans Health \nAdministration serves about 5.5 million of them each year and employs \n247,000 employees to attend to their care. I draw attention to these \nnumbers to emphasize not only the scale of the system--and therefore \nthe noted difficulties in meeting all needs at all times--but also to \nreiterate that there are a large number of veterans to whom we owe an \nenormous debt.\n  Unfortunately, we are not doing well enough by our veterans. We know \nthat nationally 23 percent of all homeless persons are veterans. In \nPortland, Oregon, that number could be as high as 30 percent. They \nsuffer disproportionately from poor health, including mental health and \nsubstance abuse challenges. We are fortunate to have wonderful \ncommunity-based groups, such as the Central City Concern in Portland, \nworking to help those who are homeless to get the help and support they \nneed; but we must do more.\n  As was reported at the hearing I held in October of 2007, Dr. Kaplan \nfrom Portland State University found that veterans in our nation are at \ntwice the risk of suicide as non-veterans. With the number and needs of \nveterans ever-increasing in our nation, we must ensure that our mental \nhealth infrastructure is prepared to handle their unique needs.\n  What we now refer to as post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, once \nwas described as ``soldier's heart'' in the Civil War, ``shell shock'' \nin World War I, and ``combat fatigue'' in World War II. Whatever the \nname, they are serious mental illnesses and deserve equal attention and \ncare as a physical wound. A system must be in place to help our \nveterans as they adjust back to life with their families and within \ntheir communities.\n  So many of our veterans from previous conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and \naround the globe in World War II, needed similar programs once they \nreturned home. Yet, I fear that we did not do enough to help them. With \nproper and early support systems in place, we can work to prevent the \nmore serious and chronic mental health issues that come from a lack of \nintervention.\n  There is no greater obligation than caring for those who have served \nthis country with their military service. We would be remiss if we did \nnot ensure that the health care provided to our heroes in arms is the \nfinest medicine has to offer. A lack of culturally sensitive mental \nhealth professionals, an inability to reach rural areas, stigma related \nto mental illness within the military, bureaucratic run-arounds and \nlong waiting times are just a few of the problems that we hear about--\nboth in the news and directly from constituents. These are problems \nthat must be addressed and can only be addressed if we all work \ntogether to find solutions.\n  As our country faces new waves of veterans with mental health \nillnesses, many of whose issues arise from combat stress, we must \nensure that we learn from the lessons of the past. We must ensure that \nthey are cared for, and we must not leave behind those who fought for \nour nation in previous generations.\n  This bill has three important parts that will improve mental health \nservices to our veterans. First, it will establish a commission charged \nwith oversight of outreach and services offered to veterans and members \nof the Armed Forces with post traumatic stress disorder and other \ndisorders that affect mental health. This commission will be a long-\nterm body that will ensure that our veterans have the support that they \nneed. They will report to Congress, make recommendations to the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Defense, and look for innovative \nways that the two bodies can work together to better ensure our \nservicemembers have the proper supports while they are in the Armed \nForces, during their time of transition back to their communities, and \nas they live their lives as veterans in their communities.\n  This bill also will establish the Heroes-to-Healers Program, which we \nhave created to build on the successes of the Troops-to-Teachers \nProgram. In addition to the wonderful work that the Troops-to-Teachers \nprogram does in training former servicemembers to work in high-need \nschool districts, the Heroes-to-Healers Program will train former \nservicemembers to become a part of the mental health workforce. We know \nthat major complaints from servicemembers and veterans working to gain \nneeded mental health services are the wait times for care that they \nexperience due to lack of available staff and their desire to work with \nprofessionals who understand, first-hand, the difficult things that \nthey have seen and type of experiences they have had serving overseas \nin combat zones. Through this program, participants will receive \nfinancial support to gain the training and licensing they need to \nbecome a mental health professional, while ensuring there is a minimum \namount of time that they will then serve their fellow veterans in their \nnew profession.\n  To further help recruitment and retention efforts for mental health \nservice providers, the third part of this bill will provide a new grant \nprogram to state and local mental health agencies, as well as non-\nprofit organizations to establish, expand or enhance mental health \nprovider recruitment and retention efforts. These efforts will be \ntargeted at supporting mid-career professionals who are looking to work \nin the mental health profession.\n  We know that we must do a better job of helping our veterans. We can \ndo better at ensuring they can remain stable in their communities, that \nthey can live healthy lives and that they can prosper as persons to \nwhom we owe a great deal of gratitude and compassion.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its passage. I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healing Our Nation's Heroes \n     Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since October 2001, approximately 1,640,000 members of \n     the Armed Forces have been deployed as part of Operation \n     Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (2) 300,000 members of the Armed Forces are suffering from \n     major depression or post traumatic stress because of service \n     in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\n       (3) 320,000 of the members of the Armed Forces who served \n     in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, or \n     19 percent of such members, have received brain injuries from \n     such service.\n       (4) Only 43 percent of members of the Armed Forces with a \n     probable traumatic brain injury have reported receiving a \n     medical evaluation for their head injury.\n       (5) Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs show that \n     120,000 members of the Armed Forces who are no longer on \n     active duty have been diagnosed with mental health problems, \n     approximately half of whom suffer from post traumatic stress \n     disorder (PTSD).\n       (6) In the last year, only 53 percent of those members of \n     the Armed Forces with post traumatic stress disorder or \n     depression have sought professional help from a mental health \n     care provider.\n       (7) Rates of post traumatic stress disorder and depression \n     are highest among members of the Armed Forces who are women \n     or members of the Reserves.\n       (8) Efforts to improve access to quality mental health care \n     are integral to supporting and treating both active duty \n     members of the Armed Forces and veterans.\n       (9) Without quality mental health care, members of the \n     Armed Forces and veterans may experience lower work \n     productivity, which negatively affects their physical health, \n     mental health, and family and social relationships.\n       (10) Cultural and personal stigmas are factors that \n     contribute to low rates of veterans of Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom who seek mental health \n     care from qualified mental health care providers.\n       (11) The capacity of mental health care providers and \n     access to such providers must be improved to meet the needs \n     of members of the Armed Forces who are returning from \n     deployment in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom.\n       (12) Community-based providers of mental health care are \n     invaluable assets in addressing the needs of such members and \n     should not be overlooked.\n       (13) Coordination of care among government agencies as well \n     as nongovernmental agencies is integral to the successful \n     treatment of members of the Armed Forces returning from \n     deployment.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, over the past 7 years, hundreds of \nthousands of members of our armed forces have gone to war and returned \nhome alive, but suffering. Advances in protective equipment and \nimprovements made in battlefield care mean that fewer troops than ever \nbefore suffer from obvious physical wounds. But many more of these \nservice members have returned with less obvious injuries--invisible \ninjuries like post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury.\n  Our armed forces have seen a surge in diagnosed cases of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, commonly known as \nPTSD and TBI. And soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves are much \nmore likely to suffer from PTSD and depression when they return from \nbattle, a fact that is very important in Oregon where almost all of our \nservicemembers serve in the Guard and Reserves.\n  While no less real and no less serious than physical wounds of war, \nPTSD and TBI require a specialized kind of diagnosis and treatment. \nUnfortunately, only half of the soldiers and veterans who suffer from \nPTSD or TBI are receiving care for their wounds, according to a RAND \nCorporation study.\n  To help our service men and women suffering from PTSD, TBI and other \nmental health conditions, we are introducing a bill today that's \ndesigned to address some of the overwhelming difficulties faced by many \nof our nation's warriors. This bill, the ``Healing Our Nation's Heroes \nAct of 2008,'' has within it provisions to help improve mental health \ncare, and access to care, for service members who suffer from the \ninvisible wounds of war.\n  First, this legislation would create a standing commission to study \nand oversee mental health treatment of our veterans. This commission \nwould make recommendations on methods to improve mental health care \nand, just as importantly, overcome the cultural stigma attached to \nseeking help for mental health disorders. As an ongoing body, this \ncommission will continue to help guide Congress and the agencies for \nyears, instead of just making recommendations and disappearing.\n  Secondly, the bill would create a ``Heroes-to-Healers Program'' which \nwould provide financial incentives for veterans and members of the \narmed forces who are separating or retiring to obtain certification or \nlicensing as mental health providers. It also encourages them to seek \nemployment with organizations that provide mental health care to \nmembers of the armed forces, veterans and their families.\n  One of the more heartbreaking truths surrounding PTSD is that service \nmembers are often reluctant to seek help from mental health \nprofessionals who don't share their experiences. This reluctance \ncreates the sort of self-isolation that leads to increased risk of \nsuicide.\n  By increasing the number of veterans working as mental health \nproviders, this bill will allow more servicemembers and veterans to get \ntreatment from those who truly understand what combat is like.\n  Our bill would also create a grant program to help state and local \nmental health agencies recruit and retain mental health professionals. \nSome service members and veterans don't feel comfortable seeking mental \nhealth care from the Department of Defense or VA. But mental health \nagencies are already being stretched thin, especially in rural areas. \nThis legislation will provide help in recruiting and retaining the \nmental health providers our wounded heroes so desperately need.\n  Surviving the trauma of combat shouldn't sentence our forces to a \nlifetime of mental and emotional pain. They paid the price bravely for \nserving our country in battle. This bill will help them move beyond the \ninvisible scars of the battlefield and rebuild their lives at home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 3375. A bill to prohibit the introduction or delivery for \nintroduction into interstate commerce of novelty lighters, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I, along with my colleagues Senator \nCollins from Maine and Senator Dodd from Connecticut, am introducing \nthe Protect Children From Dangerous Lighters Act, a ban on novelty \nlighters. Novelty lighters, also known as toy-like lighters, are \ncigarette lighters that look like small children's toys or regular \nhousehold items.\n  These lighters are dangerous and have terrible consequences. Because \nthey are so well disguised as toys, novelty lighters have children \nliterally playing with fire.\n  The results can be deadly: In Oregon, two boys were playing with a \nnovelty lighter disguised as a toy dolphin and accidentally started a \nserious fire. One boy died and the other now has permanent brain \ndamage. Also in Oregon, a mother suffered third degree burns on her \nfoot when her child was playing with a novelty lighter disguised as a \nsmall toy Christmas tree and set a bed on fire.\n  Tragic accidents like these happen all over the country. In North \nCarolina, a boy sustained second degree\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\nburns after playing with a novelty lighter that looked like a toy cell \nphone. One of the most tragic incidents occurred in Arkansas, where a \n2-year-old and a 15-month-old child died in a fire they accidentally \nstarted playing with a novelty lighter shaped like a toy motorcycle.\n  These injuries and deaths demand we take action and remove these \ndangerous lighters from shelves everywhere.\n  If we don't protect children from novelty lighters, we are condemning \nthem to play life-threatening Russian roulette every time they pick up \nwhat they think is a toy.\n  A ban on novelty lighters would require the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission to treat novelty lighters as a banned hazardous substance. \nThat means novelty lighters will not be manufactured, imported, sold, \nor given away as promotional gifts anywhere in this country. Passing \nthis bill is the only way we can guarantee that novelty lighters will \nbe kept out of the hands of children. It's our best tool to prevent \ninjuries like those that have already brought tragedy to too many \nfamilies.\n  A number of states and cities have taken it upon themselves to take \naction to ban these deadly lighters. Maine and Tennessee passed novelty \nlighter ban legislation and similar bans are being introduced in many \nother states, including Oregon. We should expand and support these \nefforts to protect children in all states.\n  A Federal ban on novelty lighters has widespread nationwide support. \nAlong with the Oregon Fire Marshal, the National Association of Fire \nMarshals supports a Federal ban on these lighters and has been active \nin promoting public awareness on this issue. Even the cigarette lighter \nindustry, represented by the Lighter Association, supports a ban on \nnovelty lighters. We also have support from the Congressional Fire \nInstitute, Safe Kids USA, Consumer Federation of America and the \nConsumer's Union.\n  The more people learn about novelty lighters, the more support there \nis to ban them.\n  I urge my colleagues to act now and help kids across America avoid \nthe senseless deaths and serious injuries they suffer when they mistake \nnovelty lighters for toys.\n  Hazardous tools containing flammable fuel should not be dressed up in \npackages that are particularly attractive to children. Kids need our \nhelp to protect them from the treacherous ``wolf in sheep's clothing'' \nof novelty lighters.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Protect Children from \nDangerous Lighters Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objetion, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Children from \n     Dangerous Lighters Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lighters are inherently dangerous products containing \n     flammable fuel.\n       (2) If lighters are used incorrectly or used by children, \n     dangerous and damaging consequences may result.\n       (3) Novelty lighters are easily mistaken by children and \n     adults as children's toys or as common household items.\n       (4) Novelty lighters have been the cause of many personal \n     injuries to children and adults and property damage \n     throughout the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOVELTY LIGHTER DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``novelty lighter'' means a device \n     typically used for the igniting or lighting of cigarettes, \n     cigars, or pipes that has a toy-like appearance, has \n     entertaining audio or visual effects, or resembles in any way \n     in form or function an item that is commonly recognized as \n     appealing, attractive, or intended for use by children of 10 \n     years of age or younger, including such a device that takes \n     toy-like physical forms, including toy animals, cartoon \n     characters, cars, boats, airplanes, common household items, \n     weapons, cell phones, batteries, food, beverages, musical \n     instruments, and watches.\n\n     SEC. 4. BAN ON NOVELTY LIGHTERS.\n\n       (a) Banned Hazardous Substance.--A novelty lighter shall be \n     treated as a banned hazardous substance as defined in section \n     2 of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261) \n     and the prohibitions set out in section 4 of such Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 1263) shall apply to novelty lighters.\n       (b) Application.--Subsection (a) applies to a novelty \n     lighter--\n       (1) manufactured on or after January 1, 1980; and\n       (2) that is not considered by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission to be an antique or an item with significant \n     artistic value.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend Senator Wyden in \nintroducing a bill that will ban the sale of certain novelty lighters \nthat children can mistake for toys, often with tragic consequences for \nthemselves and their families.\n  In Arkansas last year, two boys, ages 15 months and 2 years, died \nwhen the toddler accidentally started a fire with a lighter shaped like \na motorcycle. In Oregon, a fire started with a dolphin-shaped lighter \nleft one child dead and another brain-damaged. A North Carolina 6-year-\nold boy was badly burned by a lighter shaped like a cell phone.\n  Sadly, the U.S. Fire Administration has other stories of the hazards \npresented by novelty lighters. When you learn that one looks like a \nrubber duck toy--and quacks--you can imagine the potential for harm.\n  As a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am proud \nto note that this spring, my home State of Maine became the first State \nto outlaw the sale of novelty lighters.\n  My State's pioneering law stems from a tragic 2007 incident in a \nLivermore, Maine, grocery store. While his mother was buying \nsandwiches, six-year-old Shane St. Pierre picked up what appeared to be \na toy flashlight in the form of a baseball bat. When he flicked the \nswitch, a flame shot out and burned his face. Shane's dad, Norm St. \nPierre, a fire chief in nearby West Paris, began advocating for the \nnovelty-lighter ban that became Maine law in March 2008.\n\n  The Maine State Fire Marshal's office supported that legislation, and \na national ban has the support of the Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute's National Advisory Committee, the National State Fire \nMarshals Association, and the National Volunteer Fire Council.\n  The bill is straightforward. It treats novelty lighters manufactured \nafter January 1, 1980, as banned hazardous substances unless the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission determines a particular lighter has \nantique or significant artistic value. Otherwise, sale of lighters with \ntoy-like appearance, special audio or visual features, or other \nattributes that would appeal to children under 10 would be banned.\n  The novelty lighters targeted in this legislation serve no functional \nneed. But they are liable to attract the notice and curiosity of \nchildren, whose play can too easily turn into a scene of horror and \ndeath. The sale of lighters that look like animals, cartoon characters, \nfood, toys, or other objects is simply irresponsible and an invitation \nto tragedy.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this simple \nmeasure that can save children from disfigurement and death.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3377. A bill to amend title 46, United States Code, to waive the \nbiometric transportation security card requirement for certain small \nbusiness merchant mariners, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, Minnesota is the land of over 10,000 \nlakes and nearly as many fishing guides. We even have a Fishing Hall of \nFame in Baxter where many of our legendary guides are enshrined--names \nlike Al and Ron Lindner, Babe Winkleman, Gary Roach and many others. In \nfact tonight there is a banquet honoring the Hall. The craft of the \nfishing guide is to understand fish and to share their knowledge and \nthe sport with many of us who don't possess their skills.\n  When I travel my state I meet with folks from all walks of life who \nhave dealings with the federal government and last summer I was in the \ncity of Baudette, a small community on the Rainy River on the northern \nborder of Minnesota. I had the chance to speak with a fishing guide who \ntold me about a new federal regulation with which he had to comply. As \nyou can imagine, I was amazed when he told me that he\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nwas being required to get a Transportation Worker Identification \nCredential--or TWIC--in order to stay in business as a fishing guide. \nNow I understand that folks who do business on the water should be able \nto exhibit seamanship and operate a safe watercraft. But, my guides and \nI are having a hard time understanding why a guy whose briefcase is a \nbucket of minnows and his workday starts when he backs his boat into \nthe lake should be required to submit to the same security screening as \noperators and workers in our major ports.\n  To address this issue, I am introducing the Small Marine Business and \nFishing Guide Relief Act. I want to thank Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman for joining me as original cosponsors of this legislation. \nOur bill is very straightforward--it will exempt mariners from needing \na TWIC if they are not required to submit a vessel security plan for \ntheir boat to the Coast Guard. This group of mariners includes fishing \nguides, charter captains and other small recreational boaters.\n  I want to be clear these mariners will still be required to have a \nCoast Guard license. Security should not be jeopardized by eliminating \nthe TWIC requirement because the Coast Guard conducts significant \nbackground checks when mariners apply for a Coast Guard license. These \nbackground checks review crimes against people, property, public \nsafety, the environment and examine whether the applicant has prior \ndrug offenses or committed a crime against national security.\n  These folks already pay a minimum of $140 for their Coast Guard \nlicenses which are good for five years. Given these factors, asking \nthese operators to pay over $100 more for another credential--\nespecially with the recent downturn in the economy and the cost of \ngas--is an unnecessary burden that doesn't make sense.\n  Additionally, our legislation calls for a report to examine the \nfeasibility of identifying which small boat operators already purchased \na TWIC but will not need it once this legislation is signed into law. \nOnce this is done, refunds or credits could be issued towards license \nrenewals for these folks.\n  The TWIC program is an important tool to ensure the safety of our \nnation's ports, but common sense tells us that a fishing dock on Lake \nof the Woods or Rainy River is vastly different from the major ports \naround the country that receive thousands of cargo containers per day. \nSimply put, we need to make sure our local fishing guides and other \nsmall marine operators are not being subjected to excessive government \nregulation and this legislation will provide that relief.\n  A similar TWIC exemption passed the House on April 24 as part of the \nCoast Guard Reauthorization Act and I encourage my Senate colleagues to \npass this legislation as well before we adjourn for the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Marine Business and \n     Fishing Guide Relief Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WAIVER OF BIOMETRIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY CARD \n                   REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESS MERCHANT \n                   MARINERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 70105 (b)(2) of title 46, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``and serving under \n     the authority of such license, certificate of registry, or \n     merchant mariners document on a vessel for which the owner or \n     operator of such vessel is required to submit a vessel \n     security plan under section 70103(c) of this title'' before \n     the semicolon;\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (D); and\n       (3) by redesignating subparagraphs (E), (F), and (G) as \n     subparagraphs (D), (E), and (F), respectively.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to Congress a report that contains the \n     following:\n       (1) A list of the locations that provide service to \n     individuals seeking to obtain or renew a license, certificate \n     of registry, or merchant mariners document under part E of \n     subtitle II of title 46, United States Code.\n       (2) An assessment of the feasibility of accepting \n     applications for licenses, certificates of registry, and \n     merchant mariner documents described in paragraph (1) and any \n     applicant biometrics required therefor at the Transportation \n     Worker Identification Credential enrollment facilities or \n     mobile enrollment centers of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n       (3) An assessment of the administrative feasibility of \n     verifying that an individual has obtained a biometric \n     transportation security card issued under section 70105 of \n     title 46, United States Code, and is serving under the \n     authority of a license, certificate of registry, or merchant \n     mariners document described in paragraph (1) on a vessel for \n     which the owner or operator of such vessel is not required to \n     submit a vessel security plan under section 70103(e) of such \n     title to provide such individual a refund of any fees paid by \n     such individual to obtain such biometric transportation \n     security card.\n       (4) An assessment of the administrative feasibility of \n     verifying that an individual has obtained a biometric \n     transportation security card described in paragraph (3) and \n     is serving under the authority of a license, certificate of \n     registry, or merchant mariners document described in \n     paragraph (1) on a vessel described in paragraph (3) to \n     provide such individual a credit towards the renewal of such \n     license, certificate of registry, or merchant mariners \n     document that is equal to the amount of fees paid by such \n     individual for such biometric transportation security card.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Small Marine Business and Fishing Guide Relief Act that Senator \nColeman is introducing today. This legislation will provide much-needed \nrelief to charter boat captains and other operators of small marine \nbusinesses in Maine by exempting them from having to obtain a \nTransportation Worker Identification Credential, or TWIC, which costs \n$132.50 for each employee.\n  Under current law, any individual who holds a Coast Guard license, as \nmost charter boat captains do, must also obtain a TWIC. The purpose of \nthe requirement was to ensure that port operators and the Coast Guard \ncould inspect a tamper-resistant identification document to verify the \nidentity of those who have access to secure areas of ports and large \nvessels.\n  Charter boat captains, however, do not have secure areas on their \nboats and usually do not need unescorted access to port facilities. \nTherefore, they have no need for a TWIC. For these small businesses, \nrequiring them to obtain a TWIC essentially amounts to an unnecessary \nand costly government regulation.\n  Many small businesses are struggling in these lean economic times, \nparticularly with high marine fuel prices and tourists who have less to \nspend their discretionary income on charter tours in the Gulf of Maine. \nWith these businesses' declining profit margins, they cannot afford an \nadditional $132 identification card for their employees.\n  Even with this exemption, charter captains with a Coast Guard license \nwill have undergone an extensive background check for the same crimes \nthat are reviewed when an individual applies for a TWIC. So waiving the \nTWIC requirement for them would not reduce the background information \navailable for review before these individuals are licensed as charter \ncaptains.\n  To be sure, the Transportation Worker Identification Credential will \nplay a critical role in our Nation's maritime security by limiting \naccess to secure areas of ports and large vessels. It must ``be \nimplemented, however, in a manner that does not unnecessarily and \nunproductively impede legitimate business operations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3381. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Commissioner of Reclamation, to develop water \ninfrastructure in the Rio Grande Basin, and to approve the settlement \nof the water rights claims of the Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San \nIldefonso, Tesuque, and Taos; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, during the previous session I introduced \nlegislation to address the funding of Indian water rights claims that \nare of utmost importance in the west, and in particular, within the \nState of New Mexico. Since that time many parties have met for \ncountless hours in New Mexico and here in Washington to address how \nthese claims could be resolved and finally settled. Rather than spend \ncountless hours in litigation, these groups have sat down and worked \nthrough these issues in a very productive manner.\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\n  As a result, today I am pleased to come before you to introduce, on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Bingaman, the Aamodt and Taos Pueblo \nIndian Water Rights Settlement Act of 2008. This legislation will \nresolve these long-standing Indian water rights claims within New \nMexico and authorize a source of Federal funding to resolve them.\n  The Aamodt litigation in New Mexico was filed in 1966 and is the \nlongest-standing litigation in the Federal judiciary system. The hard \nwork that each party put into the settlement process demonstrates that \nnegotiated settlements, with multiple parties working together, can \nbest determine how to allocate scarce water supplies among diverse \nparties in a way that does not curtail existing uses. This bill will \nresult in additional economic development and improved health benefits \nwithin these communities.\n  The resolution of these claims will not only improve the lives of \nmany within these communities by providing a safe and reliable water \nsupply, but will also improve the ability of New Mexico to effectively \nundertake water rights planning in the near and long-term future.\n  As I have stated before, the costs of not settling these claims in \nNew Mexico are dire. The legislation before us will ensure that our \nobligations to these communities are met and that they will have safe \nand reliable water systems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senator Domenici and I are \nintroducing a bill that I am pleased to say, will help end contentious \ndisputes over water rights claims in two long-standing general stream \nadjudications in northern New Mexico. The bill accomplishes this by \nauthorizing two Indian water rights settlements. The first is a \nsettlement involving the\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nwater rights claims of the Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque \nPueblos in the Rio Pojoaque stream system, north of Santa Fe. The \nsecond settlement resolves Taos Pueblo's water rights claims in the Rio \nPueblo de Taos stream system.\n  The Rio Pojoaque stream adjudication is known as the Aamodt case, and \nit's my understanding that it's the longest active case in the Federal \ncourt system nationwide. The case began in 1966, and since that time \nhas been actively litigated before the district court in New Mexico and \nthe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Forty years of litigation resolved \nvery little, certainly not what the parties accomplished by engaging \ndirectly with each other in an attempt to resolve their differences. \nThe Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act represents an agreement by the \nparties that will 1. secure water to meet the present and future needs \nof the four Pueblos involved in the litigation; 2. protect the \ninterests and rights of long-standing water users, including century-\nold irrigation practices; and 3. ensure that water is available for \nmunicipal and domestic needs for all residents in the Pojoaque basin. \nNegotiation of this agreement was a lengthy process and the parties had \nto renegotiate several issues to address local, State, and Federal \npolicy concerns. In the end, however, their commitment to solving the \nwater supply issues in the basin prevailed.\n  The Rio Pueblo de Taos adjudication is a dispute that is almost 40 \nyears old. Similar to the Aamodt case, little has been resolved by the \npending litigation. The parties have been in settlement discussions for \nwell over a decade but it was not until the last 5 years that the \ndiscussions took on the sense of urgency needed to resolve the issues \nat hand. The settlement will fulfill the rights of the Pueblo \nconsistent with the Federal trust responsibility, while continuing the \npractice of sharing the water necessary to protect the sustainability \nof traditional agricultural communities. The town of Taos and other \nlocal entities are also secure in their ability to access the water \nnecessary to meet municipal and domestic needs. The Taos Pueblo Indian \nWater Rights Settlement Act represents a commonsense set of solutions \nthat all parties to the adjudication have a stake in implementing.\n  Both settlements are widely supported in their respective \ncommunities. Moreover, the State of New Mexico, under Governor \nRichardson's leadership, deserves special recognition for actively \npursuing a settlement in both of these matters and committing \nsignificant resources so that the Federal Government does not have to \nbear the entire cost of these settlements. To the extent that going \nconcerns may exist by some remaining water users, I am committed to \ncontinuing the dialog about the value of these settlements.\n  This bill is critical for New Mexico's future. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate to see that it gets enacted \ninto law. The U.S. Supreme Court once characterized the Federal \nGovernment's responsibilities to Indian tribes as ``moral obligation of \nthe highest responsibility and trust.'' This bill is an attempt to \nensure that the Government lives up to that standard, and does so in a \nmanner that also addresses the needs of the Pueblos' neighbors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3382. A bill for the relief of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie \nRaymonde Toto; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Guy Privat Tape and his wife Lou Nazie \nRaymonde Toto. Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto are citizens of the Ivory Coast, \nbut have been living in the San Francisco area of California for \napproximately 15 years.\n  The story of the Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto is compelling and I believe \nthey merit Congress's special consideration for such an extraordinary \nform of relief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were subjected to numerous atrocities in the \nearly 1990s in the Ivory Coast. After participating in a demonstration \nagainst the ruling party, they were jailed and tortured by their own \ngovernment. Ms. Toto was brutally raped by her captors and several \nyears later learned that she had contracted HIV.\n  Despite the hardships that they suffered, Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were \nable to make a better life for themselves in the United States. Mr. \nTape arrived in the U.S. in 1993 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. Ms. \nToto entered without inspection in 1995 from Spain. Despite being \ndiagnosed with HIV, Ms. Toto gave birth to two healthy children, \nMelody, age 10, and Emmanuel, age 6.\n  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated \nthemselves to community involvement and a strong work ethic. They pay \ntaxes and own their own home in Hercules, California. They are active \nmembers of Easter Hill United Methodist Church.\n  Mr. Tape is the owner of a small business, Melody's Carpet Cleaning & \nUpholstery, which has four other employees. Unfortunately, in 2002, Mr. \nTape was diagnosed with urologic cancer. While his doctor states that \nthe cancer is currently in remission, he will continue to require life-\nlong surveillance to monitor for recurrence of the disease.\n\n  In addition to raising her two children, Ms. Toto obtained a \ncertificate to be a nurse's aide and currently works as a Resident Care \nSpecialist at Creekside Health Care in San Pablo, California. She hopes \nto finish her schooling so that she can become a Registered Nurse. She \nis currently taking classes at Contra Costa Community College. Ms. Toto \ncontinues to receive medical treatment for HIV. According to her \ndoctor, without access to adequate health care and laboratory \nmonitoring, she is at risk of developing life-threatening illnesses.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto applied for asylum when they arrived in the \nU.S., but after many years of litigation, the claim was ultimately \ndenied by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Although the regime which subjected Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto to \nimprisonment and torture is no longer in power, Mr. Tape has been \nafraid to return to Ivory Coast due to his prior association with \nPresident Gbagbo. Mr. Tape had previously sought to promote democracy \nand peace in the region in support of the current President Gbagbo's \nparty. However, in 2006 Mr. Tape publically distanced himself from \nPresident Gbagbo's government when he accused the party of violence and \ncorruption. As a result, Mr. Tape strongly believes that his family \nwill be targeted if they return to Ivory Coast.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to \nremain in the United States is the impact their deportation would have \non their two U.S. citizen children. For Melody and Emmanuel, the United \nStates is the only country they have ever known. Mr. Tape believes that \nif the family returns to Ivory Coast, these two young children will be \nforced to enter the army.\n  This bill is the only hope for this family to remain in the United \nStates. To send them back to Ivory Coast, where they may face \npersecution and inadequate medical treatment for their illnesses would \nbe devastating to the family. They are contributing members of their \ncommunity and have embraced the American dream with their strong work \nethic and family values. I have received approximately 50 letters from \nthe church community in support of this family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR GUY PRIVAT TAPE AND \n                   LOU NAZIE RAYMONDE TOTO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto shall each \n     be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa or for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence upon filing an application for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act \n     or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie \n     Raymonde Toto enters the United States before the filing \n     deadline specified in subsection (c), Guy Privat Tape and Lou \n     Nazie Raymonde Toto shall be considered to have entered and \n     remained lawfully in the United States and shall be eligible \n     for adjustment of status under section\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\n     245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for the issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees not later \n     than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an \n     immigrant visa or permanent residence to Guy Privat Tape and \n     Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by 2, during the \n     current or next following fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde \n     Toto under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto under section \n     202(e) of such Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Black Alliance for\n\n\n                                             Just Immigration,\n\n                                      Berkeley, CA, July 17, 2008.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I'm writing on behalf of Guy Privat \n     Tape and Raymond Tape and their three children. The Tape \n     family arrived in the United States in 1993 (husband) and \n     1995 (wife) as political refugees from the Ivory Coast. Both \n     of them were imprisoned, tortured and beaten, and Mrs. Tape \n     was repeatedly raped, while in the Ivory Coast. As a \n     consequence, she is HIV positive. They were very fortunate to \n     escape with their lives. On the facts, they seem to have a \n     strong case for political sanctuary since the same forces are \n     in power in their homeland.\n       Recently the Tape family received the terrifying notice \n     from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that on \n     August 6 they should report to be deported. It is outrageous \n     that our government is about to send this family into a \n     dangerous situation. And the impact upon the two children \n     will be devastating.\n       Please intervene and use your power to ask ICE to \n     reconsider their petition for political asylum. Thank you for \n     your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gerald Lenoir,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing this letter on behalf \n     of Guy Privat Tape and his wife, Lou Nazie Toto and their two \n     children. Guy Tape arrived in the United States in 1993 and \n     his wife, Lou Nazie Toto, arrived in 1995 as political \n     refugees from the Ivory Coast. In 1995 they applied for \n     political asylum.\n       They became members of Easter Hill United Methodist Church \n     in Richmond, California shortly after they arrived in the \n     United States and have been faithful and loyal members since \n     that time. They are the proud parents of two children who are \n     United States Citizens. Their daughter sings in the \n     children's choir and is a member of the children's usher \n     board.\n       Guy Tape is self employed and Lou Nazie Toto is employed as \n     a CNA (Nurse's Assistant). They own their own home and are \n     productive taxpayers.\n       The U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) is \n     deporting Guy Tape and his wife, Lou Nazie Toto, back to the \n     Ivory Coast on August 5, 2008. The United States government \n     will be returning this family back to the people who jailed \n     them, beat them.\n       I am asking you to please intervene and use your power to \n     ask ICE to reconsider this couple's petition for political \n     asylum.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Rev.

A bill to establish the Harriet Tubman National Historical \nPark in Auburn, New York, and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historical Park in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, \nMaryland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce The Harriet \nTubman National Historical Park and The Harriet Tubman Underground \nRailroad National Historical Park Act. I am joined by Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \nMikulski, and Mr. Schumer as original cosponsors.\n  The woman, who is known to us as Harriet Tubman, was born Araminta, \nMinty, Ross approximately 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland. She \nspent nearly 30 years of her life as a slave on Maryland's eastern \nshore. As an adult she took the first name Harriet, and when she was 25 \nshe married John Tubman.\n  Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. She did so in the dead \nof night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and wetlands that are a \nhallmark of Maryland's Eastern Shore. She did so alone, demonstrating \ncourage, strength and fortitude that became her hallmarks. Not \nsatisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned repeatedly for \nmore than 10 years to the places of her enslavement in Dorchester and \nCaroline counties where, under the most adverse conditions, she led \naway many family members and other slaves to their freedom. Tubman \nbecame known as ``Moses'' by African-Americans and white abolitionists. \nShe was perhaps the most famous and most important conductor in the \nnetwork of resistance known as the Underground Railroad.\n  During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union forces as a spy, a \nscout and a nurse. She served in Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina. \nShe is credited with leading hundreds of slaves from those slave states \nto freedom during those years.\n  Following the Civil War, Tubman settled in Auburn, New York. There \nshe was active in the women's suffrage movement, and she also \nestablished the one of the first incorporated homes for aged African-\nAmericans. In 1903 she bequeathed the home to the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Zion Church in Auburn. Harriet Tubman died in Auburn in 1913 \nand she is buried there in the Fort Hill Cemetery.\n  Slaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nwere skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of their \nowners. Not surprisingly, few of the structures associated with the \nearly years of Tubman's life still stand. The landscapes of the Eastern \nShore of Maryland, however, remain evocative of the time that Tubman \nlived there. Farm fields and forests dot the landscape, which is also \nnotable for its extensive network of tidal rivers and wetlands. In \nparticular, a number of properties including the homestead of Ben Ross, \nher father, Stewart's Canal, where he worked, the Brodess Farm, where \nshe worked as a slave, and others are within the boundaries of the \nBlackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped to \nfreedom, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in \nTalbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the \nplantation, are today protected by various conservation easements. Were \nshe alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that she \nknew intimately as she secretly led black men, women and children to \ntheir freedom.\n  In New York, on the other hand, many of the buildings associated with\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\nTubman's life remain intact. Her personal home, as well as the Tubman \nHome for the Aged, the church and rectory of the Thompson Memorial AME \nZion Episcopal Church, and the Fort Hill Cemetery are all extant.\n  In 1999, the Congress approved legislation authorizing a Special \nResource Study to determine the appropriateness of establishing a unit \nof the National Park Service to honor Harriet Tubman. The Study has \ntaken an exceptionally long time to complete, in part because of the \nlack of remaining structures on Maryland's Eastern Shore. There has \nnever been any doubt that Tubman led an extraordinary life. Her \ncontributions to American history are surpassed by few. Determining the \nmost appropriate way to recognize that life and her contributions, \nhowever, has been more difficult. Eventually, the Park Service came to \nrealize that determined that a Park that would include two \ngeographically separate units would be appropriate. The New York unit \nwould include the tightly clustered Tubman buildings in Auburn. The \nMaryland portion would include large sections of landscapes that are \nevocative of Tubman's time and are historically relevant. The Special \nResource Study will be finalized and released later this year.\n\n\n  The Harriet Tubman National Historical Park and The Harriet Tubman \n           Underground Railroad National Historical Park Act\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today establishes two parks. The \nHarriet Tubman National Historical Park includes important historical \nstructures in Auburn, New York. They include Tubman's home, the Home \nfor the Aged that she established, the African Methodist Episcopal AME \nZion Church, and the Fort Hill Cemetery where she is buried.\n  The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park \nincludes historically important landscapes in Dorchester, Caroline and \nTalbot counties, Maryland, that are evocative of the life of Harriet \nTubman. The Maryland properties include about 2,200 acres in Caroline \nCounty that comprise the Poplar Neck plantation that Tubman escaped \nfrom in 1849. The 725 acres of viewshed across the Choptank River in \nTalbot County would also be included in the Park. In Dorchester County, \nthe parcels would not be contiguous, but would include about 2,775 \nacres. All of them are included within the Blackwater National Wildlife \nRefuge boundaries or abut that resource land. The National Park Service \nwould not own any of these lands.\n  The bill authorizes $7.5 million in grants for the New York \nproperties for their preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration of \nthose resources.\n  The bill authorizes $11 million in grants for the Maryland section. \nFunds can be used for the construction of the State Harriet Tubman Park \nVisitors Center and/or for easements or acquisition of properties \ninside or adjacent to the Historical Park boundaries.\n  Finally, the bill also authorizes a new grants program. Under the \nprogram, the National Park Service would award competitive grants to \nhistorically Black colleges and universities, predominately Black \ninstitutions, and minority serving institutions for research into the \nlife of Harriet Tubman and the African-American experience during the \nyears that coincide with the life of Harriet Tubman. The legislation \nauthorizes $200,000 annually for this scholarship program.\n  Harriet Tubman was a true American patriot. She was someone for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just concepts. She lived those principles \nand shared that freedom with hundreds of others. In doing so, she has \nearned a nation's respect and honor. That is why I am so proud to \nintroduce this legislation, establishing the Harriet Tubman National \nHistorical Park and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Harriet Tubman National \n     Historical Park and Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \n     National Historical Park Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend section 11317 of title 40, United States \nCode, to require greater accountability for cost overruns on Federal IT \ninvestment projects; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr President, I rise today with my colleagues on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to introduce the \nInformation Technology Oversight Enhancement and Waste Prevention Act \nof 2008.\n  With a long name like that, you would hope that it is addressing a \nvery serious problem. Well I assure you, that it is.\n  Every year agencies spend billions of dollars on IT investments \nthat--if planned and implemented properly--can increase productivity, \nreduce costs, and improve efficiency. As everyone knows, information \ntechnology has become a cornerstone of the way we conduct business. \nJust look at the rise in popularity of Blackberries, not only outside \nthese walls, but right here in the Senate.\n  In fiscal year 2009, agencies are planning to spend almost $71 \nbillion to improve their financial systems for better reporting, \nstreamline their grant processes, and reduce wasteful paper \napplications. And this is a good thing.\n  However, the Government Accountability Office has reported for \nseveral years that many of these investments are poorly planned, poorly \nperforming--or in some cases--both. Yet, agencies continue to fund \nthese risky investments without any oversight or accountability. In \nfact, I was surprised to hear GAO report that $25.2 billion is at \ndanger of being wasted because agencies failed to properly plan or \nmanage their investments.\n  Mr. President, $25.2 billion may not be a very large sum of money \nwhen you compare it to what we spend every year, but I assure you that \nit is a very real sum of money to those families who can't pay for the \ngas they need to get to work, or who are struggling to put food on \ntheir table.\n  To illustrate my point further, this chamber had to include emergency \nfunding in the last supplemental appropriations bill to bail out the \nCensus Bureau's 2010 operations. They had been planning for more than a \ndecade to use advanced handheld computers to verify addresses and \nfollow up with households who don't send their census forms in on time. \nMy colleagues and I on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee heard, however, that Census Bureau officials failed to define \nwhat they need out of the handheld project and, as a result, the \ncontractor was having trouble delivering a product that could work. We \nheld two hearings to try and get to the bottom of the problem and find \na solution but, at the end of the day, the Census Bureau had to scrap \nthe handheld project and go with the same expensive and inefficient \n``pen and paper'' counting method that they have used for centuries. \nThe cost of this failure on the part of the Census Bureau is expected \nto total in the billions.\n  This extra money that the Census Bureau will need to spend between \nnow and 2010 could have been used to improve the quality of the final \ncount by outreaching to historically-undercounted groups. In fact, it \ncould have been used for any number of worthwhile purposes.\n  My colleagues and I on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, which I \nchair, have held three hearings on the issue of troubled IT projects \nnow, including one this morning. And what we've learned is that some \nagencies can't keep the expected cost of their investments down or \ndeliver on time as promised. Nor do these agencies, in many cases, have \nqualified IT experts they can turn to before a project spirals out of \ncontrol. The bill Senators Lieberman, Collins and I have put forward \ntoday addresses these issues.\n  Our bill starts by requiring agencies to inform Congress when an \ninvestment begins to see increased costs, schedule delays, or \nperformance deficiencies outside of 20 percent of the original plan.\n  Our bill would also require agencies to inform Congress if an \ninvestment exceeds 40 percent of their original plan, and require the \nagency head to conduct an analysis that determines whether we should \ncontinue to fund this investment or just pull the plug.\n  Many agencies today simply rewrite their plans when they run into \ntrouble. They don't tell Congress that anything is wrong and the \ntroubled projects just keep getting funded year in and year out.\n  Finally and perhaps most importantly, our bill recognizes that, many \ntimes, agencies lack the experience necessary to manage complex IT \ninvestments. To remedy this, we propose that OMB create what my staff \nand I have come to call an ``IT Strike Team.'' This team would be \ncomprised of known individuals inside and outside government who have \nrecords of successfully managing complex IT projects. If an agency or \nOMB recognizes that an investment is beginning to experience problems, \nthe team would come in make sure the project is brought online or \nscrapped before more money is wasted.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these important \nand necessary reforms enacted. I think I speak for all of us when I say \nthat investing in IT systems is important. But these investments \nshouldn't come with wasted time and money that they all too often \nbring. In tight fiscal times like these, we need to make sure the money \nwe do invest is spent wisely.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Carper in \nintroducing a bill that will improve agency performance and \nCongressional oversight of major Federal information-technology, IT \nprojects.\n  The well-publicized cost and performance problems with the Census \nBureau's handheld computers for the 2010 Census--with its troubling \nimplications for the next House reapportionment and for the allocation \nof Federal funds--represent only the most recent and conspicuous \nfailure in a long trail of troubles that also includes critical IT \nprojects like the FBI's virtual case file initiative. Former IBM \nexecutive and Carnegie-Mellon University technology expert Watts \nHumphrey makes the point succinctly: ``Software failures are common, \nand the biggest projects fail most often.''\n  During the 108th Congress, the Committee on Governmental Affairs \ninvestigated the botched automated recordkeeping project for the \nFederal employees' Thrift Savings Plan TSP. This project was terminated \nin 2001 after a\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\n4-year contract produced $36 million in waste that was charged to the \naccounts of TSP participants and beneficiaries. A second vendor needed \nan additional $33 million to bring the system online, years overdue and \ncosting more than double its original estimate.\n  In a 2004 letter from the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board \nto the Governmental Affairs Committee, the board characterized the \nproject as ``ill-fated `` and acknowledged the importance of careful \nplanning, task definition, communication, proper personnel, and risk \nmanagement--all of which were lacking on that project.\n  Large IT project failures have cost U.S. taxpayers billions of \ndollars in wasted expenditures. The waste is troubling, but even more \ntroubling is the fact that when Federal IT projects fail, they can \nundermine the Government's ability to defend the Nation, enforce its \nlaws, or deliver critical services to citizens. Again and again, we \nhave seen IT project failures grounded in poor planning, ill-defined \nand shifting requirements, undisclosed difficulties, poor risk \nmanagement, and lax monitoring of performance.\n  Unfortunately, as the Government Accountability Office, GAO, tells us \nin a new report, Federal IT projects still fall short in their use of \neffective oversight techniques to monitor development and to spot signs \nof possible trouble.\n  The GAO reports that the Federal Government will spend over $70 \nbillion in fiscal year 2008 on IT projects. Most of that spending is \nconcentrated in two dozen agencies that have 778 major projects \nunderway. These Federal entities range from Cabinet departments like \nCommerce, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, to agencies like NASA, the \nOffice of Personnel Management, and the Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  The GAO observes that ``Effectively managing projects involves \npulling together essential cost, schedule, and performance goals in a \nmeaningful, coherent fashion so that managers have an accurate view of \nthe program's development status.'' This set of goals becomes the \nproject ``baseline.''\n\n  When the GAO conducted a study of a random sample of those major \nFederal IT projects, however, they found that 85--nearly half the \nsample--had been ``rebaselined.'' Eighteen of those projects have been \nrebaselined three or more times. For example, the Department of Defense \nAdvanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System has been rebaselined four \ntimes; a Veterans Affairs Health Administration Center project has been \nrebaselined six times.\n  Rebaselining can reflect funding changes, revisions in project scope \nor goals, and other perfectly reasonable project modifications. But as \nthe GAO notes, ``[rebaselining] can also be used to mask cost overruns \nand schedule delays.'' All major Federal agencies have rebaselining \npolicies, but the GAO concludes that they are not comprehensive and \nthat ``none of the policies are fully consistent with best practices.''\n  The bill that Senator Carper and I are introducing will go far toward \naddressing the weaknesses identified by the GAO and will reduce the \nrisks that important Federal IT projects will drag on far beyond \ndeadlines, fail to deliver intended capabilities, or waste taxpayers' \nmoney. We are pleased to have Senators Lieberman, Coleman, and \nMcCaskill join us as cosponsors in this effort.\n  Our bill will improve both agency and Congressional oversight of \nlarge Federal IT projects. For all major investments, the bill requires \nagencies to track the earned value management index, a key cost and \nperformance measure, and to alert Congress should that measure fall \nbelow a defined threshold.\n  The bill requires additional reports to Congress as well as specific \ncorrective actions should those same indicators continue to worsen. \nFurther, because the bill's performance thresholds are based on \noriginal cost baselines, rebaselining can no longer serve as a tactic \nto hide troubled projects. If severe shortfalls remain uncorrected, the \nbill can even suspend commitment of funds to a project until the agency \ntakes the required corrective actions.\n  Our bill does not envision making Congress a micromanager of Federal \nprojects--especially in so complex a field as information technology. \nBut it will ensure that, for these important investments, agencies will \nbe required to track key performance metrics, inform Congress of \nshortfalls in those metrics, and provide Congress with followup \nreports, independent cost estimates, and analyses of project \nalternatives when the original projects have run off course.\n  The bill also provides that each covered agency identify to Congress \ntheir top mission-critical projects. Those ``core investments'' would \nbe subject to additional upfront planning, reporting, and performance \nmonitoring requirements. This will help ensure that agencies apply \nextra vigilance to these projects at the planning stage and not just \nwhen execution begins.\n  In addition to tracking cost and schedule slippage, agencies making \ncore IT investments must provide a complete ``business case'' that \noutlines the need for the project and its associated costs and \nschedules; produce a rigorous, independent, third-party estimate of the \nproject's full, life-cycle costs; have the agency CIO certify the \nproject's functional requirements; track these functional requirements; \nand report to Congress any changes in functional requirements, \nincluding whether those changes concealed a major cost increase.\n  To help agencies deliver IT projects on time and on budget, the bill \nalso provides two new support mechanisms.\n  First, agency heads would be required to establish an internal IT-\nmanagement program, subject to OMB guidelines, to improve project \nplanning, requirements development, and management of earned value and \nrisk.\n  Second, the Director of OMB and its E-Gov Administrator will be \nrequired to establish an IT strike force of experts and independent \nconsultants who can be assigned to help agencies reform troubled \nprojects. In addition, the E-Gov Administrator can recommend that \nagency heads mentor or replace an IT project manager, reinforce the \nmanagement team, terminate the project, or hire an independent \ncontractor to report on the project.\n  These and other provisions will help improve project planning, avoid \nproblems in project execution, provide early alerts when problems \narise, and promote prompt corrective action.\n  In projects where difficulties persist, our bill provides strong \nremedies. For projects that exhibit a performance shortfall of 20 \npercent or more, the agency head involved must not only alert Congress \nbut also provide a summary of a concrete plan of action to correct the \nproblem. If the shortfall exceeds 40 percent, agencies have 6 months to \ntake required remedial steps or else suspend further project spending \nuntil those steps are completed.\n  If the provisions of this bill had been in force during the past \ndecade, early indicators of trouble and prompt warnings to Congress \nmight have helped prevent much of the added cost, decreased \nfunctionality, and increased anxiety we now see surrounding the \nhandheld computers that were intended to streamline the 2010 Census. \nThe additional scrutiny of plans and costs required by this bill might \nhave saved some of the billions wasted on other IT projects that \nultimately landed on high-risk lists.\n  Our bill creates a measured, methodical plan to ensure that Federal \nagencies apply best practices to IT projects, supply timely reports of \nproblems, and devise corrective actions sooner rather than later. Our \nGovernment and our citizens will benefit from these improvements. I \nurge every Senator to support this constructive and bipartisan bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Burr, Mr. \n        Harkin, and Mr. Alexander):\n  S. 3385. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to the safety of the food supply; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the FDA Food \nSafety Modernization Act.\n  Yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for \nensuring the safety of about 80 percent of our food supply, announced \nthat it was one step closer to pinpointing the source of the current \nSalmonella Saintpaul outbreak. At first we were told tomatoes were the \nculprit. Then tomatoes were exonerated and jalapeno\n\n[[Page S7934]]\n\npeppers in south Texas were to blame. Now FDA is saying it has \ndiscovered a strain of the bacteria in Serrano peppers from a farm in \nTamaulipas, Mexico.\n  In the meantime, over three months have passed since the first \nreported case. At least 255 people have been hospitalized and two have \ndied because of the outbreak. The tomato industry faces tens of \nmillions of dollars in losses and a loss in consumer confidence. Some \nestimate that the economic impact may be as much as $100 to $500 \nmillion.\n  Over the last couple of years we have seen news headlines about E. \ncoli in spinach, pet food spiked with melamine, Salmonella-tainted \npeanut butter, and now contaminated peppers. It's clear that these are \nnot isolated cases but the product of a food safety system that is \noutdated, under-funded, and overwhelmed. Some of our most important \nfood safety statutes date back to the early 1900s. Standards have not \nbeen updated. The budgets of the agencies that act as watchdogs over \nthe system have eroded. We import more of our food than ever but we \ndon't have the systems in place to make sure this food is as safe as it \ncould be. All these shortcomings put consumers at unnecessary risk.\n  FDA is struggling to keep up. There are holes in its ability to \nprotect consumers from unsafe foods. For example, the Consumer \nProtection Safety Commission, the EPA, and even FDA with respect to \ninfant formula all have recall authority. But FDA is unable to pull any \nother contaminated food off the shelf when the company that makes it \nwill not. FDA can suggest a recall and most of the time companies \ncomply. But there are always bad actors and sometimes companies choose \nnot to recall their products because they are afraid of upsetting \nconsumer confidence or losing market share. In this case, FDA's hands \nare tied.\n  These are significant gaps in our food safety system that need to be \naddressed. We can and should do better.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce The FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act, along with Senators Gregg, Dodd, Burr, Harkin, and \nAlexander. This bill is a comprehensive, bipartisan effort that \naddresses some of the weaknesses in FDA's authorities and resources and \nupdates food safety standards to make important improvements in our \ncurrent food safety system. The bill includes a number of important \npreventive measures, such as increasing the frequency of FDA \ninspections of food facilities, especially high-risk facilities; \ndirecting FDA to set standards for fresh produce; and requiring the \nfood industry to control hazards in the food supply chain. It also \nenables FDA to more effectively respond to an outbreak by giving the \nagency new authorities to order recalls, shut down tainted facilities, \nand access records to track and trace food.\n  The food industry is one of the most important sectors of our \neconomy, generating more than $1 trillion annually in economic activity \nand employing millions of American workers. Food is also a deeply \npersonal experience, a part of our daily lives and our traditions and \nculture. For far too long Congress has gone without a comprehensive \nreview of our food safety laws. As long as we continue to do nothing, \nwe will pay the price for an outdated and ill-equipped food safety \nsystem.\n  I thank Senators Gregg, Dodd, Burr, Harkin, and Alexander for joining \nme in crafting this bill and urge my colleagues to support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto pain care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Pain \nCare Policy Act of 2008. I am pleased to have worked with my colleague, \nSenator Christopher Dodd, on this legislation which will help to \naddress barriers to pain care by enhancing coordination of research, \nimproving healthcare provider education and training, and elevating \npublic awareness of pain and pain management.\n  According to the American Pain Foundation, an estimated 75 million \nAmericans suffer from either chronic or acute pain. Pain is the most \ncommon reason that people access the health care system and persistent \npain can interfere with everyday life and make ordinary tasks seem \nimpossible. Severe chronic pain also can hinder sleep, work, and social \nfunctions. Due to its very nature as a prominent feature of many \nchronic conditions, pain is said to affect more Americans than \ndiabetes, heart disease and cancer combined.\n  Most pain can be relieved with proper treatment. This simple fact \nimplies that the pain problems of these countless Americans can be \neasily fixed. Unfortunately, many people in pain face considerable \nbarriers to accessing proper diagnosis, treatment, and management of \ntheir pain.\n  Health care professionals are, more often than not, inadequately \ntrained regarding pain assessment and management, making it difficult \nfor them to treat their patients' pain safely and effectively. As such, \nproviders may be unfamiliar with current research and guidelines for \nappropriate pain care. Further, health care professionals may be \nhesitant to prescribe pain medications for pain management due to lack \nof knowledge regarding regulatory policies.\n  To make worse the problem, the National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nour country's premier institution for biomedical research, currently \ndedicates less than 1 percent of its research budget to pain research. \nWorse yet, this research is spread across multiple Institutes and \ncenters without efficient coordination. Effective education is \ncontingent upon adequate research.\n  Patients may also create for themselves barriers to pain care and \nmanagement. As impractical as it seems, patients often do not tell \ntheir doctor about their pain because they do not want to complain or \nappear to be a nuisance. They also may avoid taking pain medicines \nbecause of addiction or dependency concerns which may be based on \nmisinformation due to lack of education.\n  The National Pain Care Policy Act of 2008 will help to identify these \nbarriers by authorizing an Institute of Medicine, IOM, Conference on \nPain Care to evaluate the adequacy of pain assessment, treatment and \nmanagement. The conference will establish an action agenda by which to \naddress barriers and improve education and training.\n  The bill also authorizes permanently the Pain Consortium at the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, to establish a coordinated clinical \nresearch agenda and promote pain research across NIH institutes, \ncenters, and programs. The Consortium will convene annual conferences \nto make recommendations on pain research and activities at the NIH. The \nlegislation also establishes a multidisciplinary Advisory Committee\n  The National Pain Care Policy Act of 2008 addresses the lack of pain \ncare education by creating a grant program for the development and \nimplementation of programs to educate and train health care \nprofessionals in pain assessment and management. It also requires the \nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, to collect evidence-\nbased practices regarding pain and disseminate such information to the \npain care community.\n  This bill also will break down barriers to pain care access by \nraising awareness among people who suffer from pain, and helping them \nand their families find the proper information about pain management. A \nnational pain management public outreach and awareness campaign will be \ndeveloped and implemented by the Department of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to focus on the significance of pain as a national \npublic health problem.\n  The National Pain Care Policy Act of 2008 contains provisions that \nwill help the millions of Americans who live everyday with pain by \nheightening awareness, enhancing coordination of research, and \nadvancing education. Similar legislation was introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives Lois Capps and Mike Rogers last year. The House bill is \nsupported by more than 100 organizations in the pain care community, \nincluding the America Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain \nMedicine, and the American Cancer Society. I thank Senator Dodd for his \nleadership on and interest in this issue, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Orrin Hatch, in introducing the National Pain Care Policy Act \nof 2008. This important legislation would make significant strides in \nthe understanding and treatment of pain as a medical condition. Pain is \nthe most common symptom leading to medical care and a leading health \nissue. Yet people suffering through pain often struggle to get relief \nbecause of a variety of issues. This is why we are introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  Each year pain results in more than 50 million lost workdays \nestimated to cost the United States $100 billion. Beyond the economic \nimpact, pain is a leading cause of disability, with back pain alone \ncausing chronic disability in 1 percent of the population of this \ncountry. In the United States 40 million people suffer from arthritis, \nmore than 26 million, ages 20 to 64, experience frequent back pain, \nmore than 25 million experience migraine headaches, and 20 million have \njaw and lower facial pain each year. It is estimated that 70 percent of \ncancer patients have significant pain as they fight the disease. And \nhalf of all patients in hospitals suffer through moderate to severe \npain in their last days. As with many medical conditions, this is a \nproblem that is likely to become worse as the baby boom generation \napproaches retirement and the population ages.\n  Sadly, though most pain can be relieved, it often is not. Many \nsuffering patients are reluctant to tell their medical provider about \nthe pain they are experiencing, for fear of being identified as a ``bad \npatient,'' and concern about addiction often leads patients to avoid \nseeking or using medications to treat their pain. But even if patients \nwere more forthcoming about their condition, few medical providers are \nequipped to do something about it. Often they have not been trained in \nassessment techniques or pain management, and are unaware of the latest \nresearch, guidelines, and standards for treatment. There is also \nconcern among most providers that prescribing treatment for pain will \nlead to greater scrutiny by regulatory agencies and insurers.\n  But we can do something about these barriers and help individuals \nsuffering from pain. The National Pain Care Policy Act would lead to \nimprovements in pain care across the country. The legislation would \ncall for an Institute of Medicine conference on pain care to increase \nawareness of this issue as a public health problem, identify barriers \nto pain care and determine action for overcoming those barriers. A \nnumber of years ago, my good friend Senator Hatch helped establish a \nPain Consortium at the National Institutes of Health to establish a \ncoordinated pain research agenda. This legislation will codify that \nconsortium and update its mission. The bill addresses the training and \neducation of health care professionals through new grant programs at \nthe Agency for Health Research and Quality, AHRQ, and the Health \nResources and Services Administration, HRSA. And finally this \nlegislation creates a national outreach and awareness campaign at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to educate patients, families, \nand caregivers about\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\nthe significance of pain and the importance of treatment.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this issue and \nurge my colleagues to join us on this important effort to help the \nmillions of Americans suffering from severe pain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3390. A bill to amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 \nto provide for the treatment of institutions of higher education as \nvoter registration agencies; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Student \nVoter Opportunity to Encourage Registration Act of 2008--the Student \nVOTER Act.\n  The success of America's experiment in democracy lies in broad \nparticipation and deep civic engagement. From the Reconstruction \nAmendments, to women's suffrage, to the abolition of the poll tax, and \nfinally the ratification of the 26th amendment, we have witnessed a \nsteady but difficult march toward a more inclusive nation.\n  To realize the full potential of these great strides, the Student \nVOTER Act provides a pathway to participation for America's youth.\n  The need for this bill is clear. Despite a small rise in youth voting \nin the current Presidential election cycle, the larger trend is \nunmistakable. Young voters--historically independent-minded--are far \nless likely to cast a ballot than older voters. In the 2004 \nPresidential election, only 47 percent of 18 to 24-year-old citizens \nvoted, compared to 66 percent of citizens 25 and older. This marked the \neighth straight Presidential contest in which less than half of these \nyoung Americans actually participated. In fact, the percentage of young \nAmericans who vote today is lower than it was in the first Presidential \nelection following the 26th amendment's ratification.\n  Several obstacles stand in the way of youth voting. Because so many \nstudents are first-time voters, they often are unfamiliar with how to \nregister. In some States, first-time voters must register in person in \norder to cast an absentee ballot. For students who attend college \noutside of their home State or who do not have access to \ntransportation, these requirements can be cumbersome, confusing, and \ninsurmountable.\n  Of course, apathy contributes to the fact that young voters tend to \nstay home on election day. But studies show that when an effort is made \nto reach out to young voters, they will cast a ballot. If we fail to \nreach out to the youth, we may lose a generation of civically minded \nAmericans.\n  Congress already tried to encourage youth voting with a provision in \nthe Higher Education Act of 1998, which requires colleges and \nuniversities to make a ``good faith effort'' to register students to \nvote. Many universities fulfill that obligation. For example, even \nbefore orientation begins, Brown University in Providence provides its \nstudents with voter registration materials not only for Rhode Island \nbut also for each student's home State.\n  Unfortunately, too many colleges and universities have failed to \nfollow Brown's lead. According to a 2004 Harvard University study, only \n17 percent of colleges and universities nationwide fully comply with \nthe Higher Education Act. The health of our democracy suffers as a \nresult.\n  The Student VOTER Act offers a straightforward solution: it requires \ncolleges and universities that receive Federal funds to offer voter \nregistration services to students. The Student VOTER Act simply amends \nthe National Voter Registration Act of 1993, popularly known as the \nMotor Voter Act, to designate colleges and universities that receive \nFederal funds as voter registration agencies.\n  That designation is fitting. Our institutions of higher education are \namong the wealthiest in the world, and they lead the globe in producing \nNobel laureates and scientific breakthroughs. But colleges and \nuniversities also have a special obligation to educate an active, \ninformed citizenry.\n  The act does not impose a heavy burden on colleges and universities. \nWe know this because the Student VOTER Act builds on the successful \nmodel of the Motor Voter Act, which brought voter registration to DMV \noffices across the country, adding 5 million voters--mainly \nindependents--to the rolls in the 8 months after its passage. While \nsome DMV offices simply mail completed registration forms to the \nappropriate clerk or registrar, others now use efficient, easy-to-use \ncomputer software to submit registrations electronically.\n  This means that the price tag of the Student VOTER Act to colleges \nand universities is at most a 42-cent stamp for each student. I know \nmost of my fellow Senators would agree that this is not too high a \nprice to pay for a lifetime of civic engagement.\n  In reality, costs should be even lower. Colleges and universities can \nprovide voter registration services at student orientation or during \nclass registration using the same technology that DMV offices already \nhave implemented.\n  Like the Motor Voter Act, this bill should pass with broad bipartisan \nsupport. It is a low-cost, commonsense solution to the very real \nproblem of low youth voter turnout. It represents a natural but modest \nextension of the Higher Education Act and the Motor Voter Act without \nchanging or amending any other State or Federal voting regulations in \nany way.\n  The bill may also serve to depoliticize voter registration efforts on \ncollege campuses. Polls consistently show that young voters are less \nlikely to identify with a political party than older voters. Polls \ngenerally show that more than 4 in 10 young voters identify as \nindependents, with roughly 3 in 10 young voters identifying with each \nof the two major political parties. In a July 30, 2008 letter sent to \nCongress in support of this bill, the U.S. Student Association \nexplained that under the present system, ``partisan student groups \noften become the main voter registrants, which can alienate undecided \nand independent voters. The Student VOTER Bill of 2008 seeks to \ninstitutionalize the dissemination of voting procedure and register \nmore young people in a systematic and non-partisan capacity.''\n  In addition to the U.S. Student Association, this bill is supported \nby U.S. PIRG and the Student Association for Voter Empowerment, SAVE. \nIn particular, I would like to recognize Matthew Segal, SAVE's founder \nand a Chicago native, with whom my office worked closely to prepare \nthis bill.\n  I would also like to applaud the efforts of Representative Jan \nSchakowsky, a Democrat, and Representative Steven LaTourette, a \nRepublican, who will introduce a companion bill today in the House of \nRepresentatives. The Student VOTER Bill of 2008 is a bipartisan effort \nthat is an important step toward empowering our Nation's youth.

A bill to promote conservation and provide for sensible \ndevelopment in Carson City, Nevada, and for\n\n[[Page S7948]]\n\nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Carson City Vital Community Act of 2008.\n  The origins of this legislation can be found in Carson City's \ncollaborative master planning effort, ``Envision Carson City.'' In \n2004, the elected officials in Carson City started a dialogue with \ntheir citizens to determine how the city should grow and change over \nthe next 20 years. At the end of a 2-year public process, city leaders \nhad a clear message from their residents. The community wants to keep \ngrowth compact, maintain the integrity of the Bureau of Land Management \n(BLM) and Forest Service lands surrounding the town, enhance open space \nopportunities and maintain easy access to public lands. The Carson City \nVital Community Act of 2008 was developed in close partnership with \nCarson City and other key stakeholders to help fulfill these goals.\n  Before I describe this legislation and its importance, it might be \nhelpful for me to explain that Carson City is both a city and a county. \nIt wasn't always this way. For over a hundred years the town of Carson \nCity was the county seat of Ormsby County. But in 1969 the county \ndissolved and the government functions were consolidated into what we \nnow simply call Carson City.\n  Like all but one of our counties in Nevada, Carson City is mostly \nFederal land. The town of Carson City is bounded on the west by Forest \nService lands that stretch to the shores of Lake Tahoe and by BLM lands \non the east. These open landscapes create a dramatic western backdrop \nfor Nevada's State capital but also mean that the Federal Government is \nintimately involved in what would normally be local community \ndecisions.\n  This legislation makes much needed adjustments to the pattern of \nFederal land ownership in Carson City. We have strived to make changes \nthat will improve the ability of the Federal land management agencies \nto focus on their core goals. All too often, the BLM and the Forest \nService are distracted from proper forest and range management by urban \nencroachment issues. We have a unique situation in Carson City where \nthe community has offered to take on the responsibilities of managing \nthe wildland-urban interface, while also offering to convey a major \ninholding to the Forest Service for incorporation into the Humboldt-\nToiyabe National Forest. This is a major step in the right direction \nand hopefully will serve as a model for other communities around the \nwest.\n  Our legislation also provides lands to the Washoe Tribe, \nstrengthening the Tribe's conservation and commercial efforts in Carson \nCity. Additionally, nearly 20,000 acres of BLM lands surrounding Carson \nCity will be permanently withdrawn from future develop to protect local \nviewsheds and public access. All of these actions will move Carson City \none step closer to realizing the vision that it worked hard to develop \nthrough a public process that has now spanned over four years.\n  Title I of this legislation aims to create a sensible land ownership \npattern in Carson City, aligned with the community's vision of keeping \ngrowth compact and maintaining the integrity of the surrounding public \nlands. It also addresses two serious concerns facing the community: \nwildfires in the foothills of the Sierras and flooding along the Carson \nRiver.\n  Under this title, roughly 2,200 acres of Carson City land will be \ntransferred to the Forest Service. This prime, forested land is far \nremoved from Carson City and is surrounded by state park lands and the \nHumboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. Incorporating this large inholding \ninto the Humboldt-Toiyabe will allow for improved management for \nwildlife habitat, watershed protection, and other important uses. It \nwill also ensure that the land remains undeveloped and open for public \naccess.\n  This title also makes important adjustments to the pattern of city \nand Federal lands on the west side of the town. Roughly 1,000 acres of \nForest Service land bordering urban areas will be conveyed to Carson \nCity as protected open space. This conveyance will let both Carson City \nand the Forest Service do what they do best. Carson City can more \nactively manage urban interface uses and the Forest Service can focus \non their core responsibilities of resource protection and forest \nhealth.\n  Proper management of this buffer area between Carson City's \nneighborhoods and businesses and the broader public lands is an issue \nof great concern to the community. On July 14, 2004, thirty-one homes \nand three businesses were destroyed or damaged in the Waterfall Fire \nwhich spanned nearly 9,000 acres of public and private land. Through \nour legislation, the Forest Service land that currently borders \nneighborhoods will be conveyed to Carson City, allowing the city to \ntake a more prominent role in managing fuel loads in this critical \narea.\n  There is a different threat on the east side of Carson Valley. The \nCarson River has a long history of dramatic flooding. Over the last 150 \nyears the river has flooded over 30 times, with half of those floods \ncausing extensive damage. Two 100-year flood events have struck just in \nthe last decade, one of which caused over $5 million in damage. In a \nshow of real vision and leadership, Carson City has started an \naggressive campaign to acquire land along the Carson River, recognizing \nthe value of protecting the natural function of the local floodplains.\n\n  Our legislation will enhance Carson City's efforts to acquire lands \nin the river corridor by conveying the 3,500-acre Silver Saddle Ranch \nand Prison Hill area from BLM to the city. Transferring these \nproperties to Carson City will help create a large regional park along \nthe Carson River, support the community's flood control efforts and \naddress the community's call for open space. The city has been a key \npartner in the management of the Silver Saddle Ranch for over a decade. \nAlong with the Friends of Silver Saddle, Carson City has taken the lead \non the day-to-day management of the property, including providing law \nenforcement patrols and caring for facilities.\n  It is important to note that when this land is conveyed to the city \nit will come with conditions. The Federal Government will hold a \nconservation easement on these parcels to ensure that the scenic and \nnatural qualities of the Silver Saddle Ranch and Prison Hill are \nprotected in perpetuity. The details of the conservation easement, \nwhich will focus on protecting the river corridor and the important \nwildlife habitat associated with the property, will be worked out by \nBLM, Carson City and key stakeholders like Friends of Silver Saddle and \nThe Nature Conservancy.\n  In addition to supporting Carson City's forward-looking plans for the \nCarson River and its floodplain, conveying the Silver Saddle and Prison \nHill area to Carson City also makes sense from a resource management \nperspective. BLM's Carson City District Office manages over 5 million \nacres of public land in western Nevada and eastern California. Their \nstrength is managing Nevada's wide open spaces--not urban interface. \nCarson City, on the other hand, has far more resources to bring to bear \nin managing the Silver Saddle Ranch and Prison Hill area. Carson City \nhas over 20 employees working on parks and open space, including two \npark rangers. They also have contracts in place with some of Nevada's \nmost respected natural resource experts. The BLM will also keep a light \nhand in the management of this property by virtue of the conservation \neasement.\n  There is one unique provision related to the Silver Saddle Ranch and \nPrison Hill conveyance that deserves special mention. A small section \nof this land was once owned by Carson City. This 62-acre property, \nknown as the Bernhard parcel, was slated to be subdivided into 35 home \nsites in 2001. The BLM and Carson City both recognized that the \nacquisition of this land was a priority for the protection of the \nCarson River corridor. Carson City responded quickly and acquired the \nparcel for open space before it could be developed. Their purchase \nprice in 2001 was roughly $1 million. Later, in 2006, the BLM purchased \nthe Bernhard parcel from Carson City for fair market value, which by \nthat time had reached $2.5 million.\n  Under this legislation, we transfer the Bernhard parcel back to \nCarson City as part of the Silver Saddle Ranch and Carson River Area. \nWe feel it is important that Carson City pay back 25 percent of the \n$1.5 million profit they made on their transaction with the\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\nBLM. Why just 25 percent? The 25 percent reflects the remaining value \nof the land that is being conveyed back to Carson City after the \nconservation easement is taken into account. In western Nevada, \nconservation easements restricting development typically reduce \nproperty values by anywhere from 75 percent to 90 percent. We have \nrequired Carson City to come up with 25 percent, the most generous \nestimate of remaining value for the Bernhard parcel. When received, \nthese funds will be placed into an endowment account for the BLM to use \nfor the monitoring and enforcement of the conservation easement on the \nSilver Saddle Ranch and Prison Hill Area.\n  Our legislation also conveys roughly 1,700 acres of BLM land to \nCarson City for recreation and public purposes and open space. These \nare scattered parcels of BLM land in and around Carson City that would \nbe used for primarily for parks, but also for flood control structures, \nmunicipal infrastructure like water tanks, and to give residents room \nto roam. Carson City already controls roughly a third of these acres \nthrough Recreation and Public Purpose Act leases. This bill would \nquickly and efficiently transfer these lands to the city.\n  Another provision of Title I deals with 53 acres of land that Carson \nCity acquired from BLM years ago, under the Recreation and Public \nPurposes Act. The city now believes the land is better suited for \ncommercial development. Although Carson City already owns these lands, \nby statute, if the city uses the land for something other than public \npurposes, the land reverts back to the BLM. Our legislation would \nremove the reversionary interest on these 50 acres so that Carson City \ncan sell the land at an appropriate time. If the City decides to sell \nthe land, we require that it be auctioned, with proceeds returning to \nthe Carson City special account which provides funding for federal \nacquisition of sensitive lands and protection of noted cultural \nresources.\n  One of the parcels where the federal interest would be released is \nhome to the Carson City Gun Club. Once on the edge of town, the \nshooting range is now surrounded by commercial development and the \nEagle Valley Golf Course. Although our legislation would allow Carson \nCity to sell this land, we have asked for and received a commitment \nthat Carson City will not sell this property until the shooting \nfacility has been relocated to another, more appropriate location.\n\n  The first title of our legislation also transfers 50 acres of Forest \nService land to the BLM. The Forest Service is also authorized to \ndevelop and implement, in partnership with Carson City, a plan for \nmanaging its land in a way that minimizes the impact of flood events on \nnearby residential areas.\n  Under Title II, 150 acres of federal lands would be made available \nfor sale through an open and competitive process. This includes the 50 \nacres transferred from the Forest Service to the BLM in Title 1. All of \nthe lands identified for sale in our legislation are isolated or \nseriously impacted by nearby commercial or residential development. \nBoth agencies have concluded that these parcels should be disposed of \nand that this action is consistent with their respective management \nplans.\n  Similar to past Nevada land bills, this legislation directs the \nSecretary of Interior to reinvest the proceeds of these limited land \nsales back into important public projects. Ninety-five percent of the \nproceeds will be used to acquire environmentally sensitive lands in \nCarson City and to protect archaeological resources. The remaining five \npercent of the proceeds will go to Nevada's general education program.\n  This title also permanently withdraws nearly 20,000 acres of BLM \nlands in Carson City from land sales and mineral development. These \nsame lands, located north and east of Carson City are already \nadministratively withdrawn by the BLM. This bill would make the \nwithdrawal permanent, preserving foothill views, open space and access \nto public lands, in line with ``Envision Carson City.''\n  Our bill also provides guidance that Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) use on \nBLM lands in Carson City should be restricted to existing roads and \ntrails until the BLM completes their travel management planning \nprocess. The Pine Nut Mountains east of Carson City are a favorite \ndestination for local and visiting OHV enthusiasts. This provision will \nbetter protect this area until routes can be designated.\n  Finally, the second title of the bill opens a new avenue for Carson \nCity to continue their conservation efforts along the Carson River. The \nSouthern Nevada Public Land Management Act (SNPLMA) will be amended to \nauthorize funds for Carson City to acquire land for parks and trails \nalong the Carson River and to authorize conservation initiatives, also \nalong the Carson River. In addition, we make a small change to SNPLMA \nwhich will only affect Washoe County. In the White Pine County bill of \n2006 (P. L. 109-432), Washoe County was given access to SNPLMA through \n2011 to acquire part of the Ballardini Ranch. The county has made good \nprogress towards this acquisition, but may not make the 2011 deadline. \nWe are pleased to extend the authorization to 2015.\n  Title III addresses the Washoe Tribe's pressing need for more land \nfor residential and commercial development. Tribal lands adjacent to \nboth of the colonies in Carson City, Stewart and Carson, would be \nexpanded by this legislation. Carson Colony tribal lands would grow by \nover 280 acres. On this parcel, the lands located below the 5,200-foot \nelevation contour would be available for residential or commercial \ndevelopment. The lands above the 5,200-foot contour would only be \navailable for traditional tribal uses, like ceremonial gatherings, \nhunting and plant collecting. Tribal lands at the Stewart Colony would \ngrow by only 5 acres, all of which would be available for commercial \nand residential development.\n  In 2003, Senator Ensign and I passed legislation that conveyed 25 \nacres of Forest Service land at Skunk Harbor, on the shores of Lake \nTahoe, to the Washoe Tribe. Unfortunately, the parcel was not \naccurately described in the legislation and consequently the land that \nwas conveyed did not fully reflect our commitment to the Tribe. This \nbill includes a technical correction that will provide a long overdue \nfix to the Washoe Indian Tribe Trust Land Conveyance (P. L. 108-67).\n  Lastly, this bill directs the Forest Service to develop a cooperative \nagreement with the Washoe Tribe to ensure the Tribe's access across \nForest Service land for their traditional ``lifeway'' walk to Lake \nTahoe. For centuries the Washoe people have moved from the Pine Nut \nMountains east of Carson City in the fall to Lake Tahoe in the summer. \nOur legislation ensures that they are able to continue this important \ntradition.\n  This bill, is built on years of public input. We believe it is a \nmodel piece of legislation and appreciate the support of our colleagues \nin this effort. We look forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, \nRanking Member Domenici and the other distinguished members of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to move this bill forward during \nthe time we have remaining in this legislative session.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for marginal well production preservation \nan enhancement; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, a marginal well is defined as one which \nproduces 15 barrels or less of oil per day. Yet, according to the \nInterstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, IOGCC, these marginal wells \ncontribute nearly 18 percent of the oil and 9 percent of the natural \ngas produced in America.\n  In fact, marginal wells produced more than 335 million barrels of oil \nin 2006. That's equivalent to more than 60 percent as much as the \nUnited States imports annually from Saudi Arabia or 67 percent as much \nas the Nation imports annually from Venezuela. In my own State of \nOklahoma, it is the small independents, basically mom-and-pop \noperations, that produce the majority of oil and natural gas, with 85 \npercent of Oklahoma's oil coming from marginal wells.\n  In addition to reducing our dependence on foreign oil, a producing \nwell provides both State and Federal taxes, pays royalties to land and \nmineral owners, and keeps jobs and dollars on American soil and in \nAmerican pockets. A plugged well provides none of this. On the \ncontrary, the IOGCC reported that in 2006, plugged and abandoned \nmarginal wells resulted in the loss of $1.77 billion in economic \noutput, $369.2 million in earnings reductions, and 8,223 lost jobs.\n  These statistics testify to the importance of America's marginal well \nproduction. With gasoline prices at record highs, Congress must ensure \nthat government policies do not discourage, and instead prolong and \nenhance, production from these low volume wells.\n  That is why today I am glad to join with my fellow Oklahoman, \nCongressman Dan Boren, to introduce the Marginal Well Production \nPreservation and Enhancement Act. This bill will streamline and clarify \ngovernment regulations, prolong economic feasibility, and enhance \nproduction volumes from marginal wells. Every onshore oil and gas well \nin the Nation eventually declines into marginal production. The \nMarginal Well Production Preservation and Enhancement Act ensures that \nthe Nation's policies recognize and reflect the economic importance of \nmarginal well production. It's good for America's small producers, as \nwell as America's consumers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Casey):\n  S. 3396. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants or contracts for prescription drug education and outreach for \nhealthcare providers and their parents; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Independent \nDrug Education and Outreach Act. Over the past year, the Committee on \nAging has been taking a close look at the relationship between the \npharmaceutical industry and our Nation's physicians. Not only does the \ninteraction between these two parties seem to be fraught with conflicts \nof interest, but it is likely that the marketing methods employed by \ndrug companies--and the manner in which they educate doctors about \ntheir products--have an impact on the rising costs of prescription \ndrugs in America.\n  When it comes to knowing what treatment options are available to \ndoctors, pharmaceutical sales reps are currently one of the most common \nways physicians learn about the latest drugs on the market. However, \nthese sales reps often seem to confuse educating with selling, and \nevidence shows that doctors' prescribing patterns can be heavily \ninfluenced by the sometimes biased information handed out by these \nsales representatives.\n  The Independent Drug Education and Outreach Act offers an alternative \nmethod of providing information to doctors. It's called academic \ndetailing, and we believe it can have a positive impact on both quality \nand cost of healthcare nationwide. Academic detailing provides \nphysicians and other prescribers with an objective source of unbiased \ninformation on all prescription drugs, based on scientific research \ncertified by HHS. The information is presented to doctors in their own \noffices by trained clinicians and pharmacists. Academic detailing \nensures that physicians have access to the most comprehensive data \navailable on drug safety of the full array of pharmaceutical treatment \noptions, including low-cost generic alternatives.\n  The proposed legislation would provide two sets of grants. The first \ngrant program would create educational materials for doctors on the \nsafety, efficacy, and cost of prescription drugs, including generic \ndrugs and over-the-counter alternatives. A second set of up to ten \ngrants would be used to dispatch trained medical staff--such as \npharmacists, nurses, and other health care professionals--into \nphysicians' offices to distribute and discuss the independent \ninformation. To ensure their neutrality, all grant recipients would be \nprohibited from receiving financial support from drug manufacturers.\n  When doctors are better informed about the full range of drugs \navailable on the market, they are more likely to prescribe the most \neffective treatment, as opposed to the latest brand-name blockbuster \ndrug. The result is also lower health care costs. A study in the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine projected that for every dollar spent on \nacademic detailing, two dollars can be saved in drug costs, due in part \nto the increased use of generic drugs. In this way, a Federal academic \ndetailing program will likely pay for itself, while saving the \ngovernment, consumers, and employers a considerable amount of money.\n  I would like to thank my cosponsors in the Senate, Majority Whip Dick \nDurbin, HELP Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy, and Senator Bob Casey. I \nwould also like to thank Representatives Henry Waxman and Frank \nPallone, who are introducing a companion bill today in the House. We \nstand together with the goal of providing doctors with unbiased \ninformation on prescription drugs, and ensuring Americans receive the \nquality health care they deserve.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Prescription drugs can restore health, prevent illness, \nand extend lives. But deciding whether to prescribe a drug, and which \none, requires a careful balancing of potential benefits, risks, and \ncosts.\n  Prescribing should not be determined by how heavily a drug is \npromoted by a pharmaceutical company. Sadly, this is largely what \nhappens today.\n  Our health care system does not generate objective, easy-to-access \ninformation for doctors to guide them when it comes to prescribing \noptions.\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n  New drugs are constantly entering the marketplace, but there's very \nlittle objective information about what drug might be marginally safer \nor more effective than existing drugs.\n  Even the most vigilant doctors would be challenged to monitor the \ndozens of medical journals that could contain a helpful study comparing \nthe safety and effectiveness of drugs.\n  The pharmaceutical industry has taken advantage of this information \nvoid.\n  It spends about $7 billion a year marketing to physicians and sends \nover 90,000 sales representatives, called detailers, to pitch their \ncompany's latest and most expensive drugs.\n  What the drug industry is doing is not education. It is promotion. \nAnd there's a big difference between the two.\n  The drug company sales representatives are hired more for their \ncharisma than their scientific knowledge, and they provide doctors with \ninformation skewed to portray their company's product in the most \nfavorable light.\n  The sales representatives arrive with free lunches and free drug \nsamples. Lucrative speaking and consulting fees are possible for \ndoctors who change their prescribing to the liking of a drug company.\n  The consequence of such a system is clear: an over-reliance on \nprescribing the latest, most expensive drugs even when existing drugs \nare as effective, as safe, or cost less.\n  The pain-reliever Vioxx provides a cautionary tale of what can happen \nwhen marketing prowess trumps evidence-based medicine.\n  Heavy marketing quickly made Vioxx a blockbuster drug with $3 billion \na year in sales, despite a lack of evidence that it could provide any \ngreater pain relief for most patients than Advil and despite early \nindications that it increased the risk of heart attacks. Many Americans \nneedlessly paid more and placed themselves at risk because the benefits \nof Vioxx were oversold and the risks minimized.\n\n  Another example is the marketing of calcium-channel blockers in \n1990s. Heavy marketing increased the sales of the new patent-protected \ncalcium-channel blockers but decreased sales of other blood-pressure \ndrugs, such as thiazide diuretics and betablockers, that were cheaper \nand often more effective.\n  A more recent example is the cholesterol drug Vytorin. The new drug \nhas been heavily marketed since it was introduced in 2004. But a study \nreleased earlier this year did not find that Vytorin was any better at \nlimiting plaque buildup in the arteries than Zocor, an older \ncholesterol drug that recently came out in a lower-priced generic form.\n  We have to find a better way to educate physicians about prescription \ndrug options and fill the void of medical information that the drug \nindustry is now taking advantage of.\n  Part of the solution is academic detailing, an idea first developed \nby Jerry Avorn, a physician at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and \nWomen's Hospital in Boston.\n  Academic detailing programs use some of the marketing tools that the \ndrug industry has used so effectively, such as office visits to \nphysicians and easy-to-read materials, but employs them to promote \nappropriate prescribing, based on an objective analysis of the medical \nliterature.\n  These programs--which send trained nurses and pharmacists, armed with \nunbiased information, to doctors' office--have been shown to generate \n$2 in savings for every $1 that it costs to implement them.\n  Pennsylvania's PACE program is the State's pharmacy assistance \nprogram for low- and moderate-income seniors, and it runs the most \nnotable publicly funded academic detailing program.\n  The PACE academic detailing program has reduced costs associated with \nthe overuse of Nexium, an acid-reflux drug for which there are similar \nlower-cost alternatives, and reduced the use of Cox-2 inhibitors such \nas Vioxx.\n  Today, I am joining Senator Kohl and Senators Kennedy and Casey in \nintroducing legislation that would promote additional academic \ndetailing programs.\n  The Independent Drug Education and Outreach Act would provide funds \nto medical schools, schools of pharmacies, and others for the \ndevelopment of educational materials based on what unbiased, peer-\nreviewed medical literature says about appropriate prescribing for a \nparticular condition.\n  The bill also would provide funds to ten governmental or non-profit \ngroups to train nurses and pharmacists and to send them to physician \noffices to present and discuss this information directly with \nphysicians.\n  The bill includes protections against financial conflicts of interest \nand calls on the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality to review \nthe accuracy of the information provided to doctors.\n  The Independent Drug Education and Outreach Act would begin to fix \none of the glaring shortcomings of our current health care system: the \nlack of a systematic way of disseminating information on the relative \nbenefits, risks, and costs of various treatment options directly to \ndoctors.\n  When it comes to prescription drugs, newer isn't necessarily better. \nIn many cases, they are not.\n  We can no longer afford to rely on drug company salespersons to be \ndoctors' primary source of information about new drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse)):\n  S. 3398. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to liability under State and local requirements respecting \ndevices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Medical Device Safety Act. This legislation reverses \nthe Supreme Court's erroneous decision in Riegel v. Medtronic. There, \nthe Court misread a statute designed to protect consumers by giving the \nFood and Drug Administration the authority to approve medical devices \nas preempting state tort claims when a medical device causes harm. \nRiegel prevents consumers from receiving fair compensation for injuries \nsustained, medical expenses incurred and lost wages, and it must be \nreversed.\n  Congressional action should be unnecessary. When Congress passed the \nMedical Device Amendments, or MDA, in 1976, it did so ``[t]o provide \nfor the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human \nuse.'' In other words, Congress passed the MDA precisely to protect \nconsumers from dangerous medical devices. Toward that end, Congress \ngave the FDA the authority to approve, prior to a product entering the \nmarket, certain medical devices. For over 30 years the MDA has been in \neffect, and over that period FDA regulation and tort liability have \ncomplemented each other in protecting consumers.\n  Given the MDA's purpose, and the fact it has operated successfully \nfor 30 years, I was disheartened to find the Court twist the meaning of \nthe statute to strip from consumers all remedies when a medical device \nfails. In contorted logic, the Court found that the FDA's requirements \nin approving a medical device preempted state laws designed to ensure \nthat manufacturers marketed safe devices. In other words, the Court \nbelieves that a company's responsibility to its patients ends when it \nreceives FDA approval. I strenuously disagree.\n  In fact, there is absolutely no evidence that Congress intended that \nunder the MDA, consumers would lose their only avenue for receiving \ncompensation for injuries caused by negligent or inadequately labeled \ndevices. Not a single member or committee report articulated the view \nthat the statute would preempt state tort law.\n  Nevertheless, because of the Court's decision, it is imperative that \nCongress act to ensure that those harmed by flawed medical devices can \nseek compensation. The bill introduced today addresses the Court's \naction by explicitly stating that actions for damages under state law \nare preserved. Specifically, it amends section 521 of the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act to state that the section shall not be construed \nto modify or otherwise affect any action for damages or the liability\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\nof any person under the law of any State. And, the bill applies \nretroactively to the date of the enactment of the MDA, consistent with \nCongress's intent when it passed that act over 30 years ago. \nPractically, that means that it applies to cases pending on the date of \nenactment of this legislation or claims for injuries sustained prior to \nenactment.\n  The harm from Riegel, unless Congress acts, cannot be more real. Take \nRiegel itself. In 1996, Charles Riegel had an angioplasty performed on \nhis right coronary artery. During the procedure, Mr. Reigel's surgeon \nused Medtronic's Evergreen Balloon Catheter. The catheter burst inside \nMr. Reigel's artery, causing him severe and permanent injuries and \ndisabilities.\n  Under our system of law, when someone is injured, he or she can \nnormally seek redress from the entity that caused him or her harm. Yet, \nbecause of the Court's decision, Mr. Riegel and his wife will receive \nno compensation for the defective design and inadequate warning.\n  It is not just Mr. Riegel. In 2002, Gary Despain was implanted with a \ndefective hearing aid Soundtec manufactured. While working as a welder, \nhe suffered damage to his right ear, apparently as a result of \ninterference between a magnet in his hearing device and some electronic \nwelding equipment being used in the plant. The device caused severe \nringing in his ear, but the labeling for the device failed to warn of \nthis potential risk. Mr. Despain had to have the device surgically \nremoved and he remains unemployed and disabled as a result of the \ndevice.\n  Nevertheless, two weeks after the Court's Riegel decision, Mr. \nDespain's lawsuit against Soundtec was dismissed and Mr. Despain has no \nability to seek remedies for his injuries.\n  The result of Riegel, therefore, is that in the event the FDA does an \ninadequate job of inspecting and assuring the safety of medical \ndevices--and because tort actions are now precluded--then consumers are \nleft at extreme risk.\n  While FDA approval of medical devices, moreover, is important, it \ncannot be the sole protection for consumers. FDA approval is simply \ninadequate to replace the long-standing safety incentives and consumer \nprotections that state tort law provides.\n  As a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension \nCommittee, which has oversight over FDA, I have worked hard to ensure \nthat the FDA performs its job. No matter how effective the FDA is, \nhowever, the FDA simply cannot guarantee that no defective, dangerous \nand deadly medical device will reach consumers. As the former Director \nof the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health acknowledged, \nthe FDA's ``system of approving devices isn't perfect, and that \nunexpected problems [with approved devices] do arise.'' In 1993, a \nHouse report identified a ``number of cases in which the FDA [had] \napproved devices that proved unsafe in use.''\n\n  The fact is, the FDA conducts the approval process with minimal \nresources and simply does not have adequate funds to genuinely ensure \nthat devices are safe or to properly and effectively reevaluate \napprovals as new information becomes available.\n  Further, the FDA approval process is based on partial information. A \nprincipal shortcoming is that the device's manufacturer compiles the \nstudies and data supporting an application, and the data is often \nunreliable. And, the FDA does not conduct independent investigations \ninto a device's safety. A manufacturer, moreover, is not required to \nsubmit information about development of the device, including \nalternative designs, manufacturing methods and labeling possibilities \nthat the manufacturer considered, but rejected.\n  In 1993, an FDA committee found flaws in the design, conduct and \nanalysis of the clinical studies used to support applications that were \n``sufficiently serious to impede the agency's ability to make the \nnecessary judgments about [device] safety and effectiveness.'' It \nadded, ``[o]ne of the main reasons [problems arise after approval] is \nthat the data upon which we base our safety and effectiveness decisions \nisn't perfect.'' Likewise, in 1996, the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services reported ``serious deficiencies \n. . . in the clinical data submitted as part of pre-market \napplications.''\n  FDA review, moreover, is a one-time event with no reevaluation and \nvery little FDA oversight once a device reaches doctors and patients. \nIn fact, even the best-designed and most reliable clinical studies by \ntheir very nature cannot duplicate all aspects and hazards of everyday \nuse. Moreover, while manufacturers are supposed to report defects and \ninjuries, the FDA has admitted that there is ``severe underreporting'' \nof defects and injuries.\n  Given the FDA's limitations, it is crucial that an individual have a \nright to seek redress. When defective medical devices reach the market, \nwhether or not approved by the FDA, patients are often injured. Those \ninjured are often left temporarily unable to work or to enjoy normal \nlives, and in many cases never fully recover. State tort law provides \nthe only relief for patients injured by defective medical devices and \nshould not be foreclosed.\n  Not only does access to State court mean that a person injured can \nreceive fair compensation, but there are other advantages. Such suits \naid in exposing dangers and serve as a catalyst to address their \nconsequences. Through discovery, litigation can help uncover previously \nunavailable information on adverse effects of products that might not \nhave been caught during the regulatory system. Litigants can demand \ndocuments and information on product risks that might not have been \nshared with the FDA. In this way, the public as a whole is alerted to \ndangers in medical products.\n  Finally, providing the ability to sue when injured provides an \nimportant incentive to manufacturers to use the utmost care. \nAdditionally, threat of product liability suits creates continuing \nincentives for product manufacturers to improve the safety of their \ndevice, even after FDA approval.\n  The Court fundamentally misread Congress's intent in passing the \nMedical Device Amendments in 1976, and Reigel represents yet another \nvictory by big business over consumers. Those injured, however, deserve \nto have their day in court and are entitled to compensation when they \nare injured by faulty medical devices, have medical expenses to pay and \nlost wages, regardless of whether FDA approved a device or not. We must \nreverse this erroneous decision and ensure that those who have suffered \nserious injury at the hands of others receive justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Smith, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Chambliss, \n        Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3399. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the reduction in the rate of tax on qualified timber gain of \ncorporations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the Timber Revitalization and Economic Enhancement Act II of \n2008 with my good friend, Senator Smith of Oregon. I also want to say a \nspecial thanks to our cosponsors, Senators Cantwell, Murray, Dole, \nChambliss, Cornyn, Landrieu, Wicker and Vitter.\n  This legislation has commonly been referred to as the TREE Act. I \nappreciate that Congress understood the importance of the TREE Act with \nits inclusion and enactment in the Farm Bill earlier this year. But, \nunfortunately, this tax policy is already set to expire in less than \none year. So today, my colleagues and I introduce the TREE Act II to \nmake this important forest policy permanent.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, the est products industry is a \nfoundation of our economy and culture. More than 50 percent of Arkansas \nland is forested. Much of this is sustainably managed to create \nproducts we use every day. In addition, there are jobs associated with \nthe growing of these forests and manufacture of these great products. \nMore than 32,000 Arkansas men and women work in our woods, at our \nsawmills and in our paper mills. These are good jobs located in our \nsmall rural towns.\n  However, these jobs and this industry continue to face many \nchallenges. The TREE Act II addresses one of these challenges. Just as \nit is important to have diversity in our forests, it is also important \nto maintain diversity in our forestry industry, and we must ensure\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\nthat all business forms have the necessary tools so they can be \nsuccessful in the global marketplace. Timber companies that are \norganized as corporations continue to be under intensifying pressure to \nreorganize. In that case, a corporation that owns substantial \nmanufacturing facilities would be forced to sell some of those \nfacilities and to make other structural changes in order to comply with \nthe relevant tax rules that it would newly become subject to. This \nwould be likely to cause disruptions in some of these communities and \nalso would make it harder for U.S. companies to compete \ninternationally.\n  In Arkansas, like so many other States across our Nation, a strong \nforest product industry is essential to having a strong economy. A \npermanent solution to the TREE Act II is imperative for this industry \nand supporting the jobs it provides. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to ensure this important tax \npolicy is made permanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3405. A bill to prohibit secret modifications and revocations of \nthe law, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, the junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Whitehouse, and I will introduce the Executive Order \nIntegrity Act of 2008. The bill prevents secret changes to published \nExecutive Orders by requiring the President to place a notice in the \nFederal Register when he has modified or revoked a published Order. \nThrough this simple measure, the bill takes an important step toward \nstemming the growth of secret law in the executive branch.\n  The principle behind this bill is straightforward. It is a basic \ntenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law. \nIndeed, the notion of ``secret law'' has been described in court \nopinions and law treatises as ``repugnant'' and ``an abomination.'' \nThat is why the laws passed by Congress have historically been matters \nof public record.\n  But the law that applies in this country includes more than just \nstatutes. It includes regulations, the controlling legal \ninterpretations of courts and the executive branch, and certain \nPresidential directives. As we learned at a hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Constitution Subcommittee that I chaired in April, some of \nthis body of executive and judicial law is increasingly being kept \nsecret from the public, and too often from Congress as well. The Bush \nadministration has concealed Department of Justice legal opinions, \ninterpretations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and \neven the agency rule that requires Americans to show identification at \nairports.\n  The shroud of secrecy extends to Executive Orders and other \nPresidential directives that carry the force of law. The Federal \nRegister Act requires the President to publish any Executive Orders \nthat have general applicability and legal effect. But through the \ndiligent efforts of my colleague Senator Whitehouse, we learned last \nDecember that the Department of Justice has taken the position that a \nPresident can ``waive'' or ``modify'' any Executive Order without any \nnotice to the public or Congress--simply by not following it. In other \nwords, even in cases where the President is required to make the law \npublic, the President can change the law in secret.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel memorandum that contains this position is \nstill classified, but Senator Whitehouse convinced the Department of \nJustice to declassify certain statements in the memorandum. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island spoke on the floor last December, and many times \nsince then, about these statements. They include the statement that \n``[w]henever [the President] wishes to depart from the terms of a \nprevious executive order,'' he may do so, because ``an executive order \ncannot limit a President.'' And he doesn't have to change the executive \norder, or give notice that he's violating it, because by ``depart[ing] \nfrom the executive order,'' the President ``has instead modified or \nwaived it.''\n  Now, no one disputes that a President can withdraw or revise an \nExecutive Order at any time; that is every President's prerogative. But \nabrogating a published Executive order without any public notice works \na secret change in the law. Worse, because the published Order stays on \nthe books, it actively misleads Congress and the public as to what the \nlaw is.\n  This is not just a hypothetical problem dreamed up by the Office of \nLegal Counsel. It has happened, and it could happen again. To list just \none example, the administration's warrantless wiretapping program not \nonly violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; it was \ninconsistent with several provisions of Executive Order 12333, the \nlongstanding executive order governing electronic surveillance and \nother intelligence activities. Apparently, the administration believed \nits actions constituted a tacit amendment of that Executive Order. And \nwho knows how many other Executive Orders have been secretly revoked or \namended by the conduct of this Administration.\n  The bill that Senator Whitehouse and I will introduce provides a \nsimple solution to this problem. If the President revokes, modifies, \nwaives, or suspends a published Executive Order or similar directive, \nnotice of this change in the law must be placed in the Federal Register \nwithin 30 days. The notice must specify the Order or the provision that \nhas been affected; whether the change is a revocation, a modification, \na waiver, or a suspension; and the nature and circumstances of the \nchange. If information about the nature and circumstances of the change \nis classified, it is exempt from the publication requirement, but the \ninformation still must be provided to Congress so that we, as \nlegislators, know how the law has been changed.\n  That is what our bill does; now let me talk briefly about what our \nbill does not do. First, it does not expand the existing legal \nrequirements, under the Federal Register Act, that determine which \nExecutive Orders must be published. To the extent the Federal Register \nAct permits a certain amount of ``secret law'' in the form of \nunpublished Executive Orders, our bill leaves that framework in place.\n  Second, our bill does not require public notice when the President \nrevokes or modifies an unpublished Executive Order--even if the \nsubstance of the unpublished order is well-known to Congress and even \nthe American people. This bill is narrowly aimed at the situation in \nwhich the American people have been given official notice of one \nversion of the law, but a different version is being implemented.\n  Third, the bill does not require the President to adhere to the terms \nof an Executive Order. Many scholars have argued that a President must \nadhere to a formally promulgated Executive Order unless or until the \nOrder is formally withdrawn or amended, just as the head of an agency \nmust adhere to the agency's regulations. I happen to agree. But this \nbill does not take a position on OLC's assertion that any deviation \nfrom the Executive Order by the President is a permissible amendment of \nthat Order. It simply requires public notice that the amendment has \noccurred.\n  Fourth, the bill does not require the publication of classified \ninformation about intelligence sources and methods or similar \ninformation. The basic fact that the published law is no longer in \neffect, however, cannot be classified. On rare occasions, national \nsecurity can justify elected officials keeping some information secret, \nbut it can never justify lying to the American people about what the \nlaw is. Maintaining two different sets of laws, one public and one \nsecret, is just that--deceiving the American people about what law \napplies to the government's conduct.\n  I commend Senator Whitehouse for his tireless work to bring this \nissue to light, and I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this modest effort to ensure the integrity of our published \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the intent and protections of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990; read the first time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Hatch, \nObama, and McCain in introducing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. This \nbipartisan legislation will allow us to advance and fulfill the \noriginal promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was \nsigned into law 18 years ago this month.\n  I am especially grateful to the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, for his partnership and leadership in helping to \ncraft our bill here in the Senate and to Senator Kennedy for his \ncareer-long leadership in fighting for the rights of people with \ndisabilities. Senator Kennedy has worked from the beginning to help \ncraft this bill.\n  This bill is similar to bipartisan legislation introduced in the \nother body by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Congressman Jim \nSensenbrenner. That bill passed by a 402-17 margin last month.\n  I am also grateful that, from the outset, these bills have been \nconceived and crafted in a spirit of genuine bipartisanship, with \nmembers of both parties coming together to do the right thing for all \nAmericans with disabilities.\n  Of course, passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act was also a \nbipartisan effort. As chief sponsor in the Senate, I worked very \nclosely with Senator Bob Dole and others on both sides of the aisle. We \nreceived invaluable support from President George Herbert Walker Bush \nand key members of his administration, including White House Counsel \nBoyden Gray, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, and Transportation \nSecretary Sam Skinner.\n  The fact is that Americans of all walks of life take enormous pride \nin the progress we have made since the ADA was passed 18 years ago. \nNobody wants to go backward.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act was one of the landmark civil \nrights laws of the 20th century--a long-overdue emancipation \nproclamation for Americans with disabilities. Thanks to that law, we \nhave removed most physical barriers to movement and access for more \nthan 50 million Americans with disabilities. We have required employers \nto provide reasonable accommodations so that people with disabilities \ncan have equal opportunity in the workplace. And we have advanced the \nfour goals of the ADA--equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency.\n  The reach--the triumph--of the ADA revolution struck home to me, some \ntime back, when I attended a Washington convention of several hundred \ndisability rights advocates, many with significant disabilities. They \narrived in Washington on trains and airplanes built to accommodate \npeople with mobility impairments. They came to the hotel on Metro and \nin regular busses, all seamlessly accessible by wheelchair. They \nnavigated city streets equipped with curb cuts and ramps. The hotel \nwhere the convention took place was equipped in countless ways to \naccommodate people with disabilities. There was a sign language \ninterpreter on the dais so that people with hearing disabilities could \nbe full participants.\n  For those of us who do not have disabilities, these many changes are \nall but invisible. But for individuals with disabilities, they are \ntransforming and liberating. So are provisions in the ADA outlawing \ndiscrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the \nworkplace, and requiring employers to provide ``reasonable \naccommodations.''\n  But despite this progress, we face a challenge. In recent years, the \ncourts have narrowed the definition of who qualifies as an ``individual \nwith a disability.'' As a consequence, people with conditions that \ncommon sense tells us are disabilities are being told by courts that \nthey are not in fact disabled, and are not eligible for the protections \nof the law. In a ruling last year, the 11th Circuit Court even \nconcluded that a person with an intellectual disability was not \n``disabled'' under the ADA.\n  When I explain to people what the Supreme Court has done, they are \nshocked. Impairments that the Court says are not to be considered \ndisabilities under the law include amputation, intellectual \ndisabilities, epilepsy, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, and multiple \nsclerosis.\n  In three rulings in 1999--Sutton v. United Airlines, Murphy v. United \nParcel Service, and Albertson's v. Kirkingburg--the Court held that \ncorrective and mitigating measures must be considered in determining \nwhether an individual has a disability under the ADA.\n  In Sutton, the Supreme Court held that if a person is taking \ncorrective\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\nmeasures to mitigate a physical or mental impairment, the effects of \nthose measures must be taken into account when judging whether a person \nis ``disabled.'' Corrective measures could include anything from visual \naids to a prosthesis. The Court went on to say that the approach \nadopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission--that persons \nare to be evaluated in their hypothetical uncorrected state--was an \nimpermissible interpretation of the ADA.\n  In Murphy, the Court applied the same analysis to medication used to \ntreat hypertension, and concluded that an employee who was fired \nbecause he had hypertension was not protected under the ADA, because \nmedication alleviated some of his symptoms.\n  In Kirkingburg, the Supreme Court went further and declared that \nmitigating measures to be included in the determination of whether \nsomeone is disabled included not only artificial aids such as devices \nand medications, but also subconscious measures an individual may use \nto compensate for his or her impairment. Kirkingburg was an individual \nwho was blind in one eye, and the court found that he was not \n``disabled'' under the ADA.\n  Moreover, in another Supreme Court case, Toyota v. Williams 2002, the \nCourt held that there must be a ``demanding standard for qualifying as \ndisabled.'' This too, has resulted in a much more restrictive \nrequirement than Congress intended. It has had the effect of excluding \ncountless individuals with disabilities from the protections of the \nlaw.\n  Together, these Supreme Court cases have created a supreme absurdity: \nThe more successful a person is at coping with a disability, the more \nlikely it is for a court to find that they are no longer sufficiently \ndisabled to be protected by the ADA. And if these individuals are no \nlonger protected under the ADA, then their requests for a reasonable \naccommodation at work can be denied. Or they can be fired--without \nrecourse.\n  Think about it this way: Imagine that you are an individual with a \ndisability who has a job. Due to your disability, you take some \nmedication or maybe you use an assistive device. The use of the \nmedication or the assistive device allows you to be qualified to do \nyour job. It's a job that you really love. At some point, you need to \nrequest a reasonable accommodation from your employer--maybe, if you \nhave diabetes, it is 10 minutes a day to take your insulin and check \nyour blood levels.\n  Or perhaps you use a prosthesis. Your employer says no, they don't \nwant to give you an accommodation. Eventually you get fired as a \nresult. When you go to court, your employer argues that you aren't \nreally a person with a disability so you aren't entitled to the \nprotections of the ADA. Then, under these Supreme Court cases, the \nemployer prevails by convincing the court that because of the \nmitigating measure--the prosthesis--you can't meet the test of being \n``disabled'' under the law.\n  So what are you supposed to do in these cases? If you don't take the \nmedication or use the assistive device, then you are not qualified to \ndo the job. On the other hand, if you stop taking the medication, or \nstop using your prosthesis, you will be considered a person with a \ndisability under the ADA, but you will be unable to do your job.\n  What would you do? This is the Catch 22 situation that, today, \nconfronts countless people with disabilities. This is clearly not what \nI intended, or what Congress intended, when we passed the ADA in 1990.\n  It boggles the mind that any court would rule that, for instance, \nmultiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy, is not a disability covered \nby the ADA. But that is where we are today. And that is why we are \nintroducing this bill today.\n  This Senate bill builds on the success of the House bill. However, it \nseeks to broaden the definition of disability in a way that maximizes \nbipartisan consensus and minimizes unintended consequences.\n  Our bill leaves the ADA's familiar disability definition language \nintact: A person with a disability is one who has a physical or mental \nimpairment that ``substantially limits'' one or more of the major life \nactivities of the individual. It does not substitute the term \n``materially restricts'' as in the House bill. Instead, the bill takes \nseveral specific and general steps that, individually and in \ncombination, direct courts toward a more generous meaning and \napplication of the definition.\n  This bill will overturn the basis for the reasoning in the Supreme \nCourt decisions--the Sutton trilogy and the Toyota case--that have been \nso problematic for so many people with very real disabilities.\n  This bill fixes the ``mitigating measures'' problem by clearly \nstating that mitigating measures--like the medication or assistive \ndevices I talked about earlier--are not to be considered in determining \nwhether someone is entitled to the protections of the ADA.\n  This bill will make it easier for people with disabilities to be \ncovered by the ADA because it effectively expands the definition of \ndisability to include many more major life activities, as well as a new \ncategory of major bodily functions. This latter point is important for \nthose with immune disorders, or cancer, or kidney disease, or liver \ndisease, because they no longer need to show what specific activity \nthey are limited in, in order to meet the statutory definition of \ndisability.\n  This bill rejects the current EEOC regulation which says that \n``substantially limits'' means ``significantly restricted'' as too high \na standard. We indicate Congress's expectation that the regulation be \nrewritten in a less stringent way, and we provide the authority to do \nso.\n  This bill revives the ``regarded as'' prong of the definition of \ndisability, and makes it easier for those with physical or mental \nimpairments to be able to seek relief if they have been subjected to an \nadverse action because of their disability.\n  This bill has a broad construction provision which instructs the \ncourts and the agencies that the definition of disability is to be \ninterpreted broadly, to the maximum extent permitted by the ADA.\n  Mr. President, 18 years ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act \npassed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Likewise, today, with the \nintroduction of this bill, we are building a strong bicameral, \nbipartisan majority to support the ADA Amendments Act of 2008.\n  Let me say, again, that I am grateful for the bipartisan spirit with \nwhich we are approaching this legislation. We have an opportunity to \ncome together and make an important difference for millions of \nAmericans with disabilities.\n  This bill also enjoys strong support out in the country. It is \nsupported by most national disability organizations, as well as the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nthe Society for Human Resource Management, and the Human Resources \nPolicy Association.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass this bill, and to advance and fulfill the original \npromise of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``ADA Amendments Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (ADA), Congress intended that the Act ``provide a clear and \n     comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \n     discrimination against individuals with disabilities'' and \n     provide broad coverage;\n       (2) in enacting the ADA, Congress recognized that physical \n     and mental disabilities in no way diminish a person's right \n     to fully participate in all aspects of society, but that \n     people with physical or mental disabilities are frequently \n     precluded from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated \n     attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and \n     institutional barriers;\n       (3) while Congress expected that the definition of \n     disability under the ADA would be interpreted consistently \n     with how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped \n     individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that \n     expectation has not been fulfilled;\n       (4) the holdings of the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United \n     Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases \n     have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be \n     afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many \n     individuals whom Congress intended to protect;\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\n       (5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor \n     Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 \n     (2002) further narrowed the broad scope of protection \n     intended to be afforded by the ADA;\n       (6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower courts \n     have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a \n     range of substantially limiting impairments are not people \n     with disabilities;\n       (7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Toyota \n     Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 \n     (2002), interpreted the term ``substantially limits'' to \n     require a greater degree of limitation than was intended by \n     Congress; and\n       (8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term \n     ``substantially limits'' as ``significantly restricted'' are \n     inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too \n     high a standard.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to carry out the ADA's objectives of providing ``a \n     clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \n     of discrimination'' and ``clear, strong, consistent, \n     enforceable standards addressing discrimination'' by \n     reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under \n     the ADA;\n       (2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme \n     Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 \n     (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment \n     substantially limits a major life activity is to be \n     determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of \n     mitigating measures;\n       (3) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. \n     United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to \n     coverage under the third prong of the definition of \n     disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme \n     Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. \n     273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of \n     the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of \n     1973;\n       (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court \n     in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, \n     534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms ``substantially'' and \n     ``major'' in the definition of disability under the ADA \n     ``need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding \n     standard for qualifying as disabled,'' and that to be \n     substantially limited in performing a major life activity \n     under the ADA ``an individual must have an impairment that \n     prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing \n     activities that are of central importance to most people's \n     daily lives'';\n       (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard \n     created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor \n     Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 \n     (2002) for ``substantially limits'', and applied by lower \n     courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately \n     high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under \n     the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the \n     primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA \n     should be whether entities covered under the ADA have \n     complied with their obligations, and to convey that the \n     question of whether an individual's impairment is a \n     disability under the ADA should not demand extensive \n     analysis; and\n       (6) to express Congress' expectation that the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of \n     its current regulations that defines the term ``substantially \n     limits'' as ``significantly restricted'' to be consistent \n     with this Act, including the amendments made by this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. CODIFIED FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 12101) is amended--\n       (1) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       ``(1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a \n     person's right to fully participate in all aspects of \n     society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities \n     have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; \n     others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as \n     having a disability also have been subjected to \n     discrimination;'';\n       (2) by striking paragraph (7); and\n       (3) by redesignating paragraphs (8) and (9) as paragraphs \n     (7) and (8), respectively.\n\n     SEC. 4.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall become \n     effective on January 1, 2009.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today, as I did 18 years \nago, and stand beside my good friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, to \nintroduce legislation advancing opportunities for our disabled fellow \ncitizens. Our commitment to that cause never ends. We must always \nremain open to learn from experience, to observe and evaluate how laws \nwe put on the books work in practice, and to be ready to do our part \nwith appropriate legislation. We are doing our part today by \nintroducing the ADA Amendments Act.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act is perhaps the most comprehensive \npiece of civil rights legislation we have ever enacted. It prohibits \ndiscrimination based on present, past, or perceived disabilities. It \naffirmatively requires accommodations in the workplace and \nmodifications and assistance to ensure that persons with disabilities \ncan access and enjoy places of public accommodation. That combination \nof the negative prohibition and the affirmative obligation makes the \nADA truly unique and able to make such a positive contribution to the \nlives of so many across our great Nation.\n  This legislation responds to Supreme Court decisions that have had \nthe effect of narrowing the ADA's definition of disability and thereby \nrestricting its coverage. Its goal is to once again broaden the \ndefinition of disability in a way that maximizes bipartisan consensus \nand minimizes unintended consequences. I am sure that my friend from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, joins me in thanking so many people and \norganizations who have been part of this process, offering countless \nsuggestions and ideas and input about how to achieve this goal.\n  This effort has been neither simple nor easy. Because the ADA is such \na comprehensive statute, virtually any change we make can have effects \nin areas beyond where a problem might have occurred. In addition, \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, with liberal or conservative \nperspectives, equally want to help the disabled but have very different \nviews about how to do it.\n  And so the bill we introduce today is really the third phase in a \nprocess that began more than a year ago with introduction of the ADA \nRestoration Act and continued with passage last month of the House ADA \nAmendments Act. I am glad to say that it enjoys the support of the \nbroad coalitions of disability and business groups that have provided \nvaluable input and analysis along the way. It also takes steps to \naddress concerns expressed by the education community. While the \nproblems this legislation addresses arose in the employment arena, the \nsolution this legislation represents will certainly impact the \neducation arena.\n  Finally, let me say that like the original ADA, this bill is the \nresult of negotiation and compromise on all sides. That is the nature \nof the legislative process and the more important the goal, the greater \nthe effort to continue the process until we reach a good result. We \nhave done that here and I hope and trust that when this legislation \npasses here and in the other body that the margin of the votes will \nreflect the breadth of the consensus behind this new effort to advance \nopportunities for the disabled to participate in all that this great \ncountry has to offer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. \n        inhofe):\n  S. 3407. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \ncommanders of wounded warrior battalions to accept charitable gifts on \nbehalf of the wounded members of the Armed Forces assigned to such \nbattalions; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in the years since the War on Terror began, \nwe have seen the creation of new Wounded Warrior Battalions and Warrior \nTransition Battalions in the Marines and the Army. These units were \nbuilt from the ground up with one purpose in mind: to ensure that \nseriously wounded service members receive the medical care and benefits \nthat they have earned. The service personnel who command and administer \nthese units are some of the most competent and dedicated professionals \nin our armed forces, and they deserve our praise.\n  These professionals have done much to improve the quality of care \nthat is given to our Nation's wounded service members, but many of the \nyoung men and women who find themselves assigned to a Wounded Warrior \nBattalion still face a tough journey on their road to recovery. \nThankfully, the challenges that these men and women face rarely go \nunnoticed in their communities. Over the past several years we have \nheard countless stories of private citizens, church congregations and \nother community groups stepping forward to donate their time, money and \nother charitable gifts to our wounded service personnel. It is not \nuncommon to hear about donations of $10,000 or more being offered to \nhelp provide additional resources to help our wounded recover.\n  Unfortunately, the military's gift-acceptance rules have not been \nupdated\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nto take into account the generosity of the American people. For \nexample, if a North Carolinian wished to provide a gift of just over \n$12,000 to the Wounded Warrior Battalion at Camp Lejeune, the \nacceptance paperwork for this donation would spend months working its \nway through a complicated bureaucracy before finally arriving on the \ndesk of the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Our taxpayers and our \nwounded veterans are not being served very well when gifts of such a \nsmall dollar amount must be approved at the very highest levels of \ncommand.\n  That is why I am introducing the Friends of Wounded Warriors Act. \nThis legislation will streamline the gift-acceptance process by \nempowering the commanders of Wounded Warrior Battalions and similar \nunits with the authority to accept charitable gifts of up to $100,000 \nfor the benefit of the members of their unit. This will enable these \ncommanders to cut through the red tape that is currently the cause of \nneedless delay in getting extra resources to our wounded service men \nand women. I hope you will join me in making a commitment to ensure \nthat out-dated processes for accepting gifts do not stand in the way of \nthe generosity of concerned citizens and communities seeking to \ncontribute to the care of our wounded and ill service members.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 3408. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the conduct of comparative effectiveness research and to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a Comparative \nEffectiveness Research Trust Fund, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in 2006, America spent more than $2 \ntrillion on health care. By any standard, $2 trillion is an enormous \nfigure. Health care accounts for 16 percent of our Nation's economy. \nThat means that for every $100 in goods and services produced and \nconsumed in America in 2006, $16 were for health care. And the health \ncare share of the economy is expected to reach 20 percent in just 10 \nyears.\n  These projections are cause for concern. If so much of our Nation's \nresources are devoted to heath care, we need to ask ourselves what we \nare--or are not--getting for it.\n  The answer is that we are getting a mixed bag of goods. Some patients \nreceive medical treatments that work well. Some patients receive \ntreatments that don't work well. In many cases, doctors and patients \ndon't have enough reliable evidence to know whether treatments work or \ndon't.\n  Of the $2 trillion spent on health in 2006, only \\1/10\\ of 1 percent \nwas spent to assess what works and what doesn't. At the Federal level, \nonly $15 million was directly appropriated to compare the effectiveness \nof health interventions and services. People who purchase other goods--\nanything from cars to computers--use information to compare the value \nof the different products before they purchase. Physicians and patients \ndeserve better. We should devote more than \\1/10\\ of 1 percent of \nhealth spending to study how well health goods and services actually \nwork.\n  Rapid innovation has led to an ever-changing array of new and \nsometimes expensive technologies. The age of personalized medicine and \ngenetic engineering will provide even more choices for patients and \ntheir physicians. Indeed, patients and physicians can face great \ndifficulty in choosing among treatment options.\n  But much of the information about those options is biased. Much \ninformation about those options is of poor quality. And for many \ntreatments, there are large gaps in what is known to be most effective.\n  With a paucity of sound evidence, clinical guidelines and treatment \nprotocols can vary widely. If there has ever been a need for better \ninformation--on what works, for which patients, under which \ncircumstances--it is in this age of rapid innovation of technology.\n  Several august bodies--including the Institute of Medicine, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice--have called on Congress to create a national entity charged \nwith conducting research to determine what works in health care.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce the Comparative Effectiveness Research \nAct of 2008. I am joined by the Chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad. He and I share a deep concern about rising health care \ncosts. And we share a deep commitment to finding ways to address it.\n  This bill does what the experts suggest. It would create a new entity \nresponsible for generating better information on the effectiveness of \nhealth care treatments.\n  Specifically, the bill would create a nonprofit corporation \nresponsible for setting national priorities for comparative \neffectiveness research. The corporation, which would be called the \nHealth Care Comparative Effectiveness Research Institute, would be a \nprivate entity. But it would be governed by a public-private sector \nBoard of Governors. It would not be an agency of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In addition to setting national priorities, the Institute would \nprovide for the conduct of research studies that answer the most \npressing questions about what works in health care. The Institute would \nhave the authority to contract with experienced Federal agencies, such \nas the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, and the \nNational Institutes for Health, or NIH, or with private researchers if \nappropriate, for the conduct of the actual research. The Institute \nwould also be charged with disseminating the findings of the research \nin ways that patients and providers can understand.\n  The Institute would be required to assess the full spectrum of health \ninterventions, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical \nprocedures, medical services, and other therapies. This type of \nresearch is often called ``comparative effectiveness research,'' \nbecause it evaluates and compares the clinical effect of alternative \nmedical treatments. This type of research provides better quality \nevidence concerning the best treatment, prevention, and management of \nthe health conditions. Most importantly, this type of research helps \npatients, providers, and payers of health care to make more informed \ndecisions.\n  While many experts have called for creation of a new entity, they do \nnot specify how the entity should be structured. This bill would create \na private, nonprofit institute rather than a new entity within the \nexecutive branch or legislative. Keeping it private would remove the \npotential for political influence on the development of national \nresearch priorities. Comparative effectiveness research will be more \ncredible, and more useful, if it is done independently of political \ninfluence and with broad stakeholder input.\n  This bill includes stringent requirements for public input, \ntransparency of process and findings, and integrity of the research. \nFor example, the Institute would be required to publish its rules, \nproceedings, and reports on a public Internet site. Its meetings would \nbe open to the public. It would be required to provide public comment \nperiods at key stages, in addition to open forums to solicit and obtain \npublic input on the Institute's activities.\n  This bill would also require accountability and government oversight \nof finances and the mission. The Institute would be subject to annual \nfinancial audits. And the Comptroller General would perform periodic \naudits of the activities of the Institute to ensure that the Institute \nwould meet its statutory mission and would do so in a fair, open, and \ncredible way.\n  Finally, this bill would provide a stable source of funding for the \nInstitute. For the first 3 years, general revenues would be used to \nstart up the Institute. In the 4th year, funding would move to an all-\npayer system--from both public and private sources. Annual \ncontributions would be made from the Medicare Trust Funds, from \nrevenues generated by a fee on private health insurance policies, and \nfrom general revenues. The work of the new Institute would benefit \nAmericans who receive health care through the public and private \nsources. Therefore, public and private sources should contribute to \nthis type of research. The private insurance fee would be $1 per \ninsured person per year. Funding from Medicare would also be $1 per \nbeneficiary per year.\n  All sources of funding for the Institute would sunset after 10 years. \nThat\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\nway, Congress could review a report from the Comptroller General on the \nvalue of the research to the public and private insurance sectors. \nTotal funding for the first year would be $5 million, and funding would \nincrease to $300 million a year by the year 2013.\n  It is high time that America invested more than a fraction of a \npercent to generate knowledge about what works in health care, to \nimprove the efficiency and the quality of our health care system, and \nto give patients and doctors better information to make treatment \ndecisions. It is high time that we built a foundation of evidence for \nthe trillions of dollars spent on health in America each year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Baucus, in introducing the Comparative Effectiveness Research \nAct of 2008. This proposal is the product of months of careful \ndeliberations regarding the best way to expand the quality and quantity \nof evidence available to health consumers about the comparative \nclinical effectiveness of health care services and treatments. We have \nmet with dozens of key stakeholders and thought leaders to discuss \nvarious aspects of this legislation. I am proud of the result. This \nlegislation lays the groundwork for improving health care outcomes, \nenhancing patient safety, and reducing overall health care costs in the \nlong-run.\n  As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am acutely aware of the \nlong-term budget challenges facing our nation. Health care spending is \ngrowing at an unsustainable rate. Although demographic changes \nassociated with the retirement of the baby boom generation contribute \nto this spending growth, the most significant factor is growth in \nhealth care costs in excess of per capita GDP growth. According to \nCongressional Budget Office projections, by 2050, Medicare and Medicaid \nspending alone will consume 12 percent of our Nation's gross domestic \nproduct.\n  But excess growth in per capita health care costs is not just a \nchallenge for Federal health spending and the federal budget. If we \ncontinue on the current trajectory, the private sector will also be \noverwhelmed by rising health care costs. In fact, total health care \nspending is projected to grow from about 16 percent of GDP in 2007--\nwhich is far higher than in other industrialized countries--to more \nthan 37 percent of GDP in 2050.\n  Clearly, we need to address the underlying causes of rising health \ncare costs, not just in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but in the \noverall health care system. Simply cutting Medicare and Medicaid \nwithout making other changes will do little to solve the larger problem \nwe face. As GAO Comptroller General David Walker pointed out in \ntestimony before the House Budget Committee, in 2005, ``[F]ederal \nhealth spending trends should not be viewed in isolation from the \nhealth care system as a whole . . . . Rather, in order to address the \nlong-term fiscal challenge, it will be necessary to find approaches \nthat deal with health care cost growth in the overall health care \nsystem.''\n  A key problem we must confront is that our health care system does \nnot deliver care as efficiently or effectively as it should. In fact, \nthe United States spends far more on health expenditures as a percent \nof GDP than any other country in the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development. For example, the United States spent 16 \npercent of GDP on health expenditures in 2006, compared to 9 percent in \nItaly. And the disparity is even starker today. Despite this additional \nhealth care spending, health outcomes in the United States are no \nbetter than health outcomes in the other OECD countries. In fact, by \nsome measures, they are worse.\n  We can and must find ways to deliver health care more efficiently, \nreduce ineffective or unnecessary care, and get better health outcomes \nwithout harming patients.\n  One solution is to generate better information about the relative \neffectiveness of alternative health strategies--and encourage patients \nand providers to use that information to make better choices about \ntheir health. Many newer, more expensive health care services and \ntreatments are absorbed quickly into routine medical care--yet there is \nlittle evidence that these services and treatments are any more \nclinically effective than existing treatments and services.\n\n  The Federal Government currently funds some comparative effectiveness \nresearch through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The \nEffective Health Care Program has been a successful initiative, and we \ncommend AHRQ for its work, but comparative effectiveness research is \nnot the primary focus of any federal agency--nor is this federal \nfunding occurring on a large-scale. The Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, and the \nInstitute of Medicine, IOM, have all discussed the positive impact of \ncreating a new entity charged solely with conducting research on the \ncomparative effectiveness of health interventions, including \npharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical procedures, diagnostic tools, \nmedical services and other therapies.\n  In its June 2007 report to Congress, MedPAC issued a unanimous \nrecommendation that ``Congress should charge an independent entity to \nsponsor credible research on comparative effectiveness of health care \nservices and disseminate this information to patients, providers, and \npublic and private payers.''\n  And the Congressional Budget Office agrees. In a recent report, \nentitled, ``Research on the Comparative Effectiveness of Medical \nTreatments: Issues and Options for an Expanded Federal\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nRole,'' CBO Director Peter Orszag wrote that, ``generating better \ninformation about the costs and benefits of different treatment \noptions--through research on the comparative effectiveness of those \noptions--could help reduce health care spending without adversely \naffecting health overall.''\n  The IOM also supports getting better information into the hands of \npatients and providers. As part of its report, ``Learning What Works \nBest: The Nation's Need for Evidence on Comparative Effectiveness in \nHealth Care,'' the Institute concluded that,\n``[a] substantially increased capacity to conduct and evaluate research \n      on clinical effectiveness of interventions brings many potential \n    opportunities for improvement across a wide spectrum of healthcare \n                                                               needs.''\n  This bill that Senator Baucus and I are introducing today represents \nan important step in expanding comparative effectiveness research. The \nbill would significantly expand the conduct of comparative clinical \neffectiveness research to get better information into the hands of \npatients and providers in the hopes of improving health outcomes and \nreducing unnecessary or ineffective care.\n  The purpose of this bill is to provide health care providers and \npatients with objective and credible evidence about which health care \ntreatments, services, and items are most clinically effective for \nparticular patient populations. The research conducted under our bill \nwould evaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness of two or more \nhealth care interventions, treatment protocols, procedures, medical \ndevices, diagnostic tools, pharmaceuticals, and other processes or \nitems used in the treatment or diagnosis of patients. Access to better \nevidence about what works best will help patients and health care \nproviders make better-informed decisions about how best to treat \nparticular diseases and conditions. Our hope is that the evidence \ngenerated by this research could lead to savings in the overall health \ncare system over the long-term by allowing providers to avoid \ntreatments that may be clinically ineffective, while at the same time \nimproving health care outcomes.\n  Specifically, our bill creates a private, nonprofit corporation, \nknown as the Health Care Comparative Effectiveness Research Institute, \nwhich would be responsible for organizing and implementing a national \ncomparative effectiveness research agenda. In conducting the research, \nthe Institute would contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research \nand Quality, the National Institutes of Health and other appropriate \npublic and private entities and could use a variety of research \nmethods, including clinical trials, observational studies and \nsystematic reviews of existing evidence.\n  Many thought leaders on this issue, such as the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Committee, had concerns that a large entity within the Federal \nGovernment would be vulnerable to political interference that could \nhamper the Institute's credibility, and, therefore, limit the \nusefulness of its research. As a result, we chose a model outside of \nthe Federal Government, but subject to government oversight.\n  In order to ensure that the information developed is credible and \nunbiased, our bill establishes a 21-Member Board of Governors to \noversee the Institute's activities. Permanent board members would \ninclude the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Directors of \nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH. The remaining 18 board members would be \nappointed by the Comptroller General of the United States and would \ninclude a balanced mix of patients, physicians, drug, device, and \ntechnology manufacturers, public and private payers, academic \nresearchers, philanthropic organizations and quality improvement \nentities.\n  To ensure further credibility, the Institute is also required to \nappoint advisory panels of patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders \nthat would assist in the development and carrying out of the research \nagenda; establish a methodology committee that would help create \nstandards by which all research commissioned by the Institute must be \nconducted; create a peer review process through which all research \nfindings must be assessed; and develop protocols to help translate and \ndisseminate the evidence in the most effective, user-friendly way.\n  Moreover, Senator Baucus and I want to ensure that the operations of \nthe Institute are transparent. Therefore, we built in a strong role for \npublic comment prior to all key decisions made by the Institute. For \nexample, the bill requires public comment periods prior to the approval \nof the overall research agenda and the individual study designs. In \naddition, the bill calls for periodic public forums to seek input, \nrequires that all proceedings of the Institute be made public and \navailable through annual reports, and requires that any conflicts of \ninterest be made public and that board members recuse themselves from \nmatters in which they have a financial or personal interest.\n  Because all health care users will benefit from this research, our \nlegislation funds the Institute with contributions from both public and \nprivate payers. These contributions will include mandatory general \nrevenues from the Federal Government, amounts from the Medicare Trust \nFunds equal to $1 per beneficiary annually, and amounts from a $1 fee \nper-covered life assessed annually on insured and self-insured health \nplans. Funding will ramp up over a series of years. By the fifth year, \nwe expect the Institute's total annual funding to exceed $300 million \nper year and continue to grow thereafter.\n  The concept of an all-payer approach for comparative effectiveness \nresearch has been embraced by a number of health care experts. For \nexample, on the subject of comparative effectiveness information in its \nJune 2008 report, MedPAC stated: ``The Commission supports funding from \nfederal and private sources as the research findings will benefit all \nusers--patients, providers, private health plans, and federal health \nprograms. The Commission also supports a dedicated funding mechanism to \nhelp ensure the entity's independence and stability. Dedicated broadly \nbased financing would reduce the likelihood of outside influence and \nwould best ensure the entity's stability . . .''\n\n  To ensure accountability for these funds and to the Institute's \nmission, our bill requires an annual financial audit of the Institute. \nIn addition, the bill requires GAO to report to Congress every five \nyears on the processes developed by the Institute and its overall \neffectiveness, including how the research findings are used by health \ncare consumers and what impact the research is having on the health \neconomy. Finally, the bill requires a review after eight years of the \nadequacy of the Institute's funding, which will include a review of the \nappropriateness and adequacy of each funding source.\n  Let me take a moment to address some of the criticisms that might be \nlevied against this proposal. Some may say this Institute will impede \naccess to care and will deny coverage for high-cost health care \nservices. That is not the case. Our proposal explicitly prohibits the \nInstitute from making coverage decisions or setting practice \nguidelines. It will be up to specialty societies and patient groups to \nuse the research findings as they see fit. Moreover, to the extent that \nhigh-cost health care services or new technologies are studied by the \nInstitute and found to be clinically ineffective compared to other \nservices and technologies, such evidence will be made public to \nconsumers and providers so that they can make the best possible health \ncare decisions. Other critics may claim that this proposal will result \nin one-size-fits-all approach to comparative clinical effectiveness \nresearch. We recognize that different health care treatments may have \ndifferent levels of effectiveness for different subpopulations. That is \nwhy our bill requires that the Institute's research be designed, as \nappropriate, to take into account the potential differences in the \neffectiveness of health care services as used with various \nsubpopulations, such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, different \nage groups, and individuals with different comorbidities.\n  This bill is a balanced, carefully crafted proposal that has taken \ninto consideration the recommendations of a broad range of stakeholders \nand thought-leaders. We welcome further discussion and suggested \nimprovements. But we refuse to allow this proposal to get bogged down \nin political\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nmaneuvering or scare tactics. Our nation needs to ramp up comparative \neffectiveness research immediately to improve health outcomes and \nreduce ineffective and inefficient care.\n  Senator Baucus and I will work jointly to push for the expeditious \nenactment of this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to join our effort \nand cosponsor the Comparative Effectiveness Research Act of 2008. There \nis no time to waste.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself and Mr. Grassley)):\n  S. 3409. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nensure the safety and quality of medical products and enhance the \nauthorities of the Food and Drug Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I view my role as working to ensure the safety and well-\nbeing of the more than 80 million Americans who are beneficiaries of \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs. These programs spend a lot of \ntaxpayers' money on prescription drugs and medical devices, and that \nmoney should be spent on drugs and devices that are safe and effective.\n  Over the last four years I have conducted extensive oversight of the \nFood and Drug Administration. I have reviewed and questioned how the \nFDA handles the pre-market review and post-market surveillance of \ndrugs, biologics, devices and veterinary medicines to assess whether or \nnot the agency is fulfilling its mission to protect the public health. \nAs a result of my oversight activities, I identified serious problems \nat the FDA that included the quashing of scientific opinion within the \nagency, delays in informing the public of emerging safety problems, too \ncozy a relationship between the FDA and the industries it is supposed \nto regulate, and a failure to be adequately transparent and accountable \nto the public.\n  Last year, when the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee were working on \nFDA legislation, I encouraged them to take that opportunity to reform, \nimprove, and re-establish the FDA as the gold standard for drug safety. \nI believed the FDA needed additional tools, resources, and authorities \nto do its work.\n  The Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act \nlast September. While we did not fix a fundamental problem at the FDA \nthat's been shown through my investigations over the last few years, \nthe new legislation did provide additional tools in FDA's toolbox to \nbetter protect the American people. It was a positive step toward \nrestoring the public's trust in the FDA.\n  Today, I am here to talk about another FDA bill. Last summer, I \nstarted examining FDA's program for inspection of foreign \npharmaceutical manufacturing plants. I expressed concerns to the FDA \nregarding, among other things, inspection funding, emerging exporters, \nand weaknesses in the inspection process.\n  An increasing amount of the drugs and active pharmaceutical \ningredients (API) Americans use are being manufactured in foreign \ncountries. Yet, as reported by the Government Accountability Office in \nNovember 2007, the Food and Drug Administration does not know how many \nforeign establishments are subject to inspection and the agency \nconducts relatively few inspections each year.\n  From fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2007, the FDA conducted \nfewer than 1,400 inspections of foreign pharmaceutical facilities, \noften focused in countries with few reported quality concerns. In \nChina, the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical \ningredients, and where export safety appears to be a growing problem, \nonly 11 inspections were conducted during FY 2007, compared to 14 in \nSwitzerland, 18 in Germany, and 24 in France, all countries with \nadvanced regulatory infrastructures. I was troubled by these numbers.\n  Then came the wake-up call in January of this year. FDA announced \nthat Baxter International Inc. temporarily suspended production of its \nblood thinner heparin because of an increase in the reports of adverse \nevents that may be associated with its drug. It was discovered that the \nactive ingredient in heparin was contaminated and that the ingredient \nwas produced at a facility in the People's Republic of China. Soon more \nrecalls were announced. After several months, the FDA established a \nlink between the contaminant found in heparin and the serious adverse \nevents seen in patients that were given heparin. FDA's investigation of \nthe source of the contamination highlighted significant weaknesses in \noversight of the production and supply chain.\n  With limited inspection resources, the FDA is charged with ensuring \nthe safety and efficacy of drugs and pharmaceutical ingredients \nproduced in nearly every corner of the globe. To make matters worse, as \nthe FDA's challenges multiply, its resources for foreign inspections \nare shrinking. It is troubling that the FDA is grossly under-resourced \nat a time when foreign production of drugs and active pharmaceutical \ningredients is growing at record rates. Adding to the difficulty of \nthis task, it appears that many foreign pharmaceutical plants register \nwith the FDA as a means to bolster their own standing and with no \nintention of exporting products to the United States market.\n  That is why I am introducing the Drug and Device Accountability Act \ntoday with Senator Kennedy, chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  This legislation would augment FDA's resources through the collection \nof registration and inspection fees. The bill also expands the agency's \nauthority for ensuring the safety of drugs and medical devices, \nincluding foreign manufactured drugs and devices, by expanding FDA's \nauthority to inspect foreign manufacturers and importers, allowing the \nFDA to issue subpoenas, and allowing the FDA to detain a device or drug \nwhen its inspectors have reason to believe the product is adulterated \nor misbranded.\n  In addition, the bill includes a provision that expands on an \namendment I filed last spring to the Senate bill, S. 1082 Food and Drug \nAdministration Revitalization Act. That amendment provided for a \ncertification by drug manufacturers that the information submitted as \npart of a new drug or supplemental application is accurate.\n  Under the Drug and Device Accountability Act, individuals responsible \nfor the submission of a drug or device application or a report related \nto safety or effectiveness would have to certify that the application \nor report is compliant with applicable regulations and not false or \nmisleading. Civil as well as criminal penalties could be imposed for \nfalse or misleading certifications. I believe this is an important \nprovision, especially in light of the troubling findings presented in \nthe Journal of the American Medical Association in April. Based on a \nreview of documents from recent litigation involving the pain \nmedication Vioxx, the authors of those articles concluded that the \nmaker of Vioxx was not forthcoming in its communication with the Food \nand Drug Administration about the mortality risks seen in clinical \ntrials of Vioxx conducted in patients with Alzheimer disease or \ncognitive impairment.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation that would strengthen FDA's \nability to act on emerging safety problems. Now we need legislation \nthat will enhance FDA's oversight of drugs and devices if the Agency is \nto ensure that America's increasingly foreign-produced drug and device \nsupply is both safe and effective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 3410. A bill to authorize a grant program to provide for expanded \naccess to mainstream financial institutions; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. President, as a member of the Banking Committee, I have \nworked to improve the financial literacy of our country. My interest in \nfinancial literacy dates back to when my fourth grade teacher required \nme to have a piggy bank. We were made to understand how money saved, a \nlittle at a time, can grow into a large amount--enough to buy things \nthat would have been impossible to obtain without savings. My \nexperience with a piggy bank taught me important lessons about money \nmanagement that\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nhave stayed with me throughout my life. More people need to be taught \nthese important lessons so that they are better able to manage their \nresources.\n  Too many Americans lack basic financial literacy. Americans of all \nages and backgrounds face increasingly complex financial decisions as \nmembers of the nation's workforce, managers of their families' \nresources, and voting citizens. Many find these decisions confusing and \nfrustrating because they lack the tools necessary that would enable \nthem to make wise, personal choices about their finances.\n  Without a sufficient understanding of economics and personal finance, \nindividuals will not be able to appropriately manage their finances, \neffectively evaluate credit opportunities, successfully invest for \nlong-term financial goals in an increasingly complex marketplace, or be \nable to cope with difficult financial situations. Unfortunately, today \ntoo many working families are struggling as they are confronted with \nincreases in energy and food costs or the loss of a job.\n  It is essential that we work toward improving education, consumer \nprotections, and empowering individuals and families through economic \nand financial literacy in order to build stronger families, businesses, \nand communities.\n  Today I am introducing the Improving Access to Mainstream Financial \nInstitutions Act of 2008. This bill provides economic empowerment and \neducational opportunities for working families by helping bank the \nunbanked. It will also encourage the use of mainstream financial \ninstitutions for working families that need small loans. I thank my \ncosponsors, Senators Schumer, Lieberman, and Inouye.\n  Millions of working families do not have a bank or credit union \naccount. The unbanked rely on alternative financial service providers \nto obtain cash from checks, pay bills, and send remittances. Many of \nthe unbanked are low- and moderate-income families that can ill afford \nto have their earnings diminished by reliance on these high-cost and \noften predatory financial services. In addition, the unbanked are \nunable to save securely to prepare for the loss of a job, a family \nillness, a down payment on a first home, or education expenses.\n  My bill authorizes grants intended to help low- and moderate-income \nunbanked individuals establish bank or credit union accounts. Providing \naccess to a bank or credit union account can empower families with \ntremendous financial opportunities. An account at a bank or credit \nunion provides consumers with alternatives to rapid refund loans, check \ncashing services, and lower cost remittances. In addition, bank and \ncredit union accounts provide access to saving and borrowing services.\n  Low- and moderate-income individuals are often challenged with a \nnumber of barriers that limit their ability to open up and or maintain \naccounts. Regular checking accounts may be too costly for some \nconsumers unable to maintain minimum balances or unable to afford \nmonthly fees. Poor credit histories may also hinder their ability to \nopen accounts. By providing federal resources for product development, \nadministration, outreach, and financial education, banks and credit \nunions will be better able to reach out and bank the unbanked.\n  The second grant program authorized by my legislation provides \nconsumers with a lower cost, short term alternative to payday loans. \nPayday loans are cash loans repaid by borrowers' postdated checks or \nborrowers' authorizations to make electronic debits against existing \nfinancial accounts. Payday loans often have triple digit interest rates \nthat range from 390 percent to 780 percent when expressed as an annual \npercentage rate. Loan flipping, which is a common practice, is the \nrenewing of loans at maturity by paying additional fees without any \nprincipal reduction. Loan flipping often leads to instances where the \nfees paid for a payday loan well exceed the principal borrowed. This \nsituation often creates a cycle of debt that is hard to break.\n  There is a great need for working families to have access to \naffordable small loans. My legislation would encourage banks and credit \nunions to develop payday loan alternatives. Consumers who apply for \nthese loans would be provided with financial literacy and educational \nopportunities. Loans extended to consumers under the grant would be \nsubject to the annual percentage rate promulgated by the National \nCredit Union Administration's, NCUA, Loan Interest Rates, currently \ncapped at an annual percentage rate of 18 percent. Several credit \nunions have developed similar products. One example is the Windward \nCommunity Federal Credit Union in Kailua, on the island of Oahu, which \nhas developed an affordable alternative to payday loans to help the \nU.S. Marines and the other members that they serve. I am very proud of \nthe work done by the staff of the Windward Community Federal Credit \nUnion. This program was developed with an NCUA grant. More working \nfamilies need access to affordable small loans. More needs to be done \nto encourage mainstream financial service providers to develop \naffordable small loan products. My legislation will help support the \ndevelopment of affordable credit products at bank and credit unions. \nWorking families would be better off by going to their credit unions \nand banks, mainstream financial services providers, than payday loan \nshops.\n  I will work to enact this legislation so vital to empowering our \ncitizens. In our current, modern, complex economy, not having a bank or \ncredit union account severely hinders the ability of families to \nimprove their financial condition or help them navigate difficult \nfinancial circumstances. Instead of borrowing money from payday lenders \nat outrageous fees, we need to encourage people to utilize their credit \nunions and banks for affordable small loans. Banks and credit unions \nhave the ability to make the lives of working families better by \nhelping them save, invest, and borrow at affordable rates.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3410\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU), the only \n     national trade association that exclusively represents the \n     interests of our nation's Federal credit unions, to applaud \n     your leadership on working to get low- and moderate-income \n     unbanked individuals into mainstream financial institutions, \n     such as credit unions, and your continued commitment to \n     financial literacy as demonstrated in the Improving Access to \n     Mainstream Financial Institutions Act of 2008.\n       We believe it is important to help the unbanked set up \n     credit union accounts that will allow these individuals to \n     obtain the products and services that they need, such as \n     lower cost check cashing and remittance services, as well as \n     financial education to encourage savings and thank you for \n     your efforts to help this cause.\n       Unfortunately, payday lending has also increasingly become \n     a precarious problem for many Americans. People that find \n     themselves in sudden need of a financial boost and \n     individuals unfairly subjected to higher mortgage payments \n     with higher interest rates often rely on payday lenders to \n     help cover their bills. These types of loans can worsen their \n     current financial situation, making the consumer even more \n     dependent than before. Despite our greatest efforts to \n     prevent predatory lending in America, the evidence shows \n     these deceptive practices still occur. Predators continue to \n     target specific communities, such as low-income, minority, \n     elderly and, in recent findings, the men and women of the \n     United States military.\n       Luckily, credit unions continue to be part of the solution, \n     not the problem. Many credit unions offer alternative loan \n     programs that ensure the safety and financial reprieve that \n     their members need. These loan programs offer consumers small \n     unsecured loans with low interest rates and encourage \n     financial responsibility. We greatly appreciate your \n     continued support of these efforts.\n       NAFCU appreciates the opportunity to share our thoughts on \n     this legislation and strongly support your dedication to this \n     important matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me or \n     NAFCU's Associate Director of Legislative Affairs, Amanda \n     Slater at 703-522-4770 with any questions that you may have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Fred R.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: On behalf of the Hawaii Credit Union \n     League and its 93 affiliated credit unions representing \n     approximately 811,000 members, I am writing in support of the \n     proposed Improving Access to Mainstream Financial \n     Institutions Act. This bill, which is targeted to assist low- \n     and moderate-income unbanked individuals, would go a long way \n     toward helping underserved people achieve financial stability \n     and independence.\n       Today's volatile economic climate makes it difficult or \n     even unrealistic for people of modest means to borrow money \n     or open an account at an insured depository institution. This \n     measure would establish grant programs within the Department \n     of the Treasury to assist those who would otherwise be \n     unqualified for banking services. In addition, this measure \n     would provide financial literary education opportunities to \n     those applying for loans. Financial education is an \n     invaluable service that credit unions provide, and this \n     legislation would open more doors to this service.\n       Please accept our gratitude for introducing legislation to \n     help the unserved residents of our state and nation. Should \n     you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Dennis K. Tanimoto,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement,\n                                      Honolulu, HI, July 24, 2008.\n     Re Unbanked and Payday Lending\n\n     Hon. Senator Daniel Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Aloha Senator Akaka: The Council for Native Hawaiian \n     Advancement is a nonprofit network of over 100 Native \n     Hawaiian organizations. Its mission is to enhance the \n     cultural, economic and community development of Native \n     Hawaiians. We achieve our mission through policy advocacy, \n     grant training, consultancy, leadership development and \n     connecting resources to challenges in our communities.\n       We believe in policies that promote asset building that \n     empowers low and moderate income families to increase \n     financial asset management, home ownership and small business \n     development.\n       Senator, there is a clear need for intermediary programming \n     that helps low and moderate income families to connect with \n     financial services, including deposit and savings accounts, \n     as well as loan alternatives to high cost payday lending \n     practices.\n       CNHA has developed asset building products that are moving \n     families to financial self sufficiency. For example, we \n     developed the Homestead Individual Development Accounts \n     (HIDA) that is assisting 30 families to open savings accounts \n     at First Hawaiian Bank, provides financial education and \n     helps low income families to save toward the down payment on \n     a home purchase on Hawaiian trust lands. We also developed \n     the Home Ownership Assistance Program (HOAP), a statewide \n     program of the State of Hawaii, Department of Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to expand the reach and delivery of financial literacy \n     counseling to thousands of families.\n       Currently, we are in the process of developing a dedicated \n     Earned Income Tax Credit program to assist families in filing \n     for this important tax credit to claim wages they have \n     earned.\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\n       We support Federal legislation that will promote further \n     connections between families and banking services, \n     particularly, the ``unbanked''. We also know that payday \n     lending continues to be a detriment to families on the lowest \n     end of the income scale and would support assistance to place \n     alternatives to these loans in the community development \n     marketplace.\n       Mahalo for your consideration. If we can provide additional \n     information, please contact me at any time at 808.596.8155 or \n     via email at robinhawaiiancouncil.org. \n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robin Puanani Danner,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n         Hawai'i Alliance for Community-Based Economic \n           Development,\n                                       Honolulu, HI, July 30, 2008\n     Re Support for ``Improving Access to Mainstream Financial \n         Institutions Act of 2008''\n\n     Hon. Daniel Kahikina Akaka,\n     U.S. Senator for Hawai'i.\n       Aloha Senator Akaka: The Hawai'i Alliance for Community-\n     Based Economic Development (HACBED) is pleased to support the \n     bill titled, ``Improving Access to Mainstream Financial \n     Institutions Act of 2008.''\n       Hawai'i needs comprehensive public policies to help people \n     build assets. This should include a package of programs, tax \n     incentives, regulatory changes, and other mechanisms to help \n     people earn more, save more, protect hard earned assets, \n     start businesses and become homeowners.\n       Assets are essential for three reasons:\n       To have financial security against difficult times; to \n     create economic opportunities for oneself; and to leave a \n     legacy for future generations to have a better life.\n       This legislation would create the following two grant \n     programs within the Department of Treasury:\n       1. The first program would authorize grants intended to \n     help low- and moderate-income unbanked individuals to \n     establish bank or credit union accounts.\n       2. The second program would provide consumers with a lower \n     cost, short term alternative to payday loans as well as \n     financial education.\n       It is proven that ``banked'' households are better of \n     financially and more likely to build and own assets than \n     their ``unbanked'' counterparts. This bill will authorize \n     grants to assist millions of families to enter the financial \n     mainstream.\n       Programs that help low- and moderate-income unbanked \n     individuals to establish bank accounts provide families with \n     the opportunity to save and build their assets. Approximately \n     22 million U.S. households do not have a checking or savings \n     account. These households depend on various high-cost, \n     alternative financial service providers to meet their banking \n     needs, including check-cashing stores, payday lenders, title \n     lenders, rent-to-own stores, and tax preparers. Reliance on \n     these types of financial services undermines a family's \n     ability to survive as they can become trapped in a cycle of \n     debt due to high fees and interest rates. These families' put \n     nearly 13.3 billion dollars toward predatory lending scams \n     annually.\n       By improving our families' access to mainstream services, \n     we can enhance their financial security and success. Access \n     to savings and checking accounts can provide a foundation for \n     low- and moderate-families to begin accumulating assets. In \n     addition, families are more likely to save for assets such as \n     their children's college education, a home, retirement, and \n     business startup costs. By entering the financial mainstream \n     and having access to financial services, families are also \n     able to establish credit and increase their access to buying \n     power for the purchase of assets.\n       Payday loans and other financial services with high fees \n     and interest rates undermine families' ability to truly save \n     and build their assets. This bill will provide families with \n     an alternative to payday loans as well as the opportunity to \n     receive financial education.\n       Check cashing, or payday lending, is a short-term, high-\n     interest loan that has the potential to severely impact \n     consumers. Many consumers are often not aware of the annual \n     percentage rate associated with the fee structure of payday \n     loans causing millions of families to struggle to meet their \n     most basic needs to survive.\n       It is extremely important to protect hard working families \n     from financial services that are predatory in nature, and \n     stripping them of their hard earned income. Particularly \n     worrisome is the practice of targeting military families. \n     According to the Center for Responsible Lending, active-duty \n     military personnel are three times more likely than civilians \n     to take out a payday loan and one in five active-duty \n     personnel are payday borrowers.\n       The loans provided to families under the grant in this bill \n     would be subject to the annual percentage rate promulgated by \n     the National Credit Union Administration's (NCUA) Loan \n     Interest Rates, which is currently capped at an annual \n     percentage rate of 18 percent.\n       Several credit unions have developed similar products to \n     assist families. In Hawai'i, the Windward Community Federal \n     Credit Union has developed an affordable alternative to \n     payday loans to help the Marines and the other members that \n     they serve. This program was developed with an NCUA grant.\n       This bill will also provide financial education to families \n     that apply for the loans. As the financial market expands and \n     becomes more complex, having a financial education is \n     extremely important for every family. More than ever, \n     financial education can help families navigate the maze of \n     financial services that exist. Providing families with a \n     financial education allows them to have choice and control \n     over their finances so they are able to save and build \n     assets.\n       We urge the Senate's favorable consideration of this bill \n     that would give millions of low- and moderate-income families \n     the opportunity to successfully enter the financial world.\n           Mahalo nui loa,\n                                                 Larissa Meinecke,\n                                          Public Policy Associate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Brown, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 3413. A bill to achieve access to comprehensive primary health \ncare services for all Americans and to improve primary care delivery \nthrough an expansion of the community health center and National Health \nService Corps programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today there is some good news and some \nbad news. The bad news is that oil is at $123 a barrel and working \npeople are paying $4 for a gallon of gas, and this coming winter \nresidents of the Northeast could be paying over $5 for a gallon of \nheating oil.\n  But, there is some good news. Today, the CEOs of ExxonMobil, Shell, \nBP and ConocoPhillips are celebrating. They're feeling pretty good. \nAnd, they have good reason to feel that way.\n  ExxonMobil reported today that it made over $11.68 billion in profits \nover the 2nd quarter alone, breaking its own record for the largest \nquarterly profit of any American company in the history of the world.\n  But, ExxonMobil is not alone. Shell's 2nd quarter profit jumped by 33 \npercent to $11.56 billion; and BP's 2nd quarter profit jumped by 28 \npercent.\n  As a matter of fact, since George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have been \nin office, the five largest oil companies have made over $640 billion \nin profits. This includes $212 billion for ExxonMobil; $157 billion for \nShell; $125 billion for BP; $80 billion for ChevronTexaco; and $66 \nbillion for ConocoPhillips.\n  Believe it or not, the Big 5 oil companies made more profits during \nthe 2nd quarter, than they did during the entire year of 2002.\n  Now, with the exception of my Republican friends here in Congress, \nthere are very few people in this country who believe the oil companies \ngive one hoot about the well-being of the American people. Our \nRepublican friends are saying that if we just give these huge oil \ncompanies more acres offshore to drill for oil, they will certainly do \nthe right thing, as they always have, for the American people. Let's \njust trust those big oil companies because they are really staying up \nday after day, night after night, worrying about the well-being of the \nAmerican people. That is what their full-page ads in the New York Times \nand all their ads on television are telling us.\n  Well, it is good to see there are at least some people in America who \nbelieve that. I don't, but apparently my Republican colleagues do.\n  Let me tell you, big oil companies are so concerned about Americans \npaying high prices for gas and oil that this is what they are doing \nwith their profits:\n  In 2005, ExxonMobil gave its CEO, Lee Raymond, a $398 million \nretirement package--one of the richest compensation packages in \ncorporate history. They weren't going out looking for new land to drill \non, they weren't building more refineries, and they weren't working on \nenergy efficiency. They gave their CEO a $398 million retirement \npackage.\n  In 2006, Occidental Petroleum, gave its CEO, Ray Irani, over $400 \nmillion in total compensation.\n  The situation is so absurd and the greed of the oil companies is so \noutrageous that these companies are not only giving their executives \nhuge compensation packages during their life here on earth, but they \nhave also created a situation, if you can believe it, where these oil \ncompanies have carved out huge corporate payments to the heirs of \nsenior executives if they die in office. I guess this is what happens \nwhen you have more money than you know what to do with.\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, if the CEO of Occidental \nPetroleum dies in office, his family will get $115 million. The family \nof the CEO of Nabors Industries, another oil company, would receive \n$288 million. This would be funny if it were not so pathetic in the \nsense of the impact this type of spending has on the American people.\n  Not only are huge oil companies using their record-breaking profits \non big compensation benefits for their CEOs, but they are also spending \nlarge sums of money buying back their own stock. In other words, when \nthey are making these very large profits, they are not going out \ndrilling for more oil, as our Republican friends are suggesting.\n  In fact, While Americans are struggling to pay for the skyrocketing \nprice of gasoline; big oil companies are having an entirely different \nproblem. For the past seven years, big oil companies are struggling to \nfigure out what they are going to do with all of their windfall \nprofits.\n  Let me quote from a headline taken from the front page of the Wall \nStreet Journal way back on July 30 of 2001, ``Pumping Money: Major Oil \nCompanies Struggle to Spend Huge Hoards of Cash.'' According to this \n2001 article, ``Royal Dutch/Shell Group said it was pumping out $1.5 \nmillion in profit an hour and sitting on more than $11 billion in the \nbank.'' That was in 2001. Since that time Shell's profits have more \nthan tripled.\n  On April 18, 2005, Fortune Magazine published an article with the \nHeadline ``Poor Little Rich Company,'' referring to ExxonMobil. \nAccording to this article, ``ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond, suddenly has a \nnew anxiety: how to spend the windfall wrought by $55 a barrel oil. By \nthe end of April [of 2005], Exxon will have a cash hoard of more than \n$25 billion. . . . At a time when domestic energy production is \ndeclining and drivers are paying a record $2.15 a gallon [remember, \nthis was in 2005], American consumers, not to mention politicians, are \nlikely to start focusing on whether Exxon is spending enough to find \noil and gas. While Exxon is returning more money to shareholders via \ndividends and buying back more of its stock, its spending on drilling \nand other development activities actually declined in 2004--even though \ncrude prices jumped by a third.'' That was when the price of oil was \n$55 a barrel and gas was $2.15 a gallon. Today oil is over $123 a \nbarrel and gas is about $4 a gallon.\n  What is happening today? Big oil companies are spending even more on \nstock buybacks and CEO compensation and less on trying to produce more \noil.\n  For example, ConocoPhillips recently announced that it plans to give \nall of the $12 billion in profits it made last year back to \nshareholders, paying more than $3 billion in dividends and spending the \nrest to buy back shares of its own stock. To put this in perspective \nthe money that ConocoPhillips is spending on stock buybacks and \ndividends is enough to reduce the price of gas by 9 cents a gallon \nthroughout the entire United States.\n  Now, I want my Republican friends to listen closely. They have been \nsaying over and over again that big oil desperately needs all of these \nwindfall profits to drill for more oil.\n  But, guess what? According to the CEO of ConocoPhillips, James Mulva, \n``We like the discipline of the share repurchase. If we find that we \nhave more cash flow, it's not really going to be going toward capital \nspending.'' In other words, ConocoPhillips won't use their windfall \nprofits to drill for more oil, or invest in renewable energy, or \nexplore for new sources of oil discoveries no matter how much their \nprofits rise.\n  Overall, since 2005, the five biggest oil companies have made $345 \nbillion in profits and spent over $250 billion buying back stock and \npaying dividends to shareholders.\n  Last year, ExxonMobil spent 850 percent more buying back its own \nstock than it did on capital expenditures in the United States.\n  The $38 billion in windfall profits that ExxonMobil gave back to \nshareholders last year could have been used to reduce gas prices at the \npump throughout the United States by 27 cents a gallon for the entire \nyear.\n  Mr. President, let's not kid ourselves. One of the major reasons as \nto why Americans are getting ripped-off at the gas pump has to do with \nthe tremendous power and influence that big oil companies have in the \nCongress. As a matter of fact, since 1998, the oil and gas industry has \nspent over $616 million on lobbying activities.\n  Who have they hired? Well, on April 8 of this year, The Hill reported \nthat Chevron hired former Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican; \nformer Senator John Breaux, a Democrat; their sons Chester Trent Lott, \nJr. and John Breaux, Jr.; and Trent Boyles, who was Lott's Chief of \nStaff to lobby Congress on issues relating to trade, climate change, \nand energy taxes.\n  ExxonMobil has hired former Senator Don Nickles, a Republican from \nOklahoma, who served in this body for 24 years, to lobby Congress on \nbehalf of their issues.\n  These are just a few of the hundreds of lobbyists that big oil and \ngas companies have hired to influence Congress, many of them former \nSenators, former Congressmen, and former Congressional staffers.\n  That is one of the reasons why, among many other reasons, this \nCongress, in recent years, has decided to give some $18 billion in tax \nbreaks to oil companies despite their record-breaking profits.\n  In addition, since 1990 big oil companies have made over $213 million \nin campaign contributions. And that is a simple fact.\n  Lo and behold, what we are hearing today--just coincidentally, no \ndoubt--is that the most important thing we can do in terms of the \nenergy crisis is to provide more land offshore for the oil companies to \ndrill at a time when they already have some 68 million acres of leased \nland, which they are not drilling on today.\n  The American people want action, and there are some things we can \ndo--not in 15 or 20 years but that we can do right now.\n  First, we need to impose a windfall profits tax on big oil companies \nso that they would be prohibited from gouging consumers at the gas \npump.\n  Unfortunately, instead of taking away big oil's windfall profits and \ngiving it back to the American people, Republicans want to provide even \nmore tax breaks to big oil. In fact, Sen. McCain has a plan that would \ngive ExxonMobil a $1.5 billion tax break.\n  Now, we have heard Republicans give three reasons as to why they are \nopposed to a windfall profits tax.\n  First, Republicans claim that the last time Congress enacted a \nwindfall profits tax in 1981 it had the effect of increasing our \ndependence on foreign oil. Wrong. Mr. President, when Congress repealed \nthe windfall profits tax in 1988, the U.S. was importing 7.4 million \nbarrels of oil a day. Today, the U.S. is importing over 13.4 million \nbarrels of oil a day. We are far more dependent on foreign oil today \nwithout a windfall profits tax than we were 20 years ago when we had a \nwindfall profits tax.\n  Secondly, my Republican friends tell us that the windfall profits tax \ndidn't work because Congress repealed it in 1988. That is also wrong. \nWhile I would have structured it differently, the fact of the matter is \nthat from 1981 until 1988 when the windfall profits tax was repealed, \nthe price of oil fell from $35 a barrel to less than $15 a barrel. In \naddition, gas prices at the pump fell from $1.35 a gallon to 90 cents a \ngallon--a drop of 45 cents a gallon. And the Federal Government \ncollected over $80 billion in revenue.\n  The reason why the windfall profits tax was repealed was due to low \noil and gas prices, which makes perfect sense. If oil and gas prices \nare low, big oil companies are not making windfall profits and there is \nno need for a windfall profits tax. If gas prices at the pump were only \n90 cents a gallon, I would be one of the first Senators to say we don't \nneed a windfall profits tax. But, they are not. They are over $4 a \ngallon.\n  Finally, Republicans claim that big oil companies need to keep their \nwindfall profits so that they can increase production and build more \nrefineries. That particular argument is laughable.\n  Big oil companies have been making windfall profits for over seven \nlong years--and they are not using these profits to build more \nrefineries and they are not using it to expand production. Instead, \nthey are using this money to buy back their own stock, increase \ndividends to their shareholders,\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nand enrich their CEOs, as I have explained earlier.\n  Not only do we need to impose a windfall profits tax on these \nextremely powerful oil corporations, but we also have to address what I \nperceive is a growing understanding that Wall Street investment banks, \nsuch as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, and hedge fund \nmanagers are driving up the price of oil in the unregulated energy \nfutures market. In other words, they are speculating on energy futures \nand driving up prices.\n  There are estimates that 25 to 50 percent of the cost of a barrel of \noil is attributable to unregulated speculation on oil futures. We have \nheard from some leading energy economists, and we have heard from \npeople in the oil industry themselves who tell us that 25 to 50 percent \nof the cost of a barrel of oil today is not due to supply and demand or \nthe cost of production but is due to manipulation of markets and \nexcessive speculation. In essence, Wall Street firms are making \nbillions as they artificially drive up oil prices by buying, holding, \nand selling huge amounts of oil on dark unregulated markets.\n  Some of my Republican friends claim that the increase in the price of \noil has nothing to do with speculation, but it is interesting to me \nthat we have had executives of major oil companies--major oil \ncompanies--who have come before Congress and who are saying, ``Why is \noil $125, $130, and $140 a barrel?'' Do you know what they say? The CEO \nof Royal Dutch Shell testified before Congress and said: ``The oil \nfundamentals are no problem. They are the same as they were when oil \nwas selling for $60 a barrel.''\n  This is not some radical economist. It is not some left-winger. This \nis a guy who is the head of Royal Dutch Shell.\n  The CEO of Marathon Oil recently said: ``$100 oil isn't justified by \nthe physical demand in the market.''\n  I know my Republican friends have a lot of respect for the oil \nindustry, a great competence in them. They love them and give them huge \ntax breaks. So maybe they should listen to what some of these guys are \nsaying in terms of oil speculation.\n  For those who believe that excessive speculation is not causing oil \nprices to climb higher, let me just say this. Over the past 7 years, \nEnron; BP; and Amaranth were caught redhanded manipulating the price of \nelectricity; propane; and natural gas. Each time, supply and demand was \nto blame and each time the pundits were proven wrong. Excessive \nspeculation; manipulation and greed were the cause.

Res. 636\n\n       Whereas, by the end of 2006, it had become clear that, \n     despite exceptional efforts and sacrifices on the part of the \n     United States Armed Forces in Iraq, the United States was \n     pursuing a failed strategy in Iraq;\n       Whereas, by the end of 2006, large-scale sectarian violence \n     was accelerating throughout Iraq, al Qaeda had established \n     significant safe havens there, militias sponsored by the \n     Government of Iran had seized effective control of large \n     swaths of Iraq, and the Government of Iraq was suffering from \n     political paralysis;\n       Whereas, by the end of 2006, insurgents and death squads \n     were killing more than 3,000 civilians in Iraq each month and \n     coalition forces were sustaining more than 1,200 attacks each \n     week;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, the Iraq Study Group warned that \n     ``the United States is facing one of its most difficult and \n     significant international challenges in decades'' in Iraq and \n     that ``Iraq is vital to regional and even global stability, \n     and is critical to U.S. interests'';\n       Whereas, in December 2004, Osama bin Laden said the \n     following of the war in Iraq: ``The most important and \n     serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World \n     War. . . . The world's millstone and pillar is Baghdad, the \n     capital of the caliphate.'';\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, in an address to the Nation, \n     President George W. Bush acknowledged that the situation in \n     Iraq was ``unacceptable'' and announced his intention to put \n     in place a new strategy, subsequently known as ``the surge'';\n       Whereas President Bush nominated and the Senate confirmed \n     General David H. Petraeus as the Commander of Multi-National \n     Forces-Iraq, a position he assumed on February 10, 2007;\n       Whereas General Petraeus, upon assuming command, and in \n     partnership with Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, the \n     Commander of Multi-National Corps-Iraq, and United States \n     Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, developed a comprehensive \n     civil-military counterinsurgency campaign plan to reverse \n     Iraq's slide into chaos, defeat the enemies of the United \n     States in Iraq, and, in partnership with the Iraqi Security \n     Forces and the Government of Iraq, reestablish security \n     across the country;\n       Whereas, under the previous strategy, the overwhelming \n     majority of United States combat forces were concentrated on \n     a small number of large forward operating bases and were not \n     assigned the mission of providing security for the people of \n     Iraq against insurgents, terrorists, and militia fighters, in \n     part because there were insufficient members of the United \n     States Armed Forces in Iraq to do so;\n       Whereas, as an integral component of the surge, \n     approximately 5 additional United States Army brigades and 2 \n     United States Marine Corps battalions were deployed to Iraq;\n       Whereas, as an integral component of the surge, members of \n     the United States Armed Forces were deployed out of large \n     forward operating bases onto small bases throughout Baghdad \n     and other key population centers, partnering with the Iraqi \n     Security Forces to provide security for the local population \n     against insurgents, terrorists, and militia fighters;\n       Whereas additional members of the United States Armed \n     Forces began moving into Iraq in January 2007 and reached \n     full strength in June 2007;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the additional forces needed \n     in Iraq, in April 2007 the United States Army added 3 months \n     to the standard year-long tour for all active duty soldiers \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the United States Marine Corps \n     added 3 months to the standard 6-month tour for all active \n     duty Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, as an integral component of the surge, members of \n     the United States Armed Forces began simultaneous and \n     successive offensive operations, in partnership with the \n     Iraqi Security Forces, of unprecedented breadth, continuity, \n     and sophistication, striking multiple enemy safe havens and \n     lines of communication at the same time;\n       Whereas, as an integral component of the surge, additional \n     members of the United States Armed Forces were deployed to \n     Anbar province to provide essential support to the nascent \n     tribal revolt against al Qaeda in that province;\n       Whereas those additional members of the United States Armed \n     Forces played a critical role in the success and spread of \n     anti-Qaeda Sunni tribal groups in Anbar province and \n     subsequently in other regions of Iraq;\n       Whereas, since the start of the surge in January 2007, \n     there have been marked and hopeful improvements in almost \n     every political, security, and economic indicator in Iraq;\n       Whereas, in 2007, General Petraeus described Iraq as ``the \n     central front of al Qaeda's global campaign'';\n       Whereas, in 2008, as a consequence of the success of the \n     surge, al Qaeda has been dealt what Director of Central \n     Intelligence Michael Hayden assesses as a ``near strategic \n     defeat'' in Iraq;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     militias backed by the Government of Iran have been routed \n     from major population centers in Iraq and no longer control \n     significant swaths of territory;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     sectarian violence in Iraq has fallen dramatically and has \n     been almost entirely eliminated;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     overall insurgent attacks have fallen by approximately 80 \n     percent since June 2007 and are at their lowest level since \n     March 2004;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     United States casualties in Iraq have dropped dramatically \n     and United States combat deaths in Iraq in July 2008 were \n     lower than in any other month since the beginning of the war;\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, the \n     Government of Iraq has made significant strides in advancing \n     sectarian reconciliation and achieving political progress, \n     including the passage of key benchmark legislation;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, the \n     Iraqi Security Forces have improved markedly and \n     approximately 70 percent of Iraqi combat battalions are now \n     leading operations in their areas; and\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the success of the surge, \n     General Petraeus concluded in 2008 that conditions on the \n     ground in Iraq could permit the additional brigades and \n     battalions dispatched to Iraq in 2007 as part of the surge to \n     be safely redeployed without replacement, and all such \n     brigades and battalions have been successfully withdrawn \n     without replacement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends and expresses its gratitude to the men and \n     women of the United States Armed Forces for the service, \n     sacrifices, and heroism that made the success of the troop \n     surge in Iraq possible;\n       (2) commends and expresses its gratitude to General David \n     H. Petraeus, General Raymond Odierno, and Ambassador Ryan \n     Crocker for the distinguished wartime leadership that made \n     the success of the troop surge in Iraq possible;\n       (3) recognizes the success of the troop surge in Iraq and \n     its strategic significance in advancing the vital national \n     interests of the United States in Iraq, the Middle East, and \n     the world, in particular as a strategic victory in a central \n     front of the war on terrorism; and\n       (4) recognizes that the hard-won gains achieved as a result \n     of the troop surge in Iraq are significant but not yet \n     permanent and that it is imperative that no action be taken \n     that jeopardizes those gains or dishonors the service and \n     sacrifice of the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces who made those gains possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7974-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7974-S7975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 637--TO HONOR THE VISIONARY AND EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF \n LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY AND IBM ON THE ROADRUNNER SUPERCOMPUTER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources:\n\n                              S. Res. 637\n\n       Whereas on May 26, 2008, the Roadrunner supercomputer of \n     the Los Alamos National Laboratory broke a historic barrier \n     by being powerful enough to run at a petaflop, \n     1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second, making the \n     Roadrunner supercomputer the fastest computer in the world;\n       Whereas International Business Machines Corporation \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``IBM'') and Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory overcame the challenges of technological \n     innovation to achieve a petaflop ahead of schedule;\n       Whereas the Roadrunner supercomputer will enable the United \n     States to tackle new and more challenging problems;\n       Whereas the Roadrunner supercomputer will be primarily \n     devoted to national security in the United States and will be \n     used for ensuring the safety and reliability of the weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and for research in \n     astrophysics, materials science, energy research, medicine, \n     and biotechnology;\n       Whereas Cell-based supercomputer technology of IBM is the \n     most energy efficient in the world;\n       Whereas the new high-performance computing capabilities \n     enabled by hybrid Opteron-Cell machines of IBM in the \n     Roadrunner supercomputer of Los Alamos National Laboratory \n     enhance and improve United States competitiveness;\n       Whereas from maintaining employment records for millions of \n     people of the United States, to providing technology to help \n     the United States run the Ballistic Missile Early Warning \n     System, land on Mars, end the physical testing of atomic \n     weapons, and now help national security by ensuring the \n     safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile of the United States \n     and researching issues of critical importance such as human \n     genome science and climate change, the partnership of IBM \n     with the Federal Government and the dedication of that \n     partnership to solving critical problems that are seemingly \n     impossible have remained unrivaled and relentless for more \n     than 80 years;\n       Whereas the Roadrunner supercomputer is the most recent \n     achievement of long-standing science and technology \n     leadership of Los Alamos National Laboratory, from the \n     Manhattan Project to the role of the Laboratory today as a \n     premier national security science laboratory; and\n       Whereas, the Roadrunner supercomputer funding was initiated \n     with $35,000,000 in the Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-103): Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the visionary and \n     extraordinary work of Los Alamos National Laboratory and IBM \n     for--\n       (1) pushing the barriers of science and providing the \n     United States with historical high-performance computing \n     capabilities that will allow some of the most challenging \n     problems in science and engineering to be solved; and\n       (2) achieving the capability to make petaflop calculations, \n     which--\n       (A) is considered a crucial milestone internationally;\n       (B) is considered a sign of the competitiveness of the \n     United States in the critical new area of high-performance \n     computing capability; and\n       (C) will allow the United States to solve even bigger and \n     more complex problems from the safety of the nuclear \n     deterrent of the United States to human genome science and \n     climate change.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nresolution to recognize the achievement of a major scientific milestone \nby two great American institutions--Los Alamos National Laboratory and \nIBM--to build the first supercomputer to break the ``petaflop'' barrier \nin supercomputing. A petaflop is a million, billion calculations per \nsecond. Think of that--a million, billion calculations in a second. If \nevery human being on the planet were given a calculator it would take \n50 years to do what this supercomputer can do in a single day.\n  This supercomputer is called the ``Roadrunner'' and was developed \ncooperatively by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and IBM--two \nAmerican institutions which have a long and prestigious history in \ndelivering major technological breakthroughs for the Nation.\n  The Roadrunner is the fastest computer in the world. It more than \ndoubles the previous record. We can be very proud this achievement for \nAmerican science and technology. It highlights the essential role our \nnational laboratories play in advancing the state of the art for high \nperformance computing--a vital component of our national security and \nscientific leadership.\n  Every year, computing power increases at a pace set by America's \nnational laboratories. From developing advanced computing architectures \nand algorithms, to creating effective means for storing and viewing the \nenormous amounts of data generated by these machines, the laboratories \nhave made high performance computing a reality.\n  These applications go well beyond security and basic science. The \nlaboratories have worked hard to transition these capabilities to \nacademia and industry, simulating complex industrial processes and \ntheir environmental impact, including global climate change.\n  Collaborations with the private sector have also driven down the \ncost, so that now high performance does not mean high expense. This has \nhad an enormous impact, placing advanced computing within reach of an \never wider circle of users.\n  These achievements did not happen by accident. They required \nplanning, commitment and follow through. Indeed, the Roadrunner began \nas an earmark in the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill. Congress \nmust ensure that the world class simulation capabilities within the \ncomplex are maintained and investments are made to drive future \ninnovation.\n  We must continue to raise the bar, giving our best and brightest new \ngoals to work toward, ensuring that America will retain its technical \nleadership in advanced computing.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing Los Alamos National \nLaboratory and IBM for reaching yet another milestone in \nsupercomputing.\n  In particular, I want to commend the members of the Roadrunner team.\n  From Los Alamos: Sriram Swaninarayan, Paul Henning, Adolfy Hoisie, \nGuy Dimonte, Darren Kerbyson, Brian Albright, Tim Germann, Ben Bergen, \nKen Koch, Manuel Vigil, Randal Rheinheimer, Parks Fields, John Cerutti.\n  From IBM: Nicholas Donofrio, Cornell Wright, William Zeitler, David \nTurek, Don Grice, and Catherine Crawford.\n  Participants from academia included Steven Zuker of Yale University \nand James DiCarlo from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  Congratulations on a job well done.\n  Top 10 Fastest Supercomputers in the World (June 2008).\n  Name, Location, Speed (TFlop/s).\n  1.

Res. 638\n\n       Whereas women are the health care decisionmakers for \n     themselves and their families;\n       Whereas women want affordable health care they can count on \n     throughout life transitions, such as starting a family, job \n     changes, part-time and full-time work, divorce, caring for an \n     elderly or sick family member, having a major disease, or \n     retiring;\n       Whereas women with good health coverage worry about keeping \n     their coverage and access to their providers;\n       Whereas women are more likely to seek essential preventive \n     and routine care than are men, are more likely to have a \n     chronic health condition, and are more likely to take a \n     prescription drug on a daily basis;\n       Whereas women pay 68 percent more than men for out-of-\n     pocket medical costs, due in large part to reproductive \n     health care needs;\n       Whereas more than half of underinsured women (53 percent) \n     and \\2/3\\ of uninsured women (68 percent) forego needed care, \n     and about half of the underinsured (45 percent) and uninsured \n     (51 percent) report difficulty paying medical bills;\n       Whereas, in 2004, 1 in 6 women with individual coverage \n     reported postponing or going without needed care because she \n     couldn't afford it;\n       Whereas high-deductible health plans are often targeted to \n     young women as an inexpensive health coverage option, but \n     fail to cover pregnancy-related care, the most expensive \n     health event most young families face and the leading reason \n     for hospital stays;\n       Whereas 75,000,000 adults (42 percent of the under-65 \n     population) had either no insurance or inadequate insurance \n     in 2007, up from 35 percent in 2003;\n       Whereas 47,000,000 people, nearly 16 percent of the United \n     States population, are uninsured, including 17,000,000 adult \n     women ages 18 to 64 (18 percent) and 9,000,000 children (12 \n     percent);\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine estimated that lack of \n     health insurance coverage resulted in 18,000 excess deaths in \n     the United States in 2000 (a number which the Urban Institute \n     estimates grew to 22,000 by 2006) and that acquiring health \n     insurance reduces mortality rates for the uninsured by 10 to \n     15 percent;\n       Whereas uninsured women with breast cancer are 30 to 50 \n     percent more likely to die from the disease, and uninsured \n     women are 3 times less likely to have had a Pap test in the \n     last 3 years, with a 60 percent greater risk of late-stage \n     cervical cancer;\n       Whereas 13 percent of all pregnant women are uninsured, \n     making them less likely to seek prenatal care in the 1st \n     trimester and to receive the optimal number of visits during \n     their pregnancies, and 31 percent more likely to experience \n     an adverse health outcome after giving birth;\n       Whereas the lack or inadequate use of prenatal care is \n     associated with pregnancy-related mortality rates 2 to 3 \n     times higher and infant mortality rates 6 times higher than \n     that of women receiving early prenatal care, as well as \n     increased risk of low birthweight and preterm birth;\n       Whereas heart disease is the leading cause of death for \n     both women and men, but women are less likely to receive \n     lifestyle counseling, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, \n     and cardiac rehabilitation and more likely to die or have a \n     2nd heart attack, demonstrating inequalities in access to \n     care;\n       Whereas health care disparities persist, leaving Hispanic \n     and Native American women and children 3 times more likely \n     and African Americans nearly twice as likely to be uninsured \n     as non-Hispanic Whites;\n       Whereas, in 2005, nearly 80 percent of the female \n     population infected with the human immunodeficiency virus \n     (HIV) was Black or Hispanic, and the incidence rates of HIV \n     and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are \n     dramatically higher for Black and Hispanic women and \n     adolescents (60.2 and 15.8 per 100,000, respectively) than \n     for White women and adolescents (3.0 per 100,000);\n       Whereas women are less likely than men to be insured \n     through their jobs and more likely to be insured as a \n     dependent, making them more vulnerable to insurance loss in \n     the event of divorce or death of a spouse;\n       Whereas 64 percent of uninsured women are in families with \n     at least 1 adult working full-time;\n       Whereas health care costs are increasingly unaffordable for \n     working families and employers, with employer-sponsored \n     health insurance premiums increasing 87 percent since 2000;\n       Whereas America's 9,100,000 women-owned businesses employ \n     27,500,000 people, contribute $3,600,000,000 to the economy, \n     and face serious obstacles in obtaining affordable health \n     coverage for their employees;\n       Whereas the lack of affordable health coverage creates \n     barriers for women who want to change jobs or create their \n     own small businesses;\n       Whereas health care professionals and workers--a \n     significant portion of whom are women--have a stake in \n     achieving reform that allows them to provide the highest \n     quality care for their patients;\n       Whereas 56 percent of all caregivers are women;\n       Whereas the United States spends twice as much on health \n     care as the median industrialized nation, our health care \n     system ranks near the bottom on most measures of health \n     status among the 30 developed nations of the Organisation for \n     Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and 37th in \n     overall health performance among 191 nations; and\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Medicine (NIH) estimates \n     that the cost of achieving full insurance coverage in the \n     United States would be less than the loss in economic \n     productivity from existing coverage gaps: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commits to pass, and urges the \n     President sign into law, within the next 18 months, \n     legislation that guarantees health care for all women and \n     health care for all people of the United States and that--\n       (1) recognizes the special role that women play as health \n     care consumers, caregivers, and providers;\n       (2) guarantees inclusion of health care benefits essential \n     to achieving and maintaining good health, including \n     comprehensive reproductive health, pregnancy-related, and \n     infant care;\n       (3) promotes primary and preventive care, including family \n     planning, contraceptive equity, and care continuity;\n       (4) provides a choice of public and private plans and \n     direct access to a choice of doctors and health providers \n     that ensures continuity of coverage and a delivery system \n     that meets the needs of women;\n       (5) eliminates health disparities in coverage, treatment, \n     and outcomes on the basis of gender, culture, race, \n     ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health status, and sexual \n     orientation;\n       (6) shares responsibility for financing among employers, \n     individuals, and the government while taking into account the \n     needs of small businesses;\n       (7) ensures that access to health care is affordable;\n       (8) enhances quality and patient safety;\n       (9) promotes administrative efficiency, reduces unnecessary \n     paperwork, and is easy for health care consumers and \n     providers to utilize; and\n       (10) ensures a sufficient supply of qualified providers \n     through expanded medical and public health education and \n     adequate reimbursement.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to issue a challenge on the \nneed to reform health care. The resolution I am introducing today with \nmy friend and colleague, Representative Jan Schakowsky, calls on \nCongress to send a plan to the next President that will ensure high-\nquality and affordable health care for women and for all. I also am \nproud to be joined by my colleagues, Senators Obama, Klobuchar, \nCantwell, McCaskill, Mikulski, Murray, Clinton, Boxer, and Kennedy.\n  We spend twice as much on health care as any other industrialized \nnation, yet we have an unacceptably high number of Americans without \nhealth insurance--nearly 50 million. Millions more are also \nunderinsured and have less coverage than they need. We are blessed with \nthe best doctors, nurses, and other health providers in the world but \nrank 43rd in the world in infant mortality.\n  We are all in this together. From working families to the uninsured, \nfrom multinational corporations to small businesses, we all face \nchallenges in making sure Americans get the quality, affordable health \ncare they need, when they need it. Rising costs are crippling our \nbusinesses and our economy. Health care costs make large businesses, \nlike Michigan's automakers, less competitive globally and threaten the \nsurvival of small firms.\n  We must ensure that no child is denied doctor visits, no pregnant \nwoman has to choose between prenatal care and her rent, and no working \nfamily pays high premiums every month only to find that the care they \nmost need isn't covered. And we need to end\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\nhealth care disparities that affect women. For example, heart disease \nis a leading cause of death for both women and men but women are less \nlikely to receive lifestyle counseling or other medical intervention \nand more likely to die or have a second heart attack.\n  Women understand these hard choices and are calling on Congress to \nfind a solution. As mothers with young children, women with aging \nparents, small business owners, health professionals and health care \nconsumers, women confront problems in our health care system every day.\n  We are pleased to have the support of numerous groups representing \nphysicians, women, and families, including the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, Planned Parenthood, the National \nWomen's Law Center, and the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies.\n  There is much work to be done to change our health care system and it \nis going to take everyone's best effort, working together, to achieve \nit. America's families, businesses, and providers cannot wait any \nlonger. This resolution is a first step and a signal that we need to \nroll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7976-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 639--RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS OF TRANSPORTATION \nIMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE UNITED STATES ROUTE 36 CORRIDOR TO COMMUNITIES, \n                INDIVIDUALS, AND BUSINESSES IN COLORADO\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR (for himself and Mr. Allard) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works:\n\n                              S.

Res. 640\n\n       Whereas the United States has the highest rate of \n     preventable deaths among 19 industrialized countries and lags \n     behind 28 other members of the United Nations in life \n     expectancy;\n       Whereas various research studies suggest that nearly 60 \n     percent of premature deaths in the United States are \n     attributable to environmental conditions, social \n     circumstances, or behavioral choices that could be prevented;\n       Whereas more money is spent each year on health care in the \n     United States than in any other country in the world;\n       Whereas, of the more than $2,200,000,000,000 spent on \n     health care in the United States each year, less than 4 cents \n     out of every dollar are spent on improving public health and \n     preventing diseases and injuries;\n       Whereas chronic diseases are the leading cause of \n     preventable death and disability in the United States, \n     accounting for 7 out of every 10 deaths and killing more than \n     1,700,000 people in the United States each year;\n       Whereas those often preventable chronic diseases account \n     for approximately 75 percent of health care spending in the \n     United States each year, including more than 96 cents out of \n     every dollar spent under the Medicare program and more than \n     83 cents out of every dollar spent under the Medicaid \n     program;\n       Whereas those chronic diseases cost the United States an \n     additional $1,000,000,000,000 each year in lost productivity \n     and are a major contributing factor to the overall poor \n     health that is placing the Nation's economic security and \n     competitiveness in jeopardy;\n       Whereas the number of people with chronic diseases is \n     rapidly increasing, and it is estimated that by 2050 nearly \n     half of the population of the United States will suffer from \n     at least one chronic disease if action is not taken;\n       Whereas the use of clinically-based preventive services has \n     been demonstrated to prevent or result in early detection of \n     cancer and other diseases, save lives, and reduce overall \n     health care costs; and\n       Whereas research has shown that investing in community-\n     level interventions that promote and enable proper nutrition, \n     increased access to physical activity, and smoking cessation \n     programs can prevent or mitigate chronic diseases, improve \n     quality of life, increase economic productivity, and reduce \n     health care costs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that, in order to reduce the disease burden \n     and health care costs associated with preventable diseases \n     and injuries, it is imperative that the United States \n     strengthen its public health system--\n       (A) to provide all people in the United States with the \n     information, resources, and environment necessary to make \n     healthier choices and live healthier lives; and\n       (B) to protect all people in the United States from health \n     threats beyond their control, such as bioterrorism, natural \n     disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, and environmental \n     hazards;\n       (2) commits to creating public health strategies to \n     eliminate health disparities and improve the health of all \n     people in the United States, regardless of race, ethnicity, \n     or socioeconomic status;\n       (3) supports the prioritizing of public policies focusing \n     on the prevention of disease and injury;\n       (4) calls for community-based programs to support healthy \n     lifestyles, including programs that promote proper nutrition \n     and increased access to physical activity;\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n       (5) urges the expansion of clinical preventive activities, \n     including screenings and immunizations; and\n       (6) pledges to help significantly improve the health of all \n     people in the United States by supporting increased \n     investment in Federal public health programs.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \npromoting increased investment in preventive health and public health.\n  Our Nation's annual health expenditures have reached the astonishing \ntotal of $2.2 trillion, or approximately $7,000 for each American. Our \nhealth expenditures also represent 16 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. That's a higher percentage of GDP than any other nation as \nwell as a higher amount per capita.\n  But what are we getting for our health care dollars? Rankings from \nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, \nconsistently show the United States ranking far behind most other \nindustrialized countries in overall health status, in infant health as \nmeasured by infant mortality rates, and in life expectancy.\n  And if we examine the distribution of expenditures, it becomes \napparent that we are dedicating the lion's share of resources to a few, \nchronic diseases, such as diabetes, and hypertension. From 1987 to \n2000, while our overall health care spending doubled, spending on \nstrokes nearly quadrupled and spending on hypertension rose from $8 \nbillion to $23 billion a year. Chronic diseases are the leading cause \nof preventable death and disability, and are responsible for more than \n1.7 million deaths each year. They are particularly costly for \npublicly-funded insurance programs, accounting for 96 cents of every \nMedicare dollar and 83 cents of every Medicaid dollar. Project HOPE has \nestimated that by the year 2050, nearly half the population of the \nUnited States will develop at least one chronic disease if we do not \nact.\n  But analyses also show that of the money spent on health care, fewer \nthan 4 cents of every dollar are dedicated to public health and \nprevention. We need to prioritize public health and preventive \napproaches if we are to have a healthier America.\n  We already know that early detection can save lives, reduce costs, \nand result in a more efficient health care system for all of us. One \nprominent example is colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer is \nthe number two cancer killer in the United States. This year, an \nestimated 148,000 new cases will be diagnosed and more than 52,000 \nAmericans will die from the disease.\n  The risk of colorectal cancer begins to increase after the age of 40 \nand rises sharply at the ages of 50 to 55, at which point the risk \ndoubles with each succeeding decade. Despite advances in surgical \ntechniques and adjuvant therapy, there has been only a modest \nimprovement in survival for patients who present with advanced cancers.\n  The good news is that colorectal cancer can be prevented, and is \nhighly treatable when discovered early. Most cases of the disease begin \nas non-cancerous polyps which can be detected and removed during \nroutine screenings--preventing the development of colorectal cancer. \nScreening tests also save lives even when they detect polyps that have \nbecome cancerous by catching the disease in its earliest, most curable \nstages. The cure rate is up to 93 percent when colorectal cancer is \ndiscovered early.\n  We must also promote changes in lifestyles, community-based \ninterventions, to improve our health status. This means encouraging and \nenabling proper nutrition, increasing our level of physical activity, \nsupporting smoking cessation programs for those who smoke now, and \neducating youth about the dangers of smoking.\n  Trust for America's Health has just released a report entitled \n``Prevention for a Healthier America.'' Among its conclusions is that \n``an investment of $10 per person per year in community-based programs \nto increase physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking \nand other tobacco use could save the country more than $16 billion \nannually every five years . . . a return of $5.60 for every $1. Of the \n$16 billion, Medicare could save more than $5 billion, Medicaid could \nsave more than $1.9 billion, and private payers could save more than $9 \nbillion.''\n  It is clear that to make a real difference in America's health \nstatus, and to produce a far more efficient health care system, the \nanswer is to use our health care resources more wisely. That means \ninvesting in the clinically-based and community-based interventions \nthat will prevent the serious, chronic illnesses that are draining our \nhealth care resources now.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Clinton for joining \nme in introducing this resolution. Her knowledge of and expertise in \nhealth care are unparalleled, and I am very appreciative of her \nsupport. I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/31/senate-section/article/S7977-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 641--CONGRATULATING THE FOCUS ON THE FAMILY RADIO \n     PROGRAM FOR ITS INDUCTION INTO THE NATIONAL RADIO HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science \nand Transportation.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3370, introduced earlier \ntoday by Senators Biden, Lugar, Lautenberg, Warner, Leahy, and Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3370) to resolve pending claims against Libya by \n     United States nationals, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, with the passage of the Libyan \nClaims Resolution Act, the United States moves closer to a \ncomprehensive resolution of all outstanding claims by U.S. nationals \nagainst Libya for its support for terrorism over several decades. These \nclaims include, most notably, the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, \nScotland, which killed 270 innocent human beings in December 1988 and \nthe bombing of the LaBelle discotheque in Berlin in April 1986 in which \ntwo American military personnel were killed and scores more injured. \nThere are many other pending claims involving attacks against Americans \nthat are attributable to Libya. These, too, will be resolved by this \nlegislation. Although less well known in the public's memory, they were \nno less devastating to their victims and no less an affront to \nhumanity.\n  For several months now, the Bush administration has been negotiating \nwith the Government of Libya on a comprehensive settlement to \ncompensate American victims of Libyan terror. The State Department has \nreported to us in recent days that an agreement has been reached but \nhas not yet been signed. I commend the fine effort of Assistant \nSecretary of State David Welch and Deputy Legal Adviser Jonathan \nSchwartz, who led the U.S. delegation in these very difficult \nnegotiations. Signature on the agreement awaits action by Congress, and \nthat is what we are doing today.\n  The agreement will provide full compensation to pay settlements \nalready reached in the Pan Am 103 and LaBelle cases and enough funds to \nensure that every American claimant in these cases involving Libyan \nterrorism will receive financial compensation comparable to the Pan Am \n103 and LaBelle settlements. No U.S. taxpayer money will be used to pay \nthese claims. The regime in Libya is notoriously unpredictable, so \nthere is a chance that the deal could fall apart. But there is reason \nto believe that the Libyan leader, Colonel Qadhafi, has decided it is \nin his interest to settle all of these cases, rather than let them \nlanguish in court for years or decades, at the expense of progress in \nthe Libyan-American relationship. Should the government of Libya change \nits position and fail to provide the complete funding, the victims will \nretain their full rights to proceed with their legal challenges.\n  But before Libya is willing to sign the agreement, it wants legal \nassurances that upon providing the full funding it will be immune from \nfurther legal repercussions stemming from these cases. This \nlegislation, if signed into law by the President, provides such \nassurances, allowing the deal to go forward. It authorizes the \nSecretary of State to work with the Libyans to set up the funding \nmechanism. It assures the Libyans that if and only if full compensation \nhas been paid to all American victims of Libyan terrorism, they will be \nimmune from further claims of this nature. And it assures the American \nclaimants that their lawsuits will not be extinguished unless the \nfunding promised by the agreement is provided.\n  If this bill is approved by the House, Congress will have joined with \nthe President to solve an issue of national and international \nimportance, while protecting the interests of its nationals who have \nvalid claims against Libya. Under the Constitution, there is no \nquestion the executive and the legislative branches have the authority \nto work together in this manner to settle claims so as to help the \nhundreds of American claimants who will benefit from this initiative. \nThis cooperative effort--and the prompt bipartisan support for it--is \nalso a good example of how the two branches should work together to \nadvance our national interests.\n  I wish to be clear about what my support for this legislation means \nand does not mean. It is clearly in the interest of the United States \nto develop better relations with Libya. Libya is an important country \nas a gateway between Europe and Africa, which shares a border with the \nDarfur region of Sudan, and is a member of OPEC. Colonel Qadhafi \nappears to have made a break with his past support for terrorism and \nefforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. That is good news for \nLibya, for the United States, and for the world.\n  It also is a powerful demonstration that diplomatic engagement, \nbacked up with sanctions and incentives, can change the behavior of \ncountries whose policies threaten our interests. There is a lesson in \nhere for more productive approaches we could have taken earlier with \nother problematic countries. It is important for countries like Iran, \nNorth Korea, and Syria that pursue malevolent policies to see that \nthere is a roadmap back into the international community if they modify \ntheir behavior. In short, the model of normalization with Libya, if \napplied to other cases, can prove that our goal is conduct change, not \nregime change and can actually produce that change.\n  For these reasons, I support the nascent Libyan-American agreement to \ncomprehensively settle all outstanding American claims against Libyan \nterrorism. Libya's renunciation of its weapons of mass destruction \nprograms and its previous support for terrorism is something all of us \nshould welcome. I support the carefully calibrated movement toward the \nfull normalization of bilateral relations.\n  But it should be underscored that this legislation does not exonerate \nor excuse Libya for its despicable and cowardly support for terrorism. \nI hope that the agreement can provide a modicum of justice and closure \nfor the victims of Libyan terrorism and their families. But it is small \nconsolation indeed and will not bring back the lives that have been \nlost, nor undo the suffering endured by survivors.\n  Neither does today's legislation indicate a shift in my views of the \nfundamental nature of the Qadhafi regime. Yes, Americans are interested \nin Libya's external behavior. But we are also concerned about the human \nrights conditions within Libya. Though his support for terrorists has \nended, Qadhafi's Libya remains a police state that brooks no political \nopposition. Four decades after coming to power in a military coup, \nQadhafi continues to rule by personal fiat. He may have had a change of \nmind about Libya's policies, but I doubt that it has been matched by a \nchange of heart.\n  It is critical that the Bush administration pursue a broader \nengagement with the Libyan people and civil society. This relationship \nmust be about more than securing contracts for American oil companies. \nWe have learned the hard way that our vital interests can be threatened \nby relationships that ignore the huge deficiencies in governance and \nbasic freedoms in many Middle Eastern countries and are based \nexclusively on commercial and security interests. So I am disappointed \nthat this comprehensive claims settlement agreement is not accompanied \nby a comprehensive plan to engage Libyan society. I urge the Bush \nadministration to put as much energy into developing such a plan as it \ndid in the negotiations for a claims settlement.\n  For more than 4 years, I have called for the release of Fathi \nEljahmi, a courageous Libyan democracy advocate\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nwith serious health problems whose only crime was to speak truth to \npower. Though the change in direction in Libyan foreign policy in the \nlast few years is as commendable as it is remarkable, Mr. Eljahmi's \ncontinuing captivity is a reminder that basic fundamental freedoms such \nas rule of law and the freedom of speech do not exist inside Libya. As \nI have made it clear to Colonel Qadhafi, the future of the Libyan-\nAmerican relationship, at least as far as this Senator is concerned, \nwill be affected by the Libyan Government's treatment of Mr. Eljahmi. I \nurge the Libyan Government to release him unconditionally and \nimmediately, and to end the harassment of his family.\n  Engagement does not mean that we surrender our values. Engagement \nmeans we are in a stronger position to advance our values and to secure \nreal change. I urge the Bush administration to use this opportunity to \nassert America's interests in a broader relationship that will put \nLibya on a more sustainable, and more democratic, path.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \nunanimously passed legislation that, in conjunction with an \ninternational agreement being finalized between the United States and \nLibya, will at long last provide full and fair compensation to those \nUnited States nationals who have terrorism-related claims against \nLibya. I commend Senator Frank Lautenberg, who has been working hard \nfor years to try to get justice for these victims of terror, as well as \nthe other cosponsors who have enabled this important legislation to win \nSenate approval.\n  This legislation takes a critical step in securing the final payment \nof settlement amounts already reached by the victims of the Pan Am 103 \nLockerbie bombing and the LaBelle discotheque bombing, as well as fair \ncompensation for all other similar claims against Libya. It has wide \nsupport among victims' rights groups, and it will be an important step \nin restoring relations between the United States and Libya.\n  I urge the House to work quickly to pass this legislation so that we \ncan send this bill to the President's desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join with Senators Biden, Lugar, \nLautenberg, Warner, and Leahy today in submitting the Libya Claims \nResolution Act.\n  During last year's consideration of the Defense authorization bill, I \njoined with Senator Lautenberg and 31 other cosponsors in unanimously \nadding a provision which allowed victims of terrorism to seek redress \nin U.S. courts against foreign states whose officials or agents commit \nacts of terrorism, by establishing a private right of action under the \nsovereign immunity exception for state sponsors of terrorism.\n  I supported the Lautenberg amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill out of concern over Libya's backing out of a settlement agreement \nwith the victims and families of victims of the 1986 bombing of the La \nBelle Discotheque in Berlin, Germany. On April 5, 1986, Libya directed \nits agents to execute a terrorist attack in West Berlin for the sole \npurpose of killing as many American military personnel as possible. The \nLa Belle Discotheque was known to be frequented by large numbers of \nU.S. military personnel. The bombing of the discotheque occurred at a \ntime when 260 people, including U.S. military personnel, were present. \nWhen the bomb detonated, two U.S. soldiers were killed and over 90 U.S. \nsoldiers were injured.\n  Since shortly after the National Defense Authorization Act was \nenacted in January 2008, and in direct response to the Lautenberg \nprovision, the Libyans approached the State Department about securing a \ncomprehensive settlement of claims against Libya brought by American \nvictims of acts of terrorism.\n  Under the proposed international agreement the United States would \nreceive sufficient funding to pay the two large outstanding settlements \nwith Libya--the Pan Am 103 families' settlement and the La Belle \nDiscotheque settlement--as Congress has requested in previous \nlegislation. In addition, Libya would provide sufficient funds to \nensure fair compensation of the other pending claims for acts of \nterrorism.\n  In return for this comprehensive claims settlement, the United States \nwill need to assure Libya that it will not face further terrorism-\nrelated litigation in U.S. courts. This legislation, the Libya Claims \nResolution Act, will restore Libya's sovereign immunity--once the \nUnited States has received the agreed funding.\n  With the enactment of this legislation, the international agreement \ncan be concluded quickly and the money channeled to American claimants. \nAccording to the State Department, the Pan Am and La Belle claimants \nshould receive their settlements shortly after the agreement is signed, \nending years of waiting for just compensation form Libya.\n  I commend the State Department for its efforts to bring these claims \nto a resolution.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read three times and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3370) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
