Some call it line-item veto. That amendment is expected to \nbe offered today. Cloture will be filed on that amendment, as I told \nhim I would do, setting up a cloture vote for Wednesday. I advise all \nMembers that we may even do it sooner. It is up to Senator Gregg. We \ntalked about that a little last week.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today. I expect we will have a vote \nprior to the caucuses tomorrow. Also, tomorrow evening is the State of \nthe Union Address by President Bush. We will be in recess around 6 p.m. \nand will reassemble at 8:30 p.m. so that at 8:40 we can proceed to the \nHouse Chamber to receive the President's State of the Union Message.\n  I ask unanimous consent that during morning business today, Senator \nDorgan be recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to address recent changes in the \nsituation in Iraq and the possibility that resolutions of disapproval \nto the President's new strategy will be offered in the near future--a \npossibility which I believe would be very dangerous to the success of \nour military efforts.\n  I will make three points this afternoon.\n  The first is that it is important for us to give the newly announced \nstrategy of the President an opportunity to succeed. That makes sense \nnot only because everyone recognized that the President needed to \nannounce a new strategy--he has done that, and it seems to me he should \nbe accorded that courtesy--but also because, from a military \nstandpoint, it is the only thing that makes sense.\n  The key to the new strategy announced by the President is not the \naddition of new troops. We have had far more in terms of numbers of \ntroops in Iraq than the increase that will be provided by this latest \nplan. No, the primary change in the strategy is the actions of the \nIraqi Government--in particular, Prime Minister al-Maliki's commitment \nto begin doing things we wanted him to do a long time ago but which he \nwas unwilling to do--to hold people after being arrested rather than \nreleasing them on the streets, to allow curfews and checkpoints to \nwork, to allow the control of the Mahdi army, which is under the \nleadership of Sadr, the Shiite leader in Iraq, who has confronted al-\nMaliki and his government.\n  It appears this new strategy is beginning to work even after only a \nfew days of its announcement. People have asked: Can we trust al-\nMaliki? The answer is that no one knows. But actions speak louder than \nwords. Apparently, he has made good--at least initially--on his \ncommitment to confront the Mahdi army and to stop Sadr and that army \nfrom continuing the sectarian violence against Sunnis in Baghdad. \nApparently, there have been a lot of arrests made, and the United \nStates is going to be able to now conduct the type of hold operations, \nafter they have cleared an area, that would be necessary to create \nstability for an ultimate peace in Iraq.\n  So the first point is we do need to give this new strategy a chance \nto succeed. The very early returns suggest that it just might be having \nthat effect.\n  In addition, it is important for us to be able to regain control of \nthe Anbar Province. Almost a third of the western part of Iraq is under \nattack by al-Qaida and other terrorists who mean to create their own \nlittle fiefdom--called a caliphate--in that part of the country. \nClearly, we cannot allow al-Qaida to have a terrorist base in Iraq. The \nadditional battalion of marines who are committed to clearing this area \nis critical to the stability in Iraq and the defeat of the terrorists \nthere.\n  The second reason we should give this strategy a chance is that the \nnonbinding resolution which has already been offered and will \napparently be brought before the Senate within a week or so is wrong \nfor two reasons: First of all, it presents no credible alternative, and \nsecondly, it is dangerous. It presents no credible alternative, just \nmere criticism. Albeit in a nonbinding way, it is still criticism \nwithout any kind of an alternative.\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\n  The resolution itself doesn't contain an alternative except the \nfollowing: ``The primary objective of the United States''--I am really \nlistening at this point--``strategy in Iraq''--I am looking for a verb \nhere but instead here are the four words--``should be to have the Iraqi \npolitical leaders make the political compromises necessary to end \nviolence in Iraq.''\n  ``Should be to have'' them. Well, if I had a magic wand, maybe I \ncould make this happen. But the reality is that it is not the lack of \npolitical compromise, it is the lack of peace that is enabling them to \nmake the political compromise. As long as the Mahdi army is controlling \nSadr City and Sadr is confronting al-Maliki and fomenting violence--\nShiite and Sunni and vice versa--the political compromises are going to \nbe impossible to make. That is why the President and al-Maliki \nunderstood you have to first create peaceful conditions, change the \nconditions on the ground. If the Mahdi army is going to have death \nsquads foment this kind of violence, you will never have those \npolitical compromises. If al-Maliki can control Sadr and eliminate the \nthreat, political compromise is possible. So there is no alternative to \nthe President's strategy in the nonbinding resolution that was filed.\n  Secondly, it would be dangerous. To pass a nonbinding resolution in \nthe United States is for effect. What is the effect? Well, the effect \ntheoretically is to try to get the President to change policy. This \nstrategy isn't going to change in the near term. Troops are on the way. \nAl-Maliki made his commitment and is apparently making good on the \ncommitment, so the new strategy is working out right now. So a \nnonbinding resolution passed in a week or two is not going to change \nthis. Instead, its effect is a pernicious one. What kind of a message \ndoes it send, first of all, to our troops that Congress doesn't support \nwhat the President and they are trying to accomplish here; that the \nCongress thinks we should be going in some other direction, albeit \nthere is no alternative being presented, just in a resolution of \ncriticism? What kind of a message does it send to the allies that the \nPresident's policy is going to be undercut to the point that it will \nnot be carried out, and therefore they better begin to hedge their \nbets? And most important, what message does it send to our enemies? Can \nthey simply decide that in a matter of time, support for the \nPresident's policies will have diminished to the point that they won't \nhave to concern themselves with this new strategy anymore if they can \nwait it out, and they will have an opportunity for success? So it is \nnot going to work, No. 1, and secondly, it is dangerous.\n  That brings me to the third and final point. It seems to me that \nthose people in favor of sending a message without presenting an \nalternative have an obligation to consider what will occur if the \nPresident's policy doesn't succeed. Almost everybody recognizes that \nthe Iraqi Army is not able to defend this country and create a peaceful \nstability in the country at this point.\n  So the question is: What would happen if we leave Iraq a failed \nstate? Most agree, and the intelligence community has recently \ntestified, that it would be disastrous, not only for the people in Iraq \nbut for our allies in the region and for our long-term national \nsecurity interests, both because of the ability of al-Qaida and other \nterrorists to consolidate their gains in the area and use that as a \nplace from which to operate, and secondly, because all of the momentum \nwe have gained in getting support, more or less, from countries such as \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, Jordan--all of the \ncountries in the region--that have helped in the war against the \nterrorists will switch the other way as they realize America will not \nstay in the fight, that they have to begin hedging their bets with the \nother powers in the region which include the sectarian killers and the \nterrorists.\n  What is the consequence of a failed Iraq? It seems to me that for \nthose who present no alternative other than Iraq needs to get its act \ntogether and provide for its own security, a policy which I don't know \nof anyone who agrees would succeed at this point in time, if that is \nnot going to succeed, then what is the consequence of a failed Iraq and \nwhat is the consequence of the President's strategy failing?\n  It all gets back to what I said in the beginning, and that is, it \nseems to me all Americans should want this strategy to succeed. Why \nwould anyone want the strategy to fail? Just to prove a political \npoint? That doesn't make sense when we have young men and women in \nharm's way and a lot riding on it not just for Iraqis but also for our \nnational security. We should all want this strategy to work. We should \ndo everything in our power to help make it work, and that begins by \ngiving the plan a chance and not criticizing it before the strategy \neven has a few days to work out. That is why the possibility of a \nresolution, which is highly critical of the President's strategy and \nsuggests a different course of action, a timeline for leaving, is the \nwrong strategy.\n  What is that alternative in terms of timeline? It simply reads as \nfollows:\n\n       The United States should transfer under an appropriately \n     expedited time line responsibility for internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence in Iraq to the Government of Iraq \n     and Government security forces.\n\n  That is the alternative, in an appropriately expedited timeline. That \nis no alternative at all. That doesn't direct anybody to provide for \nsecurity in Iraq on any faster basis than we are already attempting. I \nhave heard no one criticize our training of the Iraqi forces or finding \nor suggesting there is some other way to train them in a better way, in \na faster way. It takes time. We are doing the best we can.\n  The general who was in charge of creating that program, General \nPetraeus, will be our general in charge again. I think, by all \naccounts, he did a terrific job of setting up the program. We know it \ntakes a certain amount of time to train these Iraqi forces. We know the \ncountry is not in a position to defend itself at this point. Why would \nwe want to set ourselves on a course to leave when we know they cannot \ndefend themselves?\n  The truth is, for the time being, we are going to have to remain \nthere to help secure the peace in Iraq, and that means we ought to give \nthe President's policy a chance to succeed, and all of us hope it will \nsucceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S785-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S785-S786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from Arizona is \nspeaking about a very important issue and one that we certainly will \nhave a discussion about and a debate about in this Congress in the \ncoming days, and that is as it should be. We are a democracy with \ndivided branches of Government, separation of powers. We have a \nPresident, a legislative branch, a judicial branch, and there is a role \nhere for the legislative branch.\n  My colleague suggested this was a circumstance where some were simply \nwilling to criticize the President but offer no plan of their own. Then \nhe subsequently said the resolution that some of my colleagues will \noffer in the Senate will advocate a different course of action. That is \na plan, I guess, isn't it? If one advocates a different course of \naction than the President is advocating, it seems to me that is a plan.\n  I don't disagree with much of what those who have a different view \nwould say about these issues. Most of us want peace in Iraq. We want \nthe Iraqis to control their own destiny. We want the Iraqi troops to be \nsufficiently trained so they can provide their own security. We all \nshare that goal. We all want our country to succeed in the missions.\n  Let me make one very important point. My colleague alluded to it in a \nway different than I would respond to it. During the debate on the \nfloor of the Senate I don't think there will be a single Senator who \nstands up and in any way says he wants us to withdraw support for \nAmerican troops. Speaking for myself--and I think for most other \nSenators, perhaps every other Senator--I think Members who serve in \nthis Congress believe it is critically important to support our troops. \nWhen we send men and women in our uniform to go to war, we are \nobligated, it seems to me, to do everything to support them in their \nmission.\n  So this debate is not about whether we will support those troops whom \nwe have asked to go to war in behalf of our country; we certainly will \ndo that. The debate will be about the President's\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\nplan for a surge in troops or a deepening involvement in Iraq. It is a \nworthy debate for us to have because I think this is obviously a \nconflict that has gone on a long while, longer now than the Second \nWorld War. We have had a lot of discussion with the military leaders in \nthe field about training Iraqi troops to provide for their own \nsecurity.\n  Let's review what has happened in Iraq.\n  Saddam Hussein ran Iraq. We now know he was a butcher. We knew it \nthen; we know it now. There are hundreds of thousands of skeletons in \nmass graves, of the victims murdered by Saddam Hussein. But Saddam \nHussein doesn't exist anymore. He was executed. He has been buried.\n  There is a new constitution in Iraq, voted for by the Iraqi people. \nThere is a new government in Iraq selected by the Iraqi people. This \ncountry belongs to Iraq, not to us. It is their country, not ours. The \nsecurity for their country is their responsibility, not ours. The \nquestion for all of us is: When will the Iraqi people decide they are \nable to provide for their own security?\n  My colleague says it is a matter of being patient with training the \nIraqi troops. Perhaps today there is going to be a young man or woman \nwho is going to enlist in the Marines and the Army and they will go to \ntraining. It won't be very many months before they are fully trained \nand maybe committed to the battlefield--6 months, 7 months, 8 months. \nThe question is: How long does it take to train an Iraqi army and Iraqi \nsecurity forces to provide security for their own country? Years? Can \nthey be trained, as American troops are trained, in months rather than \nyears? The answer, at least in the last several years, seems to have \nbeen no.\n  It is very important for us to debate this question of our deepening \ninvolvement in Iraq. We all know what is going on there. It is \nsectarian violence, Shia on Sunni, Sunni on Shia. Seventy-five more \npeople were killed today in Shia neighborhoods, multiple bombings, we \nare told by the news today, 160 wounded. The day before, dozens of \nIraqis were killed, and 25 American troops were killed in numerous \nattacks. Our hearts break for all of them, particularly the American \ntroops, but also for everyone who is losing their life in this \nconflict.\n  Suicide car bombers, simultaneous car bombings, beheaded bodies \nfloating in the Tigris River, bodies with holes drilled in the heads \nand knees with electric drills, tortured, tortured bodies swinging from \nlampposts in Iraq, we read. It is a cycle of grim violence, unlike any \nmost of us have ever seen. It is unbelievable.\n  Let me tell you what General Abizaid, who is in charge of CENTCOM, \nsaid about 6 weeks ago. He came to the Congress--and this relates to \nwhat my colleague had said and the debate we will have. General Abizaid \nsaid this:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     Corps commander, General Dempsey . . . and I said, in your \n     professional opinion, if we were to bring in more American \n     troops now, does it add considerably to the ability to \n     achieve success in Iraq? And they said no.\n\n  This isn't an approximation of what the top general said; it is \nexactly what he told the Congress: I met with all of my top generals, \nand I asked them the question, if we were to bring in more troops now, \ndoes it add to our ability to achieve success? They said no. That's \nwhat General Abizaid said.\n  Let me describe to you what General Abizaid said following that \ncomment. Again, this is 2 months ago in testimony before the Senate:\n\n       The reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  Less than 2 months ago, the top general said his top commanders in \nIraq all said no to bringing in more troops. Why? Because it will say \nto the Iraqis: We will do the job. We will do what we would expect you \nto do.\n  As we talk about deepening the American involvement in Iraq and the \nissue of how many troops we are going to have in that battlefield, let \nme turn to another issue. If we have 20,000-plus troops to send to \nIraq, what about Afghanistan?\n  Our military is, as all of us know, fairly overstretched. We are \ncalling up guardsmen and reservists and some of them second \ndeployments, some of them third deployments all across this country. \nBut in Afghanistan, which was the home of al-Qaida, where the Taliban \nruled and where we went first to route the Taliban and create a \ndemocracy in Afghanistan, the Taliban, by all accounts, are now taking \nhold once again and creating an even greater threat.\n  They are fighting hard to destabilize the Government of Afghanistan. \nThat was our first battle, to go into Afghanistan and kick the Taliban \nout. We need more troops in Afghanistan now, not less, and yet my \nunderstanding is the President's plan would divert troops we have in \nAfghanistan to go to Iraq.\n  Let me read something that Mr. John Negroponte, the Director of \nNational Intelligence said last week. He testified before the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, and here is what he said:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the homeland.\n\n  Al-Qaida is what poses the greatest threat to our interests, \nincluding our homeland. Then he went on to say this. This is again John \nNegroponte, Director of National Intelligence.\n\n       Al Qaeda continues to plot attacks against our homeland and \n     other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' \n     secure hideout in Pakistan.\n\n  Let me reemphasize:\n\n       And they continue to maintain active connections and \n     relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' secure \n     hideout in Pakistan to affiliates throughout the Middle East, \n     northern Africa, and Europe.\n\n  What does that mean? Osama bin Laden, do we know him? Yes. He is the \nperson who ordered--claimed and boasted--he ordered the attacks against \nthis country, killing thousands of innocent Americans. He still lives, \napparently, in a secure hideout, according to the top intelligence \nchief in this country, in Pakistan. It seems to me the elimination of \nthe leadership of al-Qaida, the organization that attacked this \ncountry, that murdered thousands of innocent Americans, ought to be the \nprimary interest of this country. That is why moving away from \nAfghanistan and the related activities that ought to exist in Pakistan \nto deal with what are called ``secure hideouts,'' the secure hideout \nfrom which al-Qaida operates, that ought to be job No. 1 for this \ncountry.\n  I don't understand. My colleague Senator Conrad and I offered an \namendment to the Defense appropriations bill last year on this subject. \nDoes anybody hear anybody talking about Osama bin Laden anymore? Or \nperhaps better described ``Osama been forgotten'' these days? Nobody \nwants to talk about it.\n\n  Finally, last week the Director of our intelligence in this country \nsaid al-Qaida is the most significant threat to this country. The most \nsignificant terrorist threat to this country is al-Qaida, and it \noperates from a secure hideout in Pakistan. If that is true, what are \nwe doing, deciding to find 20,000 troops by pulling some of them out of \nAfghanistan and moving them to Iraq? If those troops are available, \nthey ought to be dedicated to dealing with al-Qaida and bringing to \njustice those who committed the attacks against this country. I will \nhave more to say about that at some point, but I did want to make note \nof what the Director of Intelligence said last week that seems to be \nalmost ignored in this debate about Iraq.\n  I am going to be talking as well this week about the minimum wage. We \nwill have an aggressive discussion about that. That is going to be the \npending issue of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S786-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S786-S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HEALTH CARE FOR THE FIRST AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want for a moment this afternoon to talk \nabout another issue that is of great importance to me and I think to a \nnumber of our colleagues here in the Senate as well. I am going to \nchair the Indian Affairs Committee in this session of Congress. I will \nbe working with my colleague Senator Craig Thomas from the State of \nWyoming. I am pleased to do that.\n  I want to mention that this week my colleagues here in the Senate are \nlikely to see members of Indian tribes who are coming to town from all \nover the country. They will likely see them here\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\non Capitol Hill, perhaps in the halls of the Senate and the House. They \nare here to attend the ``State of Indian Nations'' address by the \nPresident of the National Congress of American Indians. They will come \nfrom across the country to hear this ``State of the Indian Nations'' \naddress and they will probably also drop in some offices and meet with \nsome Senators and Congressmen.\n  Let me talk about one of the things I am sure they will talk about in \nvirtually every office, and that is the issue of Indian health care. I \nhave seen hearings where, talking about Indian health care, very \npowerful tribal leaders have been brought to tears when they talk about \nfamily members who have taken their own lives because of depression or \ndrug abuse, or family members who needed medical attention desperately \nand did not get it.\n  Let me talk a minute about the first Americans, those who were here \nfirst. American Indians and Alaska Natives die at a higher rate than \nother Americans from tuberculosis. There is a 600-percent higher \nincidence of tuberculosis than the American population as a whole; \nalcoholism, 510 percent higher than the population at a whole; \ndiabetes, 189 percent higher than the American population as a whole. \nLet me say, in many areas it is quadruple, 8 times or 10 times higher \nthan the population as a whole, in terms of the incidence of diabetes. \nIndian youth and teenage suicide on reservations in the northern Great \nPlains is 10 times higher than the national average. There are fewer \nthan 90 doctors for every 100,000 Indians compared to 230 doctors for \nevery 100,000 people nationwide. It is almost unbelievable to see what \nthe Indian community faces with respect to the health care issues.\n  The Indian Health Service expenditure for each American Indian in \n2005 was $2,130, compared to $3,900 that we spend for health care for \nFederal prisoners. We have a responsibility for the health care of \nFederal prisoners because we incarcerate them. If they get sick, it is \nour responsibility to provide for their health care. We have a trust \nresponsibility for American Indians, and if they get sick--or in order \nto keep them well--it is our responsibility. Yet we spend almost twice \nas much money for health care for Federal prisoners as we do to meet \nour trust responsibility for American Indians.\n  I hope my colleagues will have a chance to talk to some of the Indian \nleaders who come to the Capitol this particular week and visit about \nthese issues.\n  I want to show a picture of Ardel Hale Baker, to talk a little about \nwhat some people face. It is easy to talk about the statistics. Let me \ntalk about the humanity of this issue. This is Ardel Hale Baker. She is \na member of the Three Affiliated Tribes in my State. Ms. Baker had \nsudden and severe chest pains. Her blood pressure was off the charts \nand she felt she was having a heart attack. So she went to the Indian \nHealth Service clinic of the Three Affiliated Tribes in New Town, ND, \nand she was diagnosed as having a heart attack. At the insistence of \nthe Indian Health Service staff on that reservation, she was sent by \nambulance to the nearest hospital, 80 miles away in Minot, ND. When she \ngot to the hospital, Ardel was being lifted off of a gurney from the \nambulance to be taken into the hospital, and the nurse noticed a piece \nof paper taped to her leg. Curious about this woman, with chest pains, \nlikely having a heart attack--curious about what kind of piece of paper \nwas taped to this woman's leg, the nurse looked and it was a letter. It \nwas a letter from the Indian Health Service, warning that both Ms. \nBaker and the hospital should understand the Indian Health Service had \nno funds with which to pay for the health care she needed, because this \nwas not considered a ``life or limb'' medical condition. Ms. Ardel Hale \nBaker later, after she survived, received a bill for $10,000.\n  Let me recreate that again. This is a Native American, living on a \nreservation. She was having severe chest pains, clearly a heart attack, \nput in an ambulance and driven 80 miles, and when they pulled her out \nof the gurney to run her in to the hospital, they noticed a letter \ntaped to her leg in which the Indian Health Service says: ``Understand, \nwe don't have the money. Both Ms. Baker and the hospital should \nunderstand they may have to assume the cost because we don't have the \nmoney to pay for this. It is not life or limb.'' So this woman gets a \nbill for $10,000.\n  Her life was saved, but it was saved notwithstanding a letter taped \nto her leg saying: ``Admit this woman at your own cost.''\n  This is called rationing. It is called health care rationing. If \nhealth care rationing existed in this country, there would be an \noutrage, and it does exist and nobody says much. There is a quiet yawn; \nsomewhere between daydreaming and thumbsucking. People sit around and \nhardly even think of the fact that when they are sick, it is OK because \nthey can get health care. But when this woman is sick, she might get a \nletter taped to her leg saying: ``Yes, she is having a heart attack, \nbut understand if you admit her, it is at your own expense.''\n  An Indian tribal chief told us once that on his reservation everyone \nunderstood the admonition: ``Don't get sick after June.'' Do not get \nsick after June, because June is the time of the fiscal year when they \nrun out of money for contract health care on the reservations. The \nIndian Health Service runs out of money after June. If you get sick \nafter June, I am sorry, they might tape a letter to your leg. It is \n``life or limb.'' If your illness is not threatening your life or your \nlimb, you are out of luck. That is rationing. That is health care \nrationing, and it is an outrage in this country. It is happening in a \nquiet way, inflicting misery all across this country on the first \nAmericans, those who expect we would meet our trust responsibility to \nprovide health care for Native Americans.\n\n  We are going to try very hard to see if we can rectify that. I \nunderstand the Indian Health Service is staffed with some committed and \nwonderful doctors, nurses, and administrators. They are understaffed in \na dramatic way, underfunded and understaffed. They tell us their budget \nallows them to treat about 60 percent of the health care needs of the \nIndian community. That means 40 percent is not dealt with.\n  One of the things I would have us consider is a new model for \ndelivery of health care, particularly on Indian reservations, that \ntracks what is happening in some other parts of the country where there \nare the kinds of low-cost, walk-in clinics open at all hours, where you \ncan get the routine health care, routine diagnosis. I hope the Indian \nHealth Service could do that at no charge. But what is happening now is \nnot working at all. Often health care is not available.\n  On one reservation of which I am aware, the clinic there is open 5 \ndays a week. After 4:30 or 5 o'clock on Friday: So long, tough luck. \nYou are 80 miles from the nearest major city hospital, and if you get \nsick, that is where you are going to have to look for some health care. \nWe need to do better than that. I hope we can succeed in talking to the \nIndian Health Service about a new model, a new approach.\n  This is only one issue of many. We have a full-scale crisis, I \nbelieve, in Indian health care, Indian education, and Indian housing.\n  I have spoken previously about a woman who died lying in bed in her \nhouse, who froze to death in this country. A woman named Swift Hawk \nfroze to death when she lay down and went to bed, living in a climate \nwith 35 degrees below zero weather with, instead of windows in their \ndwelling, plain plastic sheeting. This grandmother went to bed and \ndidn't wake up because she froze to death. If you saw that in the \npaper, you would think it was a Third World country, but no, it is not. \nIt is this country and it relates to a health care crisis we need to \naddress. It is not about statistics. It is about the humanity of \nunderstanding what is happening and a responsibility to do something \nabout it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, Republicans and Democrats, who I think are of a like mind, \nthat we have a responsibility here and we need to meet it, and we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, November 14, 2006, members of \nthe San Francisco School Board voted 4 to 2 to eliminate over the \ncourse of 2 years the San Francisco School District's Junior Reserve \nOfficers' Training Corps. We call this JROTC. This was an arrogant, \nmean-spirited, absolutely foolish decision. The decision was a \ndisservice to children of every socioeconomic and racial background, \nand it reveals a gangrenous, antimilitary bigotry that festers in some \ncircles of the United States today. The vote deprives hundreds of \nchildren of a safe, extremely popular, and cost-effective program that \nprovides structure and enjoyment to the lives of children through an \nemphasis on physical activity, responsibility, self-discipline, and \nteamwork.\n  The merits of the JROTC program alone compel a reversal of this \ndecision, but it is more than that. It is only the latest antimilitary \ndecision in the Bay City. The antimilitary counterrecruitment movement \nis undertaken by activists and groups who have moved beyond simple \ndisagreement with foreign policies to the outright opposition to the \nmilitary as an institution. They explicitly deprecate basic civic \nservice and exhibit an utter lack of respect for the sacrifices of men \nand women which they have made in the defense of our country.\n  Allow me to offer a statement of one such activist before moving on, \nto get the sense of the nature of the movement behind the JROTC \ndecision. This is:\n\n       When soldiers are really hurt because there are no new \n     recruits, then we are getting somewhere.\n\n  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, when the school board \nannounced its vote to eliminate the 90-year-old program in which 1,600 \nchildren participated, the dozens of children and their families \ngathered at the board meeting were absolutely stunned. Many cadets \nburst into tears, their faces in their hands, in silent bewilderment. \n``It provides me a place to go,'' said a fourth-year cadet, Eric Chu, \nas he began to cry. At the same time, the board's decision was loudly \ncheered by JROTC opponents and counterrecruitment activists. Former \nteacher Nance Manchias summarized the reason behind their jubilation by \ndeclaring, ``We need to teach a curriculum of peace.''\n  Arguments marshalled in support of this kind of antimilitary activity \nare not generally arguments of outright opposition to the military. \nCounterrecruitment activists you usually hear cloak their opposition to \nthe military in discussions about discrimination, about the military's \n``don't ask, don't tell'' policy regarding homosexuals. But in this \ncase these arguments do not apply--not to the JROTC. You don't believe \nme? The editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle, which is not \nreally a bastion of conservatism, explains. They say:\n\n       The high-flown arguments fall apart when the drill-and-\n     discipline JROTC basics are examined.\n\n  The San Francisco Chronicle's board, writing in support of the JROTC \nprogram, continues by explaining the nature and specifics of the \nprogram:\n\n       Sorry, adults, but kids love this program as if it's \n     family. There are 1,600 students enrolled in the classes, \n     which fulfill physical-ed requirements. Punctuality, team \n     work, camaraderie are the hallmarks. There, military drill \n     competitions are as popular as football games. There are no \n     weapons, just sticks and flags used in marching. Some ROTC \n     members go on to serve in the military, but the vast majority \n     don't, seeing classes as an enjoyable experience and a chance \n     to learn new things: map-reading, leadership skills and self-\n     discipline that goes with military-style assignments and \n     crisp uniforms.\n\n  I am quoting from the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial board.\n  What were the reasons, then, for the elimination of this program? \nWere there safety concerns, a lack of interest in the program, \nbudgetary issues, problems with poor management, or a troubling lack of \ndiversity? In fact, none of these factors were at issue in the \ndecision.\n  The program was popular. More than 1,600 kids were active \nparticipants in the JROTC program. Finances were not a problem. The \nprogram enjoyed a modest $1 million budget from a school district \nbudget of $365 million. That is $1 million out of $365 million, or a \ncost of just under three one-thousandths of the entire budget. Was the \nprogram poorly managed? The San Francisco Chronicle answers:\n\n       No one has offered an alternative as coherent and well-run \n     as the JROTC.\n\n  How about safety? Not a problem. There are no weapons involved. The \nprograms are nonviolent; they are simply character-building exercises \nwhich emphasize leadership and self-discipline.\n  And what about the big one, diversity? For this, I repeat the words \nof the Chronicle reporter, Jill Tucker, in a story she wrote about the \nJROTC cadets at Galileo High School:\n\n       These students are 4-foot-10 to 6-foot-4, athletic and \n     disabled, college-bound and barely graduating, gay and \n     straight, white, black, and brown. Some leave for large homes \n     with ocean views. Others board buses for Bayview-Hunter's \n     Point.\n\n  Many of the students were immigrants, and one is autistic.\n  According to the San Francisco Chronicle:\n\n       Opponents acknowledge the program is popular and helps some \n     students stay in school and out of trouble.\n\n  So, again, why eliminate a school program in which students simply \nreceive phys-ed and elective credits required for graduation? Sandra \nSchwartz of the American Friends Service Committee, an organization \ndedicated to active opposition to the JROTC program, explains:\n\n       We don't want the military ruining our civilian \n     institutions. In a healthy democracy, you contain the \n     military. You must contain the military.\n\n  So we have an answer to the question as to why this program was \neliminated. It wasn't because of any practical consideration such as \ncost, interest, or safety, nor was it opposition to a specific policy \nof the Government. It was opposition to the military as an institution.\n  But the JROTC decision in San Francisco should come as no surprise. \nIt comes on the heels of two other antimilitary decisions in the Bay \nCity which have taken place over the past year or so. Last year, San \nFrancisco city supervisors refused to allow a ship to dock in the \ncity's port. The ship was a historic World War II battleship, the USS \nIowa. Just as in the JROTC decision, there were no practical \nconsiderations which necessitated refusal of the USS Iowa. Supervisor \nChris Daly explained the reason for his vote:\n\n       I am not proud of the history of the United States of \n     America since the 1940s.\n\n  The decision was intended to be an insult to our Armed Forces.\n  Also, last year, San Francisco passed measure 1, dubbed ``College, \nNot Combat,'' which was a symbolic measure to ban all military \nrecruiters in the city's public schools. ``College, Not Combat'' was \nthe first local success of the counterrecruitment movement. Examples of \nother counterrecruitment slogans include ``Don't die for recruiter's \nlies,'' and my personal favorite, ``An army of none.''\n  This decision enjoyed the support of many extreme antiwar groups, \nincluding ANSWER, Not In Our Name, Ralph Nader's Green Party, American \nFriends Service Committee, Code Pink, Cindy Sheehan, and the \nInternational Socialist Organization.\n  These decisions to denigrate the Armed Forces are the latest tactics \nof the antiwar counterrecruitment movement. But, again, make no mistake \nabout the basis or the purpose of this movement. Ignore all the \nrhetoric about discrimination in the Armed Forces and ``don't ask, \ndon't tell.'' Forget about arguments that this is simply opposition to \nthe Iraq war, to George Bush, or to some other specific policy.\n  The counterrecruitment movement opposes the military as an \ninstitution. Counterrecruitment activists and measure 1 supporter April \nOwens admit the purpose of her movement, and she is speaking in behalf \nof measure 1:\n\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\n\n       When soldiers are really hurting because there are no new \n     recruits, then we are getting somewhere.\n\n  Speaker Pelosi is on record as saying that she was not behind measure \n1 100 percent. I think the American people would be interested to know \nwhat percentage of her support the measure is enjoying. But at least \nsome political leaders in San Francisco are speaking out about these \ntopics and decisions and this type of attitude toward the American \nsoldiers.\n  Regarding the school board decision--and this took a lot of courage \nfor him to do it, I might add--San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom said:\n\n       This move sends the wrong message. It's important for the \n     city not to be identified with disrespecting the sacrifices \n     of men and women in uniform.\n\n  Yes, it is--especially now. Do we really need to remind people that \nmen and women are fighting and dying because they heeded the call of \ntheir country? Do we need to remind people that families are grieving?\n\n  One wonders whether these activists understand that the only reason \nthey have the freedoms to dedicate their time and energy to opposing \nthe U.S. Armed Forces is because of the very existence of the U.S. \nArmed Forces. One wonders whether they have ever realized that the \nArmed Forces have dedicated far more of their time and efforts to \nestablishing and ensuring the continuation of peace rather than \nlaunching wars. And when wars are fought, they are done so at the \nbehest of democratically elected civilian leaders.\n  If they have a problem with any specific policy, they should take it \nup with the civilians who made the policy, not the soldiers doing their \nduty and carrying out that policy in the service of their country.\n  They certainly should not take their frustrations out on \nschoolchildren who enjoy a structured, character-building, afterschool \nprogram such as the JROTC program. But they believe the program exists \nto trick youngsters into joining the military. School board member Dan \nKelly says the JROTC is ``basically a branding program, or a recruiting \nprogram for the military.'' Well, Mr. Kelly, if that is the case, that \nthe JROTC is a recruiting vehicle, then the JROTC should enjoy the same \nprotections military recruiters receive. This is what I am getting to \nnow.\n  San Francisco's measure 1, which tells all military recruiters to \nstay away from schools, was only symbolic for a reason. San Francisco \nbanned military recruiters in their schools for over a decade, until \nthe No Child Left Behind Act was passed into law in 2001. Under \nprovisions of No Child Left Behind, schools can only prevent military \nrecruitment if they are willing to forgo their Federal funding. \nUnfortunately, the JROTC is not currently included in the recruiting \nprogram under the act. However, as board member Dan Kelly admits, the \nJROTC program was banned simply because it was perceived as a \nrecruiting program.\n  Let's make that perception a reality. Let's amend the appropriate \nlaws and give the JROTC the same protection that military recruiters \nenjoy. The program, as I have illustrated, is clearly a valued program \nin many communities. It deserves our support. The JROTC program in San \nFrancisco, as well as those in communities all across the nation, \ndeserve our support. Sadly, they need our protection, too.\n  At this time I would like to announce that I will soon be introducing \nlegislation to afford the same protection to the JROTC programs as the \nother military recruiters enjoy. I look forward to bipartisan support \nof that program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S789-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S789-S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.N. GLOBAL TAXES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, last session of the Congress, I introduced \na bill, along with 30 other Senators, to prevent the imposition of \nglobal taxes on the United States. The bill would withhold 20 percent \nof our contributions to the United Nations' budget should the \norganization continue in advancing its global tax goals.\n  There are a lot of things they do. I know this body is divided in \nsupport of the United Nations. I, frankly, don't see a lot of good that \nthey do. In fact, many of the things I find offensive all get started \nin the United Nations. But the fact is, there is an effort to get out \nfrom under any type of supervision from any of the member states of the \nUnited Nations.\n  The current efforts of the United Nations--and we are talking about \norganizations which are trying to replace the dues system so that we \ncan no longer threaten to withhold 20 percent of our dues and come up \nwith some type of a global tax independent funding system so they don't \nhave to answer to anyone. The current efforts of the United Nations and \nother international organizations to develop, advocate, endorse, \npromote, and publicize proposals to raise revenue by instituting \ninternational taxes are unacceptable.\n  Last year, United Nations Ambassador John Bolton summarized the U.S. \nposition in stating that although the U.S. fully supports increased \ndevelopment assistance, ``the U.S. does not accept global aid targets \nor global taxes.''\n  My bill is the latest development in a decade-long struggle against \nthe desire of the United Nations to implement a global tax regime.\n  First, to articulate openly the U.N.'s movement toward global taxes \nwas none other than Boutros-Boutros Ghali, and that was in 1996 in a \nspeech he made at Oxford University in which he hopefully embraced the \nconsent of global taxes and authoritarian world government. The then-\nSecretary General expressed the U.N.'s desire not to ``be under the \ndaily financial will of member states.'' Now, what he is talking about \nis the United States.\n  This statement warranted and resulted in congressional action, and I \ncosponsored Senator Dole's bill at that time--this is 1996--to prevent \nU.N. global taxes, which passed both Houses of Congress and became law.\n  Our efforts were met with continued resistance and arrogance on the \npart of the United Nations. In that same year, the concept of global \ntaxes was fully debated. That was after we passed our legislation.\n  A little later, the U.N. Development Programme Research Project \nresulted in a push for the Tobin Tax, which is a tax on international \nmonetary transactions to go directly to the United Nations. This tax \nwould net trillions of dollars annually.\n  The 2001 Zedillo report concluded that ``there is a genuine need to \nestablish, by international consensus, stable and contractual new \nsources of multilateral finance''--world taxes.\n  Over the next few years, the U.N. pushed for a tax on international \narms sales and military expenditures, taxes on international airline \ntickets, taxes on international trade through an ocean freight tax, a \nglobal environmental levy, and all other types of global taxes.\n  The list goes on and on, but here are just the most recent examples \nof this movement: A 2004 United Nations University study on global \ntaxation; the U.N.'s 2005 book called ``New Sources of Development \nFinance'' edited by A.B. Atkinson; a September 2005, United Nations \n``Millennium Development Goals'' meeting addresses international \nairline ticket tax; Peter Wahl of the German organization, WEED, says \ninternational currency transactions taxes are ``ready,''; and \nInternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which is an \naffiliation of the AFL-CIO, supports international taxes. The Clinton, \nFord, and Gates Foundations participated in U.N. conferences pushing \nglobal taxes. George Soros's Open Society Institute and Oxfam America \nmet at the ``New Rules for Global Finance Coalition.''\n\n  The U.N. is fascinated with these global tax schemes. It would be an \nunprecedented accumulation of power for the United Nations. We cannot \nconcede any ground on this issue. Conceding on even one of these \ninitiatives will only embolden the United Nations to go for more.\n  The same rules that apply to bureaucracies in the United States--\ngradual accumulation of more and more power and resources and coercive \nability--apply to the United Nations in an even more dramatic manner. \nThe IRS is a model of confidence, moderation, and responsibility when \ncompared to the United Nations.\n  Unfortunately, the United Nations enjoys support from another \ninternational bureaucracy which has endorsed global tax efforts. It is \nthe Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \nIn addition to its support of U.N. global tax schemes, the OECD, which \nreceives 25 percent of its budget from the United\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\nStates, has used U.S. taxpayer money in turn to encourage and support \nhigher taxes on U.S. taxpayers.\n  Now, keep in mind, this is something we are supporting, to encourage \nincreasing U.S. taxes. For these reasons, I had the following language \nincluded in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill:\n\n       None of the funds made available in this act may be used to \n     fund activities or projects undertaken by the Organization \n     for Economic Cooperation and Development that are designed to \n     hinder the flow of capital and jobs from high-tax \n     jurisdictions to low-tax jurisdictions, or to infringe on the \n     sovereign right of jurisdictions to determine their own \n     domestic policies.\n\n  Of course, we know what has happened to the appropriations bills \ncurrently. It is very simple and straightforward. If you want to \nadvocate for higher taxes and global taxes on U.S. taxpayers, U.S. \ntaxpayers would not be forced to foot the bill.\n  Let's quickly look at some of the reasons for this language and the \ncase against the OECD. The OECD has endorsed and encouraged higher \ntaxes, new taxes, and global taxes no fewer than 24 times in reports \nwith titles such as ``Toward Global Tax Cooperation'' in which the OECD \nidentifies 35 nations guilty of harmful tax competition. I am quoting \nthere: ``Guilty of harmful tax competition.''\n  In other words, they want us to have taxes as high as any of the \nother countries have.\n  They have advocated that the U.S. adopt a costly and bureaucratic \nvalue added tax, a 40-cent increase in the gas tax, a carbon tax, a \nfertilizer tax, ending the deductibility of state and local taxes from \nfederal taxes, new taxes at the state level, and a host of other new \nand innovative taxes on U.S. citizens.\n  It's not only the recommending of higher taxes which concerns us; the \nultimate concern is the movement towards undermining U.S. sovereignty. \nEcogroups such as the Friends of the Earth want the OECD to declare \nthat dam building for flood control and electronic power is \nunacceptable as sustainable energy. In May 2005, the OECD ministers \nendorsed a proposal at the UN to create a system of global taxes.\n  The OECD has stated explicitly that low-tax policies unfairly erode \nthe tax bases of other countries and distort the location of capital \nand services.\n  What we have here are Paris-based bureaucrats seeking to protect high \ntax welfare states from the free market.\n  That's why the OECD goes on to say that free-market tax competition \nmay hamper the application of progressive tax rates and the achievement \nof redistributive goals. Clearly, free market tax competition makes it \nharder to implement socialistic welfare states. The free market \nevidently hasn't been fair to socialistic welfare states. Well, it is a \ngood thing that they have the OECD and nearly $100 million in U.S. \ntaxpayer money to protect them.\n  Noted economist Walter Williams clearly sees the direction in which \nthis is headed when he says that the bottom line agenda for the OECD is \nto establish a tax cartel where nations get together and collude on \ntaxes.\n  Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill seconded that when he said that he \nwas troubled by the underlying premise that low tax rates are somehow \nsuspect and by the notion that any country . . . should interfere in \nany other country's tax policy.\n  And John Bolton argued that the OECD represents a kind of worldwide \ncentralization of governments and interest groups. Who do you think \nbears the costs for all this? Mr. Bolton answers and you probably \nguessed it--the United States.\n  America's proud history of independence was driven in no small part \nby the desire for sovereignty over taxation powers. In this context, it \nmakes no sense to relegate our sovereignty over tax policy, in any way, \nto international bureaucrats.\n  It's very simple. U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund a bunch of \ninternational bureaucrats who write, speak, organize, and advocate in \nsupport of higher taxes, global taxes, and the gradual erosion of \nAmerican sovereignty over its domestic fiscal policies.\n  If individual Americans want to give their money to an organization \nwhich is dedicated to raising taxes, they can. It is called the \nDemocratic Party. But most Americans would be outraged to learn that \nthey are forced to subsidize these types of activities with their tax \ndollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Montanan \nwho died Saturday night at his home in Libby, MT. Libby is a small town \nup in the northwest corner of my State.\n  Les Skramstad was not only an outspoken advocate for his town, which \nwas horribly wronged at the hands of W.R. Grace, but he was also my \nfriend.\n  I first met Les in Libby in the year 2000, shortly after news reports \nattributed hundreds of deaths to asbestos exposure from decades of \nvermiculite mining there.\n  We sat down in Gayla Benefield's living room. There were about 25 \npeople who were very ill. Over huckleberry pie and coffee, the group \nexplained to me the horrific legacy Grace had left behind. And although \nI had read the reports and briefing papers on the situation, that was \nthe first time I had seen asbestos exposure up close. And, it was gut \nwrenching. I will never forget it--as long as I live.\n  They opened their hearts and poured out unimaginable stories of \nsuffering and tragedy. I was absolutely stunned. It was at that moment \nthat I vowed to myself that I'll do whatever it takes to help Libby \nbecome whole again.\n  Entire families--fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sons and daughters \nare all sick. Hundreds are dead.\n  They are bound together by one thing: their exposure to tremolite \nasbestos, mined by W.R. Grace.\n  That night at Gayla's, when I first met Les, he watched me closely \nall evening. He was wary and came up to me after his friends and \nneighbors had finished speaking.\n  Les said to me, ``Senator, a lot of people have come to Libby and \ntold us they would help, then they leave and we never hear from them \nagain.''\n  ``Max,'' he said, ``please, as a man like me--as someone's father \ntoo, as someone's husband, as someone's son, help me. Help us. Help us \nmake this town safe for Libby's sons and daughters not even born yet.''\n  Les worked at the vermiculite mine starting in 1959. He told me about \nthe dust he swept every day--off of three separate floors at the mine. \nAnd although company officials said the dust was harmless, that's what \nultimately took his life. And that dust is what has made his wife and \nchildren sick, too.\n  You see, that dust was laden with tremolite asbestos fibers. When he \ngot home, he would hug his wife. His kids would jump up in his lap.\n  I think he was less worried about his own fate. It was as if Les had \naccepted that he was going to die. But the thing that got to him most \nwas that he brought that dust home with him. He wanted justice for his \nfamily and friends. That night I told him I would do all that I could. \nThat I wouldn't back down. That I wouldn't give up.\n\n  Les accepted my offer and then pointed his finger and said to me, \n``I'll be watching Senator.''\n  I knew Les would. I also knew he didn't have to because I had already \nvowed to myself I would do all I could, even without Les' \nencouragement.\n  Over the years Les and I worked together to help Libby. We became \nfriends in the process. I counted on seeing him every time I went to \nLibby. I have been up to Libby almost 20 times since then. I talked to \nLes on the phone. I visited him in the hospital.\n  Les is my inspiration in the fight to get Libby a clean bill of \nhealth and justice for its residents. He is the face of hundreds and \nthousands of sick and exposed folks in this tiny Montana community.\n  Les--working with others in the community--became an outspoken \nadvocate for Libby. He put a personal face on asbestos contamination. \nHe provided a straightforward look into the lives of people hurt by \nGrace and the poisonous asbestos fibers they left behind. Les was a \ntrue Western gentleman. And he was very effective.\n  It has been 8 years since this tragedy first came to light. We have \nmade a lot of progress in Libby.\n  We launched the Center for Asbestos Related Diseases, which has \nscreened and provided health care to thousands of Libby residents.\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\n  We kicked the EPA into gear and got Libby listed as a national \nSuperfund site.\n  We secured millions for cleanup, health care, and economic \ndevelopment in Libby.\n  But sadly, there is still much more to do. Much more. Libby residents \ndeserve compensation for their injuries. They deserve health care. They \ndeserve to see those responsible go to prison for what they did. They \ndeserve to know that their town is clean of asbestos.\n  What I knew about Les makes this news very sad to me, personally. I \nam sad for his family. I am sad for his friends. I am sad for Libby.\n  I am also angry at W.R. Grace, which knowingly poisoned its workers. \nI am angry that justice still has not been done in Libby. I am angry \nthat we haven't been able to do more.\n  But we won't give up. We will keep fighting for Les and Libby. Les' \npassing only furthers my resolve to try harder. To do more. We won't \nlet up. We will not stop.\n  When I get tired, I think of Les. And I can't shake what he asked me \nto do.\n  In all of my years as an elected official, helping Libby is among the \nmost personally compelling things I have ever been called on to do.\n  I will keep the promise I made to Les that night at Gayla's house.\n  Les was a fighter to the end. He recently minced no words about his \nfeelings towards Grace.\n  He told the Missoulian newspaper, quote: ``There's not a doubt in my \nmind that [they] are guilty of murder.''\n  ``I started in 1959 and I was as healthy as a horse,'' he said. ``I \nknew all the guys that worked there, 135 employees when I was there. \nAnd there's five of us left alive. Five. The rest of them are gone.''\n  Now, sadly, so is Les.\n  The Book of Proverbs says: ``righteousness delivers from death.'' And \nif that is true, then Les will certainly be delivered.\n  My prayers are with Les' wife Norita, his family and friends, and the \npeople of Libby.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say briefly, we are now at the point \nwhere we said we would be last week. Again, I have said on a number of \noccasions that I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from New \nHampshire. This is an issue which he believes in very strongly. I just \nfinished a conversation with Senator Byrd in his office a short time \nago, and he does not believe in it. This is what legislation is all \nabout, and we look forward to voting on this amendment. We will vote on \nit Wednesday, or we will, as I said, meet with the distinguished \nRepublican leader later today and we will decide if we need to vote on \nit more quickly or we need to take all that time--whatever the rules \ncall for, unless we are able to work with Senator Gregg and Senator \nMcConnell to move that more quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Let me indicate my admiration for Senator Gregg \nin persisting in offering this very important amendment.\n  I thank the majority leader for working with us to get consideration \nof this extremely important measure, and we look forward to beginning \nthe debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the leaders have completed their \nstatements, I would ask for recognition.\n  Mr. President, first, let me begin by thanking the majority leader \nand the Republican leader for their efforts here in allowing me to \nbring forward this amendment at this time. As we know, 2 weeks ago I \noffered this amendment. At the time, I offered it because I felt it was \nappropriate to the lobbying reform vehicle, as the lobbying reform \nvehicle had been greatly involved in the issue of what is known \nas earmarks. Earmarks are where certain Senators put specific language \ninto a bill which allows spending to occur for a specific item.\n\n  I am not inherently opposed to earmarks. Many are very genuinely of \ngood purpose. And I have used it in cases to benefit programs which I \nthought were appropriate. In fact, I think the legislative branch has a \nright to direct spending. If you do not direct spending as a \nlegislative branch, then the executive branch has the authority to \ndirect spending, and the practical effect of that is the legislative \nbranch is giving up one of its key powers, which is the power over \nspending.\n  However, there have, over the years, been abuses of the earmark \nprocess. We all know that. We have seen it. And there have actually \nbeen abuses which have been unethical. We have seen that\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\nin recent times. So the key, I believe, to earmark reform is \ntransparency and allowing the Congress and the people we represent to \nsee what is being earmarked, and allow the Congress to actually have to \nvote on it.\n  The idea of the enhanced rescission proposal, which I have here--and \nI call it a second-look-at-waste proposal--is to allow the President to \nsend back to the Congress items which he or she feels were \ninappropriately put in some other bill and which did not receive an up-\nor-down vote.\n  Now, how could that happen, people might ask? It happens very simply. \nA lot of vehicles we pass here, a lot of laws we pass here, a lot of \nspending proposals we pass here involve literally tens of billions, \nsometimes hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. What will happen \nis these bills, which have these huge conglomerates of spending \nactivity in them--which are known as omnibus bills--sometimes we find \nembedded in them little items, smaller items of spending which were put \nin there for the purposes of accomplishing specific activity by Members \nof the Congress, sometimes at the specific request of people who have \nbeen asking for those programs.\n  The President, of course, does not have the choice of going in and \nsaying: Well, that is a bad program or that is an inappropriate \nprogram. He or she must sign the entire bill, the whole bill--a $10 \nbillion bill, $100 billion bill, $300 billion bill. That bill must be \nsigned in its entirety. Pieces of it cannot be separated out.\n  So what this second-look-at-waste amendment does is allow the \nPresident, on four different occasions, to send back to the Congress a \ngroup of what would be earmarks in most instances for the Congress to \nvote on again, and essentially say to the Congress: Well, those items \nwhich were buried in this great big bill--those specific little items--\nshould be reviewed and Congress should have to vote them up or down.\n  Congress then, by a majority vote, must vote on whether it approves \nthose specific spending items. That is called enhanced rescission. It \nis not a line-item veto. A line-item veto is where the President can go \nin and line-item out a specific item and then send it back to the \nCongress, and the Congress by a two-thirds vote must vote to override \nthe President's proposal to eliminate the spending. In this instance, \nthe Congress retains the right to spend this money if a majority of the \nCongress decides to spend the money in either House--in either House.\n  So as a practical matter, it is a much weaker--dramatically weaker--\nproposal than what is known as the line-item veto, which passed here in \nthe early 1990s and was ruled unconstitutional. In fact, this amendment \nhas been drafted so it will be constitutional. And, in fact, it has \nbeen drafted in a way that basically tracks rather precisely and very \nclosely the language that was offered by Senator Daschle and Senator \nByrd back in 1995 and was then called enhanced rescission.\n  We made one major change in the initiative which we proposed last \nweek to make it even closer to the language of Senator Daschle and \nSenator Byrd in that we have included in this proposal, which has been \nfiled here today, enhanced rescission which includes the right to \nstrike. What does that mean? That means the Senate will have the right \nto look at the package of rescissions sent up by the President, which \nmight be two, it might be three, it might be 10, and the Senate does \nnot have to vote up or down the entire package; the Senate can actually \ngo in and vote up or down specific items within that. So it even gives \nthe Senate, and the House for that matter, significantly more authority \nover this process.\n  The proposal we are putting forward is what we call second look at \nwaste, what was called, back in 1995 when it was offered by Senator \nDaschle and Senator Byrd, fast-track rescission. It is not a line-item \nveto.\n  I want to reinforce this point because what is shown on this chart \nreferences the Daschle language of 1995 and the amendment which we have \noffered today. You can see that the two agree on almost all the key \nelements.\n  The Daschle language established a fast-track process for \nconsideration of Presidential rescissions. We do the same thing. The \nDaschle language required congressional affirmation of the rescissions. \nWe do the same thing. The Daschle language allowed the President to \nsuspend funds for a maximum of 45 days. We do the same thing.\n  On the left side of the chart are Senator Daschle's proposals, \nsupported by Senator Byrd and 20 other Members on that side of the \naisle. It did not permit the President to resubmit a submitted \nrescission request. We do the same thing.\n  It allowed for the rescission of discretionary funding and targeted \ntax benefits. We do the same thing--only allowed motions to strike, no \namendments. So you can move to strike, the same thing as the Daschle \namendment. It required rescinded savings to go to the deficit so it \ncould not be respent. That also we do.\n  Now, the two big changes we have from Senator Daschle's proposal: We \nallow rescissions of new mandatory programs, not existing mandatory \nprograms. You cannot go in and rescind a farm program that already \nexists or a VA program that exists. No. A new mandatory program. And we \ndo not allow the rescissions to occur as often, or the President to \nsend up as many rescissions as he could have under Senator Daschle's \nand Senator Byrd's amendment. We only allow the President to send up \nfour rescission requests. Under Senator Daschle's and Senator Byrd's \namendment, you could arguably send up 13 rescission requests. So we \nhave significantly limited the ability of the President to sort of game \nthe system and also tie up the Congress.\n  It is important to understand this change we have made actually \nsignificantly increases congressional authority over the rescission \nprocess, as does this one. This other change gives the President \nadditional activity on congressional mandatory spending. Why did we put \nthat in there? Well, because today 60 percent of Federal spending is \nmandatory spending. The simple fact is that if you do not address \nmandatory spending in new mandatory programs, then you are taking out \nthe ability to address the budget in a significant way.\n  Now, I noticed Senator Conrad, in one of his very well-stated \nstatements in regard to this enhanced rescission, second-look-at-waste \nprogram, said: Well, this puts a gaping hole in any agreement that \nwould be reached between the Senate and the President on how to handle \neven entitlements. I do not believe that. I do not believe that. I \nthink if the Senate and the President reach an agreement on how to \nhandle entitlements, part of that agreement is going to be that the \nenhanced rescission program that is proposed here is not going to \napply. That is logical, reasonable, and the way it is going to work.\n\n  Obviously, the Congress is not going to give up that much authority \nif we are going to reach that type of agreement, and I do hope we reach \nsuch agreement. That would be good for us as a Nation.\n  Again, I emphasize we have put in this new amendment, as it has been \nsent up, the motion to strike. This was an issue of considerable \ndisagreement on the floor. A lot of Members believed that by not giving \nus a motion to strike, we were giving too much power to the executive \non the issue of enhanced rescission. Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd, \nin their amendment in 1995, had that language. The administration is \nnot happy with that language. I can argue it both ways. But I think in \norder to have consistency between both and because it is a significant \nright to retain with the legislative branch, we have put it back in.\n  I also think it is important to note that any savings go to deficit \nreduction. Deficit reduction should be our goal. If the President sends \nup something he thinks is wasteful and we agree, let's rescind it and \nsend it to reduce the deficit rather than rescinding it and sending it \non to be spent. That makes a lot of sense.\n  To show you how different this is than the line-item veto, back in \n1995, when we had the line-item veto--and remember, when we passed it, \n11 members of the other party who are presently serving in the Senate \nvoted for the line-item veto: Senators Baucus, Biden, Dorgan, Feingold, \nFeinstein, Harkin, Kennedy, Kerry, Kohl, Lieberman, and Wyden; I voted \nfor the line-item veto--that was ruled unconstitutional. That was \ndramatically\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\nmore power given to the executive. This basically gives no power to the \nexecutive other than to ask the Congress to take another look and vote \nagain. So one would presume that the folks who voted for the line-item \nveto back in 1995, unless they have changed their view, would be \nsupportive of a much more weaker fast-track rescission approach in \n2007.\n  In addition, the Daschle amendment, which was supported by Senator \nByrd and others, had 20 Democratic cosponsors--and it was essentially \nthe same amendment we are offering today--Senators Akaka, Baucus, \nBiden, Bingaman, Boxer, Byrd, Conrad, Dodd, Dorgan, Feingold, Harkin, \nInouye, Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Mikulski, Murray, Reid, and \nRockefeller. All supported the Daschle rescission language, which is \nessentially the language we have offered today, especially now that we \nput in language relative to a motion to strike.\n  To read a couple quotes that I believe are informative and accurate, \nback in 1995, Senator Feinstein said about the proposal:\n\n       Really, what a line-item veto is all about is deterrence, \n     and that deterrence is aimed at pork barrel [spending]. I \n     sincerely believe that a line-item veto will work.\n\n  Senator Feingold said:\n\n       The line-item veto is about getting rid of those items \n     after the President has them on his desk. I think this will \n     prove to be a useful tool in eliminating some of the things \n     that have happened in the Congress that have been held up \n     really to public ridicule.\n\n  That is the line-item veto they were talking about, a much stronger \nlanguage than this enhanced rescission language.\n  Senator Byrd on the Daschle language said:\n\n       The Daschle substitute does not result in any shift of \n     power from the legislative branch to the executive. It is \n     clear cut. It gives the President the opportunity to get a \n     vote . . . So I am 100 percent behind the substitute by Mr. \n     Daschle.\n\n  Senator Dodd said:\n\n       I support the substitute offered by Senator Daschle. I \n     believe it is a reasonable line-item veto alternative. It \n     requires both houses of Congress to vote on the President's \n     rescission list and sets up a fast-track procedure to ensure \n     that a vote occurs in a prompt and timely manner.\n\n  That is an accurate statement as to what it does.\n  Then, Senator Levin, in March 1996--all these quotes are from 1995-\n96--\n\n       I, for instance, very much favor the version which the \n     Senator from West Virginia has offered, which will be voted \n     upon later this afternoon. That so-called expedited \n     rescission process, it seems to me, is constitutional and is \n     something which we can in good conscience, at least I can in \n     good conscience, support.\n\n  Senator Levin is one of our true constitutional scholars in this \ninstitution.\n  And Senator Biden, in 1996, said:\n\n       Mr. President, I have long supported an experiment with a \n     line-item veto power for the President.\n\n  So he supported the line-item veto. Again, I note that this is \nnowhere near the line-item veto language.\n  In fact, this language has been vetted, vetted aggressively, not only \nby Senator Daschle when he offered it back in 1995 but since then with \na variety of individuals who are constitutional scholars, to make sure \nit settles the issue and does not, in any way, take from the Congress \nthe power of the purse, which is the issue that, of course, was raised \nagainst the line-item veto in Clinton v. The City of New York, which \nstruck down the line-item veto on the grounds that it did go too far in \nviolating the presentment clause. This language does not do that \nbecause it retains to the Senate and to the House absolute authority \nover spending. It simply asks them, through the Executive, to take a \nsecond look at an item that might otherwise--and, in fact, for all \npractical purposes--never get a clear vote. It was something that was \nburied in some larger bill. Because we have retained the right to \nstrike, we have even gone further by saying that the entire package \nwhich the President sends up, assuming he sent up more than one item to \nrescind, would be subject to a right to strike.\n  So the Congress has the ability to pick and choose in its second-look \nprocess as to what it thinks makes sense and what it doesn't think \nmakes sense. There is probably going to be a lot of stuff sent up that \nthe Congress agrees with, because some things happen in these major \nbills where items get in that people don't notice, and certainly a \nmajority of the Congress feels, if they took another look at it, they \nwould not be inclined to support.\n  Equally important is the restriction on the President, which is \ndifferent from the Daschle-Byrd amendment, which is that we only allow \nhim to do this four times. That is important. I am willing to go back \nfrom four and maybe take it back further. Senator Lott came to the \nfloor and said he didn't like the idea of four. If we get this thing \nmoving along, I am willing to take a look at less rescission packages. \nBut the President, under the original Daschle amendment in 1995, had 13 \nshots at the apple because he could do it on each appropriations bill. \nAt that time, we had 13 appropriations bills; now we have 12. But \ntoday, under this amendment, he will only have four chances to package \nideas, initiatives he thinks were inappropriately buried in some bill, \nsend them back up and say: Take another look at this. I have to get 51 \nvotes to support taking out this item.\n\n  What is the purpose of all this? That is the technical purpose in \ndescribing it, but what is the real purpose of all this? The real \npurpose is to get to the issue of managing the Federal purse. Congress \nhas the right to the Federal purse. That is the most important power \nCongress has. I have listened to the explanation of the Senator from \nWest Virginia on this for many years, and he says it more eloquently \nthan anyone else. Everyone has to agree with his position. The power of \nthe purse is the power of the legislative branch. But this is about \nmanaging that power. This is about when a bill comes roaring through \nthat has $300 or $400, $500 billion of initiative in it, called an \nomnibus bill usually, and you have to pass it because the Government \ncloses if you don't. This is about saying: All right, there is going to \nbe a process where we can take another look at some specific items in \nthat bill without giving up to the Executive power which the Executive \nshould not have, which is the capacity to line item something and force \nus into a supermajority.\n  That is what this is about. That is why I presume Senator Daschle \noffered it back in 1995, and that is why I offer it today. In the end, \nit is going to give us better discipline over our own fiscal house. It \nis going to make us better stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. We will \nbe able to say to the taxpayer: Yes, that bill may have been a $500 \nbillion bill. Maybe there were some things in there that we shouldn't \nhave done. We are going take a second look at it to make sure those \nthings were not wasteful. We are going to pass the bill because we need \nto pass the bill to keep the Government going, but we will have a \nchance to take a second look. It is just good management, without \ngiving up the authority of the legislative branch, in my humble \nopinion.\n  I hope that Members who take a look at this will consider it \ncarefully. I know it has been caught up in the dialog of politics. I \nregret that. I regret that last week it got caught up and was \nrepresented by some as being an attempt to poison the lobbying bill.\n  That was never my intention. I didn't even think of that, quite \nhonestly, when I offered this amendment. I didn't know it was going to \nbe so controversial. I thought I would just get a vote. That was not my \nintention, and I don't think it was anybody's intention on our side. It \ngot caught up in the broader fight of what we do sometimes around here. \nWe let process overwhelm substance. It got characterized by the talking \nhead community out there as both a legislative attempt to kill the \nlobbying bill and a legislative attempt to show the power of the \nminority. It wasn't any of that. It was simply an attempt by me to \nbring forward what I thought was good legislation which would be \nconstructive to our process of fiscal discipline, which happens to be \none of my high priorities.\n  Now it is on the minimum wage bill. I greatly appreciate the Senator \nfrom Nevada and especially the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from Wyoming, who have to manage this bill, being courteous \nenough to allow their bill to already have an amendment on it that \nmaybe isn't immediately related to their bill. This, however, was not \nmy choice. I would have preferred to have it on the lobbying bill, \nwhich it was immediately\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nrelated to. That was an earmark bill. That had a lot to do with \nearmarks. This has a lot to do with earmarks. But nobody can argue that \nthis is the wrong vehicle because I didn't choose this vehicle. This \nvehicle was chosen for me. That is why we are doing it here.\n  When we get to the motion on cloture, I hope people will vote for it \non its merits and will not vote for it on some procedural argument, \nsuch as this is the wrong vehicle. Because I think people are sort of \nestopped, to use one of our legal phrases--I remember that phrase from \nlaw school--from claiming that this is the wrong vehicle. Because as a \npractical matter, I was told to put it on this vehicle. I didn't choose \nit. I was told. I am trying to be helpful. So that is why it is here.\n  That is the presentation in brief. There will be more discussion as \nwe move down the road. I look forward to hearing from everyone. I hope \npeople will take a hard look at the actual substance of the amendment. \nSubstantively, it is not a line-item veto. It is essentially the \n``daughter of Daschle,'' for lack of a better term. I would hope that \nwe would consider it on its merits as such. It will give us a chance to \ngovern better and to handle the purse, which we are charged with by our \nconstituents, more frugally and efficiently.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, may I ask the Chair, there is no time limitation on \nspeeches at this point, is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit in effect.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the very able and distinguished Senator from \nKansas wants to speak for 5 minutes or more. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may yield to the distinguished Senator for 5 minutes or 6 or 7 \nminutes or whatever he wants at this time, without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I believe I can get my remarks done in 5 \nor 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator doesn't have to be in a great hurry. I know the \nSenator is reasonable and he will take such time as he may desire and \nit is not going to be too much. I yield to the Senator for that purpose \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                       Western Kansas Snowstorms\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am going to address a decision that has \njust been announced by FEMA regarding emergency assistance to the \ncitizens of my State of Kansas.\n  I rise today to thank all those who have aided thousands and \nthousands of Kansans stranded by snow and ice over the course of the \npast few weeks. I want to give them some much needed good news.\n  First, let us remember the situation. Late last month, a large winter \nstorm spread over 30 inches of very heavy snow and up to 3 inches of \nice on top of that over much of my State. Fifteen-foot drifts were very \ncommon in western Kansas. At the time, 65,000 Kansans were without \npower. Snow blocked all major roadways, and many impacted Kansans, many \npeople in small communities, were able to survive only because their \nfriends and neighbors pitched in to help each other.\n  I came to the Chamber in the aftermath of the storm with charts \nshowing the damage--11,000 utility poles down, transmission lines \ndown--and some very pertinent charts in regard to stranded livestock. I \nwas worried about the state of assistance in our country out on the \nHigh Plains. Many financial and economic livelihoods were in danger. In \nKansas, farmers remained unable to reach their herds of cattle and keep \nthem fed and watered.\n  Quite frankly, I was a little worried about the Federal response. I \nknow when we have disasters, FEMA responds as best they possibly can. \nWe have heard a lot about Katrina and forest fires and floods and other \nsituations, but here we had a record disaster in regard to a blizzard \nand ice in communities that were isolated. I was a little concerned \nabout it. In the midst of this record destruction, let me say that the \nNational Guard, the Department of Transportation, local emergency \nresponders, nonprofit organizations, and regional FEMA representatives \nreally stepped to the plate. Frankly, the swift and selfless response \nof so many has been almost overwhelming.\n  Almost immediately, in the wake of this storm, our Governor, Kathleen \nSebelius, declared a state of emergency, and we all got to work. The \nNational Guard, at the direction of GEN Tod Bunting, sprung to action, \nand they delivered bales of hay and generators to those with stranded \ncattle and also aided in emergency services with helicopters and any \nother equipment that would work under the circumstances.\n  The Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and the Association of General \nContractors from the private sector also proved vital in providing \nKansans simply a place to stay warm. I must particularly thank the \nState's emergency management officials, working with the regional FEMA \noffice, for the countless hours they worked to expedite the requests \nfor public assistance.\n  FEMA workers get a lot of brickbat when things get very tough and \ncomplicated and difficult. This time, they certainly deserve a great \ndeal of credit. Over the course of the past few weeks, local \ngovernments and certain nonprofits serving Kansans needed their Federal \nGovernment desperately, and the cry for help was answered. But the best \nnews came a few moments ago when I received a call from the FEMA office \nhere in Washington. I received notice that all remaining categories of \npublic assistance have been approved for the State of Kansas. This is \nthe news we have been waiting for. This gives the State reimbursement \nfor a large portion of the $360 million in damage that has been \ndocumented to date. It includes such vital assistance for public \nbuildings and utility and road repair.\n\n  Mr. President, we believe in self-help in Kansas, and most of the \ntime we can handle our own problems. But in working through this \ndisaster, we desperately needed Federal help. Federal help came, and \nFederal help came in record time, and it came because of the \ncooperation of local and State and national organizations--primarily \nFEMA--and it was a situation where everybody worked together and got \nthe job done.\n  On this particular occasion, let me say thank you to all of those \npeople who worked so hard and all of the people in Kansas whom I am so \nproud to represent. I look forward to the receipt of this assistance \nand the continued support that our communities in Kansas have seen from \nall levels of government.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield my time back to the Senator from West \nVirginia. I thank him for allowing me to make this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from West Virginia, the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, be recognized for 15 minutes, \nand then after Senator Conrad, I be recognized, and after I am \nrecognized, the Senator from Wyoming be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I very much admire the able Senator from New \nHampshire. I like him. As Shakespeare said, ``He's a man after my own \nkidney.'' That about says it all, I guess. That is the way I feel about \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. He and I served together in the last \nCongress as chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate \nAppropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee. I also have the pleasure \nof serving with him on the Senate Budget Committee, where he has been \nchairman--and I mean chairman--and is now the ranking member.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is one of the finest, one of the \nbrightest, one of the most illustrious Senators serving today. I want \nSenators to know--and, of course, the Congressional Record will \nreflect--that as much as I oppose the line-item veto--and that is \nsaying a mouthful--I very\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\nmuch respect the Senator from New Hampshire who has attached his name \nto it.\n  In his remarks last week on his line-item veto amendment, the very \nable Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, noted that this is not a \nnew issue before the Senate. He correctly noted that the Senate passed \na line-item veto measure in 1996, which was later nullified by the U.S. \nSupreme Court--the highest court of the land--in 1998.\n  It is appropriate, very appropriate, that Senators know something \nabout the history of this issue, particularly those Senators who were \nnot here when the Senate last considered this piece of garbage called \nthe line-item veto. I can say plenty about this line-item veto. I call \nit garbage. I can call it worst things than that, but I won't right \nnow.\n  Senators will recall, I believe, that the House of Representatives in \nthe early 1990s passed a series of legislative line-item vetoes, or \nexpedited rescissions, like the one now before this body. Because of \nconstitutional concerns and a lack of support, none of those bills ever \npassed the Senate.\n  Senators will recall that in the summer of 1993, I delivered 14 \nspeeches--I mean, they were cracker jacks, and, man, that is not the \nend of the line, either--later published as ``The Senate of the Roman \nRepublic.'' They were addresses on the history of Roman \nconstitutionalism on this very topic. Senators will recall that when \nthe 104th Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996, I was one of \nthe most outspoken opponents.\n  I argued against giving any President--any President, any President, \neven a Democratic President; that makes no difference, even a \nDemocratic President--a line-item veto or a or so-called enhanced \nrescission authority.\n  Senators will recall that after President Clinton signed into law the \nLine-Item Veto Act of 1996 I, Robert C. Byrd, a Senator from the State \nof West Virginia, joined with Senator Carl Levin and the late, God \nbless his name, Daniel Patrick Moynihan--oh, were he here today--in \nbringing suit--get that--in bringing suit in Federal court against the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, then Franklin Raines, \narguing that the act unconstitutionally authorized the President to \ncancel certain spending and revenue measures without observing the \nprocedures outlined in the presentment clause of article I, section 7.\n  That suit, Raines v. Byrd, was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court \nfor lack of standing, but the arguments, I say, but the arguments were \nlater validated in 1998, when the Court nullified the Line-Item Veto \nAct in Clinton v. City of New York.\n  Now, I am no stranger to this issue. I am no stranger to this issue. \nI have served with the eight Democratic and Republican Presidents since \nHarry Truman who have asked for line-item veto authority. And I have \nwatched, as the Senate has said ``no,'' n-o, no--the hardest word in \nthe English language to say--I watched as the Senate has said ``no'' to \nall but one. And where the Senate erred in yielding to a President's \nrequest for such power, I was there when the Supreme Court nullified \nthe Senate's actions. I was there.\n  The first question ever asked was asked of Adam. The first question \never asked--I hope the Chair is listening closely, my friend in the \nchair--in all of the centuries of the human race, the first question \never asked was: Adam, where art thou? I won't go into the time and \nplace where that was asked. Everybody ought to know it. Adam, where art \nthou?\n  Well, where was Robert C. Byrd when the Supreme Court nullified the \nSenate's actions? I was there when the Supreme Court nullified the \nSenate's actions.\n  I do not speak lightly about this subject--hear me now, if you want \nto take me on, on this question--and to refer Shakespeare:\n\n       And damned be him that first cries, ``Hold, enough!''\n\n  I do not say it is a proposal that stands in stark defiance of the \nConstitution without many decades of congressional experience and a \ndeep, deep reverence for the Constitution of the United States, and \nwhen I speak about line-item veto today, and in the coming days, if \nnecessary, I speak to all Senators of both parties about the oaths we \nswear and particularly the one we take upon entry into this office.\n  We take an oath before God and man to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n  I speak today on a subject that broaches the most serious of \nconstitutional questions. Now pending before the Senate is a \nlegislative line-item veto proposal offered as an amendment by Senator \nGregg and others to the minimum wage bill. The amendment would alter by \nstatute the constitutional role of the President of the United States \nin the legislative process. The President does have a role in the \nlegislative process. The amendment would alter by statute the \nconstitutional role of the President in the legislative process. It \nwould allow the President to sign a spending bill into law and then to \nstrip from that bill any spending items he dislikes. Let me say that \nagain.\n  I have already said that the amendment would alter by statute the \nconstitutional role of the President in the legislative process. It \nwould allow the President, one man, to sign a spending bill into law \nand then--get this--strip from that bill any spending items he \ndislikes.\n  Through a process known as expedited rescission, the President could \nforce an additional vote by the Congress on spending items that do not \nmimic his budget request and impound the funding that he, the President \nof the United States, does not like until the Congress votes again.\n  Such a proposal is a lethal, aggrandizement of the Chief Executive's \nrole in the legislative process. Lethal, deadly. Such a proposal is a \nlethal aggrandizement of the Chief Executive's role in the legislative \nprocess. It is a gross, colossal distortion of the congressional power \nof the purse. It is a dangerous, dangerous proposition, a wolf in \nsheep's clothing of fiscal responsibility. Wolf, wolf, wolf, that's \nwhat it is.\n  The Constitution, I say to Senators--hear me out there, my friends in \nWest Virginia and throughout the land--the Constitution is explicit and \nprecise about the role of the President in the legislative process. The \nPresident has a role in the legislative process. Read the Constitution, \narticle I, section 7. Here is what it says:\n\n       Every Bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, \n     with his Objections. . . .\n\n  The President must act within 10 days, Sundays excepted. And once he, \nthe President, has decided to forgo a veto, it is his constitutional \nresponsibility under article II to ``take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.''\n  President George Washington interpreted his responsibility this way, \nand I quote the immortal first President of this land, the Father of \nour Country, the Commander in Chief at Valley Forge, George Washington. \nPresident George Washington interpreted his responsibility this way: \n``I''--meaning George Washington, the President of the United States--\n``must approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in toto''--totally. \nNo other way. Take it or leave it.\n\n       I must approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in \n     toto.\n\n  The Father of our Country was right. It isn't Robert Byrd talking. \nThat was George Washington. Now come to Robert Byrd. I continue:\n  A legislative line-item veto effectively creates a third option for \nthe President of the United States--a third option, talking about the \nline-item veto. It adds a new dimension to executive power, one that is \nnot found in the Constitution. Instead of vetoing and returning a whole \nbill to the Congress before it becomes law, under the Gregg amendment, \nunder the amendment by my distinguished friend Senator Gregg, the \nPresident can resubmit only those provisions he opposes, and he can do \nso after a bill becomes law. Did you get that? Instead of vetoing and \nreturning a whole bill to the Congress before it becomes law, under the \nGregg amendment--and I speak with great respect--the President can \nsubmit only those provisions he opposes and do so after a bill becomes \nlaw.\n  What are we doing here? The President can sign a bill into law and \nthen strip it of the provisions that he\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\ndoesn't like. Let me say that again. Are you hearing me? What am I \ndoing? What am I saying here? I can't believe it. The President can \nsign a bill into law and then, after he has signed the bill into law, \nhe can strip it of the provisions he does not like.\n  Have you ever heard of anything so radical? Instead of the President \nweighing in before a bill becomes law, he can ignore the pros and cons \nof debate and wait until well after it has become law. Am I in my \nsenses when I read this? Can you believe it? He can literally ignore \nboth public opinion and congressional debate and deliberation. He can \npull out anything he does not like from legislation passed by both \nHouses of Congress--get that, now. This is one man downtown. He may be \na Republican, he may be a Democrat, he may be a Socialist or whatever--\nwhatever the people elect down there at the White House in the future. \nHe can pull out anything he doesn't like from legislation that has been \npassed by both Houses of Congress and insist on a second run through \nthe legislative process.\n  The Gregg amendment allows the President to decide what is in a bill \nconsidered by the Senate or not in a bill after it has become law. It \nwould allow the President to decide when the Senate considers a \nspending or revenue item and under what political conditions the Senate \nconsiders these measures. Such a proposal is a dangerous departure from \nthe separation of powers doctrine, which aims to prevent any one branch \nof the Government from seizing both the power to make and to execute a \nlaw. The separation of powers dividing inherently legislative and \nexecutive functions between two separate and equal branches is a \nfundamental defense against overzealous and unwise acts by either the \nPresident of the United States or the Congress of the United States.\n\n  In Federalist No. 51 James Madison writes--this is not Robert C. Byrd \nwho wrote it. In Federalist No. 51, James Madison writes:\n\n       But the great security against a gradual concentration of \n     the several powers in the same department consists in giving \n     to those who administer each department the necessary \n     constitutional means and personal motives to resist \n     encroachments of the others . . . Ambition must be made to \n     counteract ambition. . . .\n\n  So by empowering the President to craft legislation, the Congress \nwould be ceding the constitutional means of the people to resist \nexecutive encroachments.\n  Let me say that again. By empowering the President of the United \nStates to craft legislation, the Congress would be ceding the \nconstitutional means of the people to resist executive encroachments. \nFor up to 1 year after every bill is passed and signed into law--get \nthis--the President could use this power to manipulate Senators--how \nabout that--or advance his political agenda. Any President. I am not \njust referring to Mr. Bush. I am starting with him, but I am talking \nabout any President, Republican or Democrat. The President could use \nthis power that Mr. Gregg's amendment would give to the President--\nremember, this isn't the last President, Mr. Bush. There will be \nothers. The President could use this power to manipulate Senators or \nadvance his political agenda. Under the Gregg amendment, a President \ncould punish or reward recalcitrant Members of Congress by targeting or \nsparing their interests under the expedited rescission process.\n  Every debate between the Congress and the White House could be \nswayed, influenced, by this new power of the President of the United \nStates to influence Senators: You, Mr. Conrad; you, Mr. Byrd; you, Mr. \nand Mrs. or Miss Senator--he can use this power over Senators to \ninfluence them. What kind of power are we talking about? It would \nsubject every Member and the interests of their constituents and States \nto the political capricious and unchecked whims of a Chief Executive.\n  You better think about this. You better think about it. The Gregg \namendment provides the President, any President--Democratic, Republican \nor otherwise--with a mechanism to rewrite legislation after it has \npassed the Congress. Where are we going? Instead of 10 days to act on a \nbill, the Gregg amendment would provide the President with up to 365 \ndays. Hear me, friends, Romans, countrymen. Friends, Americans, \ncountrymen, lend me your ears. Instead of 10 days to act on a bill, the \nGregg amendment would provide the President with up to 365 days to act \non a bill. This is a provision that is unconstitutional on its face. I \ndon't believe that Senator over there sitting in the chair, in the \nchair to my left, would go along with that. That is Senator Conrad, for \nthe record.\n  Within 10 days of the Congress submitting a bill to the President, we \nknow if it has become the law of the land. Under the Gregg measure, \nnobody--except the President--for up to 1 year after an act is signed \ninto law, will know if all of the provisions of a bill will be carried \ninto effect. One can imagine the confusion of not knowing, for up to 1 \nyear, whether all of the provisions of a single bill will become law. \nImagine what happens if the Congress passes a major legislative package \nsuch as a Social Security and Medicare reform package, which affects \nthe retirement and health care benefits of many millions of people and \nthe payroll taxes of many millions more. Imagine the President \ndismantling that package, listen now. Imagine the President dismantling \nthat package months after it has been passed by the Congress. Are you \nlistening? Hear me. How wise and practical will this line-item veto \nseem then? This line-item veto is an anathema to the Framers' careful \nbalancing of powers within the legislative process because it allows \nthe President, any President, to aggressively--listen to me, my friends \non the other side of the aisle; I am not just talking about Mr. Bush or \nMr. Republican President--allows a President to aggressively impose his \nwill on the legislative branch in regard to budgetary matters. I will \nsay that once again. This line-item veto is an anathema to the Framers' \ncareful balancing of powers within the legislative process because it \nallows a President, any President, to aggressively--and I mean \naggressively--impose his, the President's, will, be he Republican or \nDemocratic, on the legislative branch in regard to budgetary matters.\n\n  This line-item veto amendment goes far--and I mean far--beyond the \nPresident simply making recommendations to the Congress. It makes the \nPresident, any President, a lawmaker. It is a complete reversal of the \nlegislative process. We do not need to rewrite the Constitution in \norder to legislate. We do not need to defer extraordinary and \nunconstitutional powers to the President, any President, in order to \nensure that Congress uses its power of the purse in an ethical and \nrational and wise manner.\n  We should remember that the President has not exercised his existing \nconstitutional authorities. The President--this President--has only \nvetoed one authorization bill, and he has never, never vetoed a \nspending or revenue bill. The President has not submitted a single \nrescission proposal as currently allowed under the Budget Act. Rather \nthan dealing with the President's failed budget choices, the suggestion \nhere today is that enlarging the President's power in the budget \nprocess will somehow magically--somehow magically--reduce these \nforeboding and menacing deficits. It will not. The suggestion here \ntoday is that handing the power to make laws to the President will \nsomehow improve the quality of congressional budget decisions. This \nsuggestion is without foundation. This nefarious line-item veto will \nonly further politicize and degrade a process which is already too much \nof a political football.\n  Senators--Senator Byrd being one--take an oath--yes, an oath before \nGod. The ancient Romans felt that an oath was sacred. They would give \ntheir lives--I won't go into Roman history at this point--they would \ngive their lives to preserve an oath. Senators take an oath to preserve \nand protect the Constitution. A lack of understanding about the reasons \nfor entrusting the purse strings to the hands of the Congress, and the \nunwise tax and spending decisions of this administration, must never, \nnever be allowed to propel such an unconstitutional and dangerous as \nthe legislative line-item veto.\n  I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I will stand here until my bones \ncrumble under me, until I have no further breath, if necessary, to let \nsuch a proposal become law. Why would we ever want to hand more power \nto a President who has already grabbed far too much power--any \nPresident? Why would we ever want to bargain away our most important \ntool for protecting the liberties of the people or for derailing a \ndisastrous war? Why would we\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\never want to fall for this legislative pig-in-a-poke that could cripple \nthis body, the Congress of the United States?\n  So I urge Senators to listen. This isn't the last word by any means \nthat I could have, let alone many other Senators here. Resist this \nassault on the Constitution and the Congress. I urge Senators--yes, I \nurge Senators--Senators--there is no greater name under the \nConstitution. Who was that great Roman Emperor who said, when he was \nabout to become the Emperor ``I still revere the name of Senator.'' \nThat is 476, I believe, A.D. It was Majorian, I believe, who said, ``I \nstill revere the name of Senator.'' Senator. Did you hear that?\n  I urge Senators to resist this assault. I am talking about a line-\nitem veto now. You ain't heard nothing yet. I urge Senators to resist \nthis assault on the Congress and on the Constitution of the United \nStates and on the people, the people of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope colleagues have been listening to \nthe Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. He is a wise man. He is an \nexperienced man. And what he has been warning this body about this \namendment is the truth. This is a dangerous amendment. It is offered by \nsomebody with whom I work closely. Senator Gregg is the former chairman \nof the Budget Committee. As the incoming chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, we work together virtually every day. I respect him. I like \nhim. But I believe this amendment is profoundly dangerous.\n  It is suggested that this amendment will help deal with our budget \nshortfall. It will not. Virtually everyone who has examined it will say \nit makes virtually no difference with respect to our deficits and debt. \nWhat it will do, without question, is transfer power to the President \nof the United States. Senator Byrd has made it clear that it is not a \nquestion of this President; it is a question of any President. Make no \nmistake, I believe this measure and any measure like it is \nunconstitutional.\n  The Founding Fathers had great wisdom. They did not want to repeat \nthe abuses of the King, so they wanted the spending to be in the hands \nof the bodies closest to the people--the House of Representatives and \nthe U.S. Senate. They did not want any individual, any President, to \nhave the power of the purse because they recognized the inherent \ndangers in concentrating power in the hands of one person.\n  Anybody who has any doubt about how this would be used--perhaps by \nthis President but certainly by some President--only needs to reflect \non what has happened in the past when people had this kind of unchecked \npower. I was told by a colleague of ours who served in a State \nlegislature about a situation where the Governor had this kind of \npower. She got legislation passed that was very important to her. She \nwas called to the Governor's office, and the Governor had her \nlegislation on one side of his desk and a bill he wanted on the other \nside of his desk. He told her: You know, I am probably going to have to \nline-item veto your legislation. But I have this bill which is \nimportant to me, and if you could see your way clear on that, I might \nbe able to help you on your legislation.\n  Anyone who doubts this President or a future President would use that \npower on Members of this body ought to think again.\n  The problems with this line-item veto proposal--and we know line-item \nveto proposals in the past have been declared unconstitutional by the \nSupreme Court. I believe this measure would be declared \nunconstitutional, but we shouldn't abdicate our responsibility. We \nshouldn't wait for the Supreme Court to make a judgment. We should make \nthis judgment. This line-item veto proposal represents an abdication of \ncongressional responsibility. It shifts too much power to the executive \nbranch, and with very little impact on the deficit. It provides a \nPresident up to 1 year to submit rescission requests. It requires \nCongress to vote within 10 days. It provides no opportunity to \nfilibuster proposed rescissions. And it allows a President to cancel \nnew mandatory spending proposals passed by Congress, such as those \ndealing with Social Security, Medicare, veterans, and agriculture. \nColleagues, that is an extraordinary grant of power to any President. \nJust with this final piece on mandatory spending, we know we have big \nproblems in the future with Medicare and Social Security. We might \nlabor for months to come to an agreement with the President on the \nfuture of those programs, and then under this amendment, after the \ndifficult compromises had been reached, this President or a future \nPresident could go back and cherry-pick the provisions he or she did \nnot like. I hope colleagues are listening. That is truly an \nextraordinary grant of power to this President or any President.\n  Here is what USA Today said last year in reference to line-item veto. \nThey called it a convenient distraction.\n\n       The vast bulk of the deficit is not the result of self-\n     aggrandizing line items, infuriating as they are. The deficit \n     is primarily caused by unwillingness to make hard choices on \n     benefit programs or to levy the taxes to pay for the true \n     cost of government.\n\n  A convenient distraction.\n  This is what the Roanoke Times said last year with respect to this or \na similar proposal:\n\n       The President already has the only tool he needs: the veto. \n     That Bush has declined to challenge Congress in five-plus \n     years is his choice. The White House no doubt sees reviving \n     this debate as a means of distracting people from the \n     missteps, miscalculations, mistruths, and mistakes that have \n     dogged Bush and sent his approval rating south.\n       The current problems are not systemic; they are \n     ideological. A [line-item] veto will not magically grant \n     lawmakers and the President fiscal discipline and economic \n     sense.\n\n  Here is what the former Acting CBO Director, Mr. Marron, said in \ntestimony before the House last year about line-item veto:\n\n       Such tools, however, cannot establish fiscal discipline \n     unless there is a political consensus to do so . . . In the \n     absence of that consensus, the proposed changes to the \n     rescission process . . . are unlikely to greatly affect the \n     budget's bottom line.\n\n  The proponent of this amendment said this last year:\n\n       Passage of the [line-item veto] legislation would be a \n     ``political victory'' that would not address long-term \n     problems posed by growing entitlement programs.\n\n  This is the statement of the author of this amendment last year.\n  He went on to say further:\n\n       It would have ``very little impact'' on the budget deficit.\n\n  He was telling the truth.\n  Here is what a conservative columnist said about the line-item veto \nproposal, George Will.\n\n       It would aggravate an imbalance in our constitutional \n     system that has been growing for seven decades: The expansion \n     of executive power at the expense of the legislature.\n\n  I hope colleagues are listening. I truly believe this is a dangerous \namendment.\n  A scholar at the American Enterprise Institute went even further and \ncalled the proposal ``shameful.'' This is what he said:\n\n       The larger reality is that this [line-item] veto proposal \n     gives the President a great additional mischief-making \n     capability, to pluck out items to punish lawmakers he doesn't \n     like, or to threaten individual lawmakers to get votes on \n     other things, without having any noticeable impact on budget \n     growth or restraint.\n\n  I hope colleagues are listening. We are going to have a change in \nPresident in 2 years. This amendment might live forever and \nfundamentally erode the basic concept of a House and a Senate and the \ndivision of powers between the legislative branch and the executive \nbranch.\n  Mr. Ornstein, from the American Enterprise Institute, went on to say:\n\n       More broadly, it simply shows the lack of institutional \n     integrity and patriotism by the majority in Congress. They \n     have lots of ways to put the responsibility of budget \n     restraint where it belongs--on themselves. Instead, they \n     willingly, even eagerly, try to turn their most basic power \n     over to the President. Shameful, just shameful.\n\n  That was last year.\n  Senator Gregg has indicated his proposal closely tracks the proposal \nof our colleague, Senator Daschle, from 1995. It does not. There are \nsignificant differences.\n  Can the President propose to rescind a few mandatory items, such as \nSocial Security and Medicare reforms? The Gregg proposal, yes; Senator \nDaschle, no. That is a profound difference. Mandatory proposals would \nbe subject to the President's line-item veto under the Gregg amendment, \nnot under the\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\nDaschle amendment. That proposal alone is enough to lead anyone who \nsupported the Daschle proposal to oppose this one.\n  Second, can the President propose rescissions from multiple bills in \none rescissions package? Under the Gregg measure, yes; under the \nDaschle proposal, no.\n  What difference does that make? Let me give an example. Remember the \nbridge to nowhere? That was something that people responded to, \ndepending on its merits. A lot of people thought it was a waste of \nmoney. The President could couple that measure, which many would have \nsupported in terms of elimination, with something that was less well-\nknown that really had merit. Under the Gregg proposal, you could \njackpot unpopular things with popular things and get them eliminated, \ngiving the President an extraordinary power to leverage individual \nMembers of Congress to get votes from them on completely unrelated \nmatters.\n  For example, maybe the President puts up a controversial judge and \nthen uses this power to leverage a Senator to vote for a judge that he \nmight not otherwise support in exchange for allowing that Senator's \nspending proposal to go forward. That is a dangerous power.\n  Finally, how long does the President have to propose rescissions? \nUnder the Daschle proposal, 20 days, or in the next budget; under the \nGregg proposal, 1 year.\n  I truly believe this is an extraordinarily dangerous amendment. It is \ndangerous to the balance of powers between the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch of Government. It is an extraordinary granting of \npower to a President. Remember, the next President might be of a \ndifferent party. I would make this same speech if a Democrat were \nadvancing it. I would make this same speech if a Democrat were the \nPresident of the United States.\n  This is a dangerous amendment. It will do virtually nothing about our \ndeficit, but it will transfer power to a President who already has too \nmuch power.\n  I hope my colleagues pay very close attention to this debate. I hope \nthey reject the Gregg amendment.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their extraordinary \ncourtesy today to allow this discussion to go forward before they have \neven given their opening remarks. That is truly extraordinary in terms \nof their graciousness. And we appreciate Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me thank him for this magnificent speech. Let me thank \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Enzi for their remarkable patience and \ntheir consideration always. I thank the distinguished Senator for this \nmagnificent speech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the business now before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 101, the McConnell for Gregg \namendment to the Reid substitute to H.R. 2.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Reid substitute effectively is the increase in the \nminimum wage; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from West Virginia \nand to the Senator from North Dakota as well as the Senator from New \nHampshire, this has been an enormously important 2 hours in terms of \nthe discussion and debate about the proposal of the Senator from New \nHampshire. Over this period of time I am very hopeful our colleagues \npaid close attention to this debate because it is an extremely \nimportant issue that stretches the whole question of constitutional \npowers, the relationship between the Executive and the Congress.\n  We have had these individuals speak to this issue. They are \nknowledgeable, thoughtful colleagues who have spent a good deal of time \non this matter.\n  It is of enormous consequence, the outcome of this proposal. I am \nenormously appreciative particularly of Senator Byrd and Senator Conrad \nfor the excellence of their presentation and for the extremely \nconvincing arguments they have made. The power of their arguments I \nfind enormously compelling, and I hope our colleagues will consider it \nfavorably as they make up their minds when we vote on this issue on \nWednesday, the day after tomorrow.\n  This has been an extremely important debate. I am grateful to those \nwho have participated in it. I thank, in particular, again, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia who is constant in his commitment and protection of \nthe Constitution and the protection of the Senate as our Founding \nFathers saw it and believed in it and chartered it in the Constitution. \nWe are extremely grateful for this debate and discussion. I personally \nthank the Senator from West Virginia for bringing such clarity and \nrecall of historical importance to this debate and discussion over the \nperiod of the last 2 hours. We are very grateful to him as we always \nare when he talks about the role of the Senate and also about the \ndivision of powers under the Constitution. We thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able and highly respected \nSenator from Massachusetts, my favorite Senator of this age, for what \nhe has said.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for his \nremarkable statement. It will be in the Record for 1,000 years. There \nis nothing I could say to embellish it, to add to it, to subtract from \nit, or to comment on except to say it is one of the great speeches I \nhave heard in this Senate. And I have heard a lot. I have been here a \nlong time. Next year will be my 50th year. The Senator from North \nDakota is a leader among men, a leader among Senators. I commend him. I \nthank him.\n  I thank all Senators, and I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we now bring the focus and attention of \nthe Senate on an issue of enormous importance and consequence to \nworking families in this country. Americans understand the issues of \nfairness. They understand the importance of work. Americans have \nbelieved, for a long period of time, if you work hard and play by the \nrules, you should not have to live in poverty in the United States of \nAmerica. They have supported, Republicans and Democrats alike, a fair \nminimum wage over the period of the last 70 years. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike have supported that concept, which is basic and \nfundamental in terms of a free society and a free economy. That is the \nissue we are going to address today because over the period of these \nlast 10 years, we have had intense opposition from Republican \nleadership over an increase in the minimum wage.\n  Now, with the change of leadership in the House of Representatives \nand the Senate of the United States, our Democratic colleagues, with \nSpeaker Pelosi, and now with Senator Reid, have put this issue of \nfairness before the Senate as a priority issue.\n  We welcome the opportunity to address it. It is one that is easily \ncomprehensible, and it should not take a long time to debate. There are \nstill those in this body who oppose it, and we expect to have \namendments to try to undermine this very simple and fundamental concept \nof saying to those individuals who are at the bottom rung of the \neconomic ladder: If you work hard and play by the rules 40 hours a week \nin the United States of America, you ought to at least be able to have \na wage so you are not going to continue to live in poverty. We are also \ntrying to say, if you have a minimum wage job, that should not condemn \nyou to a life in poverty.\n  Now, let me go back over what this minimum wage is all about and give \nsome sense about who is affected by the minimum wage and what has \nhappened to it in recent times.\n  This chart reflects where the minimum wage has been in terms of its \npurchasing power from 1960 to 2005. If you look at where we are, as of \n2005, you see a steady decrease in the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage worker, who today earns $5.15 an hour. If you look back, again, in \nterms of the purchasing power of the minimum wage worker in the 1960s, \nit was about $7 an hour. It was close to $9 in 1967,\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\n1968. And then it went along, and still the purchasing power was about \n$7 an hour. Then we saw the gradual decline through the 1980s. In spite \nof our efforts to get President Reagan to increase the minimum wage, we \nwere unable to do so.\n  Then, we had two times where we got a very modest increase in the \nminimum wage, in 1991 and then again in 1997. But we have not seen an \nincrease in the minimum wage in the last 10 years, and we have seen the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage worker reach perhaps its all-time \nlow at the present time.\n  This red line on the chart indicates, with the passage of the \nincrease in the minimum wage over a 2-year period, bringing it to \n$7.25, it would still be below the purchasing power of the 20 years \nbetween 1960 and 1980, but at least it would give increasing hope to \nmillions of Americans who are working at the minimum wage.\n  This issue of the minimum wage is a women's issue because so many of \nthose who receive the minimum wage are women. So it is a women's issue. \nSo many of those women have children, so it is a children's issue and a \nwomen's issue. It is a family issue because how that family is going to \nlive, depending upon where the minimum wage is, how that child is going \nto be brought up, is going to depend on what that parent is able to \nprovide for that child.\n  So it is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil \nrights issue because so many of those who enter the job market, who \nenter it at the minimum wage, are men and women of color. So it is a \ncivil rights issue, a children's issue, a women's issue, and, most of \nall, a fairness issue. That is something the American people can \nunderstand.\n  This chart shows what has happened to productivity in the United \nStates. Generally speaking, if you look back over the years of 1960, \n1965, 1970, 1975, we see that the minimum wage related to the increase \nin productivity. As workers became more productive, an important part \nof that increased productivity was passed on to the workers themselves, \nas it should be in a fair society.\n  But what we see at the present time is that the productivity has \nincreased 165 percent over the period of the last 45 years, and the \nminimum wage, in terms of the total purchasing power over that period \nof time, has actually gone down. The minimum wage has not only not kept \nup with productivity, it has even fallen further behind. Productivity \nwas always the issue to be judged when we had debates on the minimum \nwage years ago that asked: What has happened to the increase in \nproductivity? We can justify an increase in the minimum wage in terms \nof wages if they produce more. We have seen a dramatic increase in \nproductivity but virtually no increase and a decline in the purchasing \npower of minimum wage workers.\n  Here we see the real minimum wage decline: Twenty percent in the 10 \nyears of Republican opposition. The value of it in 1997, $13,448; in \n2007, $10,700--$6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three.\n  And this chart shows the Federal poverty level in this country in \n1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, all the way through 1980. For 20 years, this \ncountry said: OK, we will have a minimum wage, and we will keep it at \nleast at the poverty level so individuals will not fall behind. If they \nwork hard and play by the rules, they at least will not have to live in \npoverty. As this chart shows, we see now it is $6,000 below the poverty \nlevel for a family of three who is earning the minimum wage.\n  Since 1980, we have only had two increases in the minimum wage. Now, \nin the last 10 years, we have had none. That is the issue. Having to \ntake the time to try to go through this and explain why we need an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and why we are going to hear from the \nother side, those who are in opposition to it, is extraordinary to me \nwith these figures.\n  Look what has happened. If we try to measure poverty in the Bush \neconomy between 2000 and 2005, there are 5.4 million more people living \nin poverty today than in the year 2000, largely because of the failure \nof the Congress to increase the minimum wage. These are the figures. \nThese are the statistics. They do not talk about real lives, how these \npeople struggle. They do not tell about the lost dreams of these \nfamilies. They do not talk about the shattered conditions of the \nchildren who are in these kinds of conditions.\n  There are 5\\1/2\\ million new people who have gone into poverty in the \nUnited States of America, the strongest economy in the world, basically \nas a result of the failure to increase the minimum wage.\n  Look what has happened to children. There are 1.3 million more \nchildren in poverty today than we had 5 years ago--1.3 million more \nchildren in poverty today--primarily because of the failure to increase \nthe minimum wage.\n\n  Well, we have to ask ourselves: Where are we as a country and a \nnation in terms of child poverty? Look at this chart. Of all the \nindustrialized nations of the world, the United States has the highest \nchild poverty rate--the highest poverty rate for children in the \nindustrialized world. There are the figures. There are the statistics. \nIt is not even close, and it is going up.\n  While we are having the extraordinary profits on Wall Street, what is \nhappening on Main Street? What is happening in the small communities, \nsmall farms, small towns, and in the major urban areas of this country? \nWhat is happening to the children of this Nation? There is not a person \nin this Chamber who, in the last 5 days, has not made a speech about \nhow our future is about our children. Everyone goes out and talks about \nthe importance of our children in our democracy and our country. Look \nwhat is happening. They talk about it and refuse to do something that \ncan make a big difference. That is child poverty.\n  When you look at child poverty and look over the figures and \nstatistics, there is nothing terribly surprising about this, with a \nnational average of 17.6 percent. We see who takes the major burdens, \nthe Latinos and African Americans, those women and children of color. \nWe are trying to talk about one country and one society, one history, \nand, nonetheless, we see the growing disparity in the increased number \nof families in poverty, the disparity with the increased number of \nchildren in poverty, and the disparity between the various communities \nin our Nation.\n  Is this what this country wants? We are not saying that the total \nanswer is the increase in the minimum wage, but it makes a major \ndifference. And we can show you, and will show you, why that is so.\n  We see the figures now in terms of what has happened in terms of \nstatistics. But what does this mean on some of the issues that relate \nto the conditions of our fellow citizens? Let's take the issue of \nhunger. Not many people are talking about the challenges and the \nproblems of hunger in our society. This is from the USDA, household \nfood security in the United States, pointing out the increasing number \nof families who are on the verge of hunger in our economy has increased \nby 2 million. In the industrialized world, we are No. 1 in child \npoverty, and we see an increasing number of our fellow citizens in \nterms of hunger.\n  How does that impact in terms of children? Mr. President, 12.4 \nmillion children are hungry now every single day in the United States \nof America, and that number is growing. We can look at the number of \nchildren who go to bed hungry at night. This quote is from Lisa Hamler-\nFugitt, who is the executive director of the Ohio Association of Second \nHarvest Foodbanks:\n\n       Thirty-five percent of the people that we serve are \n     children.\n\n  Thirty-five percent are children.\n\n       I see these children, and I think what are we teaching \n     them? That in America, you can work 40 hours a week and still \n     not earn enough to buy food?\n\n  That is what is happening. That is what is happening in the United \nStates of America now, today. And we have to spend hours in this body, \nafter we have had the adequate pay increases of $30,000 for Members of \nCongress in the last 10 years, and try to convince people to go to a \n$7.25 minimum wage? And we are going to hear opposition to this? This \nis what is happening out across this country.\n  So we know what is out there in terms of hunger, how this reflects \nitself, the fact that they are not getting the adequate income, how it \nimpacts particular children in our society.\n  This reflects, at no surprise to anyone--this is the National Low \nIncome\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\nHousing Coalition--about how many hours you have to work at the minimum \nwage to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment. This is for an \naverage family of three. These are the hours you have to work in 1 \nweek. You would have to work 229 hours a week in my State of \nMassachusetts at the minimum wage to be able to afford it; 140 hours a \nweek down in Louisiana. Across the country, out in the Southwest, we \nare looking at New Mexico; Arizona, 149 hours a week; Missouri, 119 \nhours a week; even Wyoming, 112 hours a week.\n  This illustrates pressures on these families, their difficulty to be \nable to provide food for their children, let alone providing for their \nhousing.\n  The increase, this is how it reflects itself. We propose an increase \nin the minimum wage to $7.25. This is what it means. It means 2 years \nof childcare for a minimum wage family. It means full tuition at a \ncommunity college. This is what it could mean to a family. It means a \nyear and a half of heat and electricity. We have seen the reductions in \nthe fuel assistance programs in the recent times, which has been \ndevastating in my part of the country. It means more than a year of \ngroceries. It means more than 8 months of rent.\n  This might not make a big deal of difference to a lot of people, but \nit makes an enormous amount of difference to these families who are \nearning the minimum wage. This is how it reflects itself: a year of \ngroceries, 8 months of rent, a year and a half of heat and electricity, \ntuition at a community college--an opportunity for hope for some of \nthese individuals--and also 2 years of childcare, to help with the \nproblems in terms of childcare, the difficulty that these families have \nin trying to work for the minimum wage and have someone who is going to \ncare and look out for their children. There are heartrending stories to \nthat effect.\n  This chart reiterates the fact that the great majority, 60, 61 \npercent, of those working are women, so it is primarily a women's \nissue. Great numbers of those women have children, so this is a special \nissue for women.\n  Here we show that about 1.4 million single parents, most of whom are \nwomen, would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. Some will \nsay, on the one hand, it doesn't affect all that many people. Then why \nnot have an increase in the minimum wage? It doesn't, in terms of the \npercentage increase in the total payroll of this country, it is \ninfinitesimal, an increase in the minimum wage. I will come to that in \na minute. But don't tell me it doesn't make a great deal of difference \nto the over 1 million single parents, most of whom are women, who would \nbenefit from an increase in the minimum wage.\n  This tells the story of Diana, a single mother of three from Buffalo, \nwho works for a childcare center, making the minimum wage. She has to \nrely on food stamps and Medicaid to provide for her family. Increasing \nthe minimum wage will allow her to ``decrease her reliance on \ngovernment subsidies and . . . pursue her dream of self-sufficiency and \na better life for herself and her family.''\n  It is interesting, the fact that if we do not increase the minimum \nwage, we are effectively subsidizing many businesses. Because these \nfamilies are eligible for food stamps or maybe some could get some fuel \nassistance, other kinds of support services, who do you think is paying \nfor those programs? Working families. So you get a decent minimum wage \nout there, and it reduces the pressure on those programs. That means \nless pressure on our working families who are going to have to pay in.\n  The increase in the minimum wage will benefit more than 6 million \nchildren whose parents will receive a raise. Six million children in \nthis country will benefit because of the increase in the minimum wage. \nIt is a children's issue, a women's issue. This is what this is about.\n  What happens when children are living a better quality life? Look at \nthis chart: Better attendance, concentration and performance at school, \nhigher test scores and graduation rates. We are going to be debating No \nChild Left Behind. We are going to be wondering how we can make a \ndifference in terms of children in our schools. There are a number of \nthings that can make a difference to the children: a qualified teacher, \nclassrooms where children can learn, supplementary services, parental \ninvolvement. A number of things can make a difference to the children. \nBut one thing we know for sure: If the children can't see the \nblackboard, if they need glasses, or they can't hear a teacher because \nthey need some kind of help, we tried to do this with the CHIP program \nto help them. In the CHIP program, it is not required, but a lot of \nStates do provide those. But if the child is going to be hungry, the \nchild is not going to pay attention. We have all kinds of examples for \nthat. We will mention that at another time.\n  But 6.4 million children will benefit from an increase in the minimum \nwage: better concentration, performance at school, higher test scores, \nhigher graduation rates, stronger immune systems, better health, fewer \nexpensive hospital visits, fewer run-ins in the juvenile justice \nsystem--investing in the children. Again, 6.4 million will benefit from \nan increase in the minimum wage, and this will be part of the benefits \nthat will come from those increases.\n  We have seen a higher minimum wage improves children's futures. For \nfamilies living in poverty, a $400 increase in family income will \ndramatically increase children's test scores. This is from the \nInstitute of Research on Poverty, on reading and math. This shows the \ndifference in terms of the test scores. Children who are going to be \nfed, children who are going to have the kind of support do better in \nschools.\n  We mentioned earlier the problems of poverty falling \ndisproportionately on those individuals of color. This chart shows that \nindividuals of color benefit from the higher minimum wage. People of \ncolor make up 36 percent of all minimum wage workers. If we are able to \nget an increase in that, it will obviously benefit them.\n  We talked about children for a time and the impact it has on \nchildren. I will spend a few minutes talking about the number of \nelderly struggling with the problems of poverty. The number of elderly \nstruggling will increase dramatically over the next several years. The \nbest estimate--and this is by the Nation's poor, near-poor older \npopulation; it is a very important and significant study--shows the \nnumber of elderly who are going to live in poverty, increasing some 41 \npercent over the period of the next years. And we can understand that \nbecause we see the decline in wages according to age. This chart shows \ndeclining wages for men as well as women, all set in motion, again, by \nthe issue about where they are going to start off on the minimum wage. \nSo we are going to have significant increases.\n  This is the RAND study in terms of our seniors who are going to be \nliving in poverty. They will certainly benefit from this.\n  Here is an elderly worker, Peggy Fraley, a 60-year-old grandmother \nfrom Wichita, KS, who works as a receptionist for $5.15 an hour. She \nlives with her daughter, who also earns the minimum wage, and her five \ngrandchildren. She says: We can barely make it, but we have each other. \nThat is richer sometimes.\n  This has a real impact. We have been talking a lot about statistics, \nbut it affects people in the most basic and fundamental ways.\n  Over the period of these recent years where the Senate has failed to \nact, a number of States have moved ahead. You will see on this chart \nthe red States are the States where they have a minimum wage which is \nhigher than the Federal. These are red States as well as the blue \nStates, with the minimum wage at or below the Federal level. This is \nwhat has happened in the country over the period of the last 10 years.\n\n  Now let's see, we have pointed out what has been happening in terms \nof children, people living in poverty, children in poverty. High \nminimum wage States, meaning those we have just mentioned here that \nhave had some increase in the minimum wage, have lower poverty rates. \nThat should not be surprising. It is all true. You can take it right \nacross the line. The States that have increased their minimum wage are \nall below the national average in terms of the poverty rate, 12.7 \npercent. So this has a real impact. And look at what it has with regard \nto child poverty rates. Remember, I mentioned we\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nare the No. 1 industrial society with the number of children living in \npoverty. Look what happens in the States where we have actually \nincreased the minimum wage. Just about every one of those is below the \nnational average on child poverty. Increasing the minimum wage has a \nreal impact in terms of child poverty in this country.\n  I will show what has happened in some other countries. I will show \nwhat has happened in other States. Let's see what happened in other \ncountries. We always hear, well, if we do this, it is going to be a \ndisaster to the economy and, therefore, we can't afford to have that \nbecause we are going to lose jobs or we will slow down the economy. We \nare going to throw those people out of work we are trying to help. We \nare going to hurt their community and we will hurt their families. \nRight? Wrong.\n  Let's look at the two countries which have raised their minimum wage \nthe most over the last 5 years. That is Great Britain and Ireland. What \nare the two countries in Europe that have the best economies? Britain \nand Ireland. What are their minimum wages? Great Britain is now $10.57 \nan hour. Ireland is $10.80 an hour. And what has been the result? They \nhave the strongest economies and the second strongest economy, and \nBritain has brought 2 million children out of poverty. Ireland has \nreduced its number of children who are in poverty by 40 percent. Look \nat this: Child poverty, dramatic increase in the minimum wage. They \nhave a strong economy and a dramatic reduction in child poverty. And \nhere we have an increase in child poverty, keeping the minimum wage.\n  Look at what has happened in terms of Great Britain. They have taken \n2 million children out of poverty, and we have seen 1.4 million \nchildren go into poverty. Five years ago, Great Britain had the highest \nnumber of children in poverty of any of the European countries. And \nTony Blair, to his credit, said: We are going to do something about it, \nand we are going to effectively eliminate child poverty in this decade. \nThey are well on the way to doing so, demonstrating what we have said. \nThat is, you can make a difference with regard to children. You can \nmake a difference in terms of the issues of poverty by increasing the \nminimum wage.\n  Now let me take the States. What has happened to the States? You can \nsay that is interesting, what has happened in those countries. But \nlet's take a look at the States that have had an increase in the \nminimum wage. States with higher minimum wages create more jobs. This \nis from the Fiscal Policy Institute, March 30, 2006, overall employment \ngrowth from January 1998 to January 2006. In the 11 States with a \nminimum wage higher than $5.15, it has been 9.7 percent. In States with \nthe minimum wage at $5.15, it is 7.5 percent. I thought if you raised \nthe minimum wage, it was supposed to go down. You weren't supposed to \ngrow as fast. And you weren't supposed to have increasing employment. \nBut quite clearly, this isn't the fact.\n  Let's take the States where they are creating businesses. People say, \nif you raise the minimum wage, we are going to put a lot of businesses \nout of work. Is that right? No, that is wrong, too. Here are the 10 \nStates with a minimum wage higher than $5.15. States with higher \nminimum wages create more small businesses. Overall growth in the \nnumber of small businesses, 1998 to 2003, 5.4 percent where you get a \nminimum wage higher than $5.15, and 4.2 percent where they have had \n$5.15--more employment, more growth of businesses. This is the result, \nif you look in other areas as well.\n  This is States with higher minimum wages on retail jobs. In States \nwith a minimum wage higher than $5.15 an hour, the employment growth is \n10 percent in retail jobs; 3.7 percent where the minimum wage is $5.15.\n  We don't expect the NFIB to support this proposal. But what we do \nfind is that many employers and small businesses do. Malcolm Davis \nsupports raising the minimum wage. This was in the News Observer, a \nnewspaper. He is a small business owner, is proud to say:\n\n       My lowest paid employee makes $8 per hour. With only 11 \n     employees, things are tight, to say the least. If I can find \n     a way to be fair with my employees in rural eastern North \n     Carolina, why can't our government? Try driving to work and \n     raising a family on the minimum wage.\n  This is more typical than not, Mr. President. Look at this. This is a \nGallup Poll of May 9, 2006. Eighty-six percent of small business owners \nsay the minimum wage doesn't affect their businesses. Question: How \ndoes the minimum wage affect your business? Eighty-six percent say no \neffect. Gallup Poll, 2006. Positive effect, 5; negative effect, 8 \npercent.\n  Let's look at what has been happening in our country over the period \nof the recent years in terms of the tax incentives. I think we ought to \nhave an increase. I am going to vote to increase the minimum wage \nwithout providing additional kinds of tax incentives. All this proposal \ndoes basically is recover the purchasing power we had 10 years ago. \nThere is no reason--we have seen countries that have raised the minimum \nwage doing very well--why we should add more tax breaks and increase \nthe deficit. Businesses receive billions of dollars while minimum wage \nworkers receive nothing.\n  This chart is from Citizens for Tax Justice. That is over the last 10 \nyears. There has been $276 billion in tax incentives for corporations--\nsmall businesses, $36 billion--and we have had no raise for the minimum \nwage workers. We are still being asked now to do more when we have seen \nthese kinds of tax breaks for corporations and businesses. I don't \nthink it is necessary that we provide the additional tax breaks. Here \nwe have seen productivity and profits skyrocket while the minimum wage \nplummets.\n  This comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Profits are up over \n45 percent; productivity, total 29 percent; and the minimum wage and \noutput per hours are down 20 percent. So it gives you an idea about \nwhat has been happening out in the economy just generally.\n  Mr. President, I think this is, above all, a moral issue. The members \nof our great faiths have all spoken clearly about this issue. Here is \nthe quote from Justice Roll, January 2007:\n\n       More than 1,000 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith leaders \n     say minimum wage workers deserve a prompt, clean minimum wage \n     increase with no strings attached.\n\n  They make an excellent statement, and it is a convincing one.\n  Mr. President, these give you at least some idea of what is at issue. \nWe have tried over the few minutes that we have had to point out where \nthe trend lines are, to show the statistics that show that an increase \nin the minimum wage is morally correct. It will strengthen our economy, \nand it will make a difference to children and to women and make a \ndifference to men and women of color. It is basically a fairness issue. \nIt will strengthen our economy. It is the right thing to do. It is long \noverdue.\n  I thank our Democratic leaders, Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid, for \ngiving it the high priority it deserves. We ought to get about the \nbusiness of getting this legislation enacted, and enacted speedily, for \nthose individuals who are out there day in and day out, men and women \nof dignity and men and women of pride, who take a sense of pride in the \njob they do, even though the jobs are very menial. Maybe it is a \nteacher's aide or someone looking out after the elderly in elderly \nhomes or someone cleaning out the buildings of American commerce. They \nare men and women of dignity, and they take pride in the jobs that they \ndo.\n  America has said it values work, and America says it values \nindividuals who want to work hard and play by the rules. We are calling \nupon this Senate now to say these working families have waited long \nenough. Those individuals who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear in this Nation of ours should not have to be condemned to living a \nlife in poverty.\n  That is the issue. Does work pay? Do we recognize our fellow citizens \nand say that we are going to respect them and we want to be one country \nwith one history and one destiny, one Nation? Let's pass the increase \nin the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, for all \nof his good work. There are a great many issues on which we agree; \nthere are some on which we differ. I always value his insight on any of \nthese issues and, needless to say, we enjoy working together. I thank \nhim for all of his cooperation on this issue, as on many other issues. \nWe give assurance to our friends in the Senate that we are going\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\nto get a lot of good work done for the people of this country in this \nsession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his kind words. I \nadmire him for the passion he puts into every issue he works on, and \npeople will notice that he works on a lot of issues. He and I have had \nthis debate three times over the last 2 years. We have varied a little \nbit on the amount of the increase, and I have always tried to get \nsomething in there for small businesses to take care of the increase, \nor to offset the increase a little so that these small businesses can \ncontinue to function and provide employment opportunities.\n  I come from a small business background. But not from small business \nas defined by the Federal government. The Federal definition is a \nbusiness with less than 500 employees. Any business that we had in our \nState that was that large--and I am not sure we have any headquartered \nin our State--would be considered big business. I am talking about the \nmom-and-pop shops where the person who does the accounting also sweeps \nthe sidewalks and cleans the toilets and waits on customers--definitely \nnot in that order. This is a significant segment of small business \nacross this country. They generate 60 to 80 percent of the net new jobs \nannually over the last decade. Raising the minimum wage will affect \nthem more substantially than businesses with as many as 500 or more \nemployees.\n  In the context of a minimum wage increase, I have always asked that \nactions be taken to offset the impact of an increase for small \nbusinesses. I want to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \ntheir work in the Finance Committee to come up with such a package. \nThat package is now contained in the Reid amendment that has been \nsubmitted. I think this package makes a substantial difference and \nmakes a raise in the minimum wage possible. I think had we worked \ntoward this kind of a situation earlier, the minimum wage might have \nhappened earlier. Unfortunately, the times that the minimum wage issue \narose in the past 2 years were situations where it was unamendable. It \nhad to be a take-it-or-leave-it--my proposal or Senator Kennedy's \nproposal, and we left them both.\n  Any proposal on which the two of us have been able to reach agreement \nhas been very successful in making it through the Senate and the House \nand getting signed by the President. It is not an easy task to pass a \nbill. I don't have to tell the Senator from Massachusetts that. He has \nbeen around here practicing the art of legislating a long time. I am \none of the newcomers; I have only been here 10 years. I have noticed, \nhowever, that legislating means either finding a compromise, or finding \na third way.\n  On this particular bill, we may find that third way. There will no \ndoubt be additional amendments to this bill. I like situations where \nbills can be amended. I have been in situations where they could not. I \nhave been on the side with the majority of votes in those situations \nand have not always felt comfortable. So I thank Majority Leader Reid \nfor having a situation where there can be amendments.\n  I ask my side of the aisle not to make amendments that are onerous or \nwide-ranging but that stick to the subject and see what the best \npossible package is that we can come up with.\n  I will speak first to the underlying substitute that has been laid \ndown on this bill. There hasn't been any comment on that yet, even \nthough we have had 2 hours 40 minutes worth of debate. Of course, we \nstarted first with Senator Gregg's amendment. I want to mention that \nthis first amendment was an agreement to keep the ethics bill from \nhaving a different approach. I appreciate the effort of both parties to \nallow that to come up. While that will be voted on as a part of the \nminimum wage, it is not a part of the minimum wage. It allows a vote on \nthat as an up-or-down vote. I am pleased there was some compromise on \nthat and some ability to do that.\n  I listened to the hour and a half of debate on that amendment and the \nconcern over whether trading votes would happen. Something this body \nought to consider, perhaps, is a law that we have in Wyoming that \nprohibits the trading of votes on any issue and makes it a felony that \nhas to be reported by both sides if an offer is made. It makes each \nissue stand on its own.\n  So I will speak first to the underlying substitute that was laid down \non this bill because it provides the tax relief we have been talking \nabout for a long time, and this is tax relief that has been agreed upon \nin a very bipartisan way. Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus often \nwork together, and that is why the Finance Committee is so successful \nin moving things along. They have come up with tax relief for very \nsmall businesses that will aid them in meeting their burden of a \nminimum wage increase. I have long advocated that we must provide a \nmeasure of tax and regulatory relief to businesses that will face these \nhigher mandated costs.\n  The substitute amendment consists of the following provisions: First, \nit would increase current section 179 expensing by extending the \nincreased expensing of qualified business property allowed for small \nbusinesses until 2011. Without an extension, the amount which may be \nexpensed will drop by more than 75 percent. If we pass this extension, \nwe will allow small business owners who are making investments in the \nfuture of their business to retain more of their earnings, and these \nadditional funds can be used to retain and hire new employees, thereby \nbalancing out the effect of the minimum wage increase.\n  Now, we have talked about families and children, and I want to tell \nyou the small businesses that we are talking about are the small \nbusinesses that are run by families that, in most instances, have \nchildren. Quite often, the small businesses are run by young people. In \nmy own case, I got married, and a week later we started a shoe store. \nWe had kids, and the kids got to learn a little about the retail trade \nby having to work and help us out. So I have some personal background \nand experience in running a small business.\n  Second, the amendment would provide a 15-year recovery period for \nleasehold improvements and certain restaurant buildings and related \nimprovements. This provision improves current law by including new \nrestaurants, retail space, and improvements by extending the broadened \nprovision. Restaurants and retail employ a very large percentage of \nminimum wage workers and are most impacted by mandated increases in the \nFederal wage. This portion of the amendment extends relief to these \nbusinesses and seeks to avoid dislocation and decreased employment \nopportunities for restaurant and other workers.\n  Third, the amendment would allow noncorporate taxpayers with annual \ngross receipts of less than $10 million to use the cash method of \naccounting for purchases and sales of merchandise.\n  Under current law, those small business taxpayers are generally \nrequired to use the accrual method for such purchases and sales, even \nthough they may use the cash accounting method for overall accounting. \nThis simplification and clarification of accounting methods would \nassist small businesses by reducing their administrative costs, which \nwould free up more resources to maintain employment levels.\n  I realize most people in America may not know the difference between \ncash accounting and accrual accounting. I can tell them, accrual \naccounting is a lot more complicated because one has to guess on the \npercentages of expenditures and then later make corrections for actual \namount, whereas under cash accounting, one takes the actual money \ncoming in and the actual money that goes out. It is a much simpler \naccounting system. We want to make sure those small businesses have \nthat opportunity.\n  Fourth, the amendment expands work opportunity tax incentives. This \nallows employers credit against wages for targeted individuals, \nincluding those on welfare, qualified veterans, and high-risk youth. \nThese populations, again, are most likely to lose jobs in an \nenvironment where employers are forced to bear increased salary costs. \nThis program would be extended for 5 years.\n  Fifth, the substitute also creates a voluntary certification program \nfor professional employer organizations that meet the standards of \nsolvency and responsibility and that maintain ongoing certification by \nthe IRS.\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\n  Lastly, the amendment provides for a series of clarifications and \nmodifications to the tax and accounting provisions that govern \nsubchapter S corporations. Many small businesses are organized under \nthe provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. \nIncidentally, the ones that are organized under subchapter S pay taxes \non the earnings each and every year as opposed to a corporation that \nonly pays some corporate taxes and then on distribution has to pay the \nrest of the taxes.\n  I can't leave this topic of small businesses without commenting \nbriefly on a matter of great concern to these businesses, the \nemployees, and the families that depend on them. I am speaking, of \ncourse, about the rise in cost of small business health insurance.\n  Although cost growth has begun to slow a bit, premiums for small \nbusinesses have been rising unsustainably at near double-digit rates \nfor more than half a decade, which is more than double the rate of \ninflation of wage growth. For much of the last Congress, my colleagues \nand I engaged in an aggressive and bipartisan effort to tackle this \nproblem. Indeed, the small business health plan legislation I authored \nwith Senator Ben Nelson came within just a few votes of overcoming a \nfilibuster last May. Our legislation would enable small businesses to \npool their negotiating across State borders to have a big enough pool \nto effectively negotiate against the big insurance companies and thus \nhold down costs and widen access to coverage while preserving the \nstrong role for State oversight and consumer protection.\n  Progress on this critical issue is moving forward. I have had \ninteresting discussions with people from both sides of the aisle. I \nthink the discussions have been promising. There is a long way to go, \nbut I think we have built a solid foundation, and that foundation \ncontinues to grow as we move into a new year and a new Congress.\n  Small business health insurance reform is vitally important, and I \nrealize there may be some sentiment that the issue should be resolved \nin the context of the minimum wage debate. However, I firmly believe \nthat offering a version of last year's small business health plan as an \namendment to the pending minimum wage legislation would be premature \nand would not help us move forward toward securing meaningful small \ngroup health insurance relief in this Congress or minimum wage or help \nfor small businesses. Rather, the best way to achieve real small \nbusiness health care reform is to proceed forcefully to build on the \nsignificant progress we made last year.\n  Development of small business health legislation is a process that is \nwell along, and I believe success is in sight. We are on a promising \ntrack, and we should stick with it. That promising track, of course, is \nhaving bipartisan discussions about what needs to be done in health to \nkeep the insurance rates down, to provide better access to people.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have been having some discussions on \nprinciples. That is the way we have been attacking the pieces of \nlegislation we do around here. We set down principles and then meet \nwith stakeholders and talk about what difficulties those principles \nprovide for them. Then we come up with a bill that will hopefully find \na way through the maze. It is extremely difficult, but the increase in \ninterest in health insurance has risen so greatly that I think this \nwill be a prime topic for people in the next year and hopefully a \nsolution within the next year.\n  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention, as I have many times in \nthe past, that while an increase in the minimum wage will be a kick-\nstart for some workers, it doesn't address the fundamental issue of \nchronic low wage earners. Regardless of how we increase the minimum \nwage today, those who earn it will still be the lowest paid tomorrow. \nThe minimum wage needs to be for all workers what it is for most--a \nstarting point. Our policy should be directed at giving all workers the \nopportunity to move up the wage ladder, not merely moving the ladder's \nlowest rung up.\n  As a former small business owner, I know these entry-level jobs are a \ngateway into the workforce for people without skills and without \nexperience. Minimum wage usually goes to those with minimum skills. \nThese skills-based wage jobs can open the door to better jobs and \nbetter lives for low-skilled workers if we give them the tools they \nneed to succeed. My colleagues know that I strongly believe we must do \nmore in this department. For the past two Congresses, one of my major \npriorities has been reauthorizing and improving the Nation's job-\ntraining system that was created by the Workforce Investment Act. This \nlaw will help to provide American workers with the skills they need to \ncompete in the global economy. Education and the acquisition of job \nskills represent the surest path to economic opportunity and security \nin the global job market. Increasing skills increases jobs, increases \nwages, and lifts the lowest boat into a bigger boat.\n\n  Over the past few years, this bill has received unanimous support in \nboth the HELP Committee, which has reported it out twice, and the full \nSenate, which has passed it twice. But I have to say that election-year \npolitics and political positioning have prevented this important bill \nfrom becoming law.\n  We tried to preconference a lot of the bills that came out of the \nHELP Committee last Congress. We were successful on many. That means \nthe House agreed with the Senate position with some changes prior even \nto the time the Senate passed a bill, and then the House would pass the \nsame bill, and as a result, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee got 27 bills through the legislative process and signed by \nthe President. That is quite a contrast to what happens with most \ncommittees.\n  The Workforce Investment Act was not able to be preconferenced. I \nhope it can be now. I believe there is a little better understanding of \nsome of the objections and also some of the benefits. I believe this \nbill will make it through the process and will start an estimated \n900,000 people a year on a better career path. It can only happen if it \nis not a casualty of Congress's inability to overcome its worst \npartisan instincts. That would be inexcusable.\n  Outside the glare of election-year politics, I hope we can quickly \npass this job-training bill that will truly improve the wages and lives \nof workers in this country. The Senate has passed it twice. We have \nspent 4 years working on it.\n  The potential skills gap facing American workers only deepens when we \nare compared to our competitors around the world. As chairman of the \ncommittee, I was able to travel to some of the foreign countries which \nare among some of our toughest competitors in the world market. I came \nhome believing strongly that we must focus more seriously on the \nacquisition and improvement of job and job-related skills. While many \nof us feel good about what we are doing today when we raise the minimum \nwage, I intend to make sure we do not neglect to address the far more \npressing concerns for American workers: the increasing skills gap and \nthe availability of health insurance. I anticipate we will get to work \non these issues at a separate time.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 103 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, at this point, I have permission to lay down \nan amendment on behalf of Senator Snowe. I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Ms. Snowe, for \n     herself, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 103 to amendment No. 100.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To enhance compliance assistance for small businesses)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Snowe. This amendment would provide some measure of \nrelief to those small businesses which bear the economic burden of \nnearly 41 percent of the increase in the Federal minimum wage. Small \nbusinesses not only employ the bulk of the minimum wage workers, they \nhave also been the engine for economic growth.\n  Small business has been responsible for the majority of new job \ncreation, generating between 60 and 80 percent of the net new jobs \nannually over the last decade, and it is small businesses which have \ntraditionally provided the only entry port for new workers into the job \nmarket.\n  I congratulate Senator Snowe for her persistence on this amendment. \nShe has worked on it a number of times and revised it to the present \nsituation. I suspect if there are any objections, we would be willing \nto work on it additionally.\n  But we must recognize that raising the Federal minimum wage, whatever \nelse effects there may be, significantly increases the costs for many \nof these businesses. I mentioned that an increase of 41 percent in \nlabor costs has to be accounted for somehow. Curtailing services, \nreducing employee complements, and forgoing expansions are some of the \nmany options considered by these businesses in the face of increased \ncosts. The inescapable fact is that increased labor costs heighten the \nrisk of both employment dislocation and decreased job opportunity for \nthe very individuals an increase in the minimum wage is designed to \nbenefit. Unless we are prudent and balance such mandated cost increases \nfor some measure of relief for affected small businesses, we risk \nserious unintended consequences. Simply put, an increase in the minimum \nwage is of no value at all to a worker who does not have a job or a job \nseeker who has no prospects of employment.\n  As a Senator from a rural, low-population State, I would like to \npoint out another reality. In many cases, heavily populated areas with \nhigh costs of living have already, in fact, adjusted their minimum wage \nlevels either by law or by market forces, which actually work.\n  The town I am from is a boomtown, it is an energy center. If one \ndrives by the Arby's restaurant, the lit-up moving marque sign says: \nNow hiring, $9.50 an hour plus benefits; you name the hours. If you go \nin and apply, they will tell you that if they can pick the hours, it is \n$10.50 an hour.\n  In many areas, market forces are working. There are construction \ncompanies that go from one site to another hiring people away from \nother construction companies. We have a shortage of people to work in \nWyoming. Of course, that requires relocating to the frontier, which is \nwhat a lot of people consider Wyoming. Horace Greeley said: Go west, \nyoung man. I would say: Go west, young man and young woman. There are \ncoal operations out there, primarily surface mines. They need people to \ndrive coal, or haul trucks. These trucks are 28 feet long, 28 feet \nwide, and 28 feet tall. They haul a lot of coal. We move 1 million tons \nof coal a day out of our county. How can we do that? We have a coal \nseam that is 50- to 90-feet thick, and it is only under 60 to 90 feet \nof dirt.\n  When I was mayor and Senator Rockefeller was Governor, he came out to \nsee our mines. Taking him back out to the airport, I always remember \nwhat he said: You folks don't mine coal here.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: You just back up trains and you load them.\n  We have coal which is low in sulfur and other chemicals, which makes \nit useful across the United States. Some of the States also known as \ncoal States take our coal and mix it with their coal, and they can help \nmeet the clean air standards that way. We are low in Btu, so they \nincrease the Btu by using their coal. If someone has a clean drug \nrecord and no experience and can drive anything, they can be trained to \ndrive one of these coal haul trucks and make $60,000 to $80,000 a year, \nand even more with overtime. It is a very flexible market. So there are \njob opportunities out there. But they may be nontraditional jobs, and \nthey may require moving to another part of the country.\n  One will find Wyoming can use a little bit more population. We are \ntrying to reach a population of half a million people. We are 350 miles \na side on our State, so we are bigger than most of the States.\n  At any rate, there are areas which would be most dramatically \naffected by the minimum wage increase and those are lower cost of \nliving areas. They are often rural and sparsely populated. In those \nareas, employers will feel the most pressure on their bottom lines. In \nthose areas, employees will have the fewest opportunities to find other \nemployment if they are let go. So a reasonable approach to the minimum \nwage issue must take those realities into account. If we are going to \ndramatically increase the costs for some businesses by a wage mandate, \nwe should provide some measure of relief to those same businesses. If \nwe do not, we harm not only those small businesses, we ultimately harm \nthe individuals they employ.\n  The sound and well-reasoned amendment that is offered by Senator \nSnowe accomplishes these ends through reasonable and targeted \nregulatory relief for those small businesses that are most negatively \nimpacted by a wage increase mandate. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthe amendment along with Senator Landrieu. The Snowe amendment provides \nsome regulatory relief by requiring that the Federal agencies which \nissue new rules and regulations which impact small businesses also \nprovide those employers with plainly written and readily available \nguidance that explains what employers must do to be in compliance with \nthese rules and regulations.\n  All employers incur costs keeping up with the obligations Government \nimposes on them and determining how to meet those obligations. Small \nbusinesses regularly incur administrative costs in monitoring Federal \nregulatory changes and developing compliance programs. There is no \nquestion that the burden of Federal regulations falls more heavily on \nsmall business. This chart shows the cost of complying with\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nFederal regulations. The per-employee compliance cost for firms with 20 \nor fewer employees is $7,647. The per-employee compliance cost for \nfirms with 500 or more employees is only $5,282.\n  So the per-employee compliance costs are 45 percent more for our \nsmallest employers than they are for our largest. Congress has \npreviously recognized the necessity of providing small businesses \nrelief from those compliance and monitoring costs, yet a GAO study has \nshown the goal of providing small businesses relief from high \ncompliance monitoring costs is far from fully met. The regulatory \nprovision in this amendment seeks to ensure that goal is finally \nrealized. The need for this type of compliance assistance was \nrecognized by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, the author of \nthis amendment and proponent of this proposal in this Congress as well \nas the last two Congresses. I am pleased to again cosponsor the bill \nauthored by Senator Snowe. The bill continues to enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport from our colleagues, including Senators Kerry and Landrieu. \nThis regulatory amendment will not only have the benefit of decreasing \nadministrative costs for small employers, it also has the further \nbenefit of increasing compliance levels by ensuring that all employers \nknow the rules of the road and the means to comply with them.\n  Through the Banking Committee, on which I also serve, we have been \nable to suggest and get several advisory committees started. Those \nadvisory committees have small businesspeople on them who advise how \ndifferent statutes as well as rules and regulations affect them, and \ntheir input has had considerable impact. This amendment is one of the \ntype things those groups would suggest.\n  When we write Federal regulation, we often make it very complicated \nand it is in a very legalistic form. I helped Senator Sarbanes on the \nSarbanes-Oxley bill. I brought an accounting perspective to that. I was \npleased he listened to it. But one of the factors we missed in that \nlegislation, or you cannot cover in that broad of a bill, is the impact \nof small business versus big business.\n  Again, the advisory committees have said what is needed is a better \nexplanation for small business that they can understand. They do not \nhave the specialists big business has. They can't afford them. \nConsequently, they do not have easy accessible advice on how these \nlegalistic terms actually work. It is the significant difference in \ncost that we are concerned about here.\n  It is a relatively simple amendment, but one that could make a \nsignificant difference. The substitute amendment to the underlying \nbill, as I mentioned, went through the Finance Committee. It did not go \nthrough the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and it did \nnot go through the Banking Committee, so there was no opportunity to \nsuggest this kind of amendment at either of those points. But it is \nsomething the Small Business Committee has worked on a number of times. \nSenator Snowe has been the chairman and is now the ranking member of \nthe Small Business Committee. I hope we will recognize her effort as \nwell as the bipartisan effort coming out of that committee to provide \nthis kind of a change.\n  I think when the week is done, or maybe even less time than that, we \nwill be at a point where there will be both a minimum wage increase and \nsome help for small businesses that will offset the impact and keep the \neconomy moving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, is there an order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). There is no order at this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from Maryland to discuss this \norder of business. I wish to discuss that a little bit.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the Senator will yield, I am prepared to make a \nunanimous consent request that after I complete my comments, Senator \nBingaman will be recognized for 10 minutes, and then the Senator will \nbe recognized for up to 15 minutes, and then Senator Menendez for up to \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How long does the Senator expect to be?\n  Mr. CARDIN. No more than 5 to 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is fine from my perspective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time in support of the \nincrease of the minimum wage to $7.25. I compliment Senator Kennedy for \nhis leadership on this issue. I agree with Senator Enzi that this needs \nto be done in a bipartisan manner, and I am pleased by the way we are \nproceeding in the consideration of the increase in the minimum wage.\n  I would first make the point that increasing the minimum wage will \nhave a positive impact on small business. I agree with the comments \nthat have been made that small business is the economic engine of our \nNation and we need to do everything we can to make it healthier for \nsmall businesses in this country, but increasing the minimum wage will \nhave a positive effect. I say that because when you look at the total \nimpact on payrolls in this country, by increasing the minimum wage to \n$7.25 per hour, it represents about one-fifth of 1 percent of the \nentire payroll of our Nation. It is not going to have a dramatic impact \non the cost of labor. What it does is try to help wage earners in this \ncountry who are suffering.\n  I believe in a liveable wage. I believe we need to do much better \nthan a minimum wage, but you need to increase the minimum wage if we \nare going to be able to get to a liveable wage in this country. We need \nto do something about the disparities among the incomes of wage earners \nof America.\n  We had a hearing in the Budget Committee not long ago. The Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve System talked about the fact that this Nation \namong the industrial nations in the world has the largest disparity \namong wealth in wage earners. We need to do something about that. \nIncreasing the minimum wage will have a positive impact on those \nissues.\n  The fiscal policy group looked at the effect of minimum wage \nincreases of States that have gone above the Federal minimum wage. I \nrepresent one of those States. Maryland has increased its minimum wage \nto $6.15 per hour. The growth rates in the States that have increased \nthe minimum wage are actually higher than those that have the Federal \nminimum wage, a growth rate of 9.4 percent versus a growth rate of 6.6 \npercent.\n  Every time Congress has increased the minimum wage in prior \nCongresses, it has had a positive impact on the overall growth of our \neconomy. When you look at the minimum wage increases, if wage earners \nat the minimum wage had received the same increase in the minimum wage \nthat the CEOs have received over the last 15 years, the minimum wage \nearners in fast food restaurants today would be making over $23 an \nhour.\n  This is an issue that needs to be addressed. Who is affected by it? \nThere are 6.6 million Americans who make the minimum wage. It \ndisproportionately affects women. Although women represent 48 percent \nof the workforce of America, they represent 61 percent of those who are \nat the minimum wage. Over 70 percent of the people receiving minimum \nwage are over 20 years of age, and over one-third are parents--760,000 \nare single moms.\n  I mention that because today, if you work 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a \nweek, and you are a family of 2, you live below the poverty rate. You \nare doing everything right, working 40 hours a week, don't take a day \noff for the entire year, yet you are still below the Federal poverty \nrate.\n  That should not be in America. We can do better than that. Since the \nlast time we increased the minimum wage, the per capita cost of health \ncare has risen by 60 percent, college costs have increased by 51 \npercent for public schools, debts for students graduated from college \nhave more than doubled, credit debt has increased by 46 percent, and we \nhave the lowest effective minimum wage in 50 years. The last time we \nincreased the minimum wage was 10 years ago. I was proud to have voted \nfor that when I was in the other body. It is now time that we follow or \npass what the other body has done and increase the minimum wage to \n$7.25 an hour over a three-stage process. It is the right thing to do.\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\n  It is not only right for our economy, it is not only the right thing \nto do as far as how it affects the individual wage earner in trying to \nbring about some fairness, but it is the right thing to do in regard to \nwhat is correct for our country on civil rights.\n  Let me quote a famous American who said:\n\n       We know of no more critical civil rights issue facing \n     Congress today than the need to increase the Federal minimum \n     wage and extend its coverage.\n\n  That was stated by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., March 18, 1966, when \nthe minimum wage was comparable in purchasing power to what it is today \nwhen Congress finally increased the minimum wage. We should have \nincreased the minimum wage before now. We have the opportunity to do \nthis in this Congress. Now is the time for us to act. Now is the time \nfor us to work in a bipartisan manner as we have on previous increases \nin the minimum wage. I hope my colleagues will work on this bill and \nget it done this week. It is the right thing to do. It will help our \neconomy, and it is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the issue of global warming is more \nand more on the minds of Americans. There is good reason why it is. I \nthink we are familiar now with the litany of adverse consequences that \nis associated with unlimited release of greenhouse gases into the \natmosphere. The scientific reports are warning us about rising sea \nlevels, about dangerous heat waves, about increasingly devastating \nhurricanes and other weather events. There are always uncertainties \nabout understanding the Earth's climate, but one thing is clear: \nUncontrolled release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with no \nreal strategy to reduce those gases is irresponsible and dangerous at \nthis point in our history. It is a great challenge that we face to \nreduce these emissions in this country and countries around the world. \nEven individual States within the United States, and regions of this \ncountry, are leading the way in dealing with this issue.\n\n  The truth is, unless the United States as a whole and the developing \ncountries that have rapidly growing economies find a way to reduce \nemissions, we are likely to see this entire planet covered with a \nblanket of gases that will take centuries to dissipate.\n  In 2005 the Senate passed a resolution setting forth an approach to \ntackling the challenges of climate change. That resolution called for \nadoption of a mandatory, economy-wide program that will slow, stop, and \nthen reverse greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy and \nthat will encourage action by developing nations. Meeting those various \ntests set out in that resolution will require a bipartisan commitment \nto understand the impact of any legislative approach.\n  Today I am joining with my colleague, Senator Specter from \nPennsylvania, in circulating a bipartisan discussion draft on global \nwarming legislation. The choice to release this discussion draft \nreflects our desire to modify or approve that legislation in the coming \nmonths before it is introduced. This is our commitment to create a \nbipartisan process that will focus discussion in a constructive \ndirection.\n  I see three main challenges that we face in this process. First, we \nneed to persuade our colleagues on the program that we have chosen; \nthat is, a cap and trade proposal that incorporates market-based \nmechanisms and funding for technology development. In 2005 over 53 \nMembers of the Senate went on record in support of such a proposal by \ndefending that sense-of-the-Senate resolution and voting for it. We \nneed to continue to expand that number. We need to engage the \nadministration, which has refused to support such measures for reducing \ngreenhouse gases.\n  To begin to meet this first challenge, I would like to call the \nattention of my colleagues to two documents. The first is an analysis \nby the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, or \nEIA. This was in September of last year. I joined with five other \nSenators in submitting a request, a discussion draft to the Energy \nInformation Administration asking them to analyze it. Earlier this \nmonth, they returned with very favorable results, showing that it is \npossible to implement a cap-and-trade proposal that begins to reduce \nthe growth of greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy. The \nEnergy Information Administration of this administration showed that \nthe program has only minor impacts on gross domestic product--a quarter \nof 1 percent by 2030. That is equal to slowing the rate of economic \ngrowth by roughly 1 month over the next 20-plus years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the executive \nsummary of this EIA analysis following the completion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The second document to which I wish to call attention \nis a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In October \nof 2005, Senator Jeffords and I asked CBO to address a debate that has \nbeen occurring in the Senate. Most experts agree that significant cuts \nin fossil fuel use is required if we are to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. But there has been a debate about whether the appropriate \nstrategy was to exclusively fund technology development through tax \nincentives and through Federal programs or, on the contrary, to put a \nprice on carbon by implementing a cap-and-trade proposal. CBO's \nanalysis demonstrated that the most effective policy was a combination \nof these two.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the summary of \nthat CBO report following the completion of my remarks as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the second challenge we face in this \ndebate is to figure out the appropriate way to structure a cap-and-\ntrade program. Putting targets and timetables aside for a moment and \ndetermining the appropriate structure of a cap-and-trade system in \norder that it functions properly will require an enormous amount of \nfocus and attention. For over a year, I have worked in a bipartisan \nmanner with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, to explore \nmany of these issues. In February of last year we released a white \npaper from the Energy Committee entitled, ``Design Elements of a \nMandatory Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Regulatory System.'' That white \npaper laid out four basic questions about the design of the cap-and-\ntrade proposal. I was very encouraged that we received detailed and \nconstructive comments from over 150 major companies, NGOs, and \nindividuals.\n\n  On April 4, 2006, we hosted a day-long workshop with 29 of these \nrespondents talking about their reaction to the white paper. This was \nthe first such discussion in Congress to have taken place. My \ncolleagues can find a transcript of this conference on the U.S. \nGovernment Printing Office Web site. I also ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a joint statement from my colleague, Senator \nDomenici, and myself that summarized the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the third challenge we face in making \nprogress on this issue is getting political consensus on the right \nlevels of control. Here I am talking about the level of stringency and \nthe aggressiveness of the program. There have already been a number of \nbills introduced this year. I commend all my colleagues who dedicated \ntheir time and effort to addressing this issue. First and foremost, of \ncourse, Senators Lieberman and McCain have reintroduced their \nlegislation. These two Senators have been leaders on the issue from the \nbeginning. Also, Senators Sanders and Boxer have reintroduced \nlegislation that Senator Jeffords drafted last year, and I commend them \nfor their leadership and their bold vision. As chairs of the two \ncommittees engage in the debate on global warming issues, I plan to \nwork very closely with Senator Boxer to ensure that everything we do\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\nwill keep momentum on global warming legislation moving forward.\n  I also commend Senators Feinstein and Carper for working together to \nintroduce legislation last week. Senator Feinstein was on our Energy \nCommittee. She is not on that committee in this Congress, and she will \nbe missed. But her leadership in this area is very important.\n  I also would like to acknowledge and congratulate the efforts of the \nU.S. Climate Action Partnership. This is a unique and diverse group of \nindustry and NGOs that have come together to offer principles on global \nwarming legislation and recommendations for that legislation.\n  With all these bills and strategies for reducing greenhouse gases on \nthe table, it is vital that we work together to craft sensible policy \nthat can be enacted sooner rather than later. The science tells us that \naction is needed immediately and that the longer we delay the more \ndifficult the problem will be. I believe the modest impacts that are \nidentified from our proposal, the one Senator Specter and I are \ncirculating, as shown by the Energy Information Administration \nanalysis, will provide a basis to explore somewhat more aggressive \nreduction targets. It is for this reason that we do not want to \nintroduce our bill without first giving great deliberation to different \ntargets and approaches that could gain political consensus in passing \nlegislation.\n  One thing is clear: We cannot delay. For this reason, I hope to \npromote a legislative approach that will reflect a constructive center \nin this often polarized debate.\n  In circulating this discussion draft, Senator Specter and I are \nsetting forth a process. The first step of the process is to invite \nSenate offices to a series of workshops with experts on the issue to \neducate and understand the impacts of the legislation. These sessions \nwill be open to Senate staff. We also, of course, want to invite \nparticipation or observation by representatives from the \nadministration. The first of the workshops will be February 2 in the \nafternoon.\n  We also need to hear from the public and interested stakeholders. In \nthe coming weeks, Senator Specter and I will be outlining a process to \nmeet with stakeholders from industry, labor, environmental groups, and \nothers. We plan to solicit their comments on the legislative text. A \ncopy of the discussion draft and supporting documents will be posted on \nthe Energy Committee Web site--energy.senate.gov. I encourage \ninterested parties to look at that draft and to monitor the Web site \nfor further developments.\n  Madam President, following all of the other items that I have \nmentioned to be printed in the Record, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndiscussion draft that Senator Specter and I are circulating also be \nprinted in the Record following the other documents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 4.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Energy Market and Economic Impacts of a Proposal To Reduce Greenhouse \n        Gas Intensity With a Cap and Trade System, January 2007\n\n (Energy Information Administration, Office of Integrated Analysis and \n        Forecasting, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC)\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       This report responds to a request from Senators Bingaman, \n     Landrieu, Murkowski, Specter, Salazar, and Lugar for an \n     analysis of a proposal that would regulate emissions of \n     greenhouse gases (GHGs) through a national allowance cap-and-\n     trade system. Under this proposal, suppliers of fossil fuel \n     and other covered sources of GHGs would be required to submit \n     government-issued allowances based on the emissions of their \n     respective products. The gases covered in this analysis of \n     the proposal include energy-related carbon dioxide, methane \n     from coal mining, nitrous oxide from nitric acid and adipic \n     acid production, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and \n     sulfur hexafluoride.\n       The program would establish annual emissions caps based on \n     targeted reductions in greenhouse gas intensity, defined as \n     emissions per dollar of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The \n     targeted reduction in GHG intensity would be 2.6 percent \n     annually between 2012 and 2021, then increase to 3.0 percent \n     per year beginning in 2022. To limit its potential cost, the \n     program includes a ``safety-valve'' provision that allows \n     regulated entities to pay a pre-established emissions fee in \n     lieu of submitting an allowance. The safety-valve price is \n     initially set at $7 (in nominal dollars) per metric ton of \n     carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) in 2012 and \n     increases each year by 5 percent over the projected rate of \n     inflation, as measured by the projected increase in the \n     implicit GDP price deflator. In 2004 dollars, the safety \n     valve rises from $5.89 in 2012 to $14.18 in 2030.\n       The proposal calls for initially allocating 90 percent of \n     the allowances for free to various affected groups, but the \n     proportion of allowances to be auctioned grows from 10 \n     percent in 2012 to 38 percent in 2030. The revenue from the \n     auctions and any safety-valve payments are accumulated into a \n     ``Climate Change Trust Fund,'' capped at $50 billion, to \n     provide incentives and pay for research, development, and \n     deployment of technologies to reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions. The U.S. Treasury would retain any revenue \n     collected in excess of the $50-billion limit.\n       As specified in the request for the analysis, EIA \n     considered both a Phased Auction case, which allocates \n     allowances as specified in the proposal, and a Full Auction \n     case, in which all allowances are assumed to be auctioned \n     beginning in 2012. Because they share the same emissions \n     targets and safety valve prices, the energy sector impacts in \n     the Phased and Full Auction cases are very similar. The only \n     areas where the impacts in the two cases differ are for \n     electricity prices and the economic impacts associated with \n     collection and use of revenue from the sale of allowances. \n     Several additional sensitivity cases examine the impacts of \n     higher and lower safety valves and limiting the use of \n     emission reduction credits, or offsets, from noncovered \n     entities. The proposal and its variants were modeled using \n     the National Energy Modeling System and compared to the \n     reference case projections from the Annual Energy Outlook \n     2006 (AEO2006).\n       The analysis presented in this report builds on previous \n     EIA analyses addressing GHG limitation, including earlier EIA \n     reports requested by Senator Bingaman, Senator Salazar, and \n     Senators Inhofe, McCain, and Lieberman. All of the analysis \n     cases incorporate the economic and technology assumptions \n     used in the AEO2006 reference case. While increased \n     expenditures for research and development (R) resulting \n     from the creation of the Climate Change Trust Fund are \n     expected to lead to some technology improvements, a \n     statistically reliable relationship between the level of R \n     spending for specific technologies and the impacts of those \n     expenditures has not been developed. Furthermore, the impact \n     of Federal R is also difficult to assess, because the \n     levels of private sector R expenditures usually are unknown \n     and often far exceed R spending by the Federal Government.\n       However, the recent reports for Senators Bingaman and \n     Salazar include additional sensitivity analyses on the \n     assumptions made regarding the availability of GHG emissions \n     reductions outside the energy sector and the pace of advances \n     in technology used to produce and consume energy. The report \n     for Senators Inhofe, McCain, and Lieberman also examines the \n     economic implications of possible alternative approaches to \n     recycling revenues collected by government under a cap-and-\n     trade program in which significant amounts of government \n     revenue is collected from allowance auctions. Alternative \n     assumptions in these areas can have a major impact on the \n     results obtained, and the insights from those prior \n     sensitivity cases would also be applicable to the proposal \n     analyzed this report. Readers interested in how the results \n     reported below might be affected by different assumptions in \n     these areas are encouraged to review the earlier reports.\n       The modeled impacts of the proposal are summarized below. \n     Reported results apply for the $7 Phased Auction case, unless \n     otherwise stated. Energy and allowance prices are reported in \n     2004 dollars for compatibility with AEO2006. Macroeconomic \n     time series such as GDP and consumption expenditures are \n     reported in 2000 chain-weighted dollars to maintain \n     consistency with standard reports of U.S. economic \n     statistics. Projections of the aggregate value of allowances \n     and auction revenues and fiscal impacts on the budget surplus \n     are reported in nominal dollars, as are deposits relating to \n     the Climate Change Trust Fund.\n\n\n                                Results\n\n     Emissions and Allowance Prices\n       The proposal leads to lower GHG emissions than in the \n     reference case, but the intensity reduction targets are not \n     fully achieved after 2025. Some regulated entities would opt \n     to make safety-valve payments beginning in 2026, the year in \n     which the market value of allowances is projected to reach \n     the safety-valve level (Table ES1). With the higher safety-\n     valve prices in the $9 Phased Auction sensitivity case, the \n     intensity targets are attained through 2029.\n       Relative to the reference case, covered GHG emissions less \n     offsets are 562 MMTCO2e (7.4 percent) lower in \n     2020 and 1,259 MMTCO2e (14.4 percent) lower in \n     2030 in the Phased Auction case. Covered GHG emissions grow \n     by 24 percent between 2004 and 2030, about half the increase \n     in the reference case.\n       In the early years of the program, when allowance prices \n     are relatively low, reductions in GHG emissions outside the \n     energy sector are the predominant source of emissions \n     reductions. In 2020, reductions of GHGs other than energy-\n     related CO2, estimated based on information \n     provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, account for \n     nearly 66 percent of the total reductions. By 2030, however, \n     the higher allowance prices lead to a\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\n     significant shift in energy decisions, particularly in the \n     electricity sector, and the reduction in energy-related \n     CO2 emissions account for almost 58 percent of \n     total GHG emissions reductions.\n       An allowance allocation incentive for carbon sequestration, \n     available only in the Phased Auction case, is projected to \n     result in an additional emissions impact of 296 \n     MMTCO2e in 2020 and 311 MMTCO2e in \n     2030, or about 4 percent of covered emissions.\n       In 2004 dollars, the allowance prices rise from just over \n     $3.70 per metric tons CO2 equivalent in 2012 to \n     the safety valve price of $14.18 metric tons CO2 \n     equivalent in 2030.\n     Energy Markets\n       The cost of GHG allowances is passed through to consumers, \n     raising the price of fossil fuels charged and providing an \n     incentive to lower energy use and shift away from fossil \n     fuels, particularly in the electric power sector.\n       When allowance costs are included, the average delivered \n     price of coal to power plants in 2020 increases from $1.39 \n     per million Btu in the reference case to $2.06, an increase \n     of 48 percent. By 2030 the change grows from $1.51 per \n     million Btu in the reference case to $2.73 per million Btu, \n     an increase of 81 percent.\n       Electricity prices are somewhat lower in the Phased Auction \n     case than in the Full Auction case because the Phased Auction \n     provides a portion of the allowances to the electric power \n     sector for free, a benefit that is passed on to ratepayers \n     where the recipients are subject to cost-of-service \n     regulation. Electricity prices in 2020 are 3.6 and 5.6 \n     percent higher than in the reference case in the Phased and \n     Full Auction cases, respectively. In 2030, electricity prices \n     are 11 and 13 percent above the reference case level. \n     Electricity price impacts are likely to vary across states \n     and regions due to differences in State regulatory regimes \n     and in the fuel mix used for generation in each area.\n       Relative to the reference case, annual per household energy \n     expenditures in 2020 are 2.6 percent ($41) higher in the \n     Phased Auction case and 3.6 percent ($58) higher in the Full \n     Auction case. By 2030, projected annual per household energy \n     expenditures range from 7.0 percent to 8.1 percent ($118 to \n     $136) higher in the two cases. The difference primarily \n     reflects the lower electricity prices in the Phased Auction \n     case.\n       Coal use is projected to continue to grow, but at a much \n     slower rate than in the reference case. Total energy from \n     coal increases by 23 percent between 2004 and 2030, less than \n     half the 53-percent increase projected in the reference case \n     over the same time period.\n       The proposal significantly boosts nuclear capacity \n     additions and generation. The projected 47-gigawatt increase \n     in nuclear capacity between 2004 and 2030 allows nuclear to \n     continue to provide about 20 percent of the Nation's \n     electricity in 2030. In the reference case, nuclear capacity \n     increases by only 9 gigawatts between 2005 and 2030.\n       The proposal also adds significantly to renewable \n     generation. In the reference case, renewable generation is \n     projected to increase from 358 billion kilowatt hours in 2004 \n     to 559 billion kilowatt hours in 2030. In the Phased Auction \n     case, renewable generation increases to 572 billion kilowatt \n     hours by 2020 and 823 billion kilowatt hours by 2030. Most of \n     the increase in renewable generation is expected to be from \n     non-hydroelectric renewable generators, mainly biomass and \n     wind.\n       Retail gasoline prices in 2030 are $0.11 per gallon higher \n     in 2030 compared to the AE02006 reference case, leading to \n     modest changes in vehicle purchase and travel decisions. The \n     transportation sector provides only a small amount of \n     emissions reduction.\n     Economy\n       While the Phased Auction and Full Auction cases have \n     similar energy market impacts, the macroeconomic impacts of \n     the two cases differ because of differences in the revenue \n     flows associated with emission allowances.\n       In the Phased Auction case, the $50-billion cap (nominal \n     dollars) on the maximum cumulative deposits to the Climate \n     Change Trust Fund is reached in 2017, and all subsequent \n     revenues from allowance sales or safety valve payments go to \n     the U.S. Treasury. This leads to a $59-billion reduction in \n     the Federal deficit by 2030. However, in the Full Auction \n     case, the revenues flowing to the government are much larger, \n     resulting in a $200-billion reduction in the Federal deficit \n     in 2030.\n       In the Phased Auction case, wholesale energy prices rise \n     steadily and, by 2030, are approximately 12 percent above the \n     reference case levels (after inflation). This translates into \n     8-percent higher energy prices at the consumer level by 2030 \n     and a 1-percent increase in the All-Urban Consumer Price \n     Index (CPI) above the reference case level.\n       In the Phased Auction case, discounted total GDP (in 2000 \n     dollars) over the 2009-2030 time period is $232 billion (0.10 \n     percent) lower than in the reference case, while discounted \n     real consumer spending is $236 billion (0.14 percent) lower. \n     In 2030, in the Phased Auction case, real GDP is projected to \n     be $59 billion (0.26 percent) lower than in the reference \n     case, while aggregate consumption expenditures, which relate \n     more directly to impacts on consumers, are $55 billion (0.36 \n     percent) lower. The reductions in GDP and consumption \n     reflect the rise in energy prices and the resulting \n     decline in personal disposable income.\n       While higher energy costs and lower consumption \n     expenditures tend to discourage investment, many provisions \n     of the bill help to support investment activity. The value of \n     allowances allocated to States is substantial, and some \n     portion of the allowance revenue would likely result in \n     increased investment. In addition, the portion of the \n     allowance allocated to the private sector generates funds \n     which would help spur private investment in energy saving \n     technologies.\n\n

spending is $483 billion (0.29 percent) lower. \n     In 2030, projected real GDP in the Full Auction case is $94 \n     billion (0.41 percent) lower than in the reference case, \n     while aggregate consumption is $106 billion (0.69 percent) \n     lower, almost twice the estimated consumption loss in the \n     Phased Auction case. These results reflect the substantially \n     higher level of auction revenues under the Full Auction case, \n     which, by assumption, are not re-circulated into the economy \n     beyond the $50 billion in expenditures from the Climate \n     Change Trust Fund. Because these estimated impacts could \n     change significantly under alternative revenue recycling \n     assumptions, these results do not imply a general conclusion \n     that a Phased Auction will necessarily result in lesser \n     impacts on GDP and consumption than a Full Auction.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n A CBO Paper, September 2006: Evaluating the Role of Prices and R in \n                   Reducing Carbon Dioxide Emissions\n\n\n                        Summary and Introduction\n\n       Several important human activities--most notably the \n     worldwide burning of coal, oil, and natural gas--are \n     gradually increasing the concentrations of carbon dioxide and \n     other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and, in the view of \n     many climate scientists, are gradually warming the global \n     climate. That warming, and any long-term damage that might \n     result from it, could be reduced by restraining the growth of \n     greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately limiting them to a \n     level that stabilized atmospheric concentrations.\n       The magnitude of warming and the damages that might result \n     are highly uncertain, in part because they depend on the \n     amount of emissions that will occur both now and in the \n     future, how the global climate system will respond to rising \n     concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and how \n     changes in climate will affect the health of human and \n     natural systems. The costs of restraining emissions are also \n     highly uncertain, in part because they will depend on the \n     development of new technologies. From an economic point of \n     view, the challenge to policymakers is to implement policies \n     that balance the uncertain costs of restraining emissions \n     against the benefits of avoiding uncertain damages from \n     global warming or that minimize the cost of achieving a \n     target level of concentrations or level of annual emissions.\n       Researchers have studied the relative efficacy--as well as \n     the appropriate timing--of various policies that might \n     discourage emissions of carbon dioxide (referred to as carbon \n     emissions in the rest of this paper), which makes up the vast \n     majority of greenhouse gases, and restrain the growth of its \n     atmospheric concentration. This paper presents qualitative \n     findings from that research, which are largely dependent of \n     any particular estimate of the costs or benefits of reducing \n     emissions. The paper's conclusions are summarized below.\n     Policies for reducing carbon emissions\n       The possibility of climate change involves two distinct \n     ``market failures'' that prevent unregulated markets from \n     achieving the appropriate balance between fossil fuel use and \n     changes in the climate. One market failure involves the \n     external effects of emissions from the combustion of fossil \n     fuels--that is, the costs that are imposed on society by the \n     use of fossil fuels but that are not reflected in the prices \n     paid for them. The other market failure is a general \n     underinvestment in research and development (R) that occurs \n     because investments in innovation may yield ``spillover'' \n     benefits to society that do not translate into profits for \n     the innovating firm. The first market failure yields \n     inefficiently high use of fossil fuels; the second yields \n     inefficiently low R\n       Because there are two separate market failures, an \n     efficient response is likely to involve two separate types of \n     policies:\n       One type of policy would reduce carbon emissions by \n     increasing the costs of emitting carbon, both in the near \n     term and in the future, to reflect the damages that those \n     emissions are expected to cause.\n       The other type of policy would increase federal support for \n     R on various technologies that could help restrain the \n     growth of carbon emissions and would create spillover \n     benefits.\n       Policymakers could increase the cost of emitting carbon by \n     setting a price on those emissions. That could be \n     accomplished by taxing fossil fuels in proportion to \n     their carbon content (which is released when the fuels are \n     burned) or by establishing a ``cap-and-trade'' program \n     under which policymakers would set an overall cap on \n     emissions but allow fossil fuel suppliers to trade rights \n     (called allowances) to those limited emissions. Either a \n     tax or a cap-and-trade program would cause the prices of \n     goods and services to rise to reflect the amount of carbon \n     emitted as a result of their consumption. To the extent \n     that a carbon tax or allowance price reflected the present \n     value of expected damages, such policies would encourage \n     users of fossil fuels to account for the costs they impose \n     on others through their emissions of greenhouse gases.\n       Researchers generally conclude that the appropriate price \n     for carbon would be relatively low in the near term but would \n     rise substantially over time, resulting in relatively modest \n     reductions in emissions in the near term followed by larger \n     reductions in the future. Phasing in price increases would \n     allow firms to gradually replace their stock of physical \n     capital associated with energy use and to gain experience in \n     using new technologies that emit less carbon. Firms would \n     have an incentive to invest in developing new technologies on \n     the basis of their expectations about future prices for \n     emissions.\n       Federal support could be provided for the research and \n     development of technologies that would lead to lower \n     emissions. Such technologies could include improvements in \n     energy efficiency; advances in low- or zero emissions \n     technologies (such as nuclear, wind, or solar power); and \n     development of sequestration technologies, which capture and \n     store carbon for long periods. Federal support would probably \n     be most cost-effective if it went toward basic research on \n     technologies that are in the early stages of development. \n     Such research is more likely to be underfunded in the absence \n     of government support because it is more likely to create \n     knowledge that is beneficial to other firms but that does not \n     generate profits for the firm conducting the research.\n     The interaction and timing of policies\n       Pricing and R policies are neither mutually exclusive nor \n     entirely independent--both could be implemented \n     simultaneously, and each would tend to enhance the other. \n     Pricing policies would tend to encourage the use of existing \n     carbon-reducing technologies as well as provide incentives \n     for firms to develop new ones; federal funding of R would \n     augment private efforts; and successful R investments would \n     reduce the price required to achieve a given level of \n     reductions in emissions.\n       Neither policy alone is likely to be as effective as a \n     strategy involving both policies. Relying exclusively on R \n     funding in the near term, for example, does not appear likely \n     to be consistent with the goal of balancing costs and \n     benefits or the goal of minimizing the costs of meeting an \n     emissions reduction target. At any point in time, there is a \n     cost continuum for emissions reductions, ranging from low-\n     cost to high-cost opportunities. Unless R efforts virtually \n     eliminated the value of near-term reductions in emissions (an \n     outcome that appears unlikely given reasonable assumptions \n     about the payoff of R efforts), waiting to begin initial \n     pricing (to encourage low-cost reductions) would increase the \n     overall cost of reducing emissions in the long run.\n       Near-term reductions in emissions achieved with existing \n     technologies could be valuable even if fundamentally new \n     energy technologies would be needed to prevent the buildup of \n     greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from reaching a point that \n     triggered a rapid increase in damages. Near-term reductions \n     could take advantage of low-cost opportunities to avoid \n     adding to the stock of gases in the atmosphere and could \n     allow additional time for new technologies to be developed \n     and put in place. That additional time could prove quite \n     valuable, given that R efforts are highly uncertain and \n     that the process of putting new energy systems in place could \n     be slow and costly.\n       Determining the appropriate mix of policies to address \n     climate change is complicated by the fact that future \n     policies would be layered on a complex mix of current and \n     past policies, all of which affect today's use of fossil \n     fuels and their alternatives as well as the amount of R \n     The analyses reviewed in this paper typically do not account \n     for existing policies or for the administrative costs of \n     implementing a carbon-pricing program or of initiating a \n     larger (and perhaps redesigned) R program for carbon-\n     reducing technologies. However, the qualitative conclusion \n     reached in those analyses--that costs would be minimized \n     by a combination of gradually increasing emissions prices \n     coupled with subsidies for R not likely to be \n     affected by such considerations.\n     A global concern\n       The causes and consequences of climate change are global, \n     and reductions in U.S. emissions alone would be unlikely to \n     have a significant impact. Cost-effective mitigation policies \n     would require coordinated international efforts and would \n     involve overcoming institutional barriers to the diffusion of \n     new technologies in developing countries, such as India and \n     China. If a domestic carbon-pricing program significantly \n     increased the prices of U.S.produced goods--and was not \n     matched by efforts to reduce emissions in other countries--it \n     could cause carbon-intensive industries to relocate to \n     countries without similar restrictions, diminishing the \n     environmental benefits of a domestic program.\n       However, successful domestic R efforts, whether funded by \n     the public or private sector, could lower the costs of \n     reducing carbon emissions in other countries as well as \n     within the United States. Some new technologies, such as \n     those that yielded improvements in energy efficiency, might \n     be deployed without additional incentives. Other innovations, \n     such as sequestration technologies or alternative energy \n     technologies that reduce carbon emissions but cost more than \n     their fossil-fuel-based alternatives, would be unlikely to be \n     deployed without financial incentives to reduce carbon \n     emission.\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n    chairman and ranking member statement: climate change conference\n\n       On April 4, 2006, the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources held a conference to discuss critical \n     issues involved in the design of a mandatory greenhouse gas \n     (GHG) program. More than 300 people attended the event and \n     over 160 organizations and individuals submitted detailed \n     written comments.\n       Although the issue of climate change continues to elicit a \n     diverse array of opinions, we are encouraged that a number of \n     general themes are emerging that could form the basis of \n     eventual solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n       The following discussion reflects our perception of key \n     areas where there appears to be a narrowing of disagreement \n     and in some cases an emerging consensus. Of course it is not \n     our intent to imply that there is now or will ever be an \n     absolute unanimity of opinion on issues related to climate \n     change, especially on a greenhouse gas regulatory mechanism. \n     Nevertheless, we remain committed to exploring the \n     development of solutions consistent with the requirements set \n     forth in the June 22, 2005, Sense of the Senate Resolution. \n     We continue to work together with our colleagues on the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and throughout the \n     Senate to fashion reasonable policy solutions to the key \n     issues identified at the April 4, 2006, Workshop and look \n     forward to ongoing input and engagement from interested \n     stakeholders.\n\n\n       conceptual direction for reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n\n       In both the written submissions and comments at the \n     workshop, many participants and respondents expressed the \n     view that the risks associated with a changing climate \n     justified the adoption of mandatory limits on greenhouse gas \n     emissions. While opinions varied on the stringency of initial \n     limits, there was support for the notion that a program \n     should begin modestly and strengthen gradually over time. \n     Consistent with the success of the acid rain program and \n     other market-based approaches, most participants supported a \n     market-based approach that would set a ``forward price'' on \n     greenhouse gas emissions in order to provide both the \n     flexibility and incentive needed to accelerate technology \n     development and deployment.\n       Most participants recognized that if the price signal \n     initially imposed under a domestic regime is modest, it is \n     unlikely to be strong enough to motivate the development and \n     deployment of the key technologies that will ultimately be \n     needed to eventually eliminate GHG emissions. In order to \n     speed technology deployment, there was general agreement that \n     some portion of the proceeds of a permit auction should be \n     used to enhance current technology incentives. Again there \n     was disagreement about the appropriate size of a permit \n     auction and the means of directing these resources toward \n     technology innovation. Ultimately, we perceive agreement \n     that a GHG policy should provide a combination of a market \n     signal and increased incentives for technology innovation.\n       In addition to general support for the overall goals of the \n     Sense of the Senate Resolution, we are encouraged by the \n     similarity of views with respect to several of the key \n     questions raised in the White Paper:\n       Economy-wide approach: A threshold decision in designing a \n     mandatory GHG emission reduction program is whether the \n     program should address GHG's on an economy-wide basis or \n     whether the program should focus on the GHG emissions of just \n     one or more sectors of the economy. In general, there was \n     agreement on the need for economy-wide action to address the \n     wide diversity of sources of GHG's. Many participants argued \n     that an economy-wide program is the most equitable and \n     efficient approach.\n       Upstream or hybrid point of regulation: Most participants \n     supported either an entirely upstream or a hybrid approach \n     for point of regulation. In an ``upstream'' regulatory \n     approach, the point of regulation is placed closer to energy \n     producers and suppliers than to end-use consumers. \n     Specifically, a requirement to acquire permits or allowances \n     for emissions associated with fossil fuel use might apply to \n     coal mining companies, petroleum refiners, and natural gas \n     shippers, processors or pipelines rather than to the \n     ``smokestack'' entities (e.g., electric utilities, large \n     industrial plants). Under a ``hybrid'' approach, major \n     stationary sources that burn coal would be regulated at the \n     point of combustion, while natural gas and petroleum related \n     emissions would be addressed upstream (at refineries for \n     petroleum and at either shippers, processors, or pipelines \n     for natural gas). Regulating the carbon content of fuels at \n     the point in which energy enters the economy was described by \n     many as providing the most complete coverage through the most \n     manageable regulatory approach. However, several participants \n     noted that the efficiency of an upstream program would not be \n     diminished if only major stationary sources were carved out \n     for regulation at the source of combustion. They note that \n     these sources are limited in number and already have the \n     monitoring and knowledge in place necessary to implement such \n     requirements due to participation in the acid rain program.\n       Offsets and set-asides: There was general agreement about \n     the benefits of emission reduction projects at sources \n     outside of a cap on GHG emissions. However, there was some \n     disagreement about how to ensure the environmental integrity \n     of these types of projects. Some panelists argued that \n     offsets could provide low-cost emission reductions and could \n     create incentives for new technologies and approaches. In \n     particular, a few panelists specifically mentioned the \n     potential for offset opportunities in the agricultural \n     sector. Others noted that offsets could dilute the \n     environmental benefit of a mandatory program unless they are \n     accompanied by rigorous and standardized baseline and \n     measurement protocols. An additional option would be to \n     dedicate a percentage of allowances from within a program's \n     overall allowance allocation for offset activities that are \n     less easily verified.\n       Links to other trading programs: Ultimately, GHG emissions \n     cannot be reduced absent an effort that includes meaningful \n     participation from all nations with significant GHG \n     emissions. An emission reduction program in the U.S. could be \n     designed to leave open the possibility of trading with GHG \n     systems in other countries. Most panelists at the conference \n     agreed that linking to other domestic emissions trading \n     programs is theoretically more efficient. However, a few \n     panelists also noted that differences in the design of \n     domestic trading programs (e.g., different target levels, \n     different monitoring and verification systems) may complicate \n     linking programs and make it politically difficult in the \n     near-term.\n       Developing country action: Many participants agreed that an \n     important component of a U.S. GHG program should encourage \n     major trading partners and large emitters of GHG's to take \n     actions that are comparable to those taken by the U.S. \n     Panelists noted that ultimately, action by major developing \n     countries like China and India is critical to address climate \n     change. There was also discussion of the competitive \n     implications if the U.S. takes action to address climate \n     change and other major trading partners do not. Not all, but \n     many panelists said that the U.S. should not wait for \n     developing countries to act. Rather, the U.S. should take a \n     cautious first step toward mandatory action with additional \n     action conditioned on an evaluation of the efforts of major \n     developing country emitters. There was debate about how to \n     measure progress when different countries have different \n     national circumstances. There was also discussion about the \n     best process for evaluating the actions of developing \n     countries and about how much discretion there should be in \n     this process.\n       Allowance distribution: Multiple views were expressed at \n     the conference on the best approach to allowance \n     distribution. However, a significant number of panelists \n     emphasized that not all allowances need be distributed for \n     free at the point of regulation. For example, several \n     panelists endorsed the concept of using cost burden as a \n     principle for allocation. In other words, even if a sector is \n     not at the point of regulation, it still might receive some \n     allowances to mitigate the cost impacts of a mandatory \n     program. In addition, some panelists argued for the benefits \n     of allowance auctions. According to this view, auctions can \n     level the playing field for new facilities, and can create an \n     incentive for lower-carbon technology. Auctions may also \n     avoid the need for complex allocation rules that might result \n     in unintended competitive advantages, including windfall \n     profits, for certain market participants. On the other hand, \n     some panelists noted the political difficulties of an auction \n     approach and suggested a gradual transition to an auction. \n     Finally, the discussion on allowance distribution highlighted \n     the diverse economic, regulatory, social, and political \n     considerations associated with this issue. There were a \n     number of creative suggestions at the conference on how to \n     accommodate these different considerations.\n       Based on the discussion at the conference, we believe the \n     following principles for allocation are emerging;\n       Allowances should be allocated in a manner that recognizes \n     and roughly addresses the disparate costs imposed by the \n     program.\n       Allowances should not be allocated solely to regulated \n     entities because such entities do not solely bear the costs \n     of the emissions trading program.\n       A portion of the allowances should be auctioned (or used \n     for ``set-aside'' programs), with revenues used to advance \n     climate-related policy goals and other public purposes.\n       Over time, an allowance distribution approach should \n     transition from approaches that attempt to fairly compensate \n     sectors for past investments in carbon intensive technologies \n     to approaches that create incentives for energy efficiency \n     and lower carbon technologies. In practice, this means a \n     gradual transition over an extended period of time from a \n     largely free allocation of allowances to the use of an \n     auction as the predominant method for distribution of \n     allowances.\n\n\n                               Next Steps\n\n       The Committee intends to continue soliciting comments on \n     the major points that have been summarized from the \n     conference and on the emerging allowance allocation \n     principles that have been described. The Committee recognizes \n     that any proposals for a mandatory GHG program will deserve \n     further input from affected stakeholders and Members of \n     Congress. We encourage stakeholders and congressional offices \n     to provide the Committee with ideas and suggestions for \n     expanding general findings to the next level of specificity. \n     Please contact John Peschke or Jonathan Black if you have \n     further thoughts or input.\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                 S. __\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 106, 107, and 108 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to share a few thoughts \nin the form of an overview of our wage situation in the United States \nand to discuss some things that I think we can do to improve that \nsituation. I would agree that wages are too low for middle-class and \nlower income workers. They have not kept pace with business profits or \nwith CEO salaries, for example. They have fallen behind. They have \nfallen behind the profits and bonuses and things of that nature. I \nbelieve it is a serious problem. I know the experts tell us--and there \nis some truth to the fact--that salary increases tend to lag behind \nbusiness growth and profits. As the profits go up, the first year the \nbonuses and the salaries don't keep up with it, but they argue that as \ntime goes by, they do make a rise, and we should, therefore, remember \nthat.\n  There is some historical truth to that argument, there is no doubt \nabout it. But, frankly, it doesn't satisfy me at this point of the \nissue. It is particularly so to me because the unemployment in our \ncountry has been falling and is still so low. I think it is 4.5 percent \nnationally. It was recently 3.2 percent in my home State of Alabama--\nthe lowest we have ever had. I am excited about that. Why aren't wages, \nthen, for our lower skilled people, our poorer people, our young \npeople, our minority workers--why aren't those wages beginning to \nincrease in a noticeable way? Why aren't they keeping pace, and what \ncan we do about it?\n  Senator Kennedy's theory and his argument is pretty clear and simple, \nas his normally are--and direct. He argues that we should have the \nGovernment fix it. Just have the Government set the wage. That is an \neasy answer. Have wage and price controls. Well, at least wage \ncontrols. Set it. Just have the Government order this, dictate it, and \nwe will just make it go that way.\n  I will admit that we have had minimum wage laws for quite some time, \nand although in pure theory they are outside the free market agenda \nthat I usually follow, I have voted for minimum wage increases a number \nof times. That is just a part of the way we do things here, and the way \nwe have done them for quite a number of years. I would hope maybe to \nvote for this bill.\n  But let's talk about it more seriously. What we want is higher wages \nfor all Americans. I think a better approach to achieving that in the \nlong run is to examine our policies to see why market forces are not \ndriving up wages. What is the problem? Are there some political, \ngovernmental structures at work that are causing wages not to increase \nsufficiently? There is one issue that is suppressing wages that I am \nabsolutely confident is unfair, and I believe undisputed and \nundeniable. No, it is not that some free market purists don't want \nwages to go up. That is not my problem. I think the problem is this: \nThe problem is an excessive flow of low-skilled immigrant workers into \nour country in such large numbers that it has stultified and eliminated \nthe growth that would have occurred for low-skilled American workers. I \nwish that weren't so, but I believe the numbers are quite clear on it. \nIn any number of different ways we can see that this has occurred.\n  So I will be offering an amendment as part of this bill, one that \ndeals with workplace enforcement and what we can do to make the \nworkplace such that American workers are not competing with low-\nskilled, illegal immigrants in the workforce. We are receiving 1 \nmillion immigrants legally in our country today and more than half that \nmany coming in illegally every year. So the competition American \nworkers face from illegal laborers is a serious problem that affects \ntheir wages.\n  If you bring in a huge amount of wheat, you bring a huge amount of \ncotton, you bring in a huge amount of corn, you can expect those prices \nto fall. If you bring in exceedingly large amounts of low-skilled \nlabor, you can expect the wages of low-skilled Americans to follow. I \ndon't know where our free marketeers are on that, but I can tell you \nthat is a fact. It is working against the interests of American \nworkers.\n\n  Professor Borjas at Harvard, who has written perhaps the most \nauthoritative book on immigration--himself an immigrant--has concluded \nthat he believes the wages of the lowest-skilled American workers, high \nschool dropouts, have been impacted negatively by 8 percent as a result \nof our current immigration policies.\n  I will share with our colleagues an article from the Wall Street \nJournal, this journal of free market economics, which I venerate and \nrespect so much. I will not go into the detail today, but I will share \nbriefly the gist of that front-page article from the last week or 10 \ndays.\n  The article featured a chicken plant in Georgia. A large number of \nthose workers were found to be illegal. They lost their jobs. According \nto the Wall Street Journal, the businesses got together and started \nrunning ads in the paper offering better than a $1-an-hour increase \nover the wages they had been paid. They offered transportation from \nnearby towns for people who would take the jobs. They said people could \nlive onsite in dormitories and work there. What does that say? That was \n$1 an hour-plus per worker wage increase without governmental \nintervention. In fact, it was governmental action to enforce the \nestablished laws of our country with regard to immigration.\n  I suggest ending illegal immigration, creating workplace enforcement \nthat actually works, limiting the number of people who come to our \ncountry illegally, emphasizing higher skilled workers. Frankly, if it \nis impacting adversely our low-skilled workers' salaries, maybe we are \nbringing in too many low-skilled workers.\n  Education is a factor for immigration, whether a person would speak \nEnglish and basically follow the Canadian model of a system which \nfocuses on what is in Canada's best interests. Likewise, we should do \nthat in the United States. We should also consider what the Labor \nDepartment says is needed in our country.\n  I have another proposal that I will shock my colleagues with. We \ncould give the average low-to-middle income worker, a family man or \nwoman, almost a $1-an-hour raise without any increase in taxes. How \nwould we do that? In the way we administer the earned-income tax \ncredit. The earned-income tax credit was passed many years ago. \nPresident Nixon was involved in it, Milton Friedman supported it. It \nwas supposed to be an incentive to Americans to work and not be on \nwelfare; to go out and work and to give benefits to people who were \nworking as opposed to people who were not working. It made a lot of \nsense. It was supposed to incentivize work.\n  I am not sure how well it works. It has been criticized. But it has \nno possibility of achieving its primary goal, which was to incentivize \nwork, the way it is presently being administered. The way it is \nadministered now, a worker who falls in the category of earned-income \ntax credit, files his income tax return next April, May or March, \nwhenever he gets his papers together, and gets an average of a $1,700 \ntax credit from the U.S. Treasury. I submit that worker does not \nunderstand or have any real comprehension of the fact that the tax \ncredit incentivizes work. It is not connected to his work.\n  We ought to reconnect the earned-income tax credit to the workplace. \nThe\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nway we do that is the way it is now authorized under law--it can be \ndone this way, but it is not being done this way--and that is to put it \non the paycheck. And $1,700 per year is a $1-an-hour increase in the \ntake-home pay of low-wage workers in America. They could take that \nmoney home every week with their paycheck, they could appreciate their \njobs much better and they could be more prideful of that paycheck they \ntake home and have more incentive to continue to work.\n  To me, that is something we should have done a long time ago. I have \ntalked about it for quite a number years. We have not made a serious \nadvancement toward accomplishing it. Some think it could cause more \nfraud, but I don't think it would. Some think it would cause more \npeople to take advantage of the earned income tax credit because some \npeople probably don't ask for it on the tax returns, but I don't think \nthat is particularly a noble thing to say, that a person who is \nentitled to it, you hope they don't apply and get it because it would \ncost the Treasury some dollars. We would be better off to put that in \nthe paycheck. I would like to see us do that. We need to move in that \ndirection.\n  Finally, one of the great tragedies we are facing as a nation is that \nwe are not saving enough. We need to do a better job of increasing \nsavings in America. I prepared legislation, creating Plus Accounts, \nthat would be a lifetime universal savings plan for every American \nworker, similar to the Federal Thrift Savings Plan for Federal \nemployees.\n  On top of Social Security--not taking money from Social Security but \non top of it as an individual plan--an account that individual \nAmericans would own. It would be within their grasp.\n  Half of the American workers work at a company that does not have a \nsavings plan. Of the half that do, 17 million choose not to \nparticipate. One more startling statistic, very startling in light of \ntoday's volatile labor market. By the age of 35, the average American \nworker has held nine jobs.\n  I sat by a gentleman on the plane yesterday. He was 37. He now has a \njob with the U.S. Civil Service. He is so happy about signing up for \nthe Thrift Plan. I asked him about his previous savings. He had two \nchildren, 37 years old. He said, I didn't save much. He had had nine \njobs himself. A lot of companies do not have a savings plan. For those \nthat do, maybe you have to work 2 years or a year before you can \nparticipate. If you did participate and you change jobs, maybe it is \nonly $500; maybe it is $1,000 or $1,500. And when you change jobs, they \ncash it in and pay the penalty, figuring it will not amount to much.\n\n  But if every American at every paycheck could know that a small \npercentage of that money was going into an account with their name on \nit, they would be subject to the magical powers of compound interest \nand that at age 65 they could have a very substantial nest egg to \nsupplement their Social Security, they would feel better about their \nwork. My plan would say you are given a number at birth. The Government \nwould open the account with a deposit at birth for every child. And \nevery job a person takes, the employee would put in 1 percent, the \nemployer would put in 1 percent at a low-fee managed fund that would \nallow for conservative investments. If you put in $1,000 at birth, if \nyou went to work and your employer put in 1 percent and you put in 3 \npercent at median income in America, $46,000 a year for a family, that \nperson would retire with half a million in the bank. We have to create \na system so it is easy for working Americans, low-income people who are \nchanging jobs regularly, who find themselves with two or three kids at \nage 35 with nothing saved. That is an American tragedy when they could, \nliterally, easily retire with half a million in their own name, in \ntheir own account.\n  These are some things we ought to talk about. Yes, I look forward to \na bill that Senator Enzi approves--if he approves it, I probably will. \nIf he approves this bill, I will vote for it. But fundamentally we have \nmore to do for low-income workers in America who are not keeping pace, \nin my view, at the rate we would like to see.\n  We should create an immigration system that does not subject them to \nfloods of imports. Let's create a savings system they can be proud of \nand adjust our earned-income tax credit so they can get a $1-an-hour \npay raise. If we do some of those things, we will be touching a lot of \npeople in a very special way.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the purposes of offering my amendments, \nthe pending amendment be set aside and I be allowed to offer three \namendments, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \ncalling for something that is long overdue for millions of workers \nacross this Nation, an increase in the minimum wage. Today is not our \nfirst day to make this call, but it is time, finally, to answer the \nvoices that have cried out for change for too long. Nearly a decade \nafter the last increase in the Federal minimum wage, this Senate has a \nchance to right the injustice that millions of workers and their \nfamilies have endured.\n  America's minimum wage workers are often not in the forefront of our \nworkforce. They may be in the stockrooms, the kitchens or on the night \ncleaning crew. By increasing the Federal minimum wage, we will be \nsaying that working in the shadows does not mean a life sentence to \npoverty.\n  For far too long, we have allowed a subpar minimum wage to exist that \nleaves a minimum wage worker supporting a family of three at $6,000 \nbelow the poverty level. You get up every day, you work hard, you work \n40 hours a week, some of the toughest jobs in America and, at the end, \nyou are still below the poverty level. We are supposed to reward work \nas a value, not suppress it. We say we want work, not welfare. Yet we \nhave people who get up every day, work some of the toughest jobs and \nstill find themselves below the poverty level.\n  Those earning minimum wage do some of the toughest jobs our Nation \nhas, and they perform some of the key services we cannot do without, \nfrom food preparers, to health care, support staff, to security \nofficers, to cashiers. These occupations are the backbone of businesses \nand industries that keep our economy running. While we depend on these \nservices they provide every day, many of these workers are earning a \nwage that is now at its lowest point ever, compared to average hourly \nwages.\n  A higher wage is much more than about putting a few more dollars in \nyour pocket each week. A better wage is about fairness, about providing \na decent standard of living, and giving workers what they deserve, and \nensuring that everyone--everyone--can share in the American dream, not \njust the top wage earners.\n  When a minimum wage earner is more likely to be a woman or a \nminority, we cannot deny that increasing the minimum wage is also about \ngreater equality and justice to nearly 7 million women, who are well \nover half of the minimum wage workers, or to the 4 million Hispanics \nand African Americans earning less than $7.25 an hour.\n  So we can look at the chart and see that as the progression goes \ndown, all of those women's wages lag behind men. And then, when we look \nat African-American women, Hispanic women, they lag even lower. This is \nabout creating equity, equality. It is about justice.\n  Our Nation has always been a place where people willing to work hard \nand play by the rules can earn a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. My parents, who came to this country in search of freedom, \nwere willing to do whatever work was necessary for a little piece of \nthe American dream. Whether it was long hours bent over a sewing \nmachine in a factory or working in a cramped carpentry shop, they did \nwhatever they could to provide me the opportunities they never had.\n  That chance to build a better life through one's labor and \ndetermination is something no one in this country should be denied. \nYet, for nearly a decade, workers earning the minimum wage have been \nstruggling to get by, struggling to provide what their families need, \nand struggling to realize the dream our country promises.\n  It is our duty to ensure everyone in this country can share in that \ndream. When we as a nation turn a blind eye, when we ignore the fact \nthat millions of workers are earning wages that have been frozen for \nnearly a decade--how much else of our economy has been frozen for \nnearly a decade--we are failing those seeking out this dream. And \nbecause most minimum-wage workers have children and families to \nsupport, it is not just the workers who are struggling to make ends \nmeet or fulfill their dreams, but behind them are families who cannot \nafford health insurance, or children who are growing up in poverty--\nchildren growing up in poverty to parents who are working hard, in the \ntoughest jobs in America, 40 hours a week, making the minimum wage, \nbelow the poverty level. So lifting up the wages of these workers is as \nmuch about improving the lives of their family members and providing a \nbrighter future for their children.\n  This week we have a chance to change the course, not just for the \nworkers still earning $5.15 an hour and their family members, but for \nthe country. We will say it is no longer acceptable to leave behind \nthose who may be at the bottom, that they should be as much a priority \nas any other worker who contributes to our Nation's economy.\n  I am extremely proud that New Jersey has not waited for Congress to \ndo what is right. Instead, it has taken upon itself to increase the \nState minimum wage far above the Federal wage. And New Jersey is not \nalone. Twenty-nine other States have raised their minimum wages above \nthe Federal minimum wage. Now at $7.15 an hour, New Jersey's minimum \nwage has given over a quarter million workers the chance to build a \nbetter life.\n  It is past time for Congress to act and give millions of other \nminimum wage workers across the country that chance. It is time to \nprovide them what they have been waiting almost 10 long years for--the \nchance to earn a wage they deserve and to live with greater dignity. It \nis time to let them know Washington will no longer turn a deaf ear to \ntheir struggles.\n  I listen to some of our colleagues sometimes, and it is amazing. \nCongress has raised its salary more than $31,000 over the same time \nperiod in which many Members have voted against raising the minimum \nwage. It is interesting; we can vote to increase the wages of Members \nof Congress and the minimum wage workers get nothing. I am sure there \nare Members who would say it was well worth it, of course. But what \nabout minimum wage workers? Nothing for nearly a decade. Congress \nraises its salary $31,000.\n  Now, interestingly enough, no one said: Well, we need to give a tax \nbreak in order to give the Members of Congress a raise. No one said, \ncertainly, while they were voting for these increases, they did not \ndeserve it. Yet families across this country are struggling in some of \nthe toughest jobs in America. They could not get the same type of \nsupport for their struggles. It is simply wrong.\n  Now is our chance to correct that injustice, but I hope it is only \nthe first step. We can never, ever again allow the hardest workers in \nour country to see their wages eroded by 10 years of inflation while \nthose at the top of the pile make more and more but give less and less \nback.\n  I hope the Senate will pass this overdue increase in the minimum \nwage. I hope we do not have to give away the store in order to be able \nto get some of those who are working at some of the toughest jobs, \nfinding themselves below the poverty level--struggling to have families \nbe nurtured to achieve their dreams and hopes and aspirations--I hope \nwe do not have to give away the store. I hope we do not see another \nincrease in Congress before we see an increase in the minimum wage. \nTherefore, when we pass this overdue increase in the minimum wage, I \nhope it will work in the future to make sure this increase stands the \ntest of time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Warner will appear on the scene shortly. But as you \nknow, Madam President, I will be presiding, so this gives me the \nopportunity to speak now.\n  Senators Warner and Collins and I have worked to develop a bipartisan \nresolution dealing with Iraq. I thank them for working to forge this \nbipartisan resolution. I would clarify that the goal of this resolution \nis to broaden the resolution's appeal. It is important to send a strong \nmessage to the White House and Iraq. And the more support the \nresolution receives in the Senate, the stronger our message will be.\n  This may not be an either/or situation. We are bringing forth a new \nset of ideas, something more broadly worded for Senators to consider. \nSome can vote for this resolution, and the other, without feeling any \ncontradiction.\n  The content of this resolution is more inclusive of the Iraq Study \nGroup's recommendations and steers clear of partisan or Presidential \nrhetoric.\n  I urge our colleagues--some of whom I have spoken with today, and \nsome of whom I have spoken with over the weekend, and others in recent \ndays, some tomorrow--to read this resolution carefully. I believe they \nwill find the resolution to be thoughtful, forceful, and meaningful.\n  If a Senator is not comfortable with the wording of the previously \nannounced resolution, if a Senator was concerned that the resolution \ndid not include the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, if a \nSenator was concerned about the infringement on executive powers, I \nthink that Senator will find our resolution more appealing.\n  In the end, we all have a responsibility to lead. We are accountable \nto our constituents--the American people, as is the President. When we \nsee a policy development that we feel is not in the best interests of \nthe United States and the U.S. military, we must speak out, we must \nact, and we must communicate with the President that we disagree with \nhis plan.\n  Simply put, that is what we are trying to do--to express our concern, \nour opposition, or disagreement with deploying troops in the heart of a \ncivil war in Iraq.\n  The goal is maximum bipartisan support to send the strongest message \npossible from the Senate to the President, to the American people, and \nto Iraq about our concern about this plan.\n  Thank you, Madam President.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Deanna Jensen, a \nlifelong Nevadan whose commitment to breast cancer advocacy will always \nbe remembered. After her own long but heroic battle against breast \ncancer, she passed away on January 7. My thoughts and prayers are with \nDeanna's husband Don and her family as they mourn this great loss.\n  As a loving wife and mother, cherished friend, and respected member \nof the community, Deanna touched many lives near and far. And my home \nState of Nevada was fortunate to have her from the beginning. Born in \nElko and raised in Clover Valley on a cattle ranch, she graduated from \nWells High School and eventually earned a master's degree in speech \npathology-audiology at the University of Nevada, Reno. Deanna remained \nin Nevada, devoting herself to a career as a speech pathologist and \nworking by her husband's side at his business, Jensen Precast.\n  When breast cancer finally struck, Deanna fought back and became a \ncancer survivor. In fact, before her recurrent metastatic breast cancer \nhad returned for the final time, she had been cancer free for 5 years. \nIn that time, Deanna had become a tireless activist for the cause of \nadvancing breast cancer research. With a determination and persistence \nthat would not surprise her loved ones, she sought to translate her \nprivate struggles with this terrible disease into civic action for the \ngreater good. It was clear to everyone that she cared deeply about the \nissue. ``Why me?'' was a question Deanna surely wondered about herself, \nbut she wanted answers for all women who asked that question.\n  The search for those answers is a driving force behind the Breast \nCancer and Environmental Research Act, bipartisan legislation that \nDeanna sought to see enacted. While the devastating effects of breast \ncancer are all too evident, its causes are still mostly unknown. We do \nknow that a better understanding of the links between the environment \nand breast cancer could help improve our knowledge of this complex \nillness. The Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act is designed \nto reveal those links by making a truly meaningful research investment \nand charting a national research strategy.\n  In Deanna's words, that is why passing the Breast Cancer and \nEnvironmental Research Act is a real opportunity for Congress to ``step \nup for women and breast cancer.'' Recognizing this call to action, 66 \nof my Senate colleagues and 262 members of the House of Representatives \njoined me in the 109th Congress in supporting the legislation. I hope \nthat the new session of Congress will give us another opportunity to \nmake good on our promise to finally pass the bill.\n  In one of my last correspondences with Deanna, she wrote of her \nfrustration that a bill with so much support had yet to be enacted by \nCongress. It was a fitting reminder of the way Deanna was mindful of \nthe public sphere beyond her own immediate situation, even as she dealt \nwith a grueling regimen of radiation and chemotherapy in her final \nmoments. Her inner strength could not be extinguished then, nor will \nher contributions be forgotten now. She will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S821-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S821-S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MICHAEL KAISER ON CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND EXCHANGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to share with my colleagues \na recent speech by Michael Kaiser, the president of the Kennedy Center. \nMr. Kaiser is an impressive and highly respected national leader in \narts policy and advocacy. Last month, he addressed the National Press \nClub and spoke about the importance of cultural development and \nexchange.\n  In addition to his role as the president of our national performing \narts center, Mr. Kaiser serves as a cultural ambassador for the \nadministration. He has traveled around the globe to assist cultural \norganizations in many countries--including Latin America, the Middle \nEast, and Asia. Cultural diplomacy is an effective part of our Nation's \noutreach to other countries and cultures, and Mr. Kaiser's role is an \nimpressive part of that effort.\n  He is an articulate and visionary leader for the Kennedy Center and a\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\nmajor national resource. I believe his address to the National Press \nClub last month will be of interest to all of us, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the National Press Club, Dec. 7, 2006]\n\n                   Cultural Development and Exchange\n\n                      (Remarks by Michael Kaiser)\n\n       It is a great pleasure to be here today to discuss the \n     Kennedy Center's approach to international cultural exchange.\n       I must admit to being a relative newcomer to the \n     international arts scene. In fact, after I finished business \n     school and applied to the World Bank for an entry-level \n     position, I was told I was exactly what they were not looking \n     for--someone who demonstrated no passion for international \n     affairs. I hope they would take me more seriously today.\n       In the early 1990's, I took the Alvin Ailey American Dance \n     Theater on tour to Japan, Greece, France and elsewhere. But \n     my international work really began with an invitation by the \n     Rockefeller Foundation to help the Market Theatre in \n     Johannesburg in 1994. Three weeks after Nelson Mandela's \n     inauguration I took my first of 18 monthly trips to Jo'burg; \n     I worked for the Market Theatre, I participated in the \n     creation of the Arts Council for the new South Africa and I \n     taught an arts management program in Jo'burg, Durban and Cape \n     Town. I fell in love with a nation and gained a mentor at the \n     same time.\n       Barney Simon, the late, great founder of the Market Theatre \n     taught me that the arts truly can change the world. Barney, \n     an unlikely father for South African theater, developed and \n     exported anti-apartheid protest theater. He played a major \n     role in educating Europeans and Americans about the horrors \n     of apartheid. He did change the world.\n       And he changed me.\n       I learned from Barney about truth in art; about the courage \n     it takes to be a real leader, and about the difference \n     between producing a show and producing change.\n       When Barney died in 1995 the world lost an arts hero. And I \n     lost a mentor.\n       What I learned from Barney provided the foundation for my \n     international work at the Kennedy Center.\n       I have spent the last 5 years building an international \n     activity that I, perhaps naively, believe will change the \n     world. Maybe not as dramatically as Barney's work at the \n     Market Theatre, but change nonetheless.\n       After my internship with Barney and after observing the \n     arts world from a different perspective when I ran the Royal \n     Opera House in London, I developed my own ideas about \n     cultural exchange.\n       The Kennedy Center has given me a unique platform to test \n     these ideas. Shortly after I arrived in Washington, I was \n     approached by State Department officials asking me which \n     American artists should be sent abroad to represent the \n     United States and to foster cultural exchange.\n       I surprised these State Department representatives by \n     explaining that many people around the world feel they \n     experience enough American culture. It may not be high \n     culture but people from London to Jo'burg to St. Petersburg \n     to Beijing have so much exposure to American movies, \n     television and pop music that they have no real interest in \n     more.\n       And while I am certainly in favor of sending talented \n     Americans to perform abroad, sending a great artist for one \n     concert for 1000 of the richest and most powerful people in \n     any nation has virtually no impact.\n       I suggested that we need to take a new, two-pronged \n     approach to cultural exchange.\n       First, we need to recognize that Americans know almost \n     nothing about other peoples. We read about political leaders \n     and movements but we know nothing about the people who live \n     in China or Lebanon or Colombia.\n       And I believe the most effective and engaging way to learn \n     about other people is to experience their arts. We need to \n     provide access to the art and the culture of other peoples. \n     We need Americans to see what moves other people, what they \n     think of as beautiful, what they worry about. When we hosted \n     the Iraqi Symphony at the Kennedy Center three years ago the \n     most common response I heard was, ``I didn't know Iraq had a \n     symphony.'' Most Americans were completely unaware of the \n     level of education and culture of the people of Iraq. In \n     October of last year, we hosted 900 performers from China at \n     the Kennedy Center in a landmark 4-week festival of Chinese \n     art.\n       We presented eastern and western music, Chinese opera, \n     theater, ballet, modern dance, film and puppetry. Virtually \n     every performance was sold out. One memorable shadow puppet \n     performance depicted the devastating impact of the Japanese \n     bombing of China through the eyes of a little boy. My \n     audience developed a new and vivid idea of the concerns of \n     Chinese parents; they realized they were far more like \n     Chinese people than they were different.\n       Not only our audiences were affected. The press attention \n     in Washington, throughout the United States and in China was \n     huge. I believe we influenced the thinking of many people.\n       We have festivals of Japanese art, Arab art, Indian art and \n     Russian art planned for the coming years.\n       But that is only one half of the cultural exchange puzzle.\n       I feel we have to exchange with other nations but it does \n     not necessarily have to be art that we offer.\n       I have learned through my travels that there is almost no \n     arts management education in other countries.\n       And while I could and often do make speeches on the need \n     for better arts management education in the United States, I \n     find the state of this training in other countries to be even \n     more rudimentary. It appears that the central role of \n     government funding in other nations has limited the perceived \n     need for this kind of education. But so many governments, in \n     fact most governments, are cutting back on their arts \n     support. And arts organizations in big European countries and \n     small African nations and Latin countries and Asian countries \n     are threatened. Arts managers here and elsewhere have no idea \n     how to respond.\n       They have never learned how to develop new sources of \n     contributed funds and have been unable, for various reasons, \n     to develop high levels of earned income.\n       Therefore, I believe that instead of only exchanging our \n     art for the art of other nations, we should also offer our \n     experience and expertise in arts management and revenue \n     generation to arts managers and government officials in other \n     countries.\n       We at the Kennedy Center believe we are in a strong \n     position to address this issue because we have systematically \n     developed approaches to teaching arts management.\n       When I first arrived at the Kennedy Center in 2001 we \n     established an arts management institute to address the \n     challenge of training arts managers in the United States and \n     abroad. To date, we have welcomed 66 Fellows; half of them \n     have come from countries other than the United States. These \n     practicing arts administrators have come from Russia and the \n     Czech Republic and Malaysia and Spain and Egypt and Pakistan \n     and numerous other countries. They take classes in \n     development, marketing, technology, financial management, \n     labor relations etc. I teach strategic planning every Friday \n     morning.\n       But they also work in our various departments on high level \n     projects, participate in board meetings and other similar \n     events, and develop a strong understanding of the way an arts \n     organization can function. For many of our Fellows, and \n     certainly most of our foreign Fellows, this is their first \n     exposure to a large, well-functioning arts organization.\n       Just last month on a trip to Cairo I was touring an \n     independent arts center named the Townhouse. As I opened a \n     door to its new theater, there was Nora Amin, a former \n     fellow, teaching arts management to a group of young \n     Egyptians. It was both surprising and deeply rewarding.\n       We have also developed a training program for the leaders \n     of arts organizations of color throughout the United States. \n     This program complements periodic in-person symposia with \n     more frequent on-line training sessions that have become an \n     efficient way for us to reach students from many geographical \n     areas at once. Since developing this program four years ago, \n     we have created others for small and mid-sized orchestras and \n     arts organizations in New York City. In total we are working \n     with 90 arts organizations in this country, And, most \n     recently, we have developed a program for training Board \n     members of arts organizations and created a website, \n     artsmanager.org, featuring arts management resources.\n       In some cases, we work with individual arts organizations \n     in need. For the past two years we have worked to help save \n     the Dance Theatre of Harlem. More recently, we have worked to \n     assist an arts organization truly in a perilous place at a \n     perilous time: the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra--New \n     Orleans' largest classical arts organization. Hurricane \n     Katrina destroyed the LPO's theater, its offices, its music \n     library, and its larger instruments. The subscriber base has \n     been scattered and the donor base focused on other more \n     immediate needs.\n       Yet the intrepid LPO staff and Board, with some guidance \n     from us, has been able to raise enough to bring the full \n     orchestra back, to mount a fairly large spring program this \n     past season, and to pay off virtually all the payables of the \n     institution.\n       All of this work has prepared us to address the challenge \n     of teaching arts management in other nations.\n       Our focus has been on countries in transition and in \n     trouble.\n       Why?\n       Because I believe that the arts play an especially \n     important role in troubled societies.\n       I believe that the arts have a power to heal. Expressing \n     anger, pain and fear on stage is productive and effective. \n     The protest theater of South Africa helped many people cope \n     with their anger while also producing change.\n       Arts can address all segments of society. While the largest \n     arts organizations typically address the wealthier and \n     better-educated segments of society, the smaller non-\n     government organizations reach far beyond the elite. That is \n     why we have focused our attention on these organizations.\n       Artists are opinion generators. When we support artists in \n     troubled areas, we teach others about the problems in society \n     and the impact of those problems.\n       In fact, the arts are the safest way for people to express \n     themselves.\n       And the arts can replace pain with beauty.\n       My first foray into this new international realm was in \n     Mexico--until the recent Presidential election not really a \n     country in turmoil but an arts environment in turmoil.\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\n       The government of Mexico has been responsible for \n     approximately 90% of arts funding in that country and has a \n     stated goal of reducing this level of support. Also, this \n     funding is concentrated; too few organizations receive any \n     government funding and the non-government organizations--\n     NGO's--are typically tiny and struggling.\n       I have spent the last two years training a group of 35 arts \n     managers of small arts organizations in Mexico who all run \n     NGO's. They each received their first government grants in a \n     special program called Mexico en Escena, Mexico on Stage. \n     These grants were 2-year grants totaling $50,000.\n       Part of the grant was access to a week-long seminar on \n     planning at the beginning of the grant and quarterly classes \n     thereafter. I am the teacher of these programs.\n       The program ends this month, as the government of Mexico \n     changes. Virtually all of the groups have made huge strides. \n     Most have improved their artistic quality substantially and \n     many have created new fund-raising and marketing \n     capabilities. About one-half of the groups are truly poised \n     for additional growth and achievement as this program ends.\n       As I was initiating my work in Mexico, I also began to \n     develop a relationship with the government of China.\n       Our festival of Chinese art was of great interest to the \n     government there and a strong relationship was developed. In \n     keeping with my philosophy expressed earlier, we traded art \n     for expertise. The Chinese provided us with a remarkable \n     array of performers and performing groups. We offered back \n     training in arts management.\n       I go to China twice a year to teach up to 500 arts managers \n     at a time; in addition, we host 20 arts managers from China \n     at the Kennedy Center for a week each summer. I must admit to \n     being a bit daunted the first time I faced a room of 500 \n     students; and the Socratic method of teaching I prefer took \n     my students many days to become accustomed to.\n       I have also had to fight, as I have elsewhere, to ensure \n     that the majority of my students are truly arts managers and \n     not government bureaucrats. This has been a consistent \n     challenge in every country in which I have taught.\n       But my students in China are excellent and learn quickly \n     and are working diligently to develop private sources of \n     funding and new marketing techniques. Like my students in \n     Mexico and elsewhere, there is far greater comfort attempting \n     to raise funds from foundations and corporations but I \n     continually pressure my students to attempt to develop an \n     individual donor base as well.\n       For as we have learned in America, individual donors are \n     far more loyal than institutional donors, and there is far \n     more total money available from individuals, and, eventually, \n     far larger gifts available from individuals. Arts \n     organizations that rely most heavily on institutional giving \n     typically remain small.\n       Much of my work here and elsewhere focuses in part on the \n     problems faced by all arts organizations, whether in Beijing \n     or Butte.\n       Of course, the central difficulty we face in the performing \n     arts is the challenge of improving productivity.\n       Unlike virtually every other industry, we cannot cover the \n     costs of inflation with increases in productivity. There are \n     the same number of performers in Don Giovanni as when Mozart \n     wrote it over 200 years ago. This productivity challenge is \n     matched by an earned income challenge: once we build a \n     theater we have literally set the earned revenue potential \n     in concrete. We cannot increase true earned revenue since \n     we cannot increase the number of seats in our theater. I \n     remember bringing the Ailey company to the Herod Atticus--\n     a beautiful Roman amphitheater built into the base of the \n     Acropolis in Athens. The entire company was awed by the \n     setting--performing outdoors with the moon over the \n     Acropolis. I only stood on stage and marveled that there \n     were the same number of seats as when it was built 2000 \n     years ago.\n       These productivity and earned income constraints, that the \n     arts have been facing for centuries, place great pressure on \n     ticket prices, unless new sources of funding can be \n     developed. And in most countries, raising ticket prices \n     simply means reducing audience size and diversity, hardly an \n     attractive option.\n       We teach how to plan for the challenges faced by every arts \n     organization and how to plan for the idiosyncratic challenges \n     faced in a given country.\n       While every arts organization must address the productivity \n     problem, the challenges posed by religious factions in \n     Pakistan are different from the government restrictions faced \n     by Chinese organizations.\n       Of course, a good deal of this planning must address how to \n     develop new sources of revenue, and particularly, how \n     marketing can be used to aid this effort. My mantra for \n     running a successful arts organization is good art, well \n     marketed. I have yet to see an arts organization that \n     routinely produces great art and also markets that art \n     aggressively that does not have the resources to pursue its \n     mission.\n       We teach why this is true and how to implement strong \n     artistic planning and how to develop a comprehensive \n     marketing campaign.\n       Most recently, we have addressed these issues in Pakistan. \n     The Pakistani arts ecology has experienced 30 years of \n     neglect and its government has asked us to help build back \n     this sector. We have created a plan to address this goal. \n     Central elements of this plan include:\n       Investing in physical infrastructure: Pakistani theaters \n     are in tremendous disrepair. I visited one of the country's \n     ``best'' theaters, the Alhambra in Lahore.\n       It has a floor so warped it can not house professional \n     dancers, and has only 10 lighting instruments, as compared to \n     the 300 or so we expect in an American theater.\n       Creating flagship arts organizations: There are no larger \n     arts organizations that create important art and serve as \n     role models for the nation. A national gallery of art is \n     about to open; we need major dance and theater and musical \n     organizations as well that can serve as centers of expertise \n     and training.\n       Improving production capabilities: If Pakistani artists are \n     to compete internationally, the nation must develop more \n     expertise in technical theater: lighting, set, costume and \n     sound design.\n       Teaching Arts Management: There is virtually no training \n     for people running arts organizations. We must develop some \n     teaching capacity in Pakistan, as we must in other countries \n     in which we can only play a minimal role.\n       Creating arts education programs: There is little arts \n     education in the schools and very few teachers equipped to \n     bring the arts into the classroom. In addition, there are few \n     works developed expressly for young audiences so children are \n     rarely introduced to the arts.\n       Building international awareness of Pakistani arts and \n     culture: There is very little understanding of the rich \n     history of culture in the region. And there are currently few \n     arts organizations that can tour with competitive \n     programming.\n       We have begun to implement this plan. We produced a one-\n     week training program for 30 arts leaders this August. We \n     have created a web site on Pakistani culture to be used to \n     educate their children and others throughout the world on the \n     rich heritage of this nation. We have planned a children's \n     theater collaboration between the Kennedy Center and the \n     Pakistan National Council on the Arts. Additional programs \n     are also in the planning stage.\n       But if Pakistan is to develop into a true democracy, \n     artists must be free to create, and an infrastructure to \n     present this art must be developed.\n       It is still unclear if the current government will \n     demonstrate a sustained interest in this endeavor and will be \n     willing to change the vestigial laws that continue to \n     restrict artistic freedom.\n       I am committed to working with the government of Pakistan \n     to build the strength of its arts ecology but will also work \n     with the nation's artists to change legislation that \n     prohibits this development.\n       I have learned a great deal from my experiences in China \n     and Mexico and Pakistan. I can summarize them in ten major \n     observations:\n       Most arts managers in many countries have few peers and \n     fewer mentors from whom they can learn. These managers feel \n     isolated and helpless. If a major donor is truly going to \n     make change, one must provide consistent and substantial \n     technical support as well as cash.\n       To make major change in many countries requires involvement \n     of the government. In Mexico, for example, arts groups \n     receiving consistent government funding must return to the \n     government that portion of their subsidies that equal their \n     private fundraising or extraordinary ticket sales.\n       This means there is no inducement for acting \n     entrepreneurially. I am working with the government leaders \n     of Mexico to change this rule to foster the development of \n     new sources of funding. We must also make the case for the \n     arts to government leaders. Most governments do not \n     appreciate the economic impact of the arts, the role of the \n     arts in tourism and the role of the arts in creating \n     international image.\n       Private donors must also be involved in changing the \n     culture of giving in any country. When I consulted to the \n     Market Theatre, one of our Board members was one of the \n     wealthiest people in the world. When I asked her why I did \n     not see her listed as a donor to the Theatre, she replied, \n     ``I do donate. I donate my time by coming to Board \n     meetings.'' But we also need to make donors comfortable that \n     their money is truly having an impact and is being well-\n     spent. This is particularly important in countries without a \n     tradition of arts philanthropy. In other words, we must \n     market to our donors as well as to our audience.\n       Non-recurring grants must be tied to a matching \n     requirement. If arts organizations are forced to raise new \n     funds to match a large gift from a single donor, they are \n     forced to develop expertise in fund-raising. I asked the \n     Mexican government, before they made two-year grants to my \n     students, to include some kind of match, and I was ignored. \n     As a result, while several of the groups have prepared well \n     for the end of this special grant, an equal number of them \n     have not and are now being forced to down-size and abandon \n     the projects they initiated with grant funds. This could have \n     been avoided if a matching requirement had been attached to \n     the grant and the groups were required to develop new sources \n     of funding.\n       Most arts groups in most countries address very small \n     audiences and have minimal scope of operations. While bigger \n     is not always better in the arts, some level of size is \n     required to have an impact and to establish\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\n     a measure of stability. We need to help arts groups get \n     larger.\n       While it is assumed that fund-raising skills are the major \n     deficiency in many countries, in fact, marketing knowledge is \n     minimal at best. We must teach how to develop focused \n     programmatic marketing campaigns that help sell tickets and \n     aggressive institutional marketing campaigns that help raise \n     money and awareness.\n       We need to expand the planning horizon for arts \n     organizations in troubled countries. Most arts organizations \n     have planning horizons of less than 6 months. This makes it \n     virtually impossible to build strong fundraising efforts and \n     major touring programs. But we also have to help train arts \n     entrepreneurs. In my experience, there is no conflict between \n     planning and entrepreneurship but this is not evident to \n     everyone.\n       We must encourage artists to collaborate with \n     administrators. One of my students in Mexico experienced a \n     total life change when he handed over to an administrator the \n     things he did not know how to do and focused exclusively on \n     his role as artistic director. Today, he has two years of \n     his budget in the bank!\n       The training we offer must be practical and hands-on. While \n     our goals are idealistic, our training techniques must be \n     immediately implementable if our students are to make change.\n       And finally, we must work hard to encourage arts \n     organizations not to waste anything. While this is true for \n     arts organizations throughout the world, those organizations \n     in challenging environments must use every dollar and every \n     hour to maximum advantage.\n       Next on our agenda is a major project with the 22 Arab \n     countries. Again we are using our two-pronged approach to \n     cultural exchange. We are mounting a major Arab arts festival \n     at the Kennedy Center in 2009. But, beginning this coming \n     spring, we are also holding annual symposia on arts \n     management in the Arab countries. We have begun by surveying \n     a large list of Arab arts organizations to determine their \n     chief concerns.\n       Just last month I visited Cairo, Amman, Riyadh and Damascus \n     to discuss our plans with government leaders, arts managers \n     and artists. The response was very positive from all sectors \n     and the press we received was encouraging. On numerous \n     occasions during my trip I heard enthusiasm for our idea of \n     helping Americans understand Arabs, as people rather than as \n     political entities. And the training we are offering is seen \n     as an act of generosity by people who do not always think of \n     Americans in that way.\n       I am convinced that this project, our most ambitious to \n     date, will have the dual benefits of educating the American \n     public while also creating stronger cultural institutions in \n     the Arab world. We hope this will allow these institutions to \n     play a more vital role in their countries and will foster \n     relationships between Americans and Arabs that will help to \n     unite and bring understanding and peace.\n       This is an ambitious goal; some would call it naive.\n       But it would be impossible for us not to try.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S824-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY J.

Mr. Zagami officially retired on January 3, 2007, from \nthe U.S. Government Printing Office with the distinction of being the \nlongest serving general counsel in history.\n  In the mid-1960s, Mr. Zagami began his distinguished career on \nCapitol Hill as a Senate page. I first met Tony many years ago when he \nwas working in the Senate Democratic cloakroom. Following his service \nin the cloakroom, he worked for the Secretary of the Senate and \neventually went on to become the general counsel for the Joint \nCommittee on Printing for 9 years. Mr. Zagami would ultimately work in \nthe Senate for a total of 25 years in various capacities.\n  In 1990, Tony began his tenure as the longest serving general counsel \nin history. In this capacity, he oversaw an agency that is responsible \nfor the printing and distribution of the Congressional Record and \nnearly every other governmental publication. Mr. Zagami served at a \nmomentous time in the history of the GPO, as the agency worked to move \ninto the digital age.\n  Tony is known as a diligent, thorough, and dedicated public servant, \nand I am honored to recognize his outstanding service. His record of \nservice, which spans more than four decades, is tremendous indeed. I \nknow my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Tony Zagami for his \ntremendous work over the years, and I wish him the best in the years to \ncome. I hope he will enjoy his retirement as much as we have enjoyed \nhis presence around the Capitol over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S824-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JUDGE OTHA LEE BIGGS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are many public servants \nwho hold office and it is not possible to make mention of the \nmilestones in their lives; however, with Otha Lee Biggs, probate judge \nof Monroe County, AL, I must make an exception. His remarkable tenure \nis truly notable. Judge Biggs served 36 years as probate judge and as \nchairman of the Monroe County Commission. He has been dual-hatted, as \nthey say.\n  During that time, he has been a tireless proponent of economic growth \nfor the county and constantly worked for more and better jobs for his \npeople. Everyone knows Judge Biggs and he knows everyone. He knows his \nconstituents, their children, parents, cousins, and neighbors. Even \nknowing those who get along and those who don't. He knows how to get \nthings done. And his word is good. That is to say, he is a master \npolitician in the finest sense of that word.\n  It is a real treat to hear him tell how he worked to get the Alabama \nRiver Pulp Mill to locate in Monroe County in 1978. Make no mistake, \nthat event has been hugely important to the county ever since. He is a \nfriend of Monroe County's best known citizen, Nelle Harper Lee, the \nauthor of ``To Kill A Mockingbird,'' the most widely read book of the \n20th century in the schools of America. He was a visionary behind the \nproduction of the play based on the book. A historian, a \nconservationist, a fabulous storyteller, and a man of family and \ntradition, Judge Biggs is one of a kind. We will not see his like \nagain. He is held, to a most unusual degree, in the highest esteem and \naffection by the people he has served. They have given him their trust, \nand he has been worthy of it.\n  His has been a remarkable period of leadership, Constant and faithful \nhe has been, and the people love him for it. Rich and poor, Black and \nWhite, he has served them all. He has put them and his county first.\n  Governors, Senators, and Congressmen have been his friend. I have \nbeen honored to be his friend, too. When I pass through Monroeville on \nthe way to visit my homeplace in Hybart, on the northern edge of the \ncounty, I always try to stop in for a visit with the Judge. It is a \nspecial treat to peer over that pile of papers on his desk, some yellow \nwith age, in his small modest office and to catch up on the news, to \nhear a good story, to take a peek at his pictures, and to learn about \nthe important issues facing the county, our State and our Nation. For, \nfirst of all, Judge Biggs is a patriot. He loves his country and loves \nit truly and understands its exceptional nature. Thus, his insight is \nalways valuable.\n  Now, as everyone knows, Judge Biggs is frugal. If he ran the Federal \nGovernment, the budget would be balanced--that is for sure. His style \nis clearly demonstrated at the ceremony at which his successor, Judge \nGreg Norris, was installed. At the conclusion, Judge Biggs said ``I \nhave one bit of advice. Replace the carpet in your office. It's been \nthere 44 years.''\n  The retirement reception for Judge Biggs, hosted by the Alabama Power \nCompany and Alabama River Pulp Company on January 11, 2007, was a \nremarkable event. I am truly disappointed to have missed that wonderful \ntime. Though my duties here kept me away, I was there in spirit and in \nadmiration for one of Alabama's most important leaders, Judge Otha Lee \nBiggs. Well done, good and faithful servant, well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S824-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S824-S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF VALDOSTA, GEORGIA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the city \nof Valdosta, which received the Audrey Nelson Community Development \nAchievement Award for its outstanding administration of the 2006 \nSouthern Hospitality Workcamp. The city of Valdosta is 1 of 11 cities \nfrom across the Nation to receive this award. I am very proud of its \naccomplishments, and I would like to commend all of the people involved \nin this effort.\n  The Audrey Nelson Community Development Award is presented by the\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nNational Community Development Association in recognition of \noutstanding achievements and exemplary uses of the community \ndevelopment block grant funds. In the spirit of this program, which \nassists the needs of low-income families and neighborhoods, the city of \nValdosta has set a goal of eliminating substandard housing by the year \n2010.\n  Through its 2006 Southern Hospitality Workcamp, the city gathered \nover 350 youths from across the country to repair 46 homes for low-\nincome and disabled individuals and families. This annual program has \nalso earned the city of Valdosta the State of Georgia's Magnolia Award \nfor excellence in affordable housing. The city has won this award in 3 \nof the past 6 years.\n  The honorable work by these students exemplifies the dedication the \ncity has to its goal of eliminating substandard housing. I would like \nto thank the city of Valdosta for its efforts as well as encourage the \ncity to keep working on this outstanding goal in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S825-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING MASTER SERGEANT LARRY PERRY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize MSG Larry Perry of \nBruce, SD, who was recently awarded the Purple Heart Medal at Camp \nClark in Afghanistan for injuries he incurred while on patrol.\n  Master Sergeant Perry is married and has two sons. He has served with \nthe National Guard for more than 18 years. He is a member of the 147th \nField Artillery Brigade of the South Dakota Army National Guard and is \ncurrently the 203rd Regional Corps Assistance Group, RCAG, 1st Brigade \nMotor Officer. Master Sergeant Perry's service in Afghanistan is part \nof the efforts to train and mentor members of the newly organized \nAfghan National Army. The brigade trains Afghani soldiers in areas such \nas intelligence, communications, logistics, maintenance, military \noperations, and leadership skills. These necessary skills are allowing \nthe Afghan National Army to operate independently as a professional \nforce to curb terrorist attacks, provide safety and security for its \ncitizens, and participate as an important ally in the war on terror.\n  On the morning of September 25, 2006, Master Sergeant Perry was \nserving as a gunner in the turret of a Humvee in Khowst Province when a \nsuicide car bomb exploded alongside his convoy. The explosion sent \nshrapnel into his shoulder, and he suffered burns to his face and neck.\n  Master Sergeant Perry and his fellow soldiers face such dangers every \nday, and their willingness to put themselves in harm's way for the \nAmerican and Afghani people is truly humbling. I, along with the \ncitizens of South Dakota and the entire United States, owe Master \nSergeant Perry a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to repay. \nWe honor Master Sergeant Perry for his patriotism, bravery, and \nselflessness, and we applaud his courage in the face of danger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S825-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH W. WHITAKER\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I acknowledge the \ncontributions of a dedicated public servant, Joe Whitaker. Joe \ncurrently serves as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army, \nInstallations and Housing. This makes Joe Whitaker the most senior \ncareer civilian official in the Army responsible for military \ninstallation issues such as the construction of new facilities and \nhousing for our soldiers and their families. Joe Whitaker's service to \nthe Army includes both military and civilian service, and he is \nretiring as a member of the Senior Executive Service at the end of this \nmonth after a career of over 35 years of dedicated public service to \nthe U.S. Army.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, \nI appreciate the challenges Joe Whitaker has faced over the past few \nyears trying to modernize the facilities where our soldiers live and \nwork. These challenges include: an Army at war; the 2005 round of base \nrealignment and closures; the so-called modular conversion of the Army \nfrom a division-based force to a brigade-based force; and the \nrelocation of thousands of Army personnel and dependents from Europe to \nthe United States. This would be a significant set of challenges to \ndeal with even if they had occurred one after the other, but Joe \nWhitaker and the Army have had to address them simultaneously, and I \ncommend him for the job he has done in meeting these challenges.\n  As a Senator from the State of Hawaii, I have seen first hand the \nimprovements in both military capability and quality of life that have \ntaken place for the Army in Hawaii thanks to the efforts of Joe \nWhitaker and others in the executive and legislative branches. This \nincludes the privatization and improvement of over 7,800 homes for Army \nfamilies in Hawaii under the Residential Communities Initiative and the \nconstruction of facilities to stand up a Stryker Brigade Combat Team in \nHawaii. Our Army forces in Hawaii are better off because of Joe \nWhitaker's contributions.\n  Dedicated career civil servants like Joe Whitaker are so important to \nthe work of the Army and other Federal agencies. They provide the \ncontinuity, background of knowledge and experience, and relationships \nthat the political appointees representing any administration need to \nget things accomplished. This is even more true in the military, where \neffective command during the relatively brief tours of senior military \nleaders would not be possible without the expertise of career civil \nservants like Joe Whitaker.\n  Finally, the members and staff of our committee have also known they \ncould rely on Joe Whitaker as a candid, hard-working partner in our \nshared responsibility for providing for our men and women in uniform \nand their families. On behalf of the Subcommittee on Readiness and \nManagement Support and the entire Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nexpress our appreciation to Joe Whitaker for his contributions, and \ndedication to, the soldiers of the U.S. Army and his country, and I \nwish him success in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S825-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DONALD D. JUNCK\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Donald D. \nJunck of Sioux Falls, SD. In November of 2006, Donald submitted the \none-millionth Trademark Electronic Application System, TEAS, filing.\n  Donald currently owns two small businesses in Sioux Falls, SD: a \nconstruction company and a laser engraving company. He used TEAS to \nprotect the name and logo of his mark, Bait Craft, which is used for \nhis unique, handcrafted fishing tackle boxes. Fishing and other outdoor \nactivities are an important part of South Dakota's heritage and are \nvital to our State's economy. Fishermen have spent $173 million and \nhunters $193 million in South Dakota over the last 5 years. TEAS has \nhelped Donald and many others in our State achieve the entrepreneurial \nsuccess that creates jobs and keeps our economy moving forward.\n  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, opened TEAS on a \nworldwide basis in 1998.

A bill to expand visa waiver program to countries on a \nprobationary basis and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Secure Travel \nand Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007, along with my good \nfriends Senators Akaka, Lugar, and Mikulski.\n  This legislation would expand the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in a way \nthat would increase cooperation with key allies in the War on Terror \nwhile strengthening U.S. national security.\n  The bill provides a way for us to expand and improve the Visa Waiver \nProgram so that Americans are safer and our Nation is more prosperous \nfor years to come.\n  This legislation comes at a particularly important time in our \nNation's history. We are currently facing multiple foreign policy \nchallenges in the post-9/11 world. We need the cooperation of several \nallies to combat transnational threats. As such, we are asking our \nfriends and allies to contribute more of their troops and resources to \nIraq, Afghanistan, and other conflicts in the world, so that we can be \nsuccessful. This legislation will help us to solidify key relationships \nand increase goodwill toward the U.S. for years to come, while also \nenhancing travel security standards and safety at home.\n  My legislation would authorize the Department of Homeland Security, \nin consultation with the Department of State, to expand the Visa Waiver \nProgram to countries that are true friends of America and are prepared \nto do more to help us keep terrorists and criminals out of our borders.\n  For those that do not know about the Visa Waiver Program, it was \nestablished in 1986 to improve relations with U.S. allies and \nstrengthen the U.S. economy. The program permitted nationals from the \nselected countries to enter the United States without a visa for up to \n90 days for tourism or business purposes.\n  Currently, 27 countries participate in the program, including the \nUnited Kingdom. No countries have been added to the Visa Waiver Program \nsince 1999. But there are a number of newer allies who would also like \nto participate in the Visa Waiver Program and are willing to meet \nstrict security requirements and cooperate on counterterrorism \ninitiatives.\n  Many of these countries were former members of the Soviet Union. They \nwere victims of Soviet oppression for years, against their will, and \ndespite their desire for freedom. These countries have a unique \nunderstanding of the struggle for democracy taking place in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Today, many of these countries have had boots on the \nground in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\nand want to help the U.S. combat terrorism and promote democracy.\n  Despite their commitments to the principles of freedom and democracy, \nthese countries are still paying a price that other countries in the \nWest do not pay. Citizens of Portugal, the UK, or Spain can travel \neasily to the U.S., while citizens of Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia are \ngiven second-class treatment.\n  I recently learned of a story involving a young Czech officer who \nserved in Iraq with Americans. This soldier wanted to come to America \nto visit the American friends he made during combat operations. But his \napplication for a visa was refused. Why? Because his passport included \na visit to Iraq, the very place he served with American soldiers.\n  Many young people from places like Latvia, Estonia, and Bulgaria have \na positive view of America and hope to visit our country. However, \ntheir expensive visa applications are frequently rejected, dampening \ntheir spirits and tainting their image of America. And this view is \nspreading every day.\n  By limiting legitimate travel to the U.S., we are risking a loss of \ninfluence with the future leaders of our closest allies.\n  I have been working for many months to develop legislation that will \nexpand the Visa Waiver Program, without sacrificing U.S. security. I \nwas pleased last November when I heard President Bush announce his \nintention to work with Congress on this issue. On the margins of the \nNATO Summit in Riga, he called on Congress to expand the Visa Waiver \nProgram so that we can reward our closest allies for their help and \nfriendship.\n  I agree with the President--but I want to clarify that visa-free \ntravel privileges are not simply a reward for our allies. The true \nreward is the knowledge that we are free and democratic countries \nworking together to advance international security. The foremost goal \nof this legislation is to create mutually beneficial partnerships with \nclear national security advantages for the United States.\n\n  By continuing on the current path, we risk marginalizing some of our \nclosest allies in the War on Terror and losing the hearts and minds of \ntheir future leaders and citizens. We have an opportunity to change \ndirection in a way that will promote our own national security \ninterests and improve control of our borders. The Secure Travel and \nCounterterrorism Partnership Act of 2007 can achieve all of these \nobjectives.\n  The legislation would give the executive branch the necessary \nauthority to expand visa-free travel privileges for up to five new \ncountries, for a probationary period of three years.\n  In order for a country to participate in the plan, the executive \nbranch would first need to certify that the country is cooperative on \ncounterterrorism and does not pose a security or law enforcement threat \nto the United States. Prospective countries would also be required to \ntake a number of new steps to enhance our common security.\n  Prior to participation, the countries would be required to conclude \nnew agreements with the United States to further strengthen cooperation \non counterterrorism and improve information-sharing about critical \nsecurity issues.\n  Some might say--if these countries are key allies, aren't they \ncooperating with us already? The answer is yes. They are very \ncooperative. But in today's heightened security environment, there is \nmore that each country can do, such as sharing additional sensitive \ninformation that can help our intelligence community and law \nenforcement agencies investigate threats and combat terrorist activity. \nBy negotiating new agreements on counterterrorism and information-\nsharing to permit participation in the Visa Waiver Program, we can \nreduce threats to the United States. Additionally, the legislation \nwould require the countries to enact a number of significant security \nmeasures, which would limit illegal entry and unlawful presence in \ntheir countries and impede travel by terrorists and transnational \ncriminals. Security standards required for participation in the program \nwould include electronic passports with biometric information, as well \nas prompt reporting of lost, stolen, or fraudulent travel documents to \nthe U.S. and Interpol.\n  These new requirements would help make the U.S. more secure. \nExpanding the number of participating visa waiver countries would \nincrease the number of states meeting common security standards. This \nwould allow the United States to shift consular resources used to issue \nvisas to other missions with more critical security needs.\n  If at any time, participant countries are not complying with these \nrequirements, their probationary status in the program could be \nrevoked.\n  Likewise, if the program is determined to be successful, it could be \nexpanded to include additional countries.\n  The last part of the legislation is aimed at enhancing security \nrequirements for countries who are currently participating in the Visa \nWaiver Program. In this post-9/11 world, the U.S. Government has \nalready required additional security measures of participating visa \nwaiver countries, such as machine readable passports with biometric \ninformation. But we can and must do more.\n  I was very pleased last November when Homeland Security Secretary \nChertoff recommended several new measures to further enhance the \nefficiency and security of the Visa Waiver Program. His recommendations \nincluded an electronic travel authorization system, additional \npassenger information exchanges, common standards for airport security \nand baggage screening, cooperation in the air marshal program, and home \ncountry assistance in repatriation of any traveler who overstays the \nterms of their visa or violates U.S. law.\n  As the Administration works to develop the details of its \nrecommendations, my legislation would require that within one year, the \nexecutive branch provide a report to Congress on its plans for Visa \nWaiver Program improvements.\n  In addition to the substantial benefits my legislation would create \nfor U.S. foreign relations and homeland security, the bill would also \nadvance U.S. economic competitiveness. Visa-free travel to the United \nStates has been proven to significantly boost tourism and business, as \nwell as airline revenues, and would generate substantial economic \nbenefits to the United States well into the future. Additionally, it \nwould improve attitudes toward the United States throughout the world, \nwhich would benefit the U.S. economy and national security for \ngenerations to come.\n  As a member of both the Foreign Relations and the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committees, I have studied this issue from \nevery angle. I believe the legislation I am introducing presents us \nwith a real opportunity to strengthen diplomatic relationships, enhance \nour homeland security, and improve the Visa Waiver Program overall.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Congress and the \nPresident to move this legislation forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Travel and \n     Counterterrorism Partnership Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     expand the visa waiver program to extend visa-free travel \n     privileges to nationals of foreign countries that are allies \n     in the war on terrorism as that expansion will--\n       (1) enhance bilateral cooperation on critical \n     counterterrorism and information sharing initiatives;\n       (2) support and expand tourism and business opportunities \n     to enhance long-term economic competitiveness; and\n       (3) strengthen bilateral relationships.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to extend the District of Columbia College Access Act \nof 1999; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to reauthorize the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance \nGrant (D.C. TAG) program for an additional five years. This successful \nprogram, which began in 2000, has produced dramatic results in higher \neducation in the District of Columbia by enabling District students to \nchoose a college that best suits their educational needs.\n  One of the most worthwhile things I have done during my time in the \nSenate was to sponsor the legislation that created the D.C. TAG \nprogram. The aim of this program is to assist District students who do \nnot have access to State-supported education systems. Originally, the \nD.C. TAG program provided District residents with grant funding to pay \nthe difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition at State \nuniversities nationwide. D.C. TAG participants are eligible for up to \n$l0,000 per student per school year, capped at $50,000. Since March \n2002, District students attending private institutions in Maryland and \nVirginia, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities \nnationwide are eligible to receive tuition grants of $2,500 per student \nper school year, capped at $12,500.\n  Since the programs inception, more than 26,000 grants have been \ndispersed to 9,769 District students, amounting to approximately $141 \nmillion. As a result, the District has seen a 50 percent increase in \ncollege attendance. Our States have benefited from having these \ntalented students attending their universities. In Ohio, District \nstudents attend nine of our colleges and universities with grants \nvalued at $500,000. Reauthorizing this successful program will ensure \nthat D.C. TAG grants are available for future generations of deserving \nDistrict high school students.\n  As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia, I am \ncommitted to ensuring quality educational opportunities for District \nresidents. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 5-YEAR REAUTHORIZATION OF TUITION ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Public School Program.--Section 3(i) of the District of \n     Columbia College Access Act of 1999 (sec. 38-2702(i), D.C. \n     Official Code) is amended by striking ``each of the 7 \n     succeeding fiscal years'' and inserting ``each of the 12 \n     succeeding fiscal years''.\n       (b) Private School Program.--Section 5(f) of such Act (sec. \n     38-2704(f), D.C. Official\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\n     Code) is amended by striking ``each of the 7 succeeding \n     fiscal years'' and inserting ``each of the 12 succeeding \n     fiscal years''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 344. A bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court proceedings; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, once again I seek recognition to \nintroduce legislation that will give the public greater access to our \nSupreme Court. This bill requires the high Court to permit television \ncoverage of its open sessions unless it decides by a majority vote of \nthe Justices that allowing such coverage in a particular case would \nviolate the due process rights of one or more of the parties involved \nin the matter.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to open the Supreme Court doors so \nthat more Americans can see the process by which the Court reaches \ncritical decisions of law that affect this country and everyday \nAmericans. The Supreme Court makes pronouncements on Constitutional and \nFederal law that have a direct impact on the rights of Americans. Those \nrights would be substantially enhanced by televising the oral arguments \nof the Court so that the public can see and hear the issues presented \nto the Court. With this information, the public would have insight into \nkey issues and be better equipped to understand the impact of and \nreasons for the Court's decisions.\n  In a very fundamental sense, televising the Supreme Court has been \nimplicitly recognized--perhaps even sanctioned--in a 1980 decision by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States entitled Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia. In this case, the Court noted that a public trial belongs not \nonly to the accused but to the public and the press as well and \nrecognized that people now acquire information on court procedures \nchiefly through the print and electronic media.\n  That decision, in referencing the electronic media, appears to \nanticipate televising court proceedings, although I do not mean to \nsuggest that the Supreme Court is in agreement with this legislation. I \nshould note that the Court could, on its own initiative, televise its \nproceedings but has chosen not to do so, which presents, in my view, \nthe necessity for legislating on this subject.\n  When I argued the case of the Navy Yard, Dalton v. Specter, back in \n1994, the Court proceedings were illustrated by an artist's drawings--\nsome of which now hang in my office. Today, the public gets a \nsubstantial portion, if not most, of its information from television \nand the internet. While many court proceedings are broadcast routinely \non television, the public has little access to the most important and \nhighest court in this country. Although the internet has made receipt \nof the Court's transcripts, and even more recently, audio recordings, \nmore widely accessible, the public is still deprived of the real time \ntransmission of audio and video feeds from the Court. I believe it is \nvital for the public to see, as well as to hear, the arguments made \nbefore the Court and the interplay among the justices. I think the \nAmerican people will gain a greater respect for the way in which our \nHigh Court functions if they are able to see oral arguments.\n  Justice Felix Frankfurter perhaps anticipated the day when Supreme \nCourt arguments would be televised when he said that he longed for a \nday when: ``The news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly \nas it did the World Series, since the public confidence in the \njudiciary hinges on the public's perception of it, and that perception \nnecessarily hinges on the media's portrayal of the legal system.''\n  When I spoke in favor of this legislation in September of 2000, I \nsaid, ``I do not expect a rush to judgment on this very complex \nproposition, but I do believe the day will come when the Supreme Court \nof the United States will be televised. That day will come, and it will \nbe decisively in the public interest so the public will know the \nmagnitude of what the Court is deciding and its role in our democratic \nprocess.'' I reiterated those sentiments in September of 2005 when I \nre-introduced an identical bill. Today, I believe the time has come and \nthat this legislation is crucial to the public's awareness of Supreme \nCourt proceedings and their impact on the daily lives of all Americans.\n  I pause to note that it was not until 1955 that the Supreme Court, \nunder the leadership of Chief Justice Warren, first began permitting \naudio recordings of oral arguments. Between 1955 and 1993, there were \napparently over 5,000 recorded arguments before the Supreme Court. That \nroughly translates to an average of about 132 arguments annually. But \naudio recordings are simply ill suited to capture the nuance of oral \narguments and the sustained attention of the American citizenry. Nor is \nit any response that people who wish to see open sessions of the \nSupreme Court should come to the Capital and attend oral arguments. \nFor, according to one source: ``Several million people each year visit \nWashington, D.C., and many thousands tour the White House and the \nCapitol. But few have the chance to sit in the Supreme Court chamber \nand witness an entire oral argument. Most tourists are given just three \nminutes before they are shuttled out and a new group shuttled in. In \ncases that attract headlines, seats for the public are scarce and \nwaiting lines are long. And the Court sits in open session less than \ntwo hundred hours each year. Television cameras and radio microphones \nare still banned from the chamber, and only a few hundred people at \nmost can actually witness oral arguments. Protected by a marble wall \nfrom public access, the Supreme Court has long been the least \nunderstood of the three branches of our Federal Government.''\n  In light of the increasing public desire for information, it seems \nuntenable to continue excluding cameras from the courtroom of the \nNation's highest court. As one legal commentator observes: ``An \neffective and legitimate way to satisfy America's curiosity about the \nSupreme Court's holdings, Justices, and modus operandi is to permit \nbroadcast coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements from \nthe courtroom itself.''\n  Televised court proceedings better enable the public to understand \nthe role of the Supreme Court and its impact on the key decisions of \nthe day. Not only has the Supreme Court invalidated Congressional \ndecisions where there was, in the views of many, simply a difference of \nopinion as to what is preferable public policy, but the Court \ndetermines novel issues such as whether AIDS is a disability under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, whether Congress can ban obscenity \nfrom the Internet, and whether states can impose term limits upon \nmembers of Congress. The current Court, like its predecessors, hands \ndown decisions which vitally affect the lives and liberties of all \nAmericans. Since the Court's historic 1803 decision, Marbury v. \nMadison, the Supreme Court has the final authority on issues of \nenormous importance from birth to death. In Roe v. Wade (1973), the \nCourt affirmed a Constitutional right to abortion in this country and \nstruck down state statutes banning or severely restricting abortion \nduring the first two trimesters on the grounds that they violated a \nright to privacy inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. In the case of Washington v. Glucksberg, 1997, the court \nrefused to create a similar right to assisted suicide. Here the Court \nheld that the Due Process Clause does not recognize a liberty interest \nthat includes a right to commit suicide with another's assistance.\n  In the Seventies, the Court first struck down then upheld state \nstatutes imposing the death penalty for certain crimes. In Furman v. \nGeorgia, 1972, the Court struck down Georgia's death penalty statute \nunder the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment \nand stated that no death penalty law could pass constitutional muster \nunless it took aggravating and mitigating circumstances into account. \nThis decision led Georgia and many States to amend their death penalty \nstatutes and, four years later, in Gregg v. Georgia, 1976, the Supreme \nCourt upheld Georgia's amended death penalty statute.\n  Over the years, the Court has also played a major role in issues of \nwar and peace. In its opinion in Scott v. Sanford, 1857--better known \nas the Dredd Scott decision--the Supreme Court held that Dredd Scott, a \nslave who had been taken into ``free'' territory by his owner, was \nnevertheless still a slave.\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nThe Court further held that Congress lacked the power to abolish \nslavery in certain territories, thereby invalidating the careful \nbalance that had been worked out between the North and the South on the \nissue. Historians have noted that this opinion fanned the flames that \nled to the Civil War.\n  The Supreme Court has also ensured adherence to the Constitution \nduring more recent conflicts. Prominent opponents of the Vietnam War \nrepeatedly petitioned the Court to declare the Presidential action \nunconstitutional on the grounds that Congress had never given the \nPresident a declaration of war. The Court decided to leave this \nconflict in the political arena and repeatedly refused to grant writs \nof certiorari to hear these cases. This prompted Justice Douglas, \nsometimes accompanied by Justices Stewart and Harlan, to take the \nunusual step of writing lengthy dissents to the denials of cert.\n  In New York Times Co. v. United States, 1971--the so called \n``Pentagon Papers'' case--the Court refused to grant the government \nprior restraint to prevent the New York Times from publishing leaked \nDefense Department documents which revealed damaging information about \nthe Johnson Administration and the war effort. The publication of these \ndocuments by the New York Times is believed to have helped move public \nopinion against the war.\n  In its landmark civil rights opinions, the Supreme Court took the \nlead in effecting needed social change, helping us to address \nfundamental questions about our society in the courts rather than in \nthe streets. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court struck down the \nprinciple of ``separate but equal'' education for blacks and whites and \nintegrated public education in this country. This case was then \nfollowed by a series of civil rights cases which enforced the concept \nof integration and full equality for all citizens of this country, \nincluding Gamer v. Louisiana, 1961, Burton v. Wilmington Parking \nAuthority, 1961, and Peterson v. City of Greenville, 1963.\n  In recent years Marbury, Dred Scott, Furman, New York Times, and Roe, \nfamiliar names in the lexicon of lawyerly discussions concerning \nwatershed Supreme Court precedents, have been joined with similarly \nimportant cases like Hamdi, Rasul and Roper--all cases that affect \nfundamental individual rights. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 2004, the Court \nconcluded that although Congress authorized the detention of \ncombatants, due process demands that a citizen held in the United \nStates as an enemy combatant be given a meaningful opportunity to \ncontest the factual basis for that detention before a neutral \ndecisionmaker. The Court reaffirmed the nation's commitment to \nconstitutional principles even during times of war and uncertainty. \nSimilarly, in Rasul v. Bush, 2004, the Court held that the Federal \nhabeas statute gave district courts jurisdiction to hear challenges of \naliens held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in the U.S. War on Terrorism. In \nRoper v. Simmons, a 2005 case, the Court held that executions of \nindividuals who were under 18 years of age at the time of their capital \ncrimes is prohibited by Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n  When deciding issues of such great national import, the Supreme Court \nis rarely unanimous. In fact, a large number of seminal Supreme Court \ndecisions have been reached through a vote of 5-4. Such a close margin \nreveals that these decisions are far from foregone conclusions \ndistilled from the meaning of the Constitution, reason and the \napplication of legal precedents. On the contrary, these major Supreme \nCourt opinions embody critical decisions reached on the basis of the \npreferences and views of each individual justice. In a case that is \ndecided by a vote of 5-4, an individual justice has the power by his or \nher vote to change the law of the land.\n  Since the beginning of its October 2005 Term when Chief Justice \nRoberts first began hearing cases, the Supreme Court has issued 11 \ndecisions with a 5-4 split out of a total of 93 decisions. It has also \nissued 4 5-3 decisions in which one justice recused. Finally, it has \nissued a rare 5-2 decision in which Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito took no part. In sum, since the beginning of its October 2005 \nTerm, the Supreme Court has issued l6 decisions establishing the law of \nthe land in which only 5 justices explicitly concurred. Many of these \nnarrow majorities occur in decisions involving the Court's \ninterpretation of our Constitution--a sometimes divisive endeavor on \nthe Court. I will not discuss all 16 thinly decided cases but will \ndescribe a few to illustrate my point about the importance of the Court \nand its decisions in the lives of Americans.\n  The first 5-4 split decision, decided on January 11, 2006, was Brown \nv. Sanders. In this case the Court considered ``the circumstances in \nwhich an invalidated sentencing factor will render a death sentence \nunconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the \naggravation scale in the jury's weighing process.'' A majority of the \nCourt held that henceforth in death penalty cases, an invalidated \nsentencing factor will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason \nof its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale unless one \nof the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give \naggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances. The majority \nopinion was authored by Justice Scalia and joined by Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas. Justice Stevens \nfiled a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter joined. Similarly, \nJustice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg \njoined.\n  Last November the Supreme Court decided Ayers v. Belmontes, a capital \nmurder case in which the Belmontes contended that California law and \nthe trial court's instructions precluded the jury from considering his \nforward looking mitigation evidence suggesting he could lead a \nconstructive life while incarcerated. In Ayers the Supreme Court found \nthe Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the jury was precluded by jury \ninstructions from considering mitigation evidence. Justice Kennedy \nauthored the majority opinion while Justice Stevens wrote a dissent \njoined by three other justices.\n  Other 5-4 split decisions since October 2005 include United States v. \nGonzalez-Lopez, concerning whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \nto counsel was violated when a district court refused to grant his paid \nlawyer permission to represent him based upon some past ethical \nviolation by the lawyer, June 26, 2006; LULAC v. Perry, deciding \nwhether the 2004 Texas redistricting violated provisions of the Voting \nRights Act, June 28, 2006; Kansas v. Marsh, concerning the Eighth and \nFourteenth Ariiendments in a capital murder case in which the defense \nargued that a Kansas statute established an unconstitutional \npresumption in favor of the death sentence when aggravating and \nmitigating factors were in equipoise, April 25, 2006; Clark v. Arizona, \na capital murder case involving the constitutionality of an Arizona \nSupreme Court precedent governing the admissibility of evidence to \nsupport an insanity defense, June 29, 2006; Garcetti v. Ceballos, a \ncase holding that when public employees make statements pursuant to \ntheir official duties they are not speaking as citizens for First \nAmendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their \ncommunications from employer discipline, May 30, 2006.\n  The justices have split 5-3 4 times since October 2005.\n  In Georgia v. Randolph, March 22, 2006, a 5-3 majority of the Supreme \nCourt held that a physically present co-occupant's stated refusal to \npermit a warrantless entry and search rendered the search unreasonable \nand invalid as to that occupant. Justice Souter authored the majority \nopinion. Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion as did Justice \nBreyer. The Chief Justice authored a dissent joined by Justice Scalia. \nMoreover, Justice Scalia issued his own dissent as did Justice Thomas. \nIn Randolph, there were six opinions in all from a Court that only has \nnine justices. One can only imagine the spirited debate and interplay \nof ideas, facial expressions and gestures that occurred in oral \narguments. Audio recordings are simply inadequate to capture all of the \nnuance that only cameras could capture and convey.\n  In House v. Bell, a 5-3 opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, (June \n12, 2006), the Supreme Court held that because House had made the \nstringent showing required by the actual innocence exception to \njudicially-established procedural default rules, he\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\ncould challenge his conviction even after exhausting his regular \nappeals. Justice Alito took no part in considering or deciding the \nHouse case. It bears noting, however, that if one justice had been on \nthe other side of this decision it would have resulted in a 4-4 tie \nand, ultimately, led to affirming the lower court's denial of House's \npost-conviction habeas petitions due to a procedural default.\n  In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a 5-3 decision in which Chief Justice Roberts \ntook no part, the Supreme Court held that Hamdan could challenge his \ndetention and the jurisdiction of the President's military commissions \nto try him despite recent enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act. A \nthin majority of the justices supported the decision despite knowledge \nthat the DTA explicitly provides ``no court . . . shall have \njurisdiction to hear or consider . . . an application for . . . habeas \ncorpus filed by . . . an alien detained . . . at Guantanamo Bay.'' In \ndeciding the merits, the Court went on to hold that the President \nlacked authority to establish a military commission to try Hamdan or \nothers without enabling legislation passed by both houses of Congress \nand enacted into law. This case was one of a handful of recent cases in \nwhich the Supreme Court released audiotapes or oral arguments almost \nimmediately after they occurred. Yet it would have been vastly \npreferable to watch the parties' advocates grapple with the legal \nissues as the justices peppered them with jurisdictional, \nconstitutional and merits-related questions from the High Court's \nbench.\n  In another fascinating 5-3 case, Jones v. Flowers, April 26, 2006, \nSupreme Court considered whether, when notice of a tax sale is mailed \nto the owner and returned undelivered, the government must take \nadditional reasonable steps to provide notice before taking the owner's \nproperty. In an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court held that \nwhere the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands had mailed Jones a \ncertified letter and it had been returned unclaimed, the Commissioner \nhad to take additional reasonable steps to provide Jones notice. \nJustices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy dissented and Justice Alito took no \npart in the decision.\n  Though Jones v. Flowers involved the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment, not the Takings Clause of Fifth Amendment, one \ncould draw interesting analogies to the Court's controversial 2005 \ndecision in Kelo v. City of New London. In Kelo, a majority of the \njustices held that a city's exercise of eminent domain power in \nfurtherance of a privately initiated economic development plan \nsatisfied the Constitution's Fifth Amendment ``public use'' requirement \ndespite the absence of any blight. Four justices dissented in Kelo and \npublic opinion turned sharply against the decision immediately after it \nwas issued.\n  It's possible, though merely speculation, that the public ire aimed \nat Kelo informed what became a majority of justices in Jones v. \nFlowers. In a passage by Chief Justice Roberts, the Court notes, ``when \na letter is returned by the post office, the sender will ordinarily \nattempt to resend it, if it is practicable to do so. This is especially \ntrue when, as here, the subject matter of the letter concerns such an \nimportant and irreversible prospect as the loss of a house.''\n  Not only lawyers but all homeowners could benefit from knowing how \nthe Court grapples with legal issues governing the rights to their \nhouses. My legislation creates the opportunity for all interested \nAmericans to watch the Court in action in cases like these. From his \nperch on the High Court one justice has been heard to contend that most \nAmericans could care less about the arcane legal issues argued before \nthe Court. But as elected representatives of the people we must \nendeavor to view America from a bottoms-up, rather than a top-down \nperspective.\n  Regardless of ones view concerning the merits of these decisions, it \nis clear that they frequently have a profound effect on the interplay \nbetween the government, on the one hand, and the individual on the \nother. So, it is with these watershed decisions in mind that I \nintroduce legislation designed to make the Supreme Court less esoteric \nand more accessible to common men and women who are so clearly affected \nby its decisions.\n  Given the enormous significance of each vote cast by each justice on \nthe Supreme Court, televising the proceedings of the Supreme Court will \nallow sunlight to shine brightly on these proceedings and ensure \ngreater public awareness and scrutiny.\n  In a democracy, the workings of the government at all levels should \nbe open to public view. With respect to oral arguments, the more \nopenness and the more real the opportunity for public observation the \ngreater the understanding and trust. As the Supreme Court observed in \nthe 1986 case of Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, ``People in an \nopen society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but \nit is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from \nobserving.''\n  It was in this spirit that the House of Representatives opened its \ndeliberations to meaningful public observation by allowing C-SPAN to \nbegin televising debates in the House chamber in 1979. The Senate \nfollowed the House's lead in 1986 by voting to allow television \ncoverage of the Senate floor.\n  Beyond this general policy preference for openness, however, there is \na strong argument that the Constitution requires that television \ncameras be permitted in the Supreme Court.\n  It is well established that the Constitution guarantees access to \njudicial proceedings to the press and the public. In 1980, the Supreme \nCourt relied on this tradition when it held in Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia that the right of a public trial belongs not just to the \naccused, but to the public and the press as well. The Court noted that \nsuch openness has ``long been recognized as an indisputable attribute \nof an Anglo-American trial.''\n  Recognizing that in modern society most people cannot physically \nattend trials, the Court specifically addressed the need for access by \nmembers of the media: ``Instead of acquiring information about trials \nby first hand observation or by word of mouth from those who attended, \npeople now acquire it chiefly through the print and electronic media. \nIn a sense, this validates the media claim of acting as surrogates for \nthe public. [Media presence] contributes to public understanding of the \nrule of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the entire \ncriminal justice system.''\n  To be sure, a strong argument can be made that forbidding television \ncameras in the court, while permitting access to print and other media, \nconstitutes an impermissible discrimination against one type of media \nover another. In recent years, the Supreme Court and lower courts have \nrepeatedly held that differential treatment of different media is \nimpermissible under the First Amendment absent an overriding \ngovernmental interest. For example, in 1983 the Court invalidated \ndiscriminatory tax schemes imposed only upon certain types of media in \nMinneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue. In \nthe 1977 case of ABC v. Cuomo, the Second Circuit rejected the \ncontention by the two candidates for mayor of New York that they could \nexclude some members of the media from their campaign headquarters by \nproviding access through invitation only. The Court wrote that: ``Once \nthere is a public function, public comment, and participation by some \nof the media, the First Amendment requires equal access to all of the \nmedia or the rights of the First Amendment would no longer be \ntenable.''\n  However, in the 1965 case of Estes v. Texas, the Supreme Court \nrejected the argument that the denial of television coverage of trials \nviolates the equal protection clause. In the same opinion, the Court \nheld that the presence of television cameras in the Court had violated \na Texas defendant's right to due process. Subsequent opinions have cast \nserious doubt upon the continuing relevance of both prongs of the Estes \nopinion.\n  In its 1981 opinion in Chandler v. Florida, the court recognized that \nEstes must be read narrowly in light of the state of television \ntechnology at that time. The television coverage of Estes' 1962 trial \nrequired cumbersome equipment, numerous additional microphones, yards \nof new cables, distracting lighting, and numerous technicians present \nin the courtroom. In contrast, the court noted, television coverage in \n1980 can be achieved\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nthrough the presence of one or two discreetly placed cameras without \nmaking any perceptible change in the atmosphere of the courtroom. \nAccordingly, the Court held that, despite Estes, the presence of \ntelevision cameras in a Florida trial was not a violation of the rights \nof the defendants in that case. By the same logic, the holding in Estes \nthat exclusion of television cameras from the courts did not violate \nthe equal protection clause must be revisited in light of the \ndramatically different nature of television coverage today.\n  Given the strength of these arguments, it is not surprising that over \nthe last two decades there has been a rapidly growing acceptance of \ncameras in American courtrooms which has reached almost every court \nexcept for the Supreme Court itself.\n  On September 6, 2000, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts held a hearing titled \n``Allowing Cameras and Electronic Media in the Courtroom.'' The primary \nfocus of the hearing was Senate bill S. 721, legislation introduced by \nSenators Grassley and Schumer that would give Federal judges the \ndiscretion to allow television coverage of court proceedings. One of \nthe witnesses at the hearing, the late Judge Edward R. Becker, then-\nChief Judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, spoke in \nopposition to the legislation and the presence of television cameras in \nthe courtroom. The remaining five witnesses, however, including a \nFederal judge, a State judge, a law professor and other legal experts, \nall testified in favor of the legislation. They argued that cameras in \nthe courts would not disrupt proceedings but would provide the kind of \naccountability and access that is fundamental to our system of \ngovernment.\n  On November 9, 2005, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing to \naddress whether Federal court proceedings should be televised generally \nand to consider S. 1768, my earlier version of this bill, and S. 829, \nSenator Grassley's ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2005.'' During \nthe November 9 hearing, most witnesses spoke favorably of cameras in \nthe courts, particularly at the appellate level. Among the witnesses \nfavorably disposed toward the cameras were Peter Irons, author of May \nIt Please the Court, Seth Berlin, a First Amendment expert at a local \nfirm, Brian Lamb, founder of C-SPAN, Henry Schleif of Court TV \nNetworks, and Barbara Cochran of the Radio-Television News Directors \nAssociation and Foundation.\n\n  The notable exception was the Honorable Judge Jan DuBois of the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania, who testified on behalf of the \nJudicial Conference. Judge DuBois warned of problems particularly at \nthe trial level, where witnesses who appear uncomfortable because of \ncameras might seem less credible to jurors. I note, however, that \nappellate courts do not appear susceptible to this criticism because \nthere are no witnesses or jurors present for appellate arguments.\n  The Judiciary Committee considered and passed both bills on March 30, \n2006. The Committee vote to report S. 1768 was 12-6, and the bill was \nplaced on the Senate Legislative Calendar. Unfortunately, due to the \npress of other business neither bill was allotted time on the Senate \nFloor.\n  During their confirmation hearings over the past two years, Chief \nJustice John Roberts stated he would keep an open mind on the issue and \nJustice Alito stated that as a circuit judge he unsuccessfully voted \n(in the minority) to permit televised open proceedings in the Third \nCircuit. I applaud the fact the new Chief Justice has taken steps to \nmake the Court more open and to ensure the timely publication of audio \nrecordings of the arguments as well as the written transcripts.\n  In my judgment, Congress, with the concurrence of the President, or \noverriding his veto, has the authority to require the Supreme Court to \ntelevise its proceedings. Such a conclusion is not free from doubt and \nis highly likely to be tested with the Supreme Court, as usual, having \nthe final word. As I see it, there is clearly no constitutional \nprohibition against such legislation.\n  Article 3 of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the \nUnited States shall be vested ``in one Supreme Court and such inferior \nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' \nWhile the Constitution specifically creates the Supreme Court, it left \nit to Congress to determine how the Court would operate. For example, \nit was Congress that fixed the number of justices on the Supreme Court \nat nine. Likewise, it was Congress that decided that any six of these \njustices are sufficient to constitute a quorum of the Court. It was \nCongress that decided that the term of the Court shall commence on the \nfirst Monday in October of each year, and it was Congress that \ndetermined the procedures to be followed whenever the Chief Justice is \nunable to perform the duties of his office.\n  Beyond such basic structural and operational matters, Congress also \ncontrols more substantive aspects of the Supreme Court. Most \nimportantly, it is Congress that in effect determines the appellate \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the Constitution itself \nsets out the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, it provides that such \njurisdiction exist ``with such exceptions and under such regulations as \nthe Congress shall make.''\n  Some objections have been raised to televised proceedings of the \nSupreme Court on the ground that it would subject justices to undue \nsecurity risks. My own view is such concerns are vastly overstated. \nWell-known members of Congress walk on a regular basis in public view \nin the Capitol complex. Other very well-known personalities, \npresidents, vice presidents, cabinet officers, all are on public view \nwith even incumbent presidents exposed to risks as they mingle with the \npublic. Such risks are minimal in my view given the relatively minor \nensure that Supreme Court justices would undertake through television \nappearances. Also, any concerns could be mitigated by focusing only on \nthe attorneys presenting arguments. There is no requirement that the \njustices permit the cameras to focus on the bench.\n  As I explained earlier, the Supreme Court could, of course, permit \ntelevision through its own rule but has decided not to do so. Congress \nshould be circumspect and even hesitant to impose a rule mandating the \ntelevising of Supreme Court proceedings and should do so only in the \nface of compelling public policy reasons. The Supreme Court has such a \ndominant role in key decision-making functions that their proceedings \nought to be better known to the public; and, in the absence of Court \nrule, public policy would be best served by enactment of legislation \nrequiring the televising of Supreme Court proceedings.\n  This legislation embodies sound policy and will prove valuable to the \npublic. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Homeland Security and Neighborhood \nSafety Trust Fund and refocus Federal priorities toward securing the \nHomeland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homeland \nSecurity Trust Fund Act of 2007. I introduced this legislation in the \nlast Congress, and I do so again because it is my sincere belief that \nin order to better prevent attacks here at home, we must dramatically \nreorder the priorities of the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n  This legislation says in basic terms that we value the security of \nall Americans over the tax cuts for our Nation's millionaires. Right \nnow, we under fund homeland security and public safety, and at the same \ntime, we have established extremely large tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us. This legislation will re-set our priorities by creating a \nhomeland security trust fund that will set aside $53.3 billion \ndollars--less than one year of the tax cut for millionaires--for the \nexclusive purpose of investing in our homeland security. Through this \ntrust fund we will allocate an additional $10 billion per year over the \nnext 5 years to enhance the safety and security of our communities.\n  Everyone in this body knows that we are not yet safe enough. \nIndependent experts, law enforcement personnel, and first responders \nhave warned us that we have not done enough to prevent an attack and we \nare ill-equipped to respond to one. Hurricane Katrina showed us that \nlittle has been done to enhance our preparedness and the devastating \nconsequences of our failure to act responsibly here in Washington. And, \njust over a year ago, the 9/11 Commission issued their report card on \nthe Administration's and Congresses' progress in implementing their \nrecommendations. The result was a report card riddled with D's and F's.\n  Last November, the American people voted for a change and their \ndecision ushered in a new Democratic Congress. Under new leadership, we \nhave made a decision to implement the 9/11 Recommendations. I have long \nargued that we need to take these prudent steps, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to see that this is done, but under the \nproposals currently being circulated we do not put forward any \ndedicated funding to pay for these security upgrades.\n  I believe that the most important responsibility of our Federal \nGovernment is to provide for the safety and security of the American \npeople. And, I also believe that we need to do this in a fiscally \nresponsible way. Secretary Chertoff has argued that one strategy of Al \nQaeda is to bankrupt us by forcing us to invest too much in our \ndomestic security.\n  This is an outrageous claim. This is simply a matter of priorities.\n  This year the tax cut for Americans that make over $1 million is \nnearly $60 billion. Let me repeat that, just one year of the Bush tax \ncut for Americans making over $1 million dollars is nearly $60 billion. \nIn contrast, we dedicate roughly one-half of that--approximately $34 \nbillion--to fund the operations of the Department of Homeland Security. \nWe have invested twice as much for a tax cut for millionaires--less \nthan 1 percent of the population--than we do for the Department \nintended to help secure the entire Nation.\n\n  For a Nation that is repeatedly warned about the grave threats we \nface, how can this be the right priority? The Homeland Security Trust \nFund Act of 2007 would change this by taking less than 1 year of the \ntax cut for millionaires and invest it in homeland security over the \nnext 5 years.\n  By investing $10 billion per year over the next 5 years, we could \nimplement all the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We could hire 50,000 \nadditional police officers and help local agencies create locally based \ncounter-terrorism units. We could hire an additional 1,000 FBI agents \nto help ensure that FBI is able to implement critical reforms without \nabandoning its traditional crime fighting functions. We could also \ninvest in security upgrades within our critical infrastructure, fund \nefforts to implement 100 percent scanning of cargo containers, fund a \ngrant program to ensure that our first responders can talk in the event \nof an emergency, and nearly double the funding for state homeland \nsecurity grants. And, the list goes on.\n  To add to the concerns that we face with respect to homeland \nsecurity, crime is unquestionably on the rise in the United States. The \nFBI reported earlier this past fall that violent crime and murders are \non the rise after years of decreases. Given all of this, it is hard to \nargue that we are as safe as we should be.\n  We know that the murder rate is up and that there is an officer \nshortage in communities throughout the nation. Yet, we provide $0 \nfunding for the COPS hiring program, and we've slashed funding for the \nJustice Assistance Grant.\n  We know that our first responders can't talk because they don't have \nenough interoperable equipment and available spectrum. Yet, we have not \nforced the networks to turn over critical spectrum, and we vote down \nfunding to help local agencies purchase equipment every year.\n  We know that only 5 percent of cargo containers are scanned, yet we \ndo not invest in the personnel and equipment to upgrade our systems.\n  We know that our critical infrastructure is vulnerable. Yet, we allow \nindustry to decide what is best and provide scant resources to harden \nsoft targets.\n  I am hopeful that this will change under the new Democratic Congress, \nand this legislation will help ensure that we do all this in a fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n  In addition, this legislation will also establish an independent \nagency whose sole purpose will be to make recommendations to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security with respect to distributing homeland \nsecurity with respect to risk and vulnerabilities, to improve the grant \nmaking process to ensure that all spending is made towards the common \ngoal of improving preparedness and response, and to eliminate any waste \nof our precious homeland security resources. This board will be \ncomprised of experts at the Federal, State and local level, with law \nenforcement and first responder experience to ensure that all \nstakeholders' viewpoints are considered in the recommendation process.\n  I will conclude where I started. This is all about setting the right \npriorities for America. Instead of giving a tax cut to the richest \nAmericans who don't need it, we should take some of it and dedicate it \ntowards the security of all Americans. Our Nations most fortunate are \njust as patriotic as the middle class. They are just as willing to \nsacrifice for the good of our Nation. The problem is that no one has \nasked them to sacrifice.\n  The Homeland Security Trust Fund Act of 2007 will ask them to \nsacrifice, and I am convinced that they will gladly help us out. And to \nthose who say this won't work, I would remind them that the 1994 Crime \nBill established the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, specifically \ndesignated for public safety that put more than 100,000 cops on the \nstreet, funded prevention programs, and more prison beds to lock up \nviolent offenders. It worked; violent crime went down every year for 8 \nyears from the historic highs to the lowest levels in a generation.\n  Our Nation is at its best when we all pull together and sacrifice. \nThe bottom line is that with this legislation, we make clear what our \nnational priorities should be, we set out how we will pay for them, and \nwe ensure those who are asked to sacrifice that money the government \nraises for security actually gets spent on security.\n  This legislation is about re-ordering our homeland security \npriorities. I will push for its prompt passage, and I hope to gain the \nsupport of my colleagues in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 348. A bill to improve the amendments made by the No Child Left \nBehind Act of 2001; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I introduce the Improving No Child \nLeft Behind (INCLB) Act. As a father and a legislator, I am committed \nto advocating for public education in Idaho and throughout the Nation. \nEnsuring that every child receives a good education is one of my top \npriorities. President Bush's sweeping education reforms included in the \nNo Child Left Behind Act have had measurable positive effects on many \nstudents across the country, and I support the law's objective of \nensuring that every child achieves his or her potential.\n  However, five years after passage of the law, it is now appropriate \nto review opportunities for needed improvements to the underlying \nprogram. After conferring with a number of organizations in Idaho and \nat the national level, I have identified implementation concerns that \nseem common to various stakeholder groups. In response, I have created \nthe INCLB Act. This bill contains a number of workable, common-\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nsense modifications to the law. These provisions preserve the major \nfocus on student achievement and accountability and, at the same time, \nensure that schools and school districts are accurately and fairly \nassessed. The act ensures that local schools and districts have more \nflexibility and control in educating our Nation's children. The goal of \nthe act is expressed in its name: to improve No Child Left Behind.\n  The bill does a number of things: INCLB would allow supplemental \nservices like tutoring to be offered to students sooner than they are \ncurrently available; INCLB would provide flexibility for States to use \nadditional types of assessment models for measuring student progress; \nINCLB grants states more flexibility in assessing students with \ndisabilities; INCLB would ensure more fair and accurate assessments of \nLimited English Proficiency (LEP) students; INCLB would create a \nstudent testing participation range, providing flexibility for \nuncontrollable variations in student attendance; INCLB would allow \nschools to target resources to those student populations who need the \nmost attention by applying sanctions only when the same student group \nfails to make adequate progress in the same subject for two consecutive \nyears; and INCLB would ensure that students are counted properly and \naccurately in assessment and reporting systems.\n  Taken together, these provisions reflect a realistic assessment of \nboth the strengths and weaknesses of No Child Left Behind. While there \nmay be many issues that divide us, our responsibility in education is \nclear. We must promote successful, meaningful public education for our \nchildren. The INCLB Act will ensure that NCLB continues to be an avenue \nto success for educators and students throughout Idaho and the Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 348\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Our judicial system is a secret to many people across \nthe country. Letting the sun shine in on Federal courtrooms will give \nAmericans an opportunity to better understand the judicial process. It \nis the best way to maintain confidence and accountability in the system \nand help judges do a better job.\n  For decades, States such as my home State of Iowa have allowed \ncameras in their courtrooms, with great results. As a matter of fact, \nonly the District of Columbia prohibits trial and appellate court \ncoverage entirely. Nineteen States allow news coverage in most courts; \nfifteen allow coverage with slight restrictions; and the remaining \nsixteen allow coverage with stricter rules.\n  The bill I'm introducing today, along with Senator Schumer and eight \nother cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, including Judiciary \nChairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter, will greatly improve public \naccess to Federal courts. It lets Federal judges open their courtrooms \nto television cameras and other electronic media.\n  The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act is full of provisions that ensure \nthat the introduction of cameras and other broadcasting devices into \nthe courtrooms goes as smoothly as it has at the State level. First, \nthe presence of the cameras in Federal trial and appellate courts is at \nthe sole discretion of the judges--it is not mandatory. The bill also \nprovides a mechanism for Congress to study the effects of this \nlegislation on our judiciary before making this change permanent \nthrough a three-year sunset provision. The bill also protects the \nprivacy and safety of non-party witnesses by giving them the right to \nhave their faces and voices obscured. Finally, it includes a provision \nto protect the due process rights of any party, and prohibits the \ntelevising of jurors.\n  We need to bring the Federal judiciary into the 21st Century. This \nbill improves public access to and therefore understanding of our \nFederal courts. It has safety provisions to ensure that the cameras \nwon't interfere with the proceedings or with the safety or due process \nof anyone involved in the cases. Our States have allowed news coverage \nof their courtrooms for decades. It is time we join them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize ecosystem restoration projects for the \nIndian River Lagoon-South and the Picayune Strand, Collier County, in \nthe State of Florida; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation authorizing two important Everglades projects: the Indian \nRiver Lagoon, IRL, and the Picayune Strand Restoration, PSR. Senator \nMel Martinez has joined me as an original cosponsor.\n  These two projects constitute the first phase of the overall \nrestoration of the Everglades. IRL at the northern tip of the \nEverglades ecosystem and PSR in the southwest section of the \nEverglades--are essential to getting the water right. IRL will restore \nnatural sheet flow to the Everglades ecosystem by re-directing water to \nthe Everglades instead of out to the ocean, provide reservoirs for \nstorage of water in the wet season and release in the dry season, build \nstormwater treatment facilities to improve the water quality of the \nwater flowing through the Everglades ecosystem and remove millions of \ncubic yards of muck from the St. Lucie Estuary.\n  I toured the St. Lucie River when it turned phosphorescent green \nduring an algae bloom and what was more amazing to me was that I saw \nabsolutely no wildlife, it was a dead river.\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n  PSR will re-establish the natural sheet flow to the Ten Thousand \nIslands, restore 72,320 acres of habitat, and restore ecological \nconnectivity of the Florida Panthers National Wildlife Refuge, the \nBelle Meade State Conservation and Recreation Lands Project Area and \nthe Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve. For these reasons, the Indian \nRiver Lagoon and Picayune Strand projects must be authorized and \ncompleted.\n  Last year we came close to meeting that goal, as the projects were \nincluded in the Senate passed WRDA 2006. Today I am renewing this \neffort and will work to ensure these projects are included in WRDA \n2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Commission on Entitlement \nSolvency; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein to introduce the Social Security and Medicare Solvency \nCommission Act.\n  Our country is facing a looming financial crisis. The Medicare and \nSocial Security programs face major financial problems. Current trends \nshow that these programs are not sustainable, and that if we do not \ntake action soon to reform both these programs, they will drive Federal \nspending to unprecedented levels.\n  Without reform, spending on these programs will consume nearly all \nprojected federal revenues, and threaten our country's future \nprosperity. Social Security costs are projected to rise from about 4.2 \npercent of gross domestic product today to 6.3 percent of gross \ndomestic product by 2080. Similarly, Medicare expenditures are \nprojected to rise from 2.7 percent of gross domestic product today to \nmore than 11 percent of gross domestic product by 2080. At this rate, \nno money will be left for any other federal activity. There will be no \nmoney for education, defense, federal law enforcement, or any of our \nother valued social programs.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernacke and GAO Comptroller Walker \nhave testified in front of the Senate Budget Committee in recent weeks \nthat entitlement spending is already a threat to the U.S. economy. \nHowever, despite the universal recognition of out of control \nentitlement spending growth and the problems this will cause, Congress \nhas repeatedly failed to come together to work on a solution.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will create a bipartisan \ncommission tasked with making recommendations and creating legislation \nthat will ensure the solvency of both Social Security and Medicare. \nHowever, unlike past commissions, these recommendations will not sit on \na shelf and collect dust. This legislation will force action by \nCongress.\n  This legislation mandates that the commission seek public input \nthrough a series of public hearings, and then requires the commission \nto put together a report and submit accompanying legislative language. \nHowever, then this bill goes further. It sets a mandatory timelines for \nCongress to introduce the legislation, take committee action and for \naction on the floor. In short, it forces Congress to do its job.\n  When this legislation passes, Congress will be forced to take action \nthat will generate a sustainable Social Security and Medicare system. \nAnd, most importantly, this will be a bipartisan effort. I am very \npleased that my distinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein has joined \nme in taking up this cause.\n  Though highly challenging, the financial difficulties facing Social \nSecurity and Medicare are not insurmountable. But the time has come to \ntake action. The sooner these challenges are addressed, the more \nsolutions will be available to us and the less pain they will cause. We \nneed serious and thoughtful engagement from everyone to make sure that \nMedicare and Social Security are strengthened and sustainable for \nfuture generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Upon such \n     introduction, the Commission bill shall be referred to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress under paragraph (2). If \n     the Commission bill is not introduced in accordance with the \n     preceding sentence, then any member of Congress may introduce \n     the Commission bill in their respective House of Congress \n     beginning on the date that is the 5th calendar day that such \n     House is in session following the date of the submission of \n     the Commission report under section 3(c)(2)(A).\n       (2) Committee consideration.--\n       (A) Referral.--A Commission bill introduced in the Senate \n     shall be referred to the Committee on Finance of the Senate. \n     A Commission bill introduced in the House of Representatives \n     shall be referred jointly to the Committee on Ways and Means \n     and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (B) Reporting.--Not later than 60 calendar days after the \n     introduction of the Commission bill, each Committee of \n     Congress to which the Commission bill was referred shall \n     report the bill.

A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed is agreed \n     to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the motion to \n     proceed is agreed to, the Senate shall immediately proceed to \n     consideration of the Commission bill without intervening \n     motion, order, action, or other business, and the Commission \n     bill shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until \n     disposed of.\n       (C) Limited debate.--\n       (i) In general.--Consideration in the Senate of the \n     Commission bill and all amendments to such bill, and on all \n     debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall \n     be limited to not more than 40 hours, which shall be equally \n     divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader and \n     the minority leader of the Senate or their designees. A \n     motion further to limit debate on the Commission bill is in \n     order and is not debatable. All time used for consideration \n     of the Commission bill, including time used for quorum calls \n     (except quorum calls immediately preceding a vote), shall \n     come from the 40 hours of consideration.\n       (ii) Recommital to committee.--Upon expiration of the 40-\n     hour period provided under clause (i), the Commission bill \n     shall be recommitted to committee for further consideration \n     unless \\3/5\\ of the Members, duly chosen and sworn, of the \n     Senate agree to proceed to passage.

The motion is not debatable and is not \n     subject to a motion to postpone consideration of the \n     Commission bill or to proceed to the consideration of other \n     business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n     to proceed is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in \n     order. If the motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of \n     Representatives shall immediately proceed to consideration of \n     the Commission bill without intervening motion, order, \n     action, or other business, and the Commission bill shall \n     remain the unfinished business of the House of \n     Representatives until disposed of.\n       (C) Limited debate.--\n       (i) In general.--Consideration in the House of \n     Representatives of the Commission bill and all amendments to \n     such bill, and on all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 40 \n     hours, which shall be equally divided between, and controlled \n     by, the majority leader and the minority leader of the House \n     of Representatives or their designees.

Mr. President, as the new Congress begins work, I am \npleased to join with Senator Domenici in addressing one of the most \nserious and intractable problems facing the Nation--restoring the long-\nterm fiscal health of Social Security and Medicare.\n  Today we propose a bipartisan, independent and permanently existing \ncommission to return these essential programs to solid financial \nfooting for generations to come.\n  Our legislation mandates the periodic, comprehensive review of Social \nSecurity and Medicare to ensure their present and future solvency. By a \nyear from the date of enactment, it requires the Commission to devise \nand recommend to Congress and the President a benefit and revenue \nstructure that allows Social Security and Medicare to become, once \nagain, stable and effective.\n  A key aspect of the bill is that its mission is ongoing indefinitely. \nEvery five years the Commission returns with new recommendations--small \ntweaks or larger adjustments, whatever is necessary--to keep these \nentitlement programs in actuarial balance.\n  Since 2005, the President, Congress and the Nation have stalemated \nover the issue of privatizing Social Security. The issue remains \ncontentious. Recent press articles suggest the Administration would be \nprepared to drop carve out accounts as the price of overall reform.\n  Meanwhile, the Social Security funding shortfall is projected to \nballoon to roughly $4.6 trillion over the next 75 years to pay all \nscheduled benefits. This unfunded obligation has increased by $600 \nbillion alone over the last year. Medicare is in far worse shape, \nneeding $11.3 trillion over the next seventy-five years to close the \ngap and remain in balance.\n  The 2006 report from the Trustees of Medicare and Social Security is \nalarming to say the least. They describe the current path of spending \nfor both as ``problematic'', ``unsustainable,'' ``severe'', and in \n``poor fiscal shape.'' In sum the Trustees say that ``the problems of \nboth programs are driven by inexorable demographics, and, in the case \nof Medicare, inexorable health care cost inflation, and are not likely \nto be ameliorated by economic growth or mere tinkering with program \nfinancing.''\n  Simple numbers tell the story: growing cash flow deficits will \nexhaust the Medicare trust fund in 2018, and Social Security reserves \nwill be overcome in 2040, according to the Trustees report.\n  Our legislation takes a new approach and is bipartisan to the core. \nInstead of emphasizing the merits of one proposal over another, we wipe \nthe slate clean.\n  Fifteen experts, some of whom are Members of Congress from the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, are appointed. They take a full year to \nconduct town hall meetings nationwide, assess these trillion dollar \nprograms from top to bottom, and rationalize their cost structure \nthrough intensive evaluation.\n  We advocate an open process, where all American voices can be heard. \nWe have learned in the last two years that these issues effectively \nsurpass the Congress' and President's ability to reach a compromise.\n  Relying strictly on elected officials to meet privately and out of \nthe public view to negotiate a multi-trillion agreement I believe risks \nmore failure. We have no demonstrated track record since 2005 of being \nable to achieve bipartisan consensus. And there are no new developments \nof late that suggest a different outcome than more partisan gridlock.\n  I know Majority Leader Reid is instructing on certain members of the \nSenate to gather and discuss these issues in the coming months. I hope \nit works. But I basically share his outlook for the prospects of a \nbipartisan deal: ``It's a tremendous long shot. If you were a Las Vegas \nbookmaker, you'd put the odds pretty [long] for being able to do \nthat.''\n  The Commission we propose would not be offering one-time solutions \nthat get tossed aside and collect dust. Far from it: the Commission's \ndetailed analysis, nonpartisan recommendations and findings are \nprovided in writing and take the form of legislation that Congress \nformally considers.\n  The Senate and House, in turn, through expedited legislative \nprocedures, will hopefully be poised to amend if need be and then enact \nthe changes into law.\n  Compromise, in the form of increasing payroll tax revenues or other \nfees and cutting benefits, is the inevitable reality which we face. \nSenator Domenici and I are focused on creating a pathway to reach that \ncompromise. We do not hold out, today, certain ideas that we believe \nCommission Members ought to consider.\n  We rely on their independent expertise and motivation to derive what \nis best for the Nation. Then we let the chips fall where they may from \nthere.\n  The former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said two \nyears ago that we had little time to waste in fixing Social Security. \nHe endorsed the notion of establishing a Commission, much like the one \nhe led in 1983 that led to historic changes in the program. His \ncongressional testimony bears repeating:\n\n       This is not a hugely difficult problem to solve . . . And I \n     guess what is missing is the fact that at this stage there \n     has been a rather low interest in actually joining, in \n     finding out where some of the agreements are, and I have a \n     suspicion that when that occurs, that will happen. It may \n     well be that some mechanism such as that which we employed in \n     1983 may be a useful mechanism to get groups together and \n     find out where there are agreements. I tend to think what \n     happens in these debates is nobody talks about what they \n     agree about but only about what they differ about. And \n     something has got to give soon because we do not have the \n     choice of not resolving this issue.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan is absolutely right that it is only a matter of \ntime that we implement Social Security reform. That is because 48 \nmillion people, or 1 out of every 6 Americans, depend on it. And by \n2050, an astounding 82 million Americans will receive this guaranteed \nbenefit.\n  For more than 20 percent of retirees, Social Security is it: their \nonly source of income.\n  For half of those 48 million, Social Security keeps them out of \npoverty. And for almost two-thirds, Social Security makes up more than \nhalf of their total income.\n  4.8 million widows and widowers rely on Social Security, as do 6.8 \nmillion disabled workers and 4 million children.\n  The long-term challenges are significant. It is not a crisis, we have \ntime to implement gradual reform over time, but we need to get started.\n  While the current projected shortfall for Social Security amounts to \nabout $4.6 trillion, the fact of the matter is that 100 percent of \nbenefits can be paid until 2040 by some estimates (Social Security \nAdministration) or 2046 by\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nothers (CBO). Beyond that time horizon, 73 percent of benefits can be \npaid.\n  So the bottom line is, there is time, the know-how, and the resources \nto be able to maintain the current system, with phased adjustments \noccurring over many years to the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  The key, of course, is coming to a rational consensus--Democrats and \nRepublicans united--in the effort to make Social Security solvent from \nthis day forward.\n  Most budget experts agree that the Social Security problem pales in \ncomparison to the enormous shortfall facing the Medicare Trust Fund \n(Part A)--over the next 75 years a total of $11.3 trillion. The various \ntechnical estimates are that Medicare is projected to become insolvent \nfar sooner than Social Security.\n  In fact the most recent Medicare Trustees report confirms that the \ntrust fund will be exhausted in 2018, yet the number of beneficiaries \nskyrockets upwards--from 42.7 million now, a number which will double \nby 2030--as the Baby Boom generation ages.\n  Compounding the problem, the Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat Medicare spending will rise to 11 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct by 2080, up from 3.21 percent of GDP in 2006.\n  And the number of those paying into the system gets smaller and \nsmaller: in 2000, 4 workers supported every Medicare beneficiary. That \nnumber shrinks to 2.4 workers per beneficiary by 2030.\n  The plain truth is that surging health care costs need to come under \ncontrol or Medicare faces a dire situation. Because the program is \nfinanced through payroll taxes on working Americans, and general tax \nrevenue, the pressure is building now on working Americans, given the \nhuge demographic changes we expect when Baby Boomers retire.\n  In closing let me share one pertinent fact from the Social Security \nand Medicare Trustees and their 2006 report: ``to the extent that \nchanges are delayed or phased in gradually, greater adjustments in \nscheduled benefits and revenues would be required.'' The time to act is \nnow, and Senator Domenici and I believe that our legislation represents \na reasonable and good faith step for curing what ills these vital \nsafety net programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Burr, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. DeMint, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lott, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. \n        Voinovich):\n  S. 356. A bill to ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully \ninformed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Unborn \nChild Pain Awareness Act. I am joined by 27 original cosponsors.\n  After carefully reviewing the medical and ethical arguments that \nunderpin this Act, I am convinced that my colleagues will agree that \nthis legislation is pro-woman, pro-child, and pro-information.\n  The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act is about empowering women with \ninformation and treating them as adults who are able to participate \nfully in the medical decision-making process. It is also about \nrespecting and treating the unborn child more humanely. This \nlegislation is, at heart, an informed consent bill which would do two \nsimple things: first, this act would require abortion providers to \npresent women seeking an abortion twenty or more weeks after \nfertilization with scientific information about what is known regarding \nthe pain capacity of the unborn child inside of her womb.\n  Second, should the woman desire to continue with the abortion after \nbeing presented with this information, the legislation calls for her to \nbe given the opportunity to choose anesthesia for the unborn child in \norder to lessen its pain.\n  No abortion procedures would be prohibited by the Unborn Child Pain \nAwareness Act. This is strictly an informed consent bill.\n  I don't believe that anyone in this chamber thinks that any patient \nshould ever be denied her right to all the information that is \navailable on a surgery she or her child is about to undergo simply \nbecause the patient is pregnant. Providing a woman with medical and \nscientific information on the development of her unborn child and the \npain the child will experience during an abortion will equip her to \nmake an informed decision about how or if to proceed. Pregnant women \nmust be treated as intelligent, mature human beings who are capable of \nunderstanding this information and making difficult choices.\n  Due to amazing advances in medical technology, we have known for some \ntime now that unborn children can and do respond to pain and to human \ntouch in general. This is evidenced by anatomical, functional, \nphysiological and behavioral indicators that are correlated with pain \nin children and adults.\n  In light of this knowledge, when a child undergoes prenatal surgery \nin order to alleviate certain types of congenital hernias which can \naffect the child's liver and lungs or to correct prenatal heart \nfailure, both the child and the mother are offered anesthesia as a \nmatter of course. Certainly everyone would agree that, at the very \nleast, abortion is a surgical procedure performed on the fetus. Why \nshould the medical community be required to offer anesthesia to one 20-\nweek-old unborn baby undergoing any other type of prenatal surgery, but \nnot require it for another 20-week-old unborn baby who is undergoing \nthe life-terminating surgery of an abortion? Are both babies not at the \nsame stage of development with the same capacity for pain?\n  Of course, this new scientific knowledge that unborn babies can \nexperience pain is not news to most women. Any mother can tell you her \nunborn child can feel and respond to stimuli from outside the womb. \nSometimes a voice or a sharp movement by the mother will cause the \nunborn child to stir. And usually, at some point in the late second \ntrimester, even the father can feel and see the unborn child's \nmovements. And if you push the unborn child's limb, the limb may push \nback. I have many fond memories of feeling my own children kick and \nmove around inside my wife's womb. It was obvious to both of us that \nour children were very much alive.\n  In the proposed legislation, we have settled on a 20-week benchmark \nbecause there is strong medical and scientific knowledge that unborn \nchildren feel and experience pain by 20 weeks after fertilization.\n  Many scientists and anesthesiologists believe that unborn children \nactually feel pain weeks earlier, but we chose the 20 week benchmark as \na point on which the most scientists and doctors can agree.\n  We do know that unborn children at 20 weeks' gestation can not only \nfeel, but that their ability to experience pain is heightened. The \nhighest density of pain receptors per square inch of skin in human \ndevelopment occurs in utero from 20 to 30 weeks gestation.\n  The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act offers us a rare chance to \ntranscend the traditional political boundaries on the abortion issue. \nIt is a matter of human decency, access to information for women, and \npatients' rights.\n  It is my hope that this bill will offer us a chance to work across \npolitical divides to forge new understandings in this chamber.\n  I think that we can all support giving women more information when \nthey are making life-altering decisions.\n  In fact, according to a Wirthlin Worldwide poll conducted after the \n2004 election, 75 percent of respondents favored ``laws requiring that \nwomen who are 20 weeks or more along in their pregnancies be given \ninformation about fetal pain before having an abortion.''\n  During the 2006 elections, candidates from both sides of the aisle \npromised to support bipartisan solutions dealing with abortion, such as \npromoting adoption and passing parental notification requirements for \nminors seeking abortions.\n  Adoption and parental notification for minors are indeed issues on \nwhich I hope we can work together. Perhaps we\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\ncan begin with this measure. The Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act would \nprovide a wonderful opportunity for us to affirm that the 110th \nCongress is pro-woman, pro-child, and pro-patient access to \ninformation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 357. A bill to improve passenger automobile fuel economy and \nsafety, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign \noil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill with my \ncolleagues Senators Snowe, Inouye, Durbin, Kerry, Boxer, Bill Nelson, \nCantwell, Lautenberg, Lieberman, Menendez, and Collins to close the SUV \nloophole.\n  This bill would increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, \nstandards for SUVs and other light duty trucks. It would increase the \ncombined fleet average for all automobiles--SUVs, light trucks and \npassenger cars--from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon by \nmodel year 2019.\n  The high price of oil is not a problem we can drill our way out of. \nGlobal oil demand is rising. China imports more than 40 percent of its \nrecord 6.4 million-barrel-per-day oil demand and its consumption is \ngrowing by 7.5 percent per year, seven times faster than the U.S.\n  India imports approximately 70 percent of its oil, which is projected \nto rise to more than 90 percent by 2020. Their rapidly growing \neconomies are fueling their growing dependence on oil--which makes \ncontinued higher prices inevitable.\n  The most effective step we can take to reduce gas prices is to reduce \ndemand. We must use our finite fuel supplies more wisely.\n  This legislation is an important first step to limit our Nation's \ndependence on oil and better protect our environment.\n  If implemented, closing the SUV Loophole would: save the U.S. 2.1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day by 2025, almost the same amount of oil we \ncurrently import from the Persian Gulf.\n  It would also prevent about 350 million tons of carbon dioxide--the \ntop greenhouse gas and biggest single cause of global warming from \nbeing emitted into our atmosphere by 2025. This is an 18 percent \nreduction, the equivalent of taking 60 million cars--or 50 million cars \nand light trucks--off the road in one year.\n  This bill would also save SUV and light duty truck owners hundreds of \ndollars each year in gasoline costs.\n  CAFE standards were first established in 1975. At that time, light \ntrucks made up only a small percentage of the vehicles on the road, \nthey were used mostly for agriculture and commerce, not as passenger \ncars.\n  Today, our roads look much different, SUVs and light duty trucks \ncomprise more than half of the new car sales in the United States. As a \nresult, the overall fuel economy of our Nation's fleet is the lowest it \nhas been in two decades, because fuel economy standards for these \nvehicles are so much lower than they are for other passenger vehicles.\n  The bill we are introducing today would change that. SUVs and other \nlight duty trucks would have to meet the same fuel economy requirements \nby 2013 that passenger cars meet today.\n  In 2002, the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, released a report \nstating that adequate lead time can bring about substantive increases \nin fuel economy standards. Automakers can meet higher CAFE standards if \nexisting technologies are utilized and included in new models of SUVs \nand light trucks.\n  In 2003, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration said he favored an increase in vehicle fuel economy \nstandards beyond the 1.5-mile-per-gallon hike slated to go into effect \nby 2007. ``We can do better,'' said Jeffrey Runge in an interview with \nCongressional Green Sheets. ``The overriding goal here is better fuel \neconomy to decrease our reliance on foreign oil without compromising \nsafety or American jobs,'' he said.\n  With this in mind, we have developed the following phase-in schedule \nwhich would follow up on what NHTSA has proposed for the short term and \nremain consistent with what the NAS report said is technologically \nfeasible over the next decade or so. As a first step, by model year \n2010, passenger cars must meet an average fuel economy standard of 29.5 \nmpg, and SUVs and light trucks must meet 23.5 mpg. By way of \ncomparison, passenger cars in model year 2005 averaged 30 mpg, light \ntrucks averaged 21.8 mpg, and the overall combined fleet average is \n25.2 mpg.\n  The bill also increases the weight limit within which vehicles are \nbound by CAFE standards to make it harder for automotive manufacturers \nto build SUVs large enough to become exempted from CAFE standards. \nBecause SUVs are becoming larger and larger, some may become so large \nthat they will no longer qualify as even SUVs anymore.\n  We are introducing this legislation because we believe that the \nUnited States needs to take a leadership role in the fight against \nglobal warming.\n  We have already seen the potential destruction that global warming \ncan cause in the United States.\n  Snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada are shrinking and will almost entirely \ndisappear by the end of the century, devastating the source of \nCalifornia's water.\n  Eskimos are being forced inland in Alaska as their native homes on \nthe coastline are melting into the sea.\n  Glaciers are disappearing in Glacier National Park in Montana. In 100 \nyears, the park has gone from having 150 glaciers to fewer than 30. And \nthe 30 that remain are two-thirds smaller than they once were.\n  Beyond our borders, scientists are predicting how the impact of \nglobal warming will be felt around the globe.\n  It has been estimated that two-thirds of the glaciers in western \nChina will melt by 2050, seriously diminishing the water supply for the \nregion's 300 million inhabitants. Additionally, the disappearance of \nglaciers in the Andes in Peru is projected to leave the population \nwithout an adequate water supply during the summer.\n  The United States is the largest energy consumer in the world, with 4 \npercent of the world's population using 25 percent of the planet's \nenergy.\n  And much of this energy is used in cars and light trucks: 43 percent \nof the oil we use goes into our vehicles and one-third of all carbon \ndioxide emissions come from our transportation sector.\n  The U.S. is falling behind the rest of the world in the development \nof more fuel efficient automobiles. Quarterly auto sales reflect that \nconsumers are buying smaller more fuel efficient cars and sales of the \nbig, luxury vehicles that are the preferred vehicle of the American \nautomakers have dropped significantly.\n  Even SUV sales have slowed. First quarter 2005 deliveries of these \nvehicles are down compared to the same period last year--for example, \nsales of the Ford Excursion is down by 29.5 percent, the Cadillac \nEscalade by 19.9 percent, and the Toyota Sequoia by 12.6 percent.\n  On the other hand, the Toyota Prius hybrid had record sales in March \nwith a 160.9 percent increase over the previous year.\n  The struggling U.S. auto market cannot afford to fall behind in the \ndevelopment of fuel efficient vehicles. Our bill sets out a reasonable \ntime frame for car manufacturers to design vehicles that are more fuel \nefficient and that will meet the growing demand for more fuel efficient \nvehicles.\n  We can do this, and we can do this today. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President: I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nFeinstein in introducing probably one of the most important bills we \ncan consider this Congress in terms of energy, economic, and \nenvironmental security: the Ten-In-Ten Fuel Economy Act of 2007. Simply \nput, this bill would raise the average fuel economy standards for all \npassenger cars and light trucks from 25 miles per gallon to 35 miles \nper gallon by the year 2019.\n  While Senator Feinstein and I have taken the lead on this issue, the \nbill we are introducing today is the product of considerable input and \nexpertise provided by our colleagues Senators Snowe, Durbin, and \nCantwell.\n  I also want to thank Senators Kerry, Boxer, Bill Nelson, Lautenberg, \nLieberman, Menendez, and Collins for joining us in this effort.\n  This bill is a win-win for the American public. It will substantially \nreduce America's dependence on foreign oil from unstable governments, \nas well as decrease the amount of harmful emissions coming from our \nnation's passenger vehicles. At the same time, it will save American \nfamilies money by reducing their fuel costs.\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, this bill, if \nenacted, would save 6 billion gallons of gas--equating to $12 billion \nin fuel cost savings for motorists in this country--within 6 years of \nthe first model year requiring improvement.\n  That $12 billion in fuel cost savings also translates into a \nreduction of 65 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions--one of \nthe largest contributors to global warming. This level of savings after \nonly 6 years would be accomplished before the full contribution of the \nbill is achieved.\n  By 2025, assuming today's price for a gallon of gas, enactment of \nthis bill would effectively reduce consumption of foreign oil by 2.1 \nmillion barrels a day by saving over 35 billion gallons of gasoline \nannually. It would provide motorists with $64 billion in fuel cost \nsavings, and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 358 million metric \ntons. This decrease in carbon dioxide emissions would be the equivalent \nof taking 52 million cars and trucks off the road. This incredible \nsavings is achieved by simply raising the fuel economy standard from 25 \nmiles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon in a 10 year period.\n  Some of our colleagues may question whether this proposed standard \ncan be achieved. Let me just note that the Commerce Committee helped \nestablish the first CAFE standards in 1975, against the cries of \ncritics then. History, however, shows that Congress' action then was \nlargely responsible for the Nation's decreased demand for oil during \nthe 1980s necessitated by the Arab Oil Embargo. Since the 1980s, \nhowever, the fuel economy average for cars and light trucks combined \nhas remained essentially flat even though advances in technology have \ncontinued. It is time to update CAFE standards. The benefits gained \nfrom undertaking this endeavor are many, and too long overdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Mikulski, Mr.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\n        Hatch, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Allard, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, Mr. Biden, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Cardin, and \n        Ms. Collins):\n  S. 358. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation with respect to health insurance and employment; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act of 2007 and I am joined in doing so \nby a number of my colleagues including the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Senate HELP Committee, Senators Kennedy and Enzi. The bill we \nare introducing today represents a triumph of bipartisan \ncollaboration--true consensus-building which is so vital to achieving \nsubstantive action for our constituents. Such efforts are certainly not \nalways easy--as so many here today know--I have worked with many of you \nfor more than 10 years on this issue.\n  Today we are on the threshold of a new era, as for the first time, we \nact to prevent discrimination before it has taken firm hold. Indeed, \nSenator Gregg described this legislation so well when he said it is, \ntruly, ``the first civil rights act of the 21st Century.''\n  And that is what makes this legislation so unique. For in the past \nCongress has had to act to address existing discrimination. But today \nwe are acting proactively to address genetic bias, before \ndiscrimination becomes entrenched.\n  This type of discrimination is so different than other forms. Because \nmost discrimination is a response to an obvious trait, such as one's \ngender or the color of your skin. But discrimination based on one's \ngenetic makeup involves actively looking for information on which to \ndiscriminate. Because it is so deliberate, one cannot even argue it \nwas--on any level--subconscious or unintentional.\n  It used to be difficult to find such information on which to \ndiscriminate. You might be asked if you had a family history of a \ndisorder. But today things have changed dramatically.\n  We have long known about a small number of genes which play a role in \nsome diseases--such as Huntington's Disease, and early onset \nAlzheimer's. Yet the progress of discovery and study was so slow and \ntedious. But the Human Genome Project changed all that. Today, with new \ntechnology we are seeing an explosive increase in our understanding of \ngenetics and human health.\n  That growing genetic knowledge offers the potential of disease cures \nand even customized therapies. Even more promising, genetic advances \nwill enable us to actually prevent the development of disease. But this \npotential . . . and the billions spent in discovering genetic \nrelationships and developing treatments and preventive agents . . . \nwill certainly be in vain if Americans do not avail themselves of these \nadvances.\n  To do so, Americans will need to take genetic tests. But would you do \nso if you knew that the information about your genetic makeup would be \nused against you--to deny you employment or health coverage?\n  Some say that kind of discrimination is but a future possibility--\nthat we can afford to wait until genetic discrimination begins to take \na toll. But it already has done so. I learned from the real life \nexperience of one of my constituents, Bonnie Lee Tucker. In 1997, \nBonnie Lee wrote me about her fear of having the BRCA test for breast \ncancer, even though she has nine women in her immediate family who were \ndiagnosed with breast cancer, and she herself is a survivor. She wrote \nto me about her fear of having the BRCA test, because she worried it \nwill ruin her daughter's ability to obtain insurance in the future. And \nBonnie Lee isn't the only one who has this fear. When the National \nInstitutes of Health offered women genetic testing, nearly 32 percent \nof those who were offered a test for breast cancer risk declined to \ntake it citing concerns about health insurance discrimination. Mr. \nPresident, what good is scientific progress if it cannot be applied to \nthose who would most benefit?\n  And we have seen cases where some attempted to mandate genetic \ntesting. Even when this is done to improve the delivery of health care, \nit must be recognized that once that information is disclosed . . . and \nis unprotected . . . a future employer or insurer may not necessarily \nuse that information in such a benign way. Yet we recognize that if an \nindividual can avail themselves of a genetic test, they may be able to \ntake action as a result which prevents disease or premature death, and \nreduces the burden of high health costs. And wouldn't everyone want to \nsee that?\n  I recall the testimony before Congress of Dr. Francis Collins, the \nDirector of the National Human Genome Research Institute, without whom \nwe wouldn't have reached this day. In speaking of the next step for \nthose involved in the Genome project, he explained that the project's \nscientists were engaged in a major endeavor to ``uncover the \nconnections between particular genes and particular diseases,'' to \napply the knowledge they just unlocked. In order to do this, Dr. \nCollins said, ``we need a vigorous research enterprise with the \ninvolvement of large numbers of individuals, so that we can draw more \nprecise connections between a particular spelling of a gene and a \nparticular outcome.'' Well, this effort cannot be successful if people \nare afraid of possible repercussions of their participation in genetic \ntesting.\n  The bottom line is that, given the advances in science, there are two \nseparate issues at hand. The first is to restrict discrimination by \nhealth insurers. The second is to prevent employment discrimination \nbased simply upon an individual's genetic information.\n  Some of us saw this danger 10 years ago and the threat it could pose \nto millions of Americans. I think back to when Representative Louise \nSlaughter and I first introduced our bills to ban genetic \ndiscrimination in health insurance back in the l04th Congress. At that \ntime the completion of the human genome seemed far away. But the \nscience has certainly out-paced Congressional action.\n  The following year, with the commitment of Senators Frist and \nJeffords to address this issue, I introduced a bill to ensure we would \neffectively provide the needed protections to prevent genetic \ndiscrimination in the health insurance industry. In turn, that bill was \nthe basis for an amendment offered by Senator Jeffords, to the Fiscal \nYear 2001 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services \nAppropriations bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 58-40.\n\n  While that victory was a notable step forward, unfortunately, it was \nnot followed by the enactment of our bill. It did, however, re-spark \nthe debate--which helped lay the foundation for our subsequent efforts.\n  Indeed, in March of 2002, I was again joined by Senators Frist and \nJeffords in introducing an updated version of our bill with the added \nsupport of Senator Gregg and Senator Enzi. That bill not only addressed \nwhat had become the real threat of employment discrimination but also \ncaptured the changing world of science as this was the first bill to \ninclude what we had learned with the completion of the Genome Project.\n  In June of 2003, after sixteen months of bipartisan negotiation, we \nachieved a unified, bipartisan agreement to address genetic \ndiscrimination. Today we again introduce the legislation encompassing \nthat agreement, which the Senate has twice passed . . . unanimously.\n  The bill we are introducing again today addresses genetic \ndiscrimination in both employment and health insurance based on the \nfirm foundation of current law. With regard to health insurance, the \nissues are clear and familiar, and something the Senate has debated \nbefore, in the context of the consideration of larger privacy issues. \nIndeed, as Congress considered what is now the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, we also addressed the \nissues of privacy of medical information.\n  Moreover, any legislation that seeks to fully address these issues \nmust consider the interaction of the new protections with the privacy \nrule which was mandated by HIPAA--and our legislation does just that. \nSpecifically, we clarify the protections of genetic information as well \nas information on the request or receipt of genetic tests, from being \nused by the insurer against the patient.\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\n  Because the fact of the matter is, genetic information only detects \nthe potential for a genetically linked disease or disorder--and \npotential does not equal a diagnosis of disease. At the same time, it \nis critical that this information be available to doctors and other \nhealth care professionals when necessary to diagnose, or treat, an \nillness. This is a distinction that begs our acknowledgment, as we \ndiscuss protect patients from potential discriminatory practices by \ninsurers.\n  On the subject of employment discrimination, unlike our legislative \nhistory on debating health privacy matters, the issues surrounding \nprotecting genetic information from workplace discrimination is not as \nextensive. To that end, our bipartisan bill creates these protections \nin the workplace--and there should be no question of this need.\n  As demonstrated by the Burlington Northern case, the threat of \nemployment discrimination is very real, and therefore it is essential \nthat we take this information off the table, so to speak, before the \nuse of this information becomes more widespread. While Congress has not \nyet debated this specific type of employment discrimination, we have a \ngreat deal of employment case law and legislative history on which to \nbuild.\n  Indeed, as we considered the need for this type of protection, we \nagreed that we must extend current law discrimination protections to \ngenetic information. We reviewed current employment discrimination law \nand considered what sort of remedies people would have for instances of \ngenetic discrimination and if these remedies would be different from \nthose available to people under current law--for instance under the ADA \nor the EEOC. The bill we introduce today creates new protections by \nparalleling current law and clarifies the remedies available to victims \nof discrimination. Ensuring that regardless of whether a person is \ndiscriminated against because of their religion, their race or their \nDNA, these people will all receive the same strong protections under \nthe law.\n  Indeed, I believe those who have questioned the need for this \nlegislation will see that if we can provide these protections, then \nindividuals can avail themselves of medical knowledge which will not \nonly improve their health, but will reduce health care costs. For \nemployers attempting to address the escalating cost of coverage, isn't \nit essential to utilize our investment in advancing medical knowledge \nto prevent disease and disability? Isn't that just the sort of action \nwe need to encourage to reduce health costs and make our businesses, \nlarge and small, more competitive?\n  Indeed we have seen the business community recognizing the critical \nimportance of putting our medical investment to work to reduce health \ncosts . . . not discouraging employees from undergoing tests that could \nprevent disease or death. To that end, I noted during the last Congress \nthat IBM pledged to not use genetic information in its hiring practices \nor in deciding eligibility for health insurance coverage. This \ndemonstrates an admirable understanding of how such discrimination can \nharm both individuals and business.\n  It has been more than six years since the completion of the working \ndraft of the Human Genome. Like a book which is never opened, the \nwonders of the Human Genome are useless unless people are willing to \ntake advantage of it. This bill is the product of over a year of \nbipartisan negotiations and is a shining example of what we can \naccomplish if we set aside partisan differences in order to address the \nchallenges facing the American people. Certainly this bill was only \npossible due to the commitment of members working together--setting \naside partisanship--and for that I am grateful.\n  I know I speak for my colleagues when I say that it is my hope that \nwe shall see this bill again receive the unanimous support of the \nSenate and that this will allow the House of Representatives to act \nswiftly to pass this legislation so that the President can sign this \nbill into law and finally ensure the American public is protected from \nthis newest form of discrimination.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce the \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007. It is an honor to \njoin Senator Snowe, Senator Enzi, Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator \nGregg, and other members of our committee in support of this needed \nlegislation.\n  I especially commend Senator Snowe for her leadership in this effort \nto establish protections for the public against genetic discrimination. \nIt is now over a decade since Senator Snowe first introduced \nlegislation on the issue. It passed the Senate 98-0 in the last \nCongress, and I am very hopeful we can work with our colleagues in the \nHouse and enact it into law, so that our people will finally have the \nprotections they need against the misuse of genetic information.\n  In this century of the life sciences, much of what we learn through \nbiomedical research is being translated into new treatments and cures, \nand nowhere is the explosion of scientific progress more apparent than \nin the field of genetics. Four years after the remarkable achievement \nof discovering the sequence of the human genome, clinical testing is \nnow possible for over a thousand genetic diseases. It has led to rapid \ngrowth in the field of personalized medicine, in which patients' \ntreatment and care is individualized according to their genetic makeup.\n  In the absence of federal protections, however, patients fear that \nundergoing genetic tests may lead to disqualification from future \ninsurance coverage, or that an employer will fire them or deny a \npromotion based on the results of a genetic test. The consequence is \nthat many Americans are choosing not to be tested, and are declining to \nparticipate in clinical trials so important for the development of new \ntreatments.\n  Discrimination based on genetics is just as wrong as discrimination \nbased on race or gender. Our bill provides specific protections for \ncitizens against genetic discrimination. It prohibits health insurers \nfrom picking and choosing their customers based on genetics. Employers \ncannot fire or refuse to hire persons because of their genetic \ncharacteristics. It enables Americans to benefit from better health \ncare through the use of genetic information, without the fear that it \nwill be misused against them.\n  It is difficult to imagine information more personal or more private \nthan a person's genetic makeup. It should not be shared by insurers or \nemployers, or be used in making decisions about health coverage or a \njob. It should only be used by patients and their doctors to make the \nbest diagnostic and treatment decisions they can.\n  In the near future, genetic tests will become even cheaper and more \nwidely available. If we don't ban discrimination now, it may soon be \nroutine for employers to use genetic tests to deny jobs to employees, \nbased on their risk for disease.\n  If Congress enacts clear protections against genetic discrimination \nin employment and health insurance, all Americans will be able to enjoy \nthe benefits of genetic research, free from the fear that their \npersonal genetic information will be misused. If Congress fails to make \nsure that genetic information is used only for legitimate purposes, we \nmay well squander the vast potential of genetic research to improve the \nnation's health.\n  The bill that we are considering today has been unanimously approved \nby the full Senate in the past two Congresses. We passed it 95-0 in the \n108th Congress, and 98-0 in the 109th Congress. It had over 240 \ncosponsors in the House in both Congresses, but the leadership refused \nto bring it to a vote.\n  As President Bush himself has said, ``Genetic information should be \nan opportunity to prevent and treat disease, not an excuse for \ndiscrimination. Just as our nation addressed discrimination based on \nrace, we must now prevent discrimination based on genetic \ninformation.''\n  We are closer than ever to enactment. I urge the Senate to approve \nthe bill, and this time, I think we will finally see it become law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 359. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nadditional support to students; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Student \nDebt Relief Act of 2007.\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\n  It's long past time for Congress to take action to address the crisis \nin college affordability. The cost of college has more than tripled in \nthe last 20 years. Today, the average cost of attendance at a 4-year \npublic college is almost $13,000.\n  As a result, students and families are pinching pennies more than \never to pay for higher education. Increasingly, more and more students \nare finding it's just not possible. Every year, 400,000 students who \nare qualified to attend a 4-year college find themselves shut out \nbecause of cost factors.\n  At a time when 6 out of 10 jobs require some form of post-secondary \ntraining, this is completely unacceptable. When qualified students are \nblocked from the college gates because of cost, they're also blocked \nfrom their ticket to the American Dream. It's a situation that's \nputting our prosperity and economic security as a country at risk.\n  But the crisis on college affordability is not just limited to those \nmost in need. Every low and middle income family in America is affected \nby it.\n  Today, the average student in the U.S. leaves college saddled with \nmore than $17,000 in federal student loans on graduation day. At \nprivate universities, the level of student loan debt has increased 108 \npercent over the past decade. And at public universities, student loan \ndebt has increased an astonishing 116 percent.\n  This mountain of debt is distorting countless young Americans' basic \nlife choices, from decisions on their career, to getting married, to \nbuying a home, and to starting a family. It's discouraging many from \noccupations such as teaching, social work and law enforcement, which \nare lower paying, but bring large rewards for our society. And it's \nperpetuating a shameful status quo, in which low-income and first-\ngeneration students are far less likely to earn a college degree than \nother students.\n  It's obvious we need to act immediately to make both college costs \nand student debt more manageable--and that is what this bill is all \nabout. The Student Debt Relief Act will help lift the financial yoke \nthat burdens our students and families as they try to pay for college.\n  To assist our neediest students, it will immediately increase the \nmaximum Pell Grant from $4050 to $5100 with mandatory funding. The Pell \nGrant has been the indispensable lifeline to college for low-income and \nmiddle income students for more than 40 years. But today--after five \nyears of broken promises from the President to increase the maximum \ngrant--we've seen its buying power erode.\n  Twenty years ago, the maximum Pell grant covered 55 percent of the \ncost of tuition, fees, room and board at a public 4-year college. Now \nit covers less than 32 percent of those costs. Over the last five \nyears, the gap between the cost of attending college and the maximum \nPell grant has continued to grow.\n  In addition, for the first time in six years, the average Pell Grant \nhas declined. We must reverse this trend. It's time to say, No more \nbroken promises. That's what we'll do by passing the Student Debt \nRelief Act. The Act will also cut interest rates in half--from 6.8 \npercent to 3.4 percent--on new student loans for our neediest students.\n  Last year, the Republican Congress allowed interest rates to rise on \nstudent loans, putting college even further out of reach for millions \nof students. Because of this interest rate hike, typical student \nborrowers--already straining with more than $17,000 in debt--will be \nforced to pay an additional $5,800 for their college loans.\n  But a new day has now dawned in Congress, and last week, our \ncolleagues in the House showed they have their priorities right on \ncollege costs by cutting student loan interest rates in half. Now it's \nour turn in the Senate. But we won't stop there.\n  We also need to do more to help students manage the burden of \nunreasonable debt on their student loans. No student should have to \nmortgage their future to pay for college. And no one should have their \nlives thrown into disarray when unexpected financial hardship makes it \nmuch harder for them to make their student loan payments.\n  That's why the Student Debt Relief Act caps student loan payments at \n15 percent of monthly discretionary income. It forgives loans after 25 \nyears, and also provides a 10-year loan forgiveness option for students \nwho work in public service professions.\n  This Act will also help reform our broken student loan system, which \nis larded with inexcusably large subsidies to big lenders and filled \nwith rules that are unfriendly to borrowers.\n  Like my Student Aid Reward Act, it gives colleges new incentives to \noffer loans to students through the Direct Loan program--which is \ncheaper for taxpayers--rather than the more expensive loan FFEL program \nthat's operated through private lenders.\n  President Bush's own figures back this up. According to his 2007 \neducation budget, the privately-funded student loan program costs \ntaxpayers $6 more for every $100 lent than the same loans made through \nthe Direct Loan program.\n  When colleges switch to the less-expensive program, the Student Debt \nRelief Act will let them keep a portion of the savings to the \ngovernment generated by that switch by giving it back to the schools, \nin the form of increased Pell Grant aid to students.\n  The savings generated by this Act will be enough to increase federal \nPell Grants by $1000 each at many colleges, making higher education \nmore affordable for millions of students. For example, in my home state \nof Massachusetts, college students would reap an extra $53 million in \nPell Grant scholarships per year. And all told, it could generate an \nadditional $13 billion in Pell Grants for students over 10 years.\n  The Student Debt Relief Act also extends the college tuition tax \ndeduction, increasing the allowable deduction to $12,000. It repeals \nthe student-unfriendly rule that prevents students from consolidating \ntheir loans while they're still in school, and allows them to \nreconsolidate them as well.\n  In the Direct Loan program, it also reduces the origination fee that \nstudents pay when loans are made, also helping to ease the burden on \nborrowers. In short, it's a comprehensive plan to ease the double blow \nof soaring college costs and heavy student loan burdens. It's a plan we \nmust move forward--for the sake of our students, their future, and the \nfuture of our Nation.\n  Access to college is the key to our opportunity, to our economy, and \nto our values. So we must act now.\n  Today, in communities across America, students are dreaming about \nwhat they want to be when they become adults. And as their parents \nwatch tomorrow's doctors, teachers, engineers and lawyers in action, \nthey know that all of those dreams depend on a college education.\n  When our children dream about their future, they need to know that \nthose dreams are within their reach. A college education is the \nfoundation of the opportunity society that will keep this country \nstrong and growing in the 21st century. So let's work together to get \nit done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, since coming to the Senate two years ago, I \nhave worked to fulfill pledges I made during my campaign. The first \npiece of legislation I introduced, the HOPE Act, addressed my pledge to \nmake college more affordable. The HOPE Act arose from what I heard when \nmeeting people across Illinois during my Senate campaign, and what I \nnow continue to hear from students and families across the Nation.\n  The dreams of our Nation's youth increasingly require a college \ndiploma, but that diploma is becoming, for many, ever more difficult to \nattain. That difficulty arises not from lack of ambition or aptitude, \nbut from lack of any realistic way for many American families to afford \nthe requisite college education.\n  This difficulty impacts not only the dreams of millions of students, \nbut also the wellbeing of our Nation. Competition in the global economy \nrequires the attainment of a college degree, in order to create and \nstrengthen the innovative and flexible workforce America needs.\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\n  But as college costs increase, financial aid lags. The College Board \nreports that over the most recent five-year period, the cost of tuition \nand fees at public four-year colleges jumped 35 percent, even adjusting \nfor inflation. Over that same five-year period, the maximum award \noffered by the Federal Government through Pell grants increased little. \nAs a result, the proportion of college expenses met by Pell Grants \ndecreased from 42 percent to 33 percent over that five-year period. At \nthe same time, we see that qualified high school graduates from low- \nand moderate-income families are much less likely to earn that college \ndegree than their wealthier peers.\n  That is why I am pleased to support Senator Kennedy as he introduces \nthe Student Debt Relief Act. Not only does it substantially increase \nFederal support for the Pell Grant, it also takes other steps to make \ncollege more affordable. The Act proposes to cut student loan interest \nrates, to make loan reconsolidation more feasible for many students, \nand to cap the amount of monthly loan payments for graduates who enter \npublic service careers.\n  These measures require a major investment. I believe we must continue \nto support qualified students who deserve the opportunity to turn their \ndreams into reality. I will continue to work to increase support for \nour students though the Pell Grant Program, and other measure that make \na college degree attainable for many. This remains a priority for me, \nand I ask all my colleagues to join in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S852-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 35--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR PRAYER AT SCHOOL BOARD \n                                MEETINGS\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                               S.

I rise today to join my good friend Senator Snowe in \nintroducing a resolution recognizing the life and untimely loss of a \ndistinguished women's advocate and beloved friend to so many in New \nYork, Washington and beyond: Cynthia Boles Dailard. A native New \nYorker, Cynthia will be remembered not only for her incredible work and \nimpressive career, but also for the way she touched so many in her all \ntoo short life.\n  Throughout her career, Cynthia impressed and inspired countless \ncolleagues at the National Women's Law Center, as a legislative \nassistant and counsel for Senator Snowe and as an associate director \nfor domestic policy in the Clinton Administration. She was known for \nworking in a bipartisan manner to promote her passion: the health and \nwellbeing of women and their families. This passion was matched by a \ngenuine concern for the lives of others.\n  Cynthia then moved to the Guttmacher Institute, where her passionate \nand talented voice catalyzed research and policy regarding family \nplanning, adolescent sexual behavior and insurance coverage for \ncontraception. In remembering Cynthia, her friends at the Institute \nnoted how her prolific writings pushed the women's health community \n``to think deeply and to stretch in new directions.'' Indeed, it is the \nsort of innovative work that Cynthia was known for that impacts lives \nthe most, as it spurs policy that can truly make a difference.\n  As we reflect upon Cynthia's life, we can see a path paved with far \nmore than laudatory academic and professional achievement. Cynthia's \nlegacy is one of commitment, thoughtfulness, character and kindness.\n  I remain touched by the myriad of ways Cynthia made a difference in \npeople's lives as a wife and a mother, as a lawyer and a writer, and as \nan advocate and a friend.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Cynthia on numerous occasions and \nwas always impressed with her intellect, knowledge and passion for \nwomen's health.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to Cynthia's husband of 14 years, \nScott and her daughters Miranda and Julia. And it is with the utmost \nrespect that I pledge to celebrate Cynthia's work and her life through \nthis resolution to honor her memory and through my work in the future \nto honor the health\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nand wellbeing of women across America and throughout the world.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution \nhonoring an exceptional women's health advocate, Cynthia Boles Dailard, \nwho tragically passed away on December 24, 2006.\n  Cynthia was an extraordinary person and a consummate professional who \nwas passionately committed to the issues she believed in to the \neverlasting benefit of those who were helped by her enormous \ndedication. Her zest for living and the spark she carried within her \ninspired the same in others, especially with respect to improving the \nlives of America's women.\n  As a United States Senator from Maine, I was immensely pleased to \nhave Cynthia work for me as a legislative aide for issues of particular \nimportance to women. As one of only sixteen females in the Senate \ncurrently--and even fewer in the past--one of my major goals has always \nbeen ensuring that matters critical to girls and women are represented \nand addressed in our government. And Cynthia's family should be \nincredibly proud that, in that regard--and as I began my very first \nyears in the Senate--I couldn't have asked for a better partner with \nthe keen intelligence, vision, energy, and talent she brought to my \noffice. I was extremely grateful to have the benefit of her service to \nthe country and her wide-ranging expertise and acumen--and no one was \nmore committed to the goal of advancing policy pertaining to America's \nwomen than Cynthia Dailard.\n  In developing groundbreaking initiatives, she not only served me \nwell, but most critically she served the Nation well with her unfailing \ndedication to efforts that will reverberate for generations. As such, \nshe was invaluable to me as she helped champion the campaign to improve \nthe quality of life of those in my State and across the country.\n  But above all in her work, Cynthia was effective as an advocate \nbecause she was engaged in causes that were a true labor of love. She \nadhered to those beliefs that motivated her to action, and as a result \nshe made a tremendous difference. She stood as a testament to the ideal \nof finding a passion and following it--to the fulfillment of oneself \nand the betterment of all. She also exemplified an intellectual \ncuriosity and a steadfast devotion to learning, for their own sake as \nwell as instruments for improving the greater community--traits that \nare instructive to us all.\n  All of us who were touched by Cynthia's life are greatly saddened--\nshe will be forever missed but always remembered and we will hold dear \nin perpetuity the countless and timeless memories of her. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with her husband, Scott, and their daughters, Miranda \nand Julia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S853-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 100.

Mr. President, cloture has been filed today on the line-\nitem veto offered by Senator Gregg. I filed a cloture motion on the \nunderlying bill,\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\nwhich is a straight minimum wage with no small business set-asides on \nit.\n  Today, we have had 4 amendments laid down, and there has been good \ndebate. Tomorrow, we can have our party caucuses at 12:30. We may vote \nin the morning. There are four amendments pending. We have the Enzi \namendment, and the HELP Committee majority is working with him to see \nif there can be a couple of changes made and, if so, we can vote on \nthat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say, with regard to the \ncloture motion just filed by the distinguished majority leader, that if \ncloture were to be invoked on the underlying bill, the opportunity to \npass what has developed into a bipartisan minimum wage proposal, \nincluding both an increase in the minimum wage and tax provisions, \nwhich are important for the small businesses that tend to hire people \nwho work at the minimum wage, would be lost. So certainly it is my hope \nthat cloture will not be invoked on Wednesday on the underlying bill so \nthat we could continue in the bipartisan spirit in which we have begun \nthis session of Congress and move forward on a bill that in all \nlikelihood will receive, at the end of the process, a very large \nbipartisan vote of support, and that is a combination of the minimum \nwage increase and the small business tax provision.\n  So I encourage my colleagues on this side of the aisle to, in the \nspirit of bipartisanship, defeat that so we can continue to deal with \nthe substitute that I think will enjoy broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the next couple of days, until we \nvote on the two cloture matters, if cloture is not invoked on the \nmatter relating to Senator Judd Gregg, then that matter, it is my \nunderstanding, would be withdrawn and we would go to cloture on the \nunderlying bill. If that is, of course, passed, it would be just as \nSenator McConnell said--it would eliminate the matters the Finance \nCommittee placed on the bill. If it is not invoked, we are right back \nwhere we started from and would work off the substitute.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope Senators would look at and offer whatever \namendments they want on this matter. There is going to come a time, \nbecause we have so much other business to do and, besides, there is \nample opportunity to file amendments on this bill, that I will be \nrequired to file cloture. It would be great if I didn't have to. We \ncould agree on a finite list of amendments, dispose of those \namendments, and move to final passage of the bill.\n  Next week sometime it is likely, as I explained to the distinguished \nRepublican leader, we are going to have to go to the Iraq resolution or \nresolutions reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee. What the \nRepublican leader and I have talked about doing--and we don't know if \nthat is doable in the Senate--is to limit the votes that would be on \nthat issue, whether we have a couple competing resolutions or one \nresolution. Whatever we do, we will try to work something out to the \nsatisfaction of the body.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, briefly, five amendments have been \npending, three have been filed. I will have a better sense, I say to my \nfriend, the majority leader, after lunch tomorrow how many amendments \nmy side will be interested in filing. I certainly share the majority \nleader's view, provided cloture is not invoked on Wednesday, that we \nwould work with the majority leader in the hopes of winding up this \nbill at the earliest possible time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/22/senate-section/article/S869-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 23, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I first thank the Presiding Officer for \naddressing the Senate earlier this evening with regard to the proposed \nresolution which you and our distinguished colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, have been working on now for several days and \nthroughout the weekend, placing it into the Record for all Senators to \nhave an opportunity to study it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as I said when I was joined by you and \nSenator Collins in our brief press conference this afternoon, the \nresolution we currently anticipate will not be filed formally at the \ndesk until the State of the Union is completed tomorrow and the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee works its will on a resolution which is \npending before it, authored by the chairman, Senator Biden, and Senator \nHagel of Nebraska and other Senators who have joined in that \nresolution. As that resolution works its way through the Foreign \nRelations Committee, we, the three of us who have worked on this \nresolution, will take an examination of what is sent to the floor for \npurposes of floor consideration, and at that time I anticipate we could \nindicate to the Senate a desire that our resolution be considered as a \nsubstitute resolution and therefore an alternative to the resolution \nthat will be reported out from the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\n  That is what we stated today, and it is my intention to continue to \nwork along in that vein because my motivation solely is to do what is \nin the best interests of the United States of America, and most \nparticularly the men and women of the Armed Forces at this very pivotal \ntime in the history of our Nation's commitment to Iraq, considering the \nPresident's plan.\n  As I said earlier, America's contribution to try to bring about a \nsettlement of so many of the controversies in the Middle East is done \nin the spirit only of trying to bring peace and freedom to that very \ntroubled region. Iraq, at this moment, is very much before the Congress \nbecause the President has, on the 10th of this month, laid down a plan. \nI say it is very much before us at this time, but also there are the \nvery serious questions relating to Iran and their desire to go ahead \nand develop certain aspects of nuclear energy which could at some point \nin time undertake a program that would lead to the development of \nnuclear weapons. That is a very serious question. The question of \nLebanon is before this body, as is the question of the relationship \nbetween Israel and the Palestinian people. So what we do in the context \nof Iraq is not isolated from all of these serious problems.\n  But for the moment, we have before us the plan laid down by the \nPresident on the 10th of this month. We go back and we trace the \nevolution of this problem from, say, early last fall when clearly, in \nthe minds of many of us, the situation was not measuring up to our \nexpectations. Our strategy at that time was not bringing about clear \nbenchmarks with positive results.\n  We had an extraordinary chapter of history when our military \ncampaign, together with our coalition partners, enabled the Iraqi \npeople to have free and open elections, to elect a government, and for \nthat government to take office. They were enabled to begin the \nfundamental steps to create, No. 1, a sovereign nation with the full \nexercise of sovereignty in the hands of the government and the Iraqi \npeople, and No. 2, an improved security situation in Iraq which would \nreflect throughout the region.\n  Those were all very positive accomplishments. It is owing to the \ncommitment of the nations forming the coalition of forces--to some \nextent the United Nations and the Security Council, so many \ninstitutions and commitments, and the bravery of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces--that they brought about a nation now that is a \nsovereign nation, Iraq, whose government was elected by a free people.\n  But the security situation has deteriorated, and it deteriorated in \nthe fall to the point that I and others began to express our concern \npublicly. Senator Levin and I returned from a trip to that region--\nspecifically Iraq--and in the context of reporting back to this body, \nthe Senate, I indicated that, in my judgment, the situation was \ndrifting sideways. We were simply not seeing the improvements in \nsecurity. The reins of sovereignty which we put into the hands of the \nIraqi people and their elected government were not bringing about the \nresults we wished.\n  The level of attacks was quite significant, and a measure of total \ndistrust was beginning to evolve between the various factions--the \nSunnis distrusting the Shias, the Shias distrusting the Sunnis--and \nthis has led to where the sectarian violence is now the predominant \nproblem, bringing back instability into Iraq.\n  Following comments by leaders of our administration, leaders here in \nthe Congress and, indeed, very respected experts in the private sector, \nthe President--and I commend him--instituted a total analysis of the \nsituation. I had specifically said, when I mentioned it was drifting \nsideways, that we ought to consider all aspects of changing this \nstrategy we were currently employing at that time. I am not suggesting \nmy remarks were the motivation, but the President took the initiative \nand the leadership, and he is to be commended. Every entity within the \nFederal system, from the Departments of State and Defense to all other \nentities, made contributions to what should be done to change his \nstrategy.\n  The Joint Chiefs did a very significant study on their own \ninitiative, and I commend Chairman Pace. I think the Baker-Hamilton \ncommission did a remarkably fine study and of value, certainly, in my \njudgment, to this institution and all those who are concentrating on \nhow to resolve the problems in Iraq.\n  So the President's plan presumably was his analysis of all of this \nextraordinary input into a change of strategy, and he laid down his \nproposal. At the same time he addressed the country, he said--and I \nwould like to quote him. He said very clearly that ``he would welcome \nand encourage others to make contributions.''\n  So what we did by way of putting this together was not to contravene \nin any way the constitutional authorities of our President which are \nexpressed, his role as Commander in Chief, but to accept the offer to \nthe Congress and others made by the President on January 10, 2007, and \nI quote:\n\n       If Members have improvements that can be made, we will make \n     them. If circumstances change, we will adjust.\n\n  Now, I commend the President for that, and it is in that vein that \nthe three of us came together and began our concentrated effort shortly \nafter January 10, and this is the work product.\n  It is clear to us that the U.S. strategy and operations in Iraq can \nonly be sustained and achieved with the support of the American people \nand with a level of bipartisanship in the Congress. On that note, \nindulge me to reflect a little bit on the Vietnam era where I was \nprivileged to serve as Under Secretary, Secretary of the Navy for 5 \nyears and some months during that extraordinary chapter of American \nhistory. I can say unequivocally that my heart goes out to the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces in that chapter of our history. There was a \ngreat deal of public misunderstanding about their role and what they \nwere trying to do individually and collectively in the cause of \nfreedom.\n  Eventually, that public opinion began to infuse itself here in the \ntwo bodies of the Congress, and the rest is history. The Congress began \nto pull back and, as I say, the rest is history.\n  I do not suggest there is a parallel between the combat situations, \nalthough there was enormous suffering and a tremendous level of \ncasualties--over 50,000 men and women killed, wounded and missing in \nVietnam--a great sacrifice for our country in the cause of freedom. But \ntoday I see an absolute magnificent response all across this Nation \namong the American citizens to that brave individual in uniform, both \nmen and women. And the same for our many dedicated civilians who are \nalso taking risks in connection with carrying out the instructions our \nPresident has laid down for the military, as well as all branches of \nthis Government, to achieve our goals in Iraq.\n  Our group agreed with the President that a loss, a failed state in \nIraq will affect peace in the region and indeed possibly peace \nelsewhere in the world. The stakes are very high, and we weighed that \nalways, as the three of us prepared these documents. But that is why I \nsay during the Vietnam chapter the support of the American people and a \nlevel of bipartisanship in this institution were essential, and that is \nthe purpose of this resolution: to hopefully achieve that.\n  The purpose of this resolution is not to cut our forces at their \npresent level, nor to institute and force a timetable for withdrawal. \nThat is a matter--those are both matters that have to be left to the \nPresident--but, rather, to express the genuine concerns of a number of \nSenators from both parties about the President's plan and to set forth \na strategy.\n  Unlike some of the other resolutions that have been before the body, \nwe detail a change in strategy which offers to the President the \npossibility of modification of his plan. We do not mean to be \nconfrontational with our President but instead to provide a sense of \nbipartisan resolve on recommendations, alternatives, modifications, we \nshould say, to the plan that he laid down. Our thoughts were in many \nrespects guided by the Baker-Hamilton report.\n  As I say, I personally, and I think the Presiding Officer and others, \nattach a great deal of significance to that report.\n  Now, the primary objective we see of our strategy in Iraq should be \nthe following: First, to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \ncompromises that\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\nwill foster reconciliation and strengthen the unity of government, \nultimately leading to improvements in the security situation. Further, \nour resolution states the military part of this strategy should focus \non the following. Now, let me address the military part. I think the \nPresident very wisely--and this reflects on the strength of his \nproposal. It is really three parts. It is diplomacy. It is economic \nsupport in the nature of reconstruction, a greater emphasis on helping \nthe civilian infrastructure, whether it be their electricity, their \nsanitation, their water, or many things that are very much lacking, \nregrettably. Irrespective of the enormity of the contributions we have \nmade thus far to improve those situations, they just haven't improved.\n  So this plan of the President's is really three parts, but I address \nnow the military part. But I caution that a chain is no stronger than \nits weakest link. All three of these vital parts of the President's \nprogram, in order to have any measure of success, have to work \ntogether. Our committee, the Armed Services Committee on which the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Collins and I serve, a year or so ago put in \nspecific legislation to encourage the Secretaries of the Cabinet \npositions here, the Cabinet Secretaries and the administrators of our \nGovernment--we put into law giving them flexibility to encourage more \nof their people to get into the mainstream to support the economic and \nreconstruction parts of the President's program. That part has to be \nevery bit as strong as whatever the final military components will be, \nand the same with the diplomacy.\n  But our military strategies should focus on the following: First, \nmaintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq; second, denying \ninternational terrorists a safe haven, conducting counterterrorism \noperations, promoting regional stability, and training and equipping \nIraqi forces to take full responsibility for their own security. \nFurther, our resolution states that the U.S. military operations \nshould, as much as possible, be confined to these goals and charges the \nIraqi military with the primary mission of combating sectarian \nviolence. That has been a matter of intense interest for this \nparticular Senator, and I drew up this paragraph accordingly, with the \nPresiding Officer's help and concurrence.\n  That is, I said, charges--it says to the Iraqi military: We have \ninvested in this military, over years and years, of training, 2 full \nyears, plus--equipment. Now, this sectarian violence is something that \nyou should be out on the point to handle. That is your primary \nresponsibility. The coalition GI, be it American or British or the \nothers, should not be cast into situations--whenever possible, trying \nnot to let them be cast into situations--or firefights, to be more \nprecise--where Sunni is shooting at Shia, or vice versa, and for them \nto try and make the decisions of how to solve that. That, to me, we \nshould charge the Iraqis as their responsibility, with their armed \nforces which we have trained, and which number over 200,000 because \nthey understand the language, they understand the culture, and they \nunderstand the complexity of this deep-rooted distrust, this hatred \nwhich propels the Sunni versus the Shia, or the Shia versus the Sunni.\n  This results in these wanton killings, the horrible tortures every \nday. The bodies are in the streets. I will not describe how those \nbodies have been desecrated as a symbol of this hatred and distrust. \nThat is not for us to solve. That is for the Iraqis to solve.\n  As such, our resolution states that the Senate disagrees with the \nPresident's plan to augment our forces by 21,500 and urges the \nPresident instead to consider all options and alternatives for \nachieving the strategic goals outlined above. Take a look at 21,500. \nThat sends a difficult signal, a tough signal. We have discussed Anbar \nProvince, the province where the Marines are fighting. There we \nrecognize that an augmentation of forces is necessary; namely, because \nwe are engaged directly with al-Qaida.\n  I say respectfully to the President, we urge him to consider other \noptions, to use a lesser number of troops. Particularly, we have had \nbriefings recently about the growing sentiment among the Iraqi people, \nthe rank and file, that they do not want more troops on their soil. \nThey are anxious to have them leave now. Leaving precipitously could \ntopple that situation into an all-out civil war, an imploding which has \ndisastrous consequences, as we all know.\n  Again, the signal we are sending 21,500 is, in our judgment, not a \nwise strategy. We are looking at Baghdad, which is the central focus of \nsectarian violence, the central focus of the majority of the \ninsecurity, the failure of security in that sovereign country. There \nare nine different districts, as I understand the President's plan. \nSequentially, we will take a district, go into it, and see whether we \ncan lower the level of violence, provide some stability and confidence \nfor their people so they can look forward to some quality of life and \npersonal safety. However, as we take the initial section of Baghdad and \ndo that, we should lay down clear and precise benchmarks that the Iraqi \nforces must follow.\n  First, the commitment of their troop level, together with the troop \nlevel of the United States, should be all present and accounted for on \nthe day before that operation starts. Unlike the failure of the \nprevious surge efforts in Baghdad, where the United States showed up \nand a far less number of Iraqis--although committed--showed up. That is \nthe first thing.\n  The second thing is, it is imperative the political leadership in \nthat Government, which has tried to reach down and make decisions \naffecting the tactics of the Armed Forces--both Iraqi Armed Forces and \nthe coalition forces, principally the American forces--that comes to an \nabsolute end. The military commanders should be entrusted to make the \ntactical decisions, to take the missions they see fit for each of the \nnine districts--the missions can be different in the nine districts--\nand carry them out halfway through, after perhaps sacrificing life and \nlimb to accomplish some measure of success, will not be reversed by a \npolitical decision made somewhere in the Iraqi Government. That is \nimportant.\n  We had the benchmarks. Before we go to a second location in Baghdad, \nwe will have, hopefully, a clearly documented case of this operation \ngoing according to plan. It will document the Iraqis taking the point, \nas we say in military work, with regard to incidents of sectarian \nviolence. Before we go to another sequenced operation in Baghdad, we \nbetter be sure. Words will not do it. Statements will not do it. Only \ndeeds will be convincing that there is a full and unqualified \ncommitment to the Iraqi Government.\n  Our resolution is worthy of consideration by our colleagues. There is \na great deal of concern in the Senate and adversity of opinion. I \nrespect that. I hope it will be considered. The three of us will be \nglad to work with colleagues individually, collectively, and most \nrespectfully of our own leadership, as to what guidance they might wish \nto give us.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank Senator Collins. I wish to \nthank staff who worked throughout the weekend and over the past few \ndays: Tim Becker, from the staff of the Presiding Officer; Christiana \nGallagher, also of your staff; Jane Alonso, of Senator Collins' staff; \nJohn Ullyot, of my staff; Bill Caniano and Ann Loomis and Sandy Luff, \nof my staff. We have had quite a team working. They all made possible \nthe completion of this resolution today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Language Sponsored by Mr. Warner (for himself, Mr. Nelson \n     of Nebraska, and Ms. Collins)\n       Resolution expressing the sense of Congress on the new \n     strategy in Iraq.\n       Whereas, we respect the Constitutional authorities given a \n     President in Article II, Section 2, which states that ``The \n     President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of \n     the United States;'' it is not the intent of this resolution \n     to question or contravene such authority, but to accept the \n     offer to Congress made by the President on January 10, 2007 \n     that, ``if members have improvements that can be made, we \n     will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust;''\n       Whereas, the United States' strategy and operations in Iraq \n     can only be sustained and achieved with support from the \n     American people and with a level of bipartisanship;\n       Whereas, over 137,000 American military personnel are \n     currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since \n     March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent \n     with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, \n     and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they \n     have strongly;\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\n       Whereas, many American service personnel have lost their \n     lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the \n     American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor \n     their families;\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their \n     Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with \n     components of the other branches of the military, are under \n     enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq \n     and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, these deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, retention \n     and readiness of our nation's all volunteer force;\n       Whereas in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2006, the Congress stated that ``calendar year \n     2006 should be a period of significant transition to full \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq;''\n       Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, \n     approved November 28, 2006, ``determin[ed] that the situation \n     in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international \n     peace and security;''\n       Whereas, a failed state in Iraq would present a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the long-term security \n     interests of the United States are best served by an Iraq \n     that can sustain, govern, and defend itself, and serve as an \n     ally in the war against extremists;\n       Whereas, Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating an ever-\n     widening problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian violence \n     based upon political distrust and cultural differences \n     between some Sunni and Shia Muslims;\n       Whereas, Iraqis must reach political settlements in order \n     to achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas, the responsibility for Iraq's internal security \n     and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces;\n       Whereas, U.S. Central Command Commander General John \n     Abizaid testified to Congress on November 15, 2006, ``I met \n     with every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     Commander, [and] General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future;''\n       Whereas, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006 that ``The crisis is political, and the \n     ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting \n     of innocents are the politicians;''\n       Whereas, there is growing evidence that Iraqi public \n     sentiment opposes the continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq, \n     much less increasing the troop level;\n       Whereas, in the fall of 2006, leaders in the Administration \n     and Congress, as well as recognized experts in the private \n     sector, began to express concern that the situation in Iraq \n     was deteriorating and required a change in strategy; and, as \n     a consequence, the Administration began an intensive, \n     comprehensive review of the Iraq strategy, by all components \n     of the Executive branch;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly;''\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, following consultations with \n     the Iraqi Prime Minister, the President announced a new \n     strategy (hereinafter referred to as the ``plan,'') the \n     central element of which is an augmentation of the present \n     U.S. military force structure through additional deployments \n     of approximately 21,500 U.S. military troops to Iraq;\n       Whereas, this proposed level of troop augmentation far \n     exceeds the expectations of many of us as to the \n     reinforcements that would be necessary to implement the \n     various options for a new strategy, and led many members to \n     express outright opposition to augmenting our troops by \n     21,500;\n       Whereas, the Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to \n     assume a greater share of security responsibilities, disband \n     militias, consider Constitutional amendments and enact laws \n     to reconcile sectarian differences, and improve the quality \n     of essential services for the Iraqi people; yet, despite \n     those promises, little has been achieved;\n       Whereas, the President said on January 10, 2007 that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       Whereas, the recommendations in this resolution should not \n     be interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in, \n     or withdrawal of, the present level of forces: Now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Senate disagrees with the ``plan'' to augment our \n     forces by 21,500, and urges the President instead to consider \n     all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic \n     goals set forth below with reduced force levels than \n     proposed;\n       (2) the primary objective of the overall U.S. strategy in \n     Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \n     compromises that will foster reconciliation and strengthen \n     the unity government, ultimately leading to improvements in \n     the security situation;\n       (3) the military part of this strategy should focus on \n     maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying \n     international terrorists a safe haven, conducting \n     counterterrorism operations, promoting regional stability, \n     and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take full \n     responsibility for their own security;\n       (4) United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals, and charge the Iraqi \n     military with the primary mission of combating sectarian \n     violence;\n       (5) the military Rules of Engagement for this plan should \n     reflect this delineation of responsibilities;\n       (6) the United States Government should transfer to the \n     Iraqi military, in an expeditious manner, such equipment as \n     is necessary;\n       (7) the Senate believes the United States should continue \n     vigorous operations in Anbar province, specifically for the \n     purpose of combating an insurgency, including elements \n     associated with the Al Qaeda movement, and denying terrorists \n     a safe haven;\n       (8) the United States Government should engage selected \n     nations in the Middle East to develop a regional, \n     internationally sponsored peace-and-reconciliation process \n     for Iraq;\n       (9) the Administration should provide regular updates to \n     the Congress, produced by the Commander of United States \n     Central Command and his subordinate commanders, about the \n     progress or lack of progress the Iraqis are making toward \n     this end.\n       (10) our overall military, diplomatic and economic strategy \n     should not be regarded as an ``open-ended'' or unconditional \n     commitment, but rather as a new strategy that hereafter \n     should be conditioned upon the Iraqi government's meeting \n     benchmarks that must be specified by the Administration.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
