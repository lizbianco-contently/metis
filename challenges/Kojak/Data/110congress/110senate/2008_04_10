I would say two things, Mr. President. First of all, the \ndistinguished Republican leader and I had a meeting with the President \nyesterday. I was happy to hear--I had heard he had issued a veto threat \nagainst this bill, and he said that is not the case, and that is good. \nI don't expect the President to like everything in our bill, but I \nthink this is the beginning of the process. This bill will go to the \nHouse, and with the House and the White House, we can come up with a \npiece of legislation fairly quickly. So I was very satisfied with the \nhousing discussion with the President yesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2829-9", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2829-S2830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONFIRMATION OF JUDGES\n\n  Mr. REID. Finally, on the judges, I appreciate the Judiciary \nCommittee reporting out these judges. In a Presidential election year, \nit is always very tough for judges. That is the way it has been for a \nlong time, and that is why we have the Thurmond rule and other such \nrules. But I have indicated to the Republican leader that we are going \nto try to move these nominations along. We are trying to keep up with \nthe average that has gone on in years past without a lot of political \nbickering.\n  We have the finest judicial system in the world. We need to make sure \nwe keep it that way. One of the things we are looking to do--and, \nhopefully, we may even be able to do it on the supplemental \nappropriations bill; and one\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\nway or the other, the President indicated yesterday there will be some \nthings he wants to put on it other than the direct funding--whether we \ncan do it at that time or later in the year, we need to do something \nabout increasing judges' pay, and I hope we can do that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2830-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to make a few observations about \nthe status of the judicial confirmation process, and then I will turn \nto another matter.\n  It has been 108 days since the Senate confirmed a Federal judge of \nany kind. It last did so the week before Christmas, on December 18, \n2007. Since then, the Senate has made precious little progress on \njudicial nominations. I don't blame the majority leader for that. I \nthink we began this Congress with a general understanding of what we \nhoped to achieve, and that is still possible. But as of today, we have \nnot confirmed any judicial nominees this year, and the Judiciary \nCommittee has held only one hearing on one circuit court nominee since \nlast September.\n  Today we will finally be able to confirm some judicial nominees. That \nis obviously good news, and I applaud that. But after we confirm the \njudicial nominees on the calendar, that may be it for a while due to \nthe glacial pace at which the Judiciary Committee is proceeding.\n  It is not as if the committee has been otherwise occupied. This is \nanother week in which the committee could have held a hearing, for \nexample, on the qualified nominees to the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, but again it chose not to. These nominees meet the chairman's \nown criteria for prompt consideration. Nevertheless, they have been \ninexplicably languishing for hundreds of days without a hearing while \nthe Fourth Circuit is one-third vacant.\n  We were told that having the support of home State Senators ``means a \ngreat deal and points toward the kind of qualified consensus nominee \nthat can be quickly confirmed.''\n  Let me say that again. We were told that having the support of home \nState Senators ``means a great deal and points toward the kind of \nqualified consensus nominee that can be quickly confirmed.''\n  Well, Steven Matthews of South Carolina had the strong support of \nboth of his home State Senators, one of whom, by the way, sits on the \nJudiciary Committee, but he has been waiting 217 days just to get a \nhearing.\n  Judge Robert Conrad of North Carolina, whom the Senate majority \nunanimously confirmed to two Federal positions and most recently to a \nlifetime position on the district court, has the strong support of both \nof his home State Senators. Yet he has been waiting for 268 days.\n  My Democratic colleagues are quick to point to the lack of home State \nsupport as a reason not to give someone a hearing. But it is beginning \nto look as if this criterion is being selectively applied. It is \nreadily used as a reason not to move a nominee, coincidentally, when \nthe nominee is from a State with a Democratic Senator, but it is \nignored when the nominee has the support of two Republican Senators. At \nleast that has been the case to date with the Fourth Circuit nominees.\n  For example, Rod Rosenstein is the U.S. attorney in Maryland. He has \nbeen nominated to the Fourth Circuit. By all accounts, Mr. Rosenstein \nis a fine lawyer and public servant. His peers at the American Bar \nAssociation certainly think so. They gave him the ABA's highest rating, \n``unanimously well qualified.''\n  The Washington Post also thinks Mr. Rosenstein is an outstanding \nnominee. In an editorial entitled ``A Worthy Nominee,'' the Post noted \nthat Mr. Rosenstein has ``earned plaudits for his crackdown on gang \nviolence and public corruption,'' and that one of his supporters at the \nhead of the Criminal Division during the Clinton administration, Jo Ann \nDavis, called him a ``perfect'' candidate for a judgeship:\n\n       Smart, savvy and as straight of an arrow as I have ever \n     encountered.\n\n  The Post bemoaned the fact that Mr. Rosenstein does not have the \nsupport, for some reason, of his home State Senators, and out of \ndeference to them the committee would not process Mr. Rosenstein's \nnomination. But Mr. Matthews and Judge Conrad do enjoy the strong \nsupport of their home State Senators. Yet those nominees can't get a \nhearing. So it doesn't seem that the same sort of deference is being \npaid to the Carolina Senators as to others.\n  I do understand the committee intends to give a hearing to the Fourth \nCircuit nominee from Virginia because the junior Senator from \nVirginia--a Democrat--in addition to the senior Senator from Virginia--\na Republican--support the nominee. It is great that the committee may \nactually at some point move a circuit court nominee, especially one to \na circuit that is 33 percent vacant. But why is this nominee leap-\nfrogging over two other nominees to the very same circuit, both of whom \nenjoy the strong support of their home State Senators and both of whom \nhave been pending for hundreds of days longer than the nominee from \nVirginia?\n  It looks as though if a Democratic Senator in the Fourth Circuit \nopposes the nominee, then the committee will not move the nominee, and \nif a Democratic Senator of the Fourth Circuit supports the nominee, \nthen the committee will move the nominee. But if two Republican \nSenators in the Fourth Circuit--or, in this case, four Republican \nSenators in that circuit--support two nominees, that doesn't seem to \nmean anything.\n  We need to treat all of the Senators who represent the Fourth Circuit \nconsistently and fairly. We can do that by holding a joint hearing for \nMr. Matthews and Judge Conrad. Doing so will make up for lost time and \nwill afford the Carolina Senators the respect to which they are \nentitled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2830-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2830-S2831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL WINDELL JERYD SIMMONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in Kentucky there is a family mourning \nthe loss of a young man who was taken from them entirely too soon. On \nSeptember 21, 2006, CPL Windell Jeryd Simmons was tragically killed \nwhen an improvised explosive device detonated under his humvee while on \npatrol near Taji, Iraq. The Hopkinsville, KY, soldier was 20 years old.\n  For his valor in service, Corporal Simmons received several medals, \nawards, and decorations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nArmy Commendation Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star.\n  Jeryd, as he was known, may have been born in Nuremburg, Germany, in \n1986, but he was raised in Hopkinsville. Jeryd's mother, Betty Simmons-\nMayo, tells us how her son would always greet her whenever he entered a \nroom.\n  Jeryd used to always enter a room and say,``Hey Mom.'' Then whenever \nhe would come back into the room, he would say, ``Hey, Mom'' again, she \nrecalls. I think he would say ``Hey, Mom'' at least 15 times a day. He \nwould start his e-mails from Iraq with ``Hey, Mom.''\n  But her friendly son was not without his mischievous side. Betty also \nrecalls a time when Jeryd hid a water gun behind his back and would \nsneakily shoot his mother, brother, and sister with it every time they \nwalked by. Whenever one of his victims accused him of being a culprit, \nJeryd would plead innocence. So his mother hatched a scheme to prank \nthe prankster. She said:\n\n       Jeryd loved to play practical jokes. To get him back, I got \n     everyone a water balloon, and the next time he was outside, \n     we threw balloons at him. He stopped shooting everyone after \n     that.\n\n  Jeryd graduated from Christian County High School in 2004 and set his \nsights on enlisting in the U.S. Army. He had made his decision to serve \nhis country before graduating.\n  Jeryd's friends remember him as a natural leader, somebody they would \ndearly miss, but also someone they knew would make them proud for his \nservice in uniform.\n  ``He was like the ring leader. He was the best,'' says Tad Abukuppeh, \na high school classmate. ``No matter what it was, he was always \nenergetic about everything we did together.''\n  Another friend, Justin Baker, agrees.\n\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n\n       He was pretty quiet in school, but when you got him out of \n     school, he was one of the funniest guys you would meet. He \n     was the idea man. If we were bored, he would think of \n     something to do.\n\n  Jeryd enlisted on June 24, 2004, and was assigned to HHC Company, 3rd \nBattalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, \nstationed in Fort Hood, TX.\n  He was deployed to Iraq in December 2005. Jeryd wrote in an email to \nhis mother that he would be home in time for Christmas. But, sadly, \nthat was an appointment he would not keep.\n  Jeryd's funeral service was held in Hopkinsville, where he was buried \nin a veterans' cemetery. He was laid to rest with full military rites, \nincluding a 21-gun salute and the playing of ``Taps.''\n  A memorial service for Corporal Simmons was held in Fort Hood also. \nAt that service, CPT Brad McBrayer remembered Jeryd as someone who made \npeople laugh. He reminded his fellow soldiers of Jeryd's career \nambition to be a special agent for the FBI someday.\n  Our thoughts are with the Simmons family today after the loss of CPL \nWindell Jeryd Simmons. We are thinking of his mother, Betty Simmons-\nMayo; his father, William Simmons; his stepfather, Jamel Mayo; his \nbrother, William J. Deal; his sister, Jarysa L. Simmons; his step-\ngrandmother, Mrs. Alfreda Brewer, and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  April Harris, Jeryd's math teacher from Christian County High, \nremembers Jeryd this way: ``He could have taken the easy route,'' she \nsays, ``but he wanted to prepare himself.''\n  While she was speaking about Jeryd's efforts in her classroom, she \ncould easily have been talking about the focus and determination Jeryd \napplied to life itself.\n  Our Nation is honored to have so many sons and daughters like CPL \nWindell Jeryd Simmons, who choose to stand and fight for freedom and \nfor their country.\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, this U.S. Senate salutes Corporal \nSimmons's choice to serve. We owe his family a debt that cannot be \nrepaid. And we will forever honor his sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2831-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the recent \nacquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase and the events that \ncaused the downfall of one of our largest investment banks and its \neventual merger with JPMorgan Chase.\n  When I first learned of the merger, I urged Chairman Dodd to hold a \nhearing. Last week, the Banking Committee began to exercise its much-\nneeded oversight role on this deal. The hearing served to shine a \nspotlight on the actions of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, we have learned much about the events that led \nup to Bear Stearns demise and how the government interceded to save it. \nUnfortunately, some of the accounts have raised more questions than \nanswers. Congress must continue to look into this deal and possible \nillegal behavior.\n  Mr. President, I am calling on the proper law enforcement authorities \nto investigate whether illegal insider trading may have fueled Bear \nStearns' downfall.\n  In the days, hours and, ultimately, minutes before news of Bear \nStearns became public, it appears trading in Bear Stearns' stock jumped \nsubstantially.\n  Volume trading in shares of Bear Stearns jumped from just over 5 \nmillion shares on the first day of trading in March to an astronomical \n186,986,900 shares on March 14--2 days before the Fed authorized the \n$29 billion bailout. Let me say that one more time. Volume trading in \nshares of Bear Stearns jumped from just over 5 million shares on the \nfirst day of trading in March to an astronomical 186,986,900 shares on \nFriday, March 14. In fact, the previous high in volume over the last \nyear was just over 28 million shares. Yet on March 14, shares of Bear \nStearns were traded nearly 187 million times. They were traded at \nnearly 187 million times.\n  It is uncertain whether or not rampant fears of the company's demise \nled to that spike or whether those looking to make a buck engaged in \nillegal market manipulation.\n  During the hearing last Thursday, I asked SEC Chairman Cox if he was \naware of any evidence suggesting that speculators had bet heavily that \nBear Stearns' share price would fall, known on Wall Street as ``short \nselling.''\n  Chairman Cox responded: ``I'm a little bit constrained because the \nSEC is in the law enforcement business.'' He stated that SEC pursues \ninsider trading aggressively and said his agency was mulling ``several \nlaw enforcement matters'' that had not been filed in any U.S. court.\n  Today, I will be sending this letter to Chairman Cox, as well as \nAttorney General Mukasey, calling on them to immediately and thoroughly \ninvestigate the role that short-selling played in the events \nsurrounding Bear Stearns' collapse.\n  Market manipulation is illegal and must be prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the law. I am asking that Chairman Cox and Attorney General \nMukasey to respond to me and the Senate Banking Committee with a report \nas early as possible about this investigation.\n  The American taxpayers have been asked to carry the burden of a $29 \nbillion loan that is linked to possibly risky mortgage backed \nsecurities. In fact, JPMorgan Chase would not have agreed to acquire \nBear Stearns had the government not shared the risk.\n  I want to repeat that one more time--one of the world's largest and \nmost respected investment banks would not carry the full risk without \ngovernment aid. And we are supposed to believe on blind faith that the \ninvestment is safe and will be repaid in full?\n  Knowing the consequences and the burden is being carried not only by \nshareholders, but by average taxpayers who live paycheck-to-paycheck, \nwe must learn if the Federal Reserve acted properly.\n  We must be certain that investors did not violate laws barring \nspeculators from engaging in market manipulation or insider trading. We \nmust be certain that the taxpayers did not post a preemptive bailout to \ncover massive short selling for those to make money in the markets.\n  I rose on the floor last week to raise my concern for the families in \nMontana and the rest of the country who work hard and play by the \nrules; yet, can't find a decent place to live that they can afford. And \nfor communities throughout rural America where opportunity is slipping \naway because of the failure of the national leadership to invest in \nbasic infrastructure that connects us to one another.\n  These families cannot be asked to cover what some are calling a \nGovernment bailout when they are having hard time filling their truck \nwith diesel and to save for their kid's college fund.\n  I look forward to hearing back from the SEC and Department of \nJustice. I hope they tell me that it was fear and nothing but market \ndynamics and not illegal trading. I hope they will tell me that the $29 \nbillion loan was justified and was a one-time act to prevent an \neconomic meltdown.\n  But if there was insider trading and market manipulation, the proper \nlaw enforcement authorities of the U.S. government must respond with \nappropriate action and prosecute any wrong-doing to the fullest extent \nof the law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

A couple days ago, we had General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker in front of our Senate Armed Services Committee in \nthe morning, and then I had a chance to visit with them again in the \nafternoon in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These are two very \ndedicated and bright public servants, and their public service is \ncertainly appreciated, and we expressed that--I think every Senator who \nquestioned them.\n  The bottom line for this Senator from the State of Florida is that if \nwe go back and look at what was the initial reason stated for the \nsurge, which was over a year ago, it was stated that it was to bring \nsome stability and give some time in order that the Sunnis and the \nShiites could have more reconciliation so they could start charting a \nmore stable government for themselves. When pressed on whether that \npolitical reconciliation had occurred, both General Petraeus and \nAmbassador Crocker said they thought it had. And then when I asked, \nwell, what laws have been passed, they named two or three, as if that \nwere the example of political reconciliation, and I think it would be \none indicia.\n  I further asked had those laws been implemented. Of course, with each \nof the questions that narrowed the focus, the answer was less and less \npainting a picture that political reconciliation had occurred. We would \ncertainly hope that political reconciliation would occur, because it \nwould clearly be in the interest of the United States that Iraq could \nbe stabilized.\n  It is the opinion of this Senator that the political reconciliation \nhas not occurred--while at the same time the aggressive diplomatic \neffort in reaching out to other countries in the region that are very \nimportant to bringing about political reconciliation in Iraq has not \noccurred. Therefore, the tremendous success and effectiveness of the \nsurge, militarily, in fact has not borne the fruit of political \nreconciliation as we had hoped it would. That is a disappointment to \nthis Senator.\n  On the subject of Iraq, I need to bring to the attention of the \nSenate that yesterday I had the privilege of chairing a subcommittee in \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the question of whether the \nrapes of American women who are contractor personnel in Iraq as a \nresult of the war effort there--whether these rapes are being \nprosecuted. The answer to that is, sadly, no. We had dramatic testimony \nby a Mrs. Mary Beth Kineston, who is a rape victim, and Mrs. Dawn \nLeamon, who for the first time revealed her identity yesterday in the \nhearing. In the couple of times she spoke on the radio before, she was \nusing a pseudonym. Of course, that testimony was exceptionally \nemotional, and it was very graphic as to the trauma that these two \nwomen had suffered, not only in the act of the sexual assault--and in \nthe case of one of the women, a gang rape after she had been drugged by \nfellow Americans--but the trauma in the aftermath of the contractor \ntrying to sweep it under the rug so that it didn't disturb the waters; \nand all of the trauma each of them went through and the way they were \ntreated by their fellow American workers and fellow contractors in the \naftermath of them not being able to get any help. In each case it was \nnot until the military intervened that they actually got any help. In \nthe case of Mrs. Leamon, it was 5 weeks after the fact when she was \nfinally able to see a U.S. military doctor at another base from the \nforward operating base where the assault took place, and she in fact \nwas told by the doctor that you need to continue to try to work through \nthis and get help; you were drugged and you were raped.\n  The second panel in our hearing was the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of State, and the Department of Defense. To say the response \non why there had not been a prosecution of 26 identified assaults among \ncontractor personnel--not U.S. military--contractors, American women \npersonnel and there had not been one conviction was, indeed, not only \ndeeply disturbing but deeply disappointing.\n  The way I tried to conduct that hearing, since I chaired the hearing, \nwas to say to those representatives of the Departments of State, \nDefense, and Justice that we were going to conduct that hearing in a \nrespectful way, and at the end of the day what we wanted was to \ngraphically bring to light the problem that is occurring, not only with \nthe assaults but the aftermath where American women cannot get justice, \nand that it is the responsibility of their ultimate guarantors, the \nvery departments that are contracting out for the war effort, to see \nthat justice is done. Hopefully, that may have occurred yesterday, to \nremind all those folks that in a very difficult environment, a war \nzone, we still have to obey the rule of law and, particularly, when it \ncomes to the rights of Americans, and particularly American women, to \nbe protected and to have the full extent of the law to support their \nrights.\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate because this is not the \nlast time we are going to hear about this issue and, hopefully, the \nnext stories we will hear in the aftermath of this drama that played \nout in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday will \nbe more a story of success, of how the wheels of the Department of \nJustice will continue to turn to, as the Good Book says, love mercy and \nto do justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nEnsign-Cantwell amendment we are going to be voting on shortly.\n  I thank the many cosponsors of the amendment, which I believe are \nsomewhere in the 20 range, too many to read. With the actual Cantwell-\nEnsign bill that was introduced last Thursday, I think we have over 40 \ncosponsors. It is safe to say there has been much enthusiasm about this \nidea of moving forward on extending expiring green energy tax credits \nand doing so in a way that we can get the requisite votes we need for \nthe measure to become law and be signed by the President.\n  I also want thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for their continued \nfocus on green energy tax credits, they understand that we need to move \nforward on leveling the playing field between the fossil fuel industry \nand making investments in green energy technology. I know the Finance \nCommittee has had many conversations about this issue, and I am sure \nthey will continue to make it a top priority.\n  I particularly want to thank my colleague Senator Ensign of Nevada, \nwith whom I have had an opportunity to work on several issues in the \npast such as protecting electricity consumers, ratepayers, from the \nEnron debacle, to now working with him on these green energy tax \ncredits. I applaud him for standing up and taking the lead and \nunderstanding how renewable energy will play a key role in our Nation's \neconomy moving forward, certainly the Nevada economy, and the need to \nprovide a level playing field to keep this year's investment cycle \ngoing. Senator Ensign understands that, and I appreciate his leadership \nin getting the other side of the aisle to participate in the \nsponsorship of this amendment.\n  I also want to thank Senator Reid who, being from Nevada, understands \nhow important the solar energy and the green energy tax credits are for \nhis State's economy, but he also understands the national economy \ndepends on us moving off of fossil fuels. I appreciate his steadfast \nsupport in getting this legislation passed. We are fortunate to have \nSenator Reid on our side in the upcoming negotiations with the House, \nwe need to make sure this legislation is actually passed by the House \nand signed into law.\n  We are at this point because we believe the investments in green \nenergy tax credits, production tax credits for wind and other \nrenewables, investment tax credits for solar, fuel cells, and for other \npromising energy sources, and the efficiency tax credits that are in \nthis legislation are stimulative. They are stimulative. We voted in \nthis body to put them as part of a stimulus package, and the Senate \nFinance Committee said we think in addition to checks going to \nhouseholds, some activity that would keep investment and create jobs in \n2008 should be a priority.\n  Mr. President, this is a stimulative measure that would keep about \n100,000 jobs and keep and protect about $20 billion of investments this \nyear. That is why it is part of this underlying bill, and we hope the \nHouse will look at this\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nissue as stimulative activity, along with the accompanying housing \nmeasure.\n  The reason why this is so urgent is because the end of the first \nquarter is here. Companies that are making these investment decisions \nare going to start issuing their first quarter reports, giving guidance \nas to the rest of the year and their investments. If we do not make it \nclear as a Congress that we believe in these tax credits, they are \ngoing to start canceling projects.\n  I know I have been to the floor and said this previously, but now \nhave the last month's numbers as it relates to actual job loss, the \n80,000 jobs that have been lost in our economy, and if you looked \ndeeply, you would probably find some of those jobs are these energy-\nrelated jobs, where we have not given predictability to investors and, \nconsequently, they are starting to cancel projects.\n  This Senator does not want to see the next quarter's numbers and see \nthe greater job losses because Congress would not give predictability \nin the tax code. This is a time when our economy needs investment. It \nneeds investment in those activities that are going to help consumers \nin the long run lower their energy costs, but, frankly, this is an \ninvestment we can make right now that will help our economy create much \nneeded new jobs and investment.\n  What is our goal? I know many of my colleagues would say: Let's go \nback to the drawing board and see if we can find a pay-for way of doing \nthis. I am sure this discussion is going to come up in the House of \nRepresentatives as well. But I remind my colleagues, we have tried that \napproach three times. We have tried that approach, and we have failed. \nThe White House has issued veto threats every time we tried to pay for \nthese measures. To now say we are going to revert back to that I think \nis going to leave in jeopardy the investment cycle for 2008 of that \n100,000 jobs and $20 billion of investment.\n  A more positive way to proceed is to get this particular legislation \npassed and signed into law so we do not lose the investment in the \njobs, we do not see a 77-percent plunge in the investment in wind like \nwe did last time the PTC was allowed to expire. Or see a drop off in \nsolar or renewables or efficiency and the other areas that are just \nstarting to take off. Instead we should get this off the table, signed \ninto law, and we have plenty of time later this year to talk about how \nwe are going to make green energy tax credits a priority in our \nNation's tax code so this industry can take off and continue to provide \nthe certainty and predictability we need.\n  What I am saying is, we should not pin a gold medal on our chest for \nwork we should have done in 2007 to give the market predictability on \ngreen energy tax credits. This work is actually late to the game. Let's \nfinish it and be proud we did so in a bipartisan fashion to break the \nlogjam, but now let's get on to the rest of the year in coming up with \na funding source for what are predictable tax credits beyond the 2008 \nand 2009 time period that will really stimulate the millions of green-\ncollar jobs America can have.\n  The urgency of this issue should not be underestimated. The \nopportunity for America to become a leader in green energy technology \nis at our doorstep today. But if the United States does not realize it \nneeds to put its foot on the accelerator, then we are not doing our job \nin communicating the facts. The Europeans, the Chinese, and the rest of \nthe world are going to move ahead in the manufacturing of green energy \ntechnology. The United States can be a leader in that new green-collar \nindustry or it simply can be a marketplace for other countries' \ntechnology solutions.\n  This Senator wants the United States to be a green energy technology \nleader. I want us to be an exporter of the green energy technologies \ndeveloped and manufactured here at home, creating jobs in the United \nStates and leveraging the know-how we have in green energy technologies \nto provide much needed solutions around the globe.\n  To do that, the United States has to give predictability in our tax \ncode. It has to recognize we are willing to turn our ship off the \nfossil fuel direction and on to green energy solutions that will help \nour economy, help our environment, and help shift the change we need in \nour foreign policy.\n  I hope my colleagues will take this vote on the Ensign amendment this \nmorning with a lot of foresight into the debate that is going to \ncontinue to happen and to support the Ensign-Cantwell amendment, to \nsign onto the underlying bill to say it is time for us to move forward \non this solution and to urge our House colleagues to work diligently to \nquickly put this legislation on the President's desk so we can get \nabout the other vital energy tasks we must address.\n  There is much work to do, but let's vote today with enthusiasm that \nthe United States is going to be more aggressive in turning to green \nenergy solutions and to make the United States a leader in green energy \ntechnology.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is a strong sentiment in the \nRepublican caucus that President Bush's nominees for judicial \nconfirmation have not been fairly treated. We have not had a single \nconfirmation of a Federal judge this year. I know we have some listed \ntoday, but up until this moment there has not been a single \nconfirmation. There was no hearing for any circuit court nominee from \nSeptember of last year until February 21 of this year, and only one \ncircuit court nominee has had a hearing in over the past 6 months. This \nis totally unacceptable.\n  In the last 2 years of President Clinton's administration, 15 circuit \njudges and 54 district judges were confirmed; thus far in this \nCongress, only 6 of President Bush's circuit judges and 34 district \njudges have been confirmed. Even with confirmation of those on the list \ntoday, President Bush is far behind where President Clinton stood.\n  The Fourth Circuit is a judicial emergency. The nominations of Judge \nConrad and Mr. Matthews are long overdue. Peter Keisler, a very \ndistinguished nominee for the DC Circuit, has languished for an \ninterminable period of time. There are not adequate reasons for failure \nto move the nominees in Maryland, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, and I \nam negotiating now with Senator Casey on the pending nomination of Gene \nPratter for the Third Circuit. Thomas Farr in North Carolina deserves \nconfirmation to the district court, as does Davis Dugas in Louisiana, \nJames Rogan in California, and William Powell in West Virginia.\n  So a number of Republican Senators will be coming to the floor today \nto protest what has been going on. I believe the Republican caucus is \ncorrect on this issue. I deviated from a Republican caucus position and \nvoted to confirm qualified nominees of President Clinton, and I was \nprepared to stand up and to say that it is the constitutional \nprerogative of the President to nominate and the constitutional \nobligation of the Senate to consent or to dissent--to not consent--to \nnominees, but not to hold them in limbo and not to fail to have \nappropriate consideration of these judges.\n  There is a growing movement in the Republican caucus to hold up \nlegislation if we cannot move in any other way to get justice on the \nconfirmation of these judges. It is a time-honored practice in this \nbody to put holds on legislation or holds on nominations or otherwise \nto delay legislation from being considered. I think that it is a very \nproblematic tactic myself, but it is used frequently by the minority to \nget some action by the majority.\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\n  I think that it is only fair to note that in some quarters within the \nRepublican caucus there is consideration at the present time to holding \nup the patent reform bill. Now, the patent reform bill is a very \nimportant piece of legislation--very important--to reform the patent \nlaws and to protect intellectual property and to maintain American \ncompetitiveness--very important legislation. But the confirmation of \nFederal judges is also very important. Very important indeed.\n  Now, Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and I have been engaged in very \nextensive discussions to try to come to agreement on the substance of a \npatent reform bill. We have had many conversations. Every day for the \npast many days--including yesterday--we have had several discussions \nbetween myself and Senator Leahy, between myself and Senator Hatch, and \nyet we do not have it right, in my judgment. We are very close on a \ncritical issue of inequitable conduct. We certainly have to stop the \nsurge of litigation where there is no reasonable basis to do so, and I \nthink the inequitable conduct provision, which I have been pressing \nfor, is indispensable. Perhaps we have agreement there, but it may be \nconditioned on something else. The damage provision is not yet \nsatisfactory, and I think we have to get it right even if it takes \ntime.\n  Now, I am aware that the majority leader would like to move ahead \nwith a bill, with a window which may be open in the immediate future. \nThere is nothing to stop any other Senator from introducing the bill in \nits present form and to take it up and to take up the disagreements we \nhave on damages, for example, and to vote on them. There is the issue \nof cloture on a motion to proceed, and I would not anticipate \ndifficulty on that unless the Republican caucus moves ahead with a \njudgment that we are not going to permit the patent reform bill to move \nahead, as a matter of leverage to get fair and equitable treatment on \nthe judges. At this moment, I am not prepared to say where I would be \non that issue. It would be my hope that we could work these matters out \nand that Senators could come to an agreement on these matters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would hope that there could be agreement on the issue \nof judges, that we could find a way to deal with Peter Keisler, and \nthat we could find a way to deal with the nominations of Judge Conrad \nand Mr. Matthews and others in the Fourth Circuit so that we do not \nhave to resort to using leverage like withholding consent on other \nlegislation, which would prevent moving ahead with cloture on a motion \nto proceed. I am available to discuss this with Members on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  So it is my hope that we will not tie up the patent bill, but that is \na possibility if we can't find some equitable way to handle this judge \nissue. To repeat, I am available to discuss it with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to find some sensible way to deal with it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleagues \nbecause I share their concerns about the immediate need to schedule \nhearings and then up-or-down votes on 10 highly qualified judicial \nnominees currently pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  This immediate need for judicial confirmations is especially true in \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which serves the \nresidents of Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \nWest Virginia. As a matter of fact, there are currently 19 judicial \nemergencies across the United States, 9 including circuit court \njudicial emergencies, and it is imperative that the Senate do its duty \nto schedule hearings and then have votes on the nominees who have been \nsent over by the White House.\n  The Fourth Circuit is currently operating without a third of its \njudges. The Washington Post observed that:\n\n       The Senate should act in good faith to fill vacancies, not \n     as a favor to the President but out of respect for the \n     residents, the businesses, defendants and victims of crime in \n     the region the 4th Circuit covers.\n\n  I sincerely hope the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee will work with Republican Members to remedy this unfortunate \nand untenable situation in the Fourth Circuit. Chairman Leahy and I \nhave a solid record of working together on a bipartisan basis on a \nvariety of issues, ranging from open Government to public corruption, \nand I am hopeful we can add this to that list.\n  I am also grateful for his cooperation in dealing with two recent \nFifth Circuit nominees. The latest of these Fifth Circuit nominees is \nCatharina Haynes, a distinguished member of the bar in Dallas, TX, and \nformer State court judge. In February, the chairman held a hearing for \nMs. Haynes. That hearing, by the way, was the first--and is still the \nonly--circuit nominee hearing that has occurred since last September. \nThus, the problem is painfully obvious. We need more hearings and more \nmarkups of nominees and more votes on the floor.\n  Later today, the Senate will vote on Ms. Haynes's nomination and, I \nhope, confirm her to the Federal bench. She is an outstanding circuit \ncourt nominee, well qualified in terms of her legal ability, her \nexperience, and her judicial temperament. Her nomination has not been \ncontentious or controversial. I am pleased our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have rejected manufactured criticism of her record \nand the calls from the hard-left interest groups to stop her nomination \nfrom moving forward. I can only assume that my Democratic colleagues \nsee these charges for what they are: reckless smears.\n  I am hopeful we can persuade our Democratic colleagues to reject \nsimilarly spurious claims against the many well-qualified nominees who \ndeserve to have hearings and who deserve up-or-down votes in committee \nand on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of my colleagues was recently quoted as \nsaying that facts are stubborn things.\n  The facts are that the majority has virtually shut down the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  Some say that the process always shuts down in a Presidential \nelection year, so I checked every one since I was first elected.\n  By today, April 10, in each of those Presidential election years, the \nJudiciary Committee had held hearings for multiple appeals court \nnominees.\n  But this year, only one appeals court nominee has had a hearing, and \nthere is not another one on the schedule.\n  The Judiciary Committee held no confirmation hearing at all last \nmonth, and last week's hearing was yet another one with no appeals \ncourt nominee.\n  The facts are just as stubborn when we look at the entire 110th \nCongress.\n  Since I was first elected, there have been seven Congresses like this \none that included a Presidential election year.\n  During each of these Presidential election Congresses, the Judiciary \nCommittee held hearings for an average of 25 appeals court nominees.\n  But today, more than 15 months into the 110th Congress, the Judiciary \nCommittee has held a hearing for only five appeals court nominees.\n  This amounts to just one-fifth of the average for previous \nPresidential election seasons.\n  If the partisan roles were reversed and the pace of hearings for \nappeals court nominees had slowed to perhaps one-half or one-third of \nthe historic average, I can guarantee you that my friends across the \naisle would be down here raising the roof about how we were failing to \ndo our confirmation duty.\n  In fact, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee under the previous \nPresident and the hearing pace was actually much faster than it is \ntoday, they did complain early, loudly, and often.\n  But the pace today is worse than one-half, worse than one-third, \nworse even than one-fourth of the historic average.\n  The current Judiciary Committee hearing pace for appeals court \nnominees is the worst in decades.\n  In fact, there is no current pace at all.\n  Or look at what is going on or I should say what is not going on, \nhere on the Senate floor.\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\n  The current Judiciary Committee chairman in the past often insisted \nthat 1992 provides the standard for judicial confirmation progress.\n  Like today, his party controlled the Senate and a President Bush was \nin the White House.\n  By this time that year, by April 10, 1992, the Senate had already \nconfirmed 25 nominees to the Federal bench.\n  It does not look like the Senate will confirm 25 judicial nominees \nfor the entire rest of the year.\n  This afternoon we will finally have the opportunity, the first \nopportunity of the year, to vote on a few nominees to the Federal \nbench.\n  The majority has stalled judicial confirmation votes longer this year \nthan in any Presidential election year since 1848.\n  Yes, you heard me right.\n  This is the latest start to judicial confirmations of any \nPresidential election year in 160 years.\n  That was the century before last. That was before Utah even became a \nterritory, let alone a State.\n  The last time the Senate waited this long in a Presidential election \nyear to confirm Federal judges, James Polk, the 11th President, was in \nthe White House.\n  What could possibly explain such abject confirmation failure?\n  I might have missed it, but I am not aware of any domestic armed \nconflict today that is disrupting the Senate's business.\n  Yet the Civil War did not stop the Senate in 1864 from confirming \nseven judges before April 10.\n  Senators today do not have to use horses or carriages or travel on \ndirt roads.\n  Yet slow, burdensome travel did not stop the Senate in 1884 from \nconfirming five judges before April 10.\n  The Great Depression did not stop the Senate in 1932 from confirming \n14 judges before April 10.\n  The possibility of the Senate majority party capturing the White \nHouse did not stop Republicans in 2000 from confirming seven judges, \nincluding five appeals court judges, before April 10.\n  Today is April 10, 2008, and we will not confirm a single nominee to \nthe Federal bench until this afternoon and even this late start was \nnoticed only yesterday.\n  Facts are indeed very stubborn things.\n  The majority has already virtually shut down the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  The Senate has not always operated this way.\n  The majority is refusing to do what the American people sent us here \nto do because--I guess, simply--they can.\n  That may be the reason, but it certainly is no excuse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in our country over the last couple of \nhundred years, you never know what party is going to control the Senate \nor the Presidency. As a result, in doing the people's business, both \nparties have operated somewhat by tradition with respect to the \nnomination and confirmation of judges. It is important because it \nhappens that, more often than not, in the last 2 years of a Presidency \nthe other party controls the Senate. That has been the case in the last \nthree Presidencies, and this Presidency. In this case a Republican is \nthe Chief Executive and the Democratic Party controls the Senate. That \nhas been the tradition.\n  As a result, and since we do not know whether a Republican or a \nDemocrat is going to be elected President next time or which party is \ngoing to control the Senate, it has been understood by both parties \nthat you do not play politics when it comes to confirming judges \nbecause, while you may be able to stop the other party's President's \nnominations one time, they might be able to stop yours next time. \nBesides which, it is not good government. It is not doing the people's \nbusiness. The President was elected fair and square. He has the right \nto submit judicial nominees and it is the Senate's obligation under the \nConstitution to act on those nominees.\n  That is why my colleagues and I have pointed out the historical \nrecord, that, for example, since the Reagan and Clinton and first Bush \nadministrations, during the last 2 years of the administration, when \nthe other party controlled the Senate, the average for confirmation of \ncircuit nominees is 17. The last President was President Clinton, \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, but we confirmed 15 of his nominees \nfor circuit judge in his last 2 years.\n  If we were to do the same thing with regard to President Bush, we \nwould have to confirm nine more circuit judges because there have only \nbeen six confirmed last year--none this year. The pace at which circuit \njudges are acted on ordinarily is a relatively slow pace. We would have \nto do two a month for the remaining time we are in session in order to \nachieve that. In fact, that would include the months of August and \nSeptember, when we are not likely to be here in August and September is \nnot likely to be a month where we would confirm judges. So we literally \nwould have to confirm about three a month in order to achieve the same \nnumber as Clinton.\n  Why are those numbers important? Not just because it is what we \nshould be doing. The President has made nominations. The Judicial \nConference says many of these are judicial emergencies, meaning we have \nvacancies in the circuits that need to be filled because there are not \nenough judges to do the people's business. We should do it because we \nshould do it; it is our responsibility. But even if you only look at it \nfrom a political standpoint, the reality is that if this tradition is \nbroken--of 15, 16, 17 judges in the last 2 years of the \nadministration--then clearly we are going to devolve into a situation \nwhere, for political purposes, the party in power decides not to \nsupport--not even to have votes on--the nominees of the President. That \nis very bad.\n  It is important that we maintain this tradition of doing at least \n15--and we should do more than that--circuit judges in the last 2 \nyears.\n  My colleagues have spoken to different judges. Arlen Specter, the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania, who is the ranking Republican on the \nJudiciary Committee, specifically mentioned Peter Keisler, who has been \npending the longest. He has been pending for almost 2 years. In fact, \nhe was nominated to the District of Columbia Circuit Court in June of \n2006 and received a hearing in August of that year. He is widely \nregarded as well qualified, fair minded, and has received support from \nall over the political spectrum. He is a graduate magna cum laude from \nYale University. He received his law degree from Yale Law School. He \nclerked for a judge on the DC Circuit and for a Justice in the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He served in the White House Counsel's Office, has been \nin private practice, joined the Justice Department where he was \nassistant attorney general for the civil division and was even Acting \nAttorney General during a brief time between the time that Judge \nGonzales left the Attorney General's position and Judge Mukasey took \nhis place.\n  The American Bar Association has rated him ``unanimously well \nqualified.'' You cannot get a higher rating than that. The Washington \nPost--no particular friend of this administration--editorialized in \nfavor of Keisler, describing him as a ``highly qualified nominee'' who \n``certainly warrants confirmation.''\n  Keisler was also the subject of an editorial from the Los Angeles \nTimes, which called him a ``moderate conservative,'' and supported his \nnomination.\n  There have been some who say we should not fill the last seat on the \nDC Circuit because it doesn't have as many cases as other circuits. \nThere was a point in time when that was true and I even noted that. But \nthe reality is that today its caseload is increasing. It needs to be \nfilled and Peter Keisler is one of the nominees who should be \nsupported.\n  I urge my colleagues to find a way to hold the hearings and to bring \nthese nominees to the floor so the Senate can do its business and act \non the nominees of the President for the circuit courts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saying that \nthis is the time for us to move. I am delighted to see the majority \nleader and the majority whip here on the floor as well, to talk, \nbecause there is a practical effect of what is soon to take place \naround here if we don't start moving judges soon, and specifically \ncircuit court judges. This is something\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nI don't want to see taking place, but I think you heard from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania--a respected, open-minded Member of this \nbody--that if we do not start approving some circuit court judges in \nsome significant numbers--I think my colleague from Arizona mentioned \nhitting some of the historic averages, or at least getting close to \nit--I think you are going to see people start to jam the body down and \nsay that unless we start approving some circuit court judges, business \nis not going to happen around here.\n  I think people will understand why. Circuit court judges are \npositions that are significant, that are long lasting, that are needed, \nand yet nominees are not being approved. Why are they not being \napproved? We have qualified nominees who are in the queue who have been \nwaiting for a long period of time. I have one to talk about here, Judge \nRobert Conrad in the Fourth Circuit. The seat to which he has been \nnominated is a judicial emergency. We have a third of the positions on \nthe Fourth Circuit that are open. It is a judicial emergency. His \nnomination is supported by both home State Senators. They want this \nposition. In North Carolina, Senator Burr and Senator Dole both support \nthis nominee. He is highly qualified. The ABA says this is a highly \nqualified nominee, meeting their highest standard of ``unanimously \nwell-qualified.'' This is an individual who has been previously \napproved by this body for a Federal judgeship, and has now been \nnominated to move from the Federal district court bench to the circuit \ncourt bench. It is a judicial emergency. Yet Judge Conrad's nomination \nlanguishes and has languished for over 250 days.\n  I think clearly what we are setting up right now is for not much to \nhappen in the Senate. I think what you are going to see starting to \ntake place--and we are serving notice here today, if we do not start \nmoving these nominees at some regular pace--qualified people who fit \nthe criteria, who should move on through, business is going to slow \ndown in this body. It may come to a complete standstill if we do not \nstart getting some judges.\n  We should not go that route. I urge my colleagues, I urge the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member, to sit down and say: \nOK, what can we work out on circuit court judges? District court \njudges? What can we get worked out so the business of the Senate can \nmove forward? Without that, things are going to slow down here. Things \nare not going to get done. It is going to be because we are not getting \nanywhere close to reasonable numbers of circuit court judges approved. \nI want to say that clearly. That is where this is all headed.\n  The majority party can choose to go that route. That is what is going \nto end up taking place. It is going to be about judges. We are going to \nhave a big debate then across the country on that. Meanwhile, the whole \nNation wants us to get work done and we are not getting it done because \njudges are not being approved.\n  I hope the majority party would sit up and say we are going to \napprove this many, that many, we are going to get these moving through \nin some reasonable fashion so the body can do its job. Judge Conrad is \none of those who deserves a hearing. If there are challenges to him on \nthe basis that we don't think he is qualified, we don't like what he \nsaid here or there--fine, hold a hearing so we can get those out in the \nair. Clearly, if we do not start moving some judges in reasonable \nnumbers, you are going to start seeing this body start to not move much \nthrough, as we begin to protest not getting judges approved.\n  We should not go that route. I hope we do not have to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have sat here and listened and I have \nsome outline notes from which to speak, but I am not sure we should. \nThe very thing we are talking about is what America wants to spit out, \nin terms of their elected representatives. The Senate has an obligation \nto offer advice and consent. There is no question judges are important. \nThat is why you are here, seeing a demonstration from the minority \ntoday, of judicial committee members, because we know it is important. \nIt is important across the country because making law from the bench is \nsomething that is the antithesis of what most freedom-loving Americans \nwant. The idea that we want to have judges who know their role, know \nthe role of interpreting law rather than making law, is something with \nwhich the vast majority of Americans agree.\n  But I am struck by the fact that gamesmanship is taking place--not \njust in terms of the majority but also the minority. We are in a game \nnow. How do we move this? How do we leverage this? How do we force it?\n  My disheartenment comes from the fact--why are we here in the first \nplace? Why did we get here, when we know what the role of the Senate is \nin terms of advice and consent.\n  My hope is we do not see a devolution to parliamentary maneuvering, \nto raise the issue above where it should be.\n  I am reminded of the fact that the majority had problems with four of \nPresident Bush's nominees, starting in January. He withdrew those. In a \ngesture of good will, he withdraw four nominees who were not--although \nthey were well qualified, they were not acceptable to movement down the \nroad. Now we have highly qualified judges in districts that are \njudicial emergencies that get actually slandered by the chairman of the \ncommittee about supposedly an anti-Catholic statement--when they are \nCatholic in their faith. So we offer criticism to somebody and never \noffer them a venue in which to defend themselves.\n  That is not what America expects of this body. That is not what it \nexpects of the Judiciary Committee. My hope is the majority leader will \nsay: There is a deal to be struck here. Let's do what we can so we \ndon't spend our time on the business of creating wedge issues that \ndon't further the best interests of this country. Give President Bush \nfive or six more, seven or eight more district court nominees, all of \nwhich are qualified, bring them to the floor. Let's get it done so it \ndoesn't interfere with other important work. It is time for the Senate \nto make good on promises. It is time for it to reciprocate for what \nPresident Bush did in terms of withdrawing the four nominations. My \nhope is we will think about what is in the best long-term interest of \nthe country and not the next election.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask if the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee is ready to make his remarks, we should do it now. The two \nmanagers are not here, but I am sure they would not care. Then when you \ncomplete your remarks, we will go forward.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am prepared to go ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 3221, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3221) moving the United States toward greater \n     energy independence and security, developing innovative new \n     technologies, reducing carbon emissions, creating green jobs, \n     protecting consumers, increasing clean renewable energy \n     production, and modernizing our energy infrastructure, and to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax \n     incentives for the production of renewable energy and energy \n     conservation.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dodd-Shelby amendment No. 4387, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Ensign amendment No. 4419 (to amendment No. 4387), to amend \n     the Internal Revenue\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\n     Code of 1986 to provide for the limited continuation of clean \n     energy production incentives and incentives to improve energy \n     efficiency in order to prevent a downturn in these sectors \n     that would result from a lapse in the tax law.\n       Alexander amendment No. 4429 (to amendment No. 4419), to \n     provide a longer extension of the renewable energy production \n     tax credit and to encourage all emerging renewable sources of \n     electricity.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4429\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 4429 offered by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander. The Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, each have 5 minutes for debate.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask that the Chair let me know when 2 minutes remain \nbecause Senator Kyl may be back as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Alexander-Kyl amendment No. \n4429, which we hope is a helpful amendment to the Ensign-Cantwell \namendment. Let me try to say this in two different ways. If you care \nabout climate change, here is what our amendment will do. It will \nextend from 1 year to 2 the production tax credit for all qualified \nrenewable sources of electricity. In other words, these emerging \nrenewable energies, which have the capacity to work 24 hours a day, \nwould have 2 years, as well as wind.\n  Second, it would mean that wind would not get all the money but that \nsome others would have more time to respond to the incentives we are \ncreating with these tax credits. Let me use a story to illustrate. \nLet's say a family has several children. One of them older. Dad calls a \nmeeting and says: I have $3 billion extra, which is the amount of money \nwe are talking about for the Ensign-Cantwell amendment. Let's give it \nto the overgrown son who is still living at home who has gotten most of \nthe allowance money for the last 16 years. Let's give him another year. \nMom, who is a little wiser, says: It is nice for you to want to give an \nallowance to the children, but what about all these other children--\nopen-loop biomass and small irrigation power and landfill gas and trash \ncombustion. Instead of giving all the money to the son living at home, \nlet's give some to all the children, including the overgrown son. That \nis what we would do if we adopt the Alexander-Kyl amendment.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, the production \ntax credit Senator Ensign wants to extend for a year, 97 percent of it \nwent to wind in Fiscal Year 2007, which has gotten most of our \nrenewable electricity tax credit money since 1992. So the Ensign-\nCantwell amendment is being advertised as helping renewable energy. It \nadds another $3 billion over the next 10 years to the $11 billion we \nhave already invested in wind and these other promising children. Wind \nonly works when it wants to. These emerging technologies might work \nwhen they are told to. We would like to include them. Wind would still \nget more of the money than anybody else, but it would not get 97 \npercent. It would not get almost all of it.\n  There is another reason to favor the Alexander-Kyl amendment. That \nwould be if you care about the spending of tax dollars. According to \nthe Energy Information Administration, we spend 53 more times per \nmegawatt hour on wind than we do on coal in subsidies, and coal \nprovides half our electricity. We spend 94 more times on wind per hour \nthan we do on natural gas which produces clean electricity; 15 times \nmore on wind per megawatt hour than we do on nuclear; 26 more per \nmegawatt hour than we do on biomass; 25 times more than we do on \ngeothermal; 35 times more than we do on hydroelectric; 17 times more \nthan we do on landfill gas. We spend 27 times more per megawatt hour to \nsubsidize wind, a proven technology that only works when it wants to, \nthan we do on all the other renewables, 27 to 1. That is not a wise use \nof tax dollars.\n  We urge support for the Alexander-Kyl amendment so these \ntechnologies, and wind as well, will have a 2-year extension of the tax \ncredit instead of 1 and so all these promising children can help with \nclimate change and clean air rather than giving all the money to one \novergrown son who ought to be out on his own by now.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remain. First, I'd like to thank Senator Cantwell for her \nleadership in the last few weeks that we have worked together on \ndrafting a bipartisan compromise making sure that we help renewable \nenergy become more of the power supply to the United States. We all \nbelieve from an economic standpoint, that it will help create jobs and \nnew technologies as well as help the economy not only now, but into the \nfuture. Renewable energy helps the environment. It is cleaner than \nfossil fuels and makes us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. \nA lot of the money we send overseas is to folks who are not exactly \nfriendly to the United States.\n  The Ensign-Cantwell amendment is supported by a broad range of \nindustries as well as environmental groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following two letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2008.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), the nation's largest industrial trade \n     association representing small and large manufacturers in \n     every industrial sector and in all 50 states, I urge you to \n     support the Cantwell-Ensign Clean Energy Tax Stimulus \n     amendment number 4419 to H.R. 3221, housing legislation \n     currently being considered on the Senate floor. This \n     amendment would, among other provisions, extend incentives \n     for clean and renewable energy that are set to expire at the \n     end of this year.\n       U.S. manufacturers, large and small, have a substantial \n     concern for affordable domestic energy supplies and improved \n     energy efficiency. As a key component to reducing energy \n     demand, increasing energy efficiency will go a long way to \n     lowering energy costs and increasing economic \n     competitiveness. By promoting energy efficiency and the \n     development of renewable and alternative energy sources, the \n     package of incentives included in the Cantwell-Ensign \n     amendment represents an important step in securing our \n     nation's energy security without raising taxes.\n       The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that \n     votes on the amendment offered by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-\n     WA) and John Ensign (R-NV) will be considered for designation \n     as Key Manufacturing Votes in the NAM voting record for the \n     110th Congress. Eligibility for the NAM Award for \n     Manufacturing Legislative Excellence will be based on a \n     member's record on Key Manufacturing Votes.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jay Timmons,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   American Chemistry Council,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, April 4, 2008.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Ensign,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell and Senator Ensign: The American \n     Chemistry Council wishes to convey its strong support for the \n     ``Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008,'' (S. 2821), \n     introduced yesterday by you and cosponsored by a large \n     bipartisan group of Senators. The ACC has long advocated for \n     a balanced portfolio of energy policies that advance energy \n     efficiency, fuel diversity, and new supply sources. S. 2821, \n     in its current form, contains a number of critical and cost \n     effective energy efficiency and energy production incentives. \n     We urge the Senate to take up the measure quickly and approve \n     it without attaching any of the controversial ``pay for'' \n     provisions that have prevented the passage of these \n     beneficial incentives in the past.\n       The members of the ACC use natural energy resources to make \n     the products that allow our customers to save energy. The \n     products of chemistry go into energy-saving materials used \n     throughout the economy, such as insulation, weatherization \n     equipment, lightweight vehicle parts, lubricants, coatings, \n     energy efficient appliances, solar parts and windmill blades. \n     For example, the use of just one product, insulation in \n     buildings, results in a net benefit to society of 40 BTUs of \n     energy saved for every BTU used to produce the product. We \n     applaud the provisions of the bill that would encourage the \n     use of energy efficient products.\n       Similarly, we appreciate that this bill does not include \n     provisions that would increase tax burden on the oil and gas \n     industry, which is a key supplier to and a customer of the \n     American chemical industry. As you know, worldwide demand for \n     energy has pushed our industries power and feedstock prices \n     to dangerously high levels. In the first half of the\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\n     decade our fuel and feedstock costs have increased by more \n     than $100 billion. Our global competitors do not face similar \n     cost pressures. Our vital industry has lost $60 billion in \n     business to overseas competitors and more than 110,000 high-\n     paying jobs have disappeared. Additional taxes on the \n     companies supplying these feedstocks will increase costs to \n     our industry, result in high costs of our industry's inputs \n     and make it more difficult to compete in the global market. \n     You are to be commended for not linking discriminatory and \n     damaging taxes to the very laudable energy efficiency and \n     energy production policy objectives of the bill.\n       The American Chemistry Council urges the Senate to pass S. \n     2821, as it is a critical plank in a broader energy policy \n     platform, and for you to strenuously resist including tax \n     increases that constrain the supply of feedstocks that the \n     industry needs to competitively make our energy efficiency \n     products.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jack N. Gerard,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It is supported by everybody from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Real Estate \nRoundtable, the American Chemistry Council, the Sierra Club, the \nNational Resources Defense Council, as well as hundreds of other \nbusinesses and organizations.\n  This, however, is a delicate compromise. Three times in the past \nthere have been attempts to pass a renewable energy bill. They have all \nfailed. This is our chance to actually pass something that can be \nsigned into law. Unfortunately, the Alexander amendment would break the \ndelicate balance. We need to defeat the Alexander amendment and pass \nthe Ensign-Cantwell amendment if we truly want to encourage renewables \ninto the marketplace in a much larger way in the United States. It is \ngood for the country, good for the environment, and good for the \neconomy.\n  I urge a defeat of the Alexander amendment and adoption of the \nEnsign-Cantwell amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Cantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Alexander \namendment. Along with my colleague from Nevada, we reached a very \ndelicate balance to get this legislation where it is today. I would \nhate to see that balance disturbed by the proposal the Senator from \nTennessee is offering about wind. The reality is our nation is still \nonly producing a small percentage of renewable energy, and we could \nproduce much more. To curtail investment in one of the most promising \nrenewable technologies at this point would be premature. We have to \nrealize what we are trying to do is create continued incentives not \njust for the long-term, and this legislation is aimed at saving this \nyear's investment cycle. If the Senator from Tennessee wants to have a \ndiscussion later about long-term clean energy investments and what that \nhorizon should be, this Senator is more than happy to talk to him about \nthat. But this amendment before us is about the near term.\n  The bottom line is that we are trying to do is create stimulus for \nthis year, we are trying to save the investment in the production tax \ncredits, the investment tax credits, and efficiency tax credits. For \nexample, PG has proposed purchasing 553 megawatts of power, which is \nthe size of a typical natural gas or coal plant, from a concentrating \nsolar facility in the Mojave Desert. If we don't pass this legislation, \nwe are going to lose about $1.5 to $2 billion in investment and a big \nopportunity to increase the tax base of San Bernardino County, CA.\n  Another example, Butte, MT, has one of the largest polysilicon plants \nin the world, producing feedstock material for solar panels. Expansion \nof this plant, an investment over $1 billion, is on hold because we \nhaven't given predictability in the tax code.\n  Passing this amendment will also give consumers efficiency credits of \nup to $500. Using that credit on insulation for example could save \nhomeowners over 20 percent on their annual heating and cooling bills. \nThe production tax credits in the underlying Ensign amendment, not the \nAlexander amendment, as a result in the next 3 to 5 years, we will have \nenough green renewable power to power 35 cities the size of Seattle. If \nwe agree to the Ensign amendment instead of the Alexander amendment, \nwith the investment tax credit, it will build enough solar power, and \n1.1 million homes could instead have the power of solar and more \nrenewable green energy. I encourage my colleagues to turn down the \nAlexander amendment and vote for the Ensign amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been written that King of England \nEdward I--known as the ``Hammer of the Scots''--once tried to prohibit \nLondon's burning of coal. He is said to have proclaimed, ``Be it known \nto all within the sound of my voice, whoever shall be found guilty of \nburning coal shall suffer the loss of his head.''\n  Coal has always had its critics. Despite them, coal has not only \nendured, it has prevailed. It fueled America's Industrial Revolution in \nthe 19th century. It fueled America's naval battleships in the early \n20th century. It possesses the bright potential to help America get out \nfrom under the thumb of foreign oil-wielding despots in the 21st \ncentury.\n  The coal industry has evolved in the last centuries, shaped by safety \nand environmental critiques. It has professed a willingness to evolve \nfurther. But the harsh attacks and efforts to demonize coal on the \ncampaign trail are becoming increasingly irresponsible and \ninflammatory, and destructive. Coal miners hear these comments, and \nwhat are they to think? They are patriotic Americans. They risk their \nlives every day underground. They reside in the coalfields, where they \nlive honest, modest lives, and where they attend church and teach their \nchildren solid values. And they vote. The last thing they deserve is to \nhave their profession--or to have their father's profession--demonized.\n  These kinds of comments are counterproductive to the challenges that \nlie in front of us. If our Nation is to regain its independence from \nforeign oil, we must rely on coal. There is no getting around that \nreality.\n  Coal produces half of the electricity consumed by the American \npeople. It is a cheap, abundant resource in a time when the American \npeople demand stable, reliable energy prices. The U.S. military is \nalready making long-term investments in liquid-coal technology. The \nchunk of rock that once burned in a stove will soon be widely used in \nfuel tanks of aircrafts, cars, trucks, and buses, and just about \nanything else we need it for. Coal will be around for a long, long \ntime.\n  I support a broad energy portfolio. Renewable energies have their \nplace in that portfolio, but they are not a panacea. Certainly one \nrenewable energy alone, like wind, will not guarantee our Nation's \nenergy independence. We need to expand our use of other renewable and \nalternative fuels. Solar is important, geothermal is showing promise, \ntidal has great possibilities, and biomass--particularly when combined \nwith coal to help immediately reduce emissions that concern us all--is \ncertainly a fuel worth investing in.\n  It is clear to me that the intent of the Ensign/Cantwell amendment is \ngood, but the benefit of the Alexander amendment is greater. And so I \nwill cast my vote with those who seek a broader investment in renewable \nenergies that is also grounded in the realities of the continuing \npromise of coal.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Ensign-Cantwell \namendment to the housing bill. This amendment extends expiring tax \ncredits for renewable energy production and development and tax credits \nfor energy efficient homes and buildings.\n  Let me be perfectly clear. I fully support extending these tax \ncredits. I voted for them last December when we tried to attach them to \nthe Energy bill. I supported them again when we considered the economic \nstimulus package in February. I am in fact an original cosponsor of the \nfreestanding legislation this amendment is based on. I have long argued \nthat we have a responsibility to put our nation on a path toward energy \nindependence. In addition to making us better stewards of the \nenvironment, this is also vitally important to protecting our national \nsecurity by reducing our dependence on foreign fossil fuels. Done \nresponsibly, it can also spur economic growth and create tens of \nthousands of new good-paying green collar jobs.\n  However, I felt compelled to oppose the Ensign-Cantwell proposal as \nan\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\namendment to the housing bill. In my view, however, the housing bill \nsimply was the wrong legislative vehicle for this initiative. As I have \nsaid many times, nearly 8,000 people every day are facing foreclosure--\n8,000 people every single day are losing their homes and must cope with \nuncertain and difficult financial futures for themselves and their \nfamilies. Working this week with Senator Shelby, the majority and \nminority leaders, and others, I felt it my responsibility to shepherd \nthrough a basic set of policies that will help mitigate this housing \ncrisis. This bill did clearly not include everything I would have \nliked, but it provides a critical first step, and it was imperative in \nmy view that we act quickly to stem this national housing crisis \nwithout being sidelined by other matters, regardless of their merit.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues Senator Cantwell and Senator Ensign for \ntheir commitment to clean, renewable energy and their leadership on the \nissue. For the reasons I have given, I wish this proposal could have \nbeen advanced differently. However, I remain committed to working with \nthem and all the Members of this body to achieve the goal of energy \nindependence.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee has 55 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, let me emphasize this point. No. 1, the \nAlexander-Kyl amendment has more certainty. It extends the production \ntax credit from 1 year to 2 for all these. Second, the distinguished \nSenator from Washington mentioned solar power. Solar asked to be out of \nthe production tax credit 3 years ago because all the money in the \nproduction tax credit was going to wind. In the Energy Policy Act of \n2005, I was the lead sponsor of the amendment adding the investment tax \ncredit for solar power. No one loses under the Alexander amendment No. \n4429, except wind is treated similar to everybody else. It gets 1 cent \nper kilowatt hour. That means it will still get more of the money than \nanybody in the production tax credit. But open-loop biomass, all these \nemerging renewable technologies will suddenly have a fighting chance to \nget some of the money that since 1992 has almost all gone to one proven \ntechnology. That is not a wise use of taxpayer dollars. It is not a \ngood use of funds to continue to over subsidize wind, which is now a \nmature energy technology. Two years instead of one is a vote yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, in a short while, the Senate will be \nvoting to approve H.R. 3221, the Foreclosure Prevention Act. It is a \ngood bill with some good provisions; namely, $10 billion for mortgage \nrevenue bonds, $4 billion for community development block grants, and \n$200 million for foreclosure prevention counseling. I regret, however, \nthat we missed two opportunities to make it even better. The first \nmissed opportunity was our failure to adopt Senator Durbin's provision \nregarding bankruptcy. I am still mystified why a bankruptcy judge can \nreduce the principal or modify the mortgage loan terms on a vacation \nhome but not on a primary residence. The second missed opportunity, in \nmy estimation, was our inability to adopt an amendment Senator Ensign \nand I offered to establish a $7,000 nonrefundable tax credit for first-\ntime homebuyers. I regret that the Parliamentarian ruled our amendment \nout of order and we never had a chance to vote on it.\n  The amendment Senator Ensign and I offered was timely, targeted, and \ntemporary: eligibility for the credit would be phased out for single \nfilers whose adjusted gross income, AGI, is between $70,000 and \n$90,000; for married couples filing a joint return, eligibility for the \ncredit would be phased out if their AGI is between $110,000 and \n$130,000. These phase-out levels are identical to the phase-out levels \ncontained in the District of Columbia's first-time homebuyers' tax \ncredit. The credit would be available only for the purchase of a \nprimary residence made within 1 year of the date of enactment.\n  We need to encourage prospective buyers to get off the sidelines and \nback into the market. An important segment of that population--39 \npercent nationwide--consists of first-time homebuyers. Recently, first-\ntime homebuyers have accounted for 65 to 67 percent of sales in \nBaltimore.\n  The District of Columbia had a similar tax credit and it worked. \nThrough the end of last year, first-time homebuyers who purchased a \nhome in the District were eligible for a $5,000 tax credit. The credit \nhelped 3,000 to 4,000 people become home owners each year, and it \nboosted buyers' interest in neighborhoods where home ownership rates \nlagged.\n  I think this amendment, if adopted, would have made a good bill \nbetter. I hope the House will incorporate a first-time homebuyers' tax \ncredit provision in its version of this bill.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would like to associate myself with the remarks from \nthe junior Senator from Maryland regarding the Cardin-Ensign first-time \nhomebuyers' tax credit amendment. We worked together as members of the \nHouse Ways & Means Committee and I was pleased to be able to work with \nhim again on this amendment here in the Senate. The foreclosure problem \nis particularly acute in Nevada; in fact, we have the highest rate of \nforeclosures in the Nation. Last year, according to RealtyTrac.com, we \nhad 66,316 foreclosure filings--a 215 percent increase over 2006 and a \n760-percent increase over 2005. We have nearly 35,000 properties in \nforeclosure, which is 3.4 percent of all households. This tidal wave of \neconomic misfortune is swamping the housing market in my home State. \nThe amendment Senator Cardin and I offered would have helped to \nstabilize the market and I am disappointed that the Senate didn't have \na chance to vote on it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would say to my colleagues from Maryland and Nevada \nthat I, too, think that in the current economy, a temporary tax credit \nis a meritorious idea. I commend the Senators for working so hard on \ntheir amendment and I can understand their disappointment. It appears \nthat, yesterday, the Ways and Means Committee adopted a credit more \nalong the lines the Senators have proposed. I look forward to working \nwith the House in a conference to craft a homebuyer tax credit that \nwill help the housing market recover. There are many things we can and \nshould do to help homeowners and a targeted, temporary homebuyer credit \nis one of them.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee for his remarks, which I find encouraging. I \nlook forward to working with him and with my colleague from Nevada on \nthis matter.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a justifiable feeling of \nanger and worry across America today regarding the ongoing housing \ncrisis. Millions of Americans are currently bearing a heavy burden to \nkeep their family homes and desperate for relief. The clamor for the \nFederal Government to act quickly has been heard by the Senate and we \nare now set to vote on a bipartisan package that will offer some \nassistance to suffering homeowners.\n  Without action, the pain of the foreclosure crisis will not only be \nfelt by the millions of American families who stand to lose their homes \nbut by all Americans. Congress must confront this reality and pass \nlegislation that has three key components: it is temporary in nature, \nhas an immediate goal of helping cash-strapped but credit-worthy home \nowners stay in their homes, and prevents a mortgage crisis from \nhappening again.\n  The bill before the Senate is not perfect, but it does contain \nseveral provisions that I support and believe can help our housing \nmarket--for both mortgage borrowers and lenders--now and in the future. \nIt is important to avoid situations in which homeowners owe more money \nthan their home is worth. Unfortunately, that has become too common a \nscenario in part because many homeowners never had much equity in their \nhome to begin with. This bill contains a provision that would ensure \nhomeowners avoid this situation by requiring a modest increase in the \ndownpayment necessary for Federal Housing Administration-insured \nmortgages. This legislation can also offer some relief to borrowers by \nincreasing the amount of FHA-insured loans, which typically carry lower \ninterest rates. Additionally, it is also vital to have well-informed \nborrowers who understand the terms and obligations in a mortgage \nagreement and provide lenders with accurate and easily understood \nfinancial information. The bill expands the early disclosures \nrequirements under the Truth In Lending Act and requires a new \ndisclosure informing borrowers of the maximum monthly payments possible \nunder their loans. While these provisions should help bring about some \nrelief, I do not think we should kid ourselves into believing that this \nbill is the panacea for our housing crisis.\n  I am supporting this bill and thank its bipartisan sponsors. However, \nI do want the record to be clear that I remain concerned over the \ninclusion of several provisions that do not adhere to my principles for \nmortgage relief and question the effectiveness of these provisions in \ndelivering needed assistance to home owners. Mr. President, again, I \nthank those who have worked so hard on this measure on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I look forward to acting on this important \nsubject.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the Senate threw a lifeline to \nhomeowners facing the specter of foreclosure. This legislation includes \nvaluable resources for communities, homeowners, and industry to combat \nthe downturn in the housing market.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, foreclosures have risen at an alarming \nrate. Compared to last year, foreclosures have increased by 145 \npercent. Many of these foreclosed properties were connected with \nsubprime loans with adjusting interest rates. A combination of lax \nlending standards and the creation of exotic financial products gave \nlenders the ability to offer people who would not qualify before the \nchance to own a home. However, there was little concern on whether or \nnot the person or family would be able to sustain home ownership. \nBecause of the irresponsibility of some lenders, families across the \ncountry have lost their homes and more are soon to follow if help does \nnot come.\n  One of the provisions included in the Foreclosure Prevention Act \nincreases funds for housing counseling services. These nonprofit \nhousing counseling agencies help homeowners connect to their lenders \nand renegotiate terms that will allow them to keep their homes. The \nmoney is estimated to help close to 500,000 families stay in their \nhomes. Another very important provision provides $4 billion in \ncommunity development block grant for communities to purchase and \nredevelop foreclosed-upon properties. This will enable localities to \npurchase unoccupied\n\n[[Page S2841]]\n\nproperties which drag down neighboring home prices and are easy targets \nfor criminal activity. By rehabilitating these blights, communities \nwill be able to prevent further loss of property value while at the \nsame time providing affordable housing units. Other important \nprovisions include providing a temporary tax refund to help struggling \nbusinesses stay afloat and including reforms to the Federal Housing \nAdministration to make it easier for low- and moderate-income families \nutilize the home ownership programs.\n  The housing crisis has shed light on the complexity and problems in \nour Nation's lending system. Many homeowners were rushed through the \nprocess without truly understanding the terms and conditions of their \nloans. The Foreclosure Prevention Act will amend the Truth in Lending \nAct to require lenders to fully disclose the terms and conditions of \nthe loan and to provide the home buyer with the maximum loan payment \nthey will have to make. This simple change will enable future home \nbuyers to make informed decisions regarding their mortgage and enable \nthem to plan accordingly.\n  While this bill is not the final answer to the housing crisis, it is \na step in the right direction. There are still many issues that need to \nbe resolved in order to avoid a similar housing and economic downturn. \nWe must consider revising lending standards to protect future home \nbuyers, increasing our affordable rental housing stock and ensuring we \ncreate sound fiscal policies that promote the economic well-being of \neach and every American.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the legislation \ncurrently before the Senate. The Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 \nseeks to provide assistance to families and businesses adversely \naffected by the decline of the values of real estate.\n  While I support many of the worthy initiatives in this bill, such as \nthe Federal Housing Authority modernization provisions and other \nresources to assist communities devastated by foreclosures, there are \nseveral provisions that cause me to withhold my support at this time. I \nnote that the bill will go to a conference committee with the House of \nRepresentatives, and subsequent to their work, I will revisit this \nlegislation.\n  America, our Republic, rests on basic and time tested principles. \nAmong them is our free enterprise system. The foundation of this system \nmust not be unduly influenced from excessive government interference.\n  Again, while this legislation contains a number of worthy \ninitiatives, respectfully, in my view, this legislation as a whole \noverreaches and fails this basic test.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the Foreclosure Prevention Act \nof 2008 because it provides targeted relief to homeowners facing \nforeclosure and communities dealing with the negative effects of \nincreasing numbers of foreclosures. Unfortunately, this bill also \nincludes provisions that would not provide assistance to those most in \nneed and it is my hope that those provisions will be modified or \nremoved during the conference process. While I have reservations about \nsome of the provisions in this bill, on balance, the legislation takes \na step towards addressing some of the problems in the housing industry \nby increasing mortgage disclosures provided to borrowers and providing \nmore housing counseling to homeowners facing foreclosure. I hope as \nCongress moves forward on this bill and other related housing measures \nwe make sure that the legislation is crafted to help those most in \nneed.\n  It is estimated that at least 2 million Americans may face \nforeclosure on their homes in the coming months and years, which will \nnot only have a devastating impact for those individual families, but \nwill also have significant negative impact on the communities in which \nthose homes are located. Various cities report that increased numbers \nof foreclosures and the concentration of foreclosures in certain \nneighborhoods can lead to increased instances of vandalism, crime, and \ntheft. We need to act now to provide assistance that will help keep \nAmerican families in their homes both for the good of those families \nand also for the good of whole neighborhoods.\n  While Wisconsin has not been as hard hit as other regions of the \ncountry, foreclosures are in the rise in the state and a number of \nWisconsinites have told me about their concerns about the effects of \nrising number of foreclosures on communities around the state. I have \nheard from local government officials who are concerned about holding \nlenders accountable for maintaining abandoned homes and ensuring the \nabandoned homes do not fall into disrepair. I have heard from housing \nadvocates concerned about borrowers who may have been misled into \ntaking out a subprime loan and now face the prospect of losing their \nhomes. And I have heard from dedicated lawyers and counselors who are \ntrying to provide counseling and other services in order to help \nindividual and families through these tough times.\n  If these personal stories are not enough to urge us to act, available \nforeclosure data should also move us to take steps to address the \nrising number of foreclosures around our country. One report, by the \nCenter for Responsible Lending, looks at the effects of subprime loans \nissued in 2005 and 2006 throughout the Nation, including in Wisconsin. \nAccording to the center's analysis, there were over 60,000 subprime \nloans issued in 2005 and 2006 in Wisconsin and close to 12,000 of these \nhomes financed by a subprime loan during those years may be foreclosed \nupon. Additionally, the foreclosures from these subprime loans may \nresult in over 550,000 surrounding homes in my State of Wisconsin \nexperiencing a decline in their value. These statistics are alarming \nand unfortunately are replicated in States around the country.\n\n  This bill does take some good steps towards trying to address the \nrising number of foreclosures around the country. I am pleased that \nthis bill includes an additional $150 million in housing counseling \nfunds for 2008 and $30 million to provide legal services to homeowners \ndealing with the possible foreclosure of their homes. These funds are \nto be used to assist families facing foreclosure reach agreements with \ntheir lenders so that they can remain in their homes while also making \nreasonable payments on the amount owed on the home. Congress \nappropriated funding for counseling services as part of the fiscal year \n2008 omnibus appropriations bill and reports indicate that these funds \nare a cost-effective use of Federal resources. I am disappointed that \nthe Senate did not provide the full $200 million in housing counseling \nfunds that was included in the original bill introduced by Senator Reid \nin February. I am hopeful that we can continue to look for fiscally \nresponsible ways to increase access to foreclosure counseling services \nin the coming months in order to assist more families in their attempts \nto restructure payments.\n  I was also pleased to support the increased Community Development \nBlock Grant, CDBG, funds that were included in the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act. CDBG is an immensely popular Federal program that \nprovides a flexible source of funding for States and local governments \nto address the unique problems facing their communities. States and \nlocalities will be able to use these CDBG funds for a variety of \npurposes including: establishing methods to purchase foreclosed homes, \nrehabbing these homes in order to sell or rent them out, and \ndemolishing foreclosed homes that are contributing to neighborhood \nblight. The increased number of foreclosures is impacting States and \nlocal communities in unique ways, and providing flexibility in the use \nof these CDBG funds is essential to help communities make the best \npossible use of this money. I was particularly pleased that the \nnegotiators of this bill agreed to require that 25 percent of the CDBG \nfunds provided in this bill be used to redevelop foreclosed homes for \nfamilies or individuals whose income is at 50 percent of the area \nmedian income or less. While this targeting could be even stronger, it \nwill help ensure that the Americans most in need are not left out of \nthe Federal assistance provided in this legislation.\n  The additional mortgage disclosures included in this package will do \nmuch to help ensure that future borrowers, whether taking out a first \nmortgage or refinancing their existing mortgages, better know the terms \nof the mortgages and how much they can expect to pay every month. While \nit is true that some borrowers fully knew that they\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nwere getting in over their heads when they took out mortgages, other \nborrowers did not understand the terms of their loans or were misled by \nlenders. The changes that this legislation makes to the Truth in \nLending Act, TILA, will help to prevent some of the egregious lending \npractices that have gone on in the past from occurring again. While \nthis provision is a good step forward, much more needs to be done to \nrein in predatory lending. I hope that the Senate can move quickly on \ncomprehensive predatory lending legislation this year.\n\n  Unfortunately, there were some tax provisions included in this \nlegislation that will not directly help families and individuals facing \nforeclosure on their homes. I am particularly disappointed that the \nsingle largest provision in the bill is a tax break that bails out some \nof those businesses whose actions helped aggravate the housing crisis.\n  I was also disappointed that the Senate voted to table the Durbin \namendment which would have removed a provision in bankruptcy law that \nprevents mortgages on primary residences from being modified during \nbankruptcy. According to advocates, the Durbin amendment could have \nhelped approximately 600,000 individuals or families remain in their \nhomes. It is the single most effective thing that could be done to \nreduce foreclosures. Unfortunately, this amendment faced stiff \nresistance in the lending community, even though mortgages on vacation \nhomes and luxury items such as yachts can be modified in bankruptcy \nunder current law. Senator Durbin even worked to narrow the amendment \nto address some of the lenders' concerns. Even after these reasonable \nmodifications, the lending community remained opposed to the amendment, \nand the Senate bowed to this opposition. That is unfortunate. The \nDurbin amendment was a measured response targeted at homeowners facing \nextreme hardship. I voted for Senator Durbin's stand-alone legislation \non this last week in the Judiciary Committee, and I hope the Senate can \nmove this proposal forward in the coming weeks and months.\n  With respect to the renewable energy amendment offered by Senators \nEnsign and Cantwell, while I continue to support extending critical \nrenewable energy tax provisions, I am disappointed that this amendment \nwas not offset. I also oppose the amendment's section 105 language. It \nunfortunately does not reflect the latest compromise reached within \nboth the House and Senate as reflected in H.R. 6, which passed the \nHouse on December 2, 2007; S. Amdt 3841, which I supported on December \n13, 2007; and H.R. 5351. I am pleased, however, that Senator Cantwell \nhas committed to working with me to ensure this provision is fixed to \ncorrect its overly broad definition, which poses a unique but serious \nthreat to Wisconsin. Unless modified, the bill's language could have \nthe unintended consequence of penalizing Wisconsin, which has a unique, \nState-mandated independent transmission model, by incentivizing its \nexisting independent transmission company to sell assets to another \nindependent transmission company. The provision is intended to only \napply to vertically integrated utilities and I am pleased by my \ncolleagues' willingness to work with me and Senator Kohl to preserve \nthis intent.\n  I have reservations about some of the provisions in this bill, but I \nwill support the final bill because the bill does provide some \nimportant assistance to individuals and communities and it is important \nthat we get the CDBG and housing counseling funds to States and local \ncommunities as soon as possible. The high number of foreclosures around \nour country has caused much suffering among individual homeowners and \nthroughout local communities and we need to take action now to help \nthese homeowners and communities rebuild their lives and neighborhoods. \nI hope that this bill can be improved during conference negotiations \nand that Congress will address the unresolved housing issues we face, \nincluding the need for stronger predatory lending laws and the need for \nmore affordable housing for low income Americans. The problems in the \nhousing industry and their broader impact on the Nation's economy are \nserious issues that will require the involvement of all levels of \ngovernment as well as both private and nonprofit organizations. This \nbill represents a step forward in those efforts, but much more remains \nto be done.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Foreclosure Prevention Act of \n2008. I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby for their work to \ndevelop a meaningful bill to help address the housing crisis in our \ncountry. Too many working families are losing their homes, credit \naccess has been significantly reduced, and our economy has slowed. This \nact will help alleviate the challenges faced by homeowners.\n  Hawaii's foreclosure rate increased by more than 88 percent last \nyear, for a total of 1,270 families who had their homes foreclosed. The \nloss of a family home can be financially and emotionally devastating. \nCompared with other States, Hawaii has not suffered as much during this \nhousing crisis. However, foreclosure statistics do not reflect the many \nfamilies who are having difficulties making mortgage payments after \ntheir adjustable interest rate mortgage reset or having to sell at a \nsignificant loss due to an unexpected transfer or a loss of a job.\n  This much needed bipartisan legislation will help protect homeowners \nacross the country, prevent foreclosures, and assist our Nation's \nveterans. This legislation will modernize and improve the Federal \nHousing Administration, FHA, to provide homeowners with additional \naccess to fixed rate mortgages. Additional resources will be provided \nby this bill for housing counseling to assist homeowners in finding \nsolutions to their difficult situations. In addition, mortgage \ndisclosures will be made more meaningful to consumers by this bill.\n  I also appreciate the inclusion of a provision that is derived from \nlegislation that I introduced last month, S. 2768. That legislation \nwould correct an oversight in the Economic Stimulus Act and extend the \ntemporary home loan guaranty increase to veterans so that more of them \ncan realize the dream of home ownership.\n  The VA Home Loan Guaranty was part of the original GI bill in 1944. \nIt was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and provided \nveterans with a federally guaranteed home loan with no down payment. So \nas World War II was ending, landmark legislation made the dream of home \nownership a reality for millions of returning veterans. Today, more \nthan 25 million veterans and servicemembers are eligible for VA home \nloan guarantees.\n  The amount of the home loan guaranty was last adjusted by the \nVeterans Benefits Act of 2004. The maximum guaranty amount was \nincreased to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit \ndetermined under section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \nCorporation Act for a single family residence, as adjusted for the year \ninvolved. Using that formula, since the Freddie Mac conforming loan \nlimit for a single family residence in 2008 is $417,000, VA will \nguarantee a veteran's loan up to $104,250, or 25 percent of the Freddie \nMac limit. This guaranty exempts homeowners from having to make a down \npayment or secure private mortgage insurance.\n  The newly enacted Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, however, temporarily \nreset the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA home loan guarantee limits \nto 125 percent of metropolitan-area median home prices, without \nreference to the VA home loan program. This had the effect of raising \nthe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits to nearly $730,000 in the highest \ncost areas, while leaving the VA limit of $417,000 in place.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure so that this \nimportant group of Americans may benefit from an increased home loan \nguaranty in this time of economic uncertainty.\n  This legislation would also increase benefits for specially adapted \nhousing for disabled veterans. This legislation would authorize VA to \npay an additional $10,000 to those eligible for assistance pursuant to \nsection 2101(a), title 38, United States Code, increasing the total \namount of funds available per grant to $60,000. Individuals eligible \nfor assistance pursuant to section 2101(b) would be able to receive an \nadditional $2,000 in assistance, increasing the total amount of funds \navailable per grant to $12,000.\n  Increases in housing and home adaptation grants have been infrequent, \ndespite the fact that real estate and construction costs are \ncontinually on the\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nrise. Unless the amounts of the grants are adjusted, inflation erodes \nthe value and effectiveness of these benefits, making it more difficult \nfor beneficiaries to afford the accommodations they need. This \nprovision would go a long way in making certain that specially adapted \nhousing benefits meet the current needs of America's veterans.\n  We must enact this legislation quickly to help homeowners remain in \ntheir homes, stabilize the economy, and provide much needed \nimprovements to veterans' housing benefits.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the progress this bill represents is \noverdue. The foreclosure crisis is dire, and there is much still to be \ndone. But this bill offers some immediate help.\n  Over the past few months, I have hosted a series of roundtable \nmeetings in Michigan communities with leaders from local and State \ngovernment, as well as organizations that are in the trenches working \nwith families facing foreclosure, to discuss practical ways to help \nhomeowners and protect our economy from further damage. When I have \nasked for their feedback on this bill, they think it would help address \na number of the problems they highlighted.\n  Across Michigan, communities would like to rehabilitate abandoned and \nforeclosed properties so that surrounding property values do not \ncontinue to fall. But currently there are not funds to meet the growing \ndemand. This bill provides Federal block grants to areas with the \nhighest foreclosure rates and filings to help rehabilitate abandoned or \nforeclosed properties and prevent further damage to local housing \nvalues and neighborhoods. In addition, taxpayers who purchase a home \nthat has been foreclosed upon will be eligible for a tax credit.\n  This bill also provides funding for much needed pre-foreclosure \ncounseling. I am encouraged by the good work currently being done by \nmany counseling organizations who are trying to help families avoid \nforeclosure. But across Michigan, foreclosure prevention counselors are \noverwhelmed, and a lack of funds is tying the hands of local groups \ntrying to help keep families on track.\n  This bill also helps address the critical need for more affordable \nloans to help families refinance and stay in their current homes. \nStates are authorized to issue new tax-exempt bonds to help homeowners \nrefinance adjustable rate mortgages. Providing refinancing options for \nhomeowners in potentially solvent situations is an important component \nin the effort to reverse the current tide of foreclosures.\n  Ending the foreclosure crisis will require a team effort among \nFederal, State, and local governments, community and neighborhood \norganizations, and lenders, brokers, and borrowers. This bill \nrecognizes that fact. It provides an opportunity to help keep \nstruggling families in their homes. It provides an opportunity to help \nrestore our housing markets by keeping declining property values \nstable. It will protect neighborhoods from a glut of vacant homes. \nThere is much more we need to do, but this bill represents a long \noverdue start. I am hopeful that an even stronger version will return \nquickly to the Senate from a House/Senate conference committee so we \ncan get much-needed help to people in Michigan as soon as possible.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to have worked with my \ncolleague Chuck Grassley on the important tax relief measures in this \nbill. They will help homeowners, homebuyers, and homebuilders. And I \nurge my colleagues to support them.\n  The tax provisions in the bill come to a little over $10 billion over \n10 years.\n  The bill creates a standard property tax deduction for homeowners who \ndo not itemize their Federal taxes. And that deduction will help low- \nand middle-income homeowners to afford to keep their homes.\n  The bill increases funding for mortgage revenue bonds. And those \nbonds will help homeowners and homebuyers to obtain affordable loans.\n  The bill provides a substantial credit to buyers of foreclosed homes. \nAnd that credit will help to stabilize local markets and restore \nproperty values.\n  The bill allows companies losing money--and laying off employees--to \nwrite off current losses and bolster struggling operations. And that \nability to carry over losses will help struggling companies to keep \nworkers on the payroll.\n  There is no magic solution to this housing crisis. This bill is just \nplain responsible policy. It addresses a lot of irresponsible actions \nthat led to serious trouble for many Americans and for our economy.\n  To respond to this crisis, Senator Grassley and I crafted provisions \nthat support American families and American workers. These folks \ndeserve to keep their homes. And they deserve to keep their jobs.\n  This bill will put real money in their pockets. It will do so through \ntax relief. And it will do so through continued paychecks from \ncompanies that use the tax relief in the bill to survive.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's send it to the \nHouse. Let's send its tax relief to American homeowners, homebuyers, \nand homebuilders. And let's speed this help to American families and \nAmerican workers.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate will soon have the \nopportunity to vote for legislation that will help lift struggling \nhomeowners, neighborhoods and our economy.\n  This bipartisan housing bill--forged through compromise and \ncooperation on the part of Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby and others, is \nnot perfect.\n  It is not a magic bullet that will solve the problem. Either coauthor \nwould be the first to say that. But it is an important step.\n  Experts now predict 3 million foreclosures in the next 2 years. \nAnother 45 million homeowners will experience reduced value in their \nhomes as a result of these foreclosures.\n  Nevadans are facing the fallout of this crisis more than any other \nstate.\n  In February alone, one out of every 165 homes was in foreclosure. \nThat is the highest rate in America.\n  Nevada's economy is suffering, just as it is throughout America, and \nthis bill will help begin to turn things around.\n  If passed into law, the housing bill now before us would improve the \nprospects and options for families and communities all across our \ncountry.\n  During our country's last great banking crisis in the 1930s, the \nFederal Housing Administration, FHA, was created to stabilize the \neconomy and help Americans secure the benefits of homeownership.\n  Over the past three quarters of a century, millions of American \nfamilies have become homeowners with the help of the FHA.\n  But the rules that govern the FHA have limited the effectiveness of \nthe program.\n  Our housing bill addresses this problem by modernizing the FHA. One \nof the principal benefits will be to permanently raise loan limits to \n$550,000 and to introduce more flexibility into the lending process.\n  President Bush has announced his support for FHA modernization. \nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress agree that it is the right thing \nto do for American families.\n  This bill will achieve that crucial and bipartisan goal.\n  Among the many little-noticed consequences of the war in Iraq is that \nthousands of service men and women stationed overseas are struggling to \nmeet their mortgage obligations.\n  The sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is more than enough. \nThey should not ever be forced to sacrifice their homes.\n  Our housing bill will help avoid that terrible prospect. We extend \nfor service members the protection period against foreclosure and make \nit easier for them to afford their mortgages.\n  These are just some of the important provisions that this bill \nincludes.\n  But as I have said before, we must recognize that the upcoming vote \nis just the beginning of a process that begins here in the Senate and \nwill continue in the House of Representatives.\n  I hope that when the process is complete, we will have a strengthened \nbipartisan bill that will do even more to help families, communities \nand our economy.\n  Yesterday, the administration announced a new program at the FHA that \nwould insure new loans that refinance existing mortgages for homeowners \nwho are ``underwater,'' meaning that they owe more than their house is \nnow worth.\n  There are reports that 9 million homeowners are now under water. The\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nadministration's proposal is predicted to help just 100,000 of them.\n  It is encouraging that President Bush is beginning to address the \ncore of the crisis, but his proposal does not go far enough.\n  Chairman Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank have been discussing a \nsimilar proposal for weeks that could help as many as 2 million.\n  The importance of our work to help our country weather this crisis \ncannot be overstated.\n  This week, the Washington Post reported that experts at the Federal \nReserve have said this:\n\n       The nationwide drop in home prices could put the economy in \n     uncharted territory, as there are no clear precedents for how \n     consumers will respond.\n\n  It is time for Congress to take action. Our vote today marks not the \nend but the beginning of that process.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4387\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 4387, \nas amended, is agreed to. The motion to reconsider is considered made \nand laid on the table.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 1101. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in implementing or \n     carrying out any provision of this Act, or any amendment made \n     by this Act, the Senate supports a policy of noninterference \n     regarding local government requirements that the holder of a \n     foreclosed property maintain that property.\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to provide needed \n     housing reform and for other purposes.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4523\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment to the \ntitle is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4523) was agreed to, as follows:\n        Amend the title so as to read:\n       To provide needed housing reform and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama and myself be recognized for 20 minutes, 10 minutes \napiece, to make some closing comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing no objection it is \nso ordered, and the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before I make those remarks, and I have \nchecked with the Parliamentarians, I would be remiss if I didn't \nrecognize a former colleague, Senator John Glenn, who is here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Senator Glenn, welcome to the Senate. Nice to have you back.\n  Mr. President, if I may, this morning, I think we have adopted a very \ngood piece of legislation, one that is going to take a significant step \nin dealing with the present housing crisis in our country. As I have \nrepeated on numerous occasions over the last number of\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nweeks on the Senate floor, almost 8,000 people every single day are \nfacing foreclosure. That is a staggering number of people, and in a \ngiven week's time that would fill most any college or professional \nsports stadium.\n  Eight thousand people every day run the risk of losing their most \nimportant asset outside of their beloved family members. The greatest \naccumulation of wealth for most people is their home. It may mean for \nthem, in their future, providing for a secure retirement, dealing with \ncollege education, providing for the unforeseen crisis that can occur \nwhere that equity in a home can make all the difference in the world, \nnot to mention what a stabilizing influence it has for a family, a \nneighborhood, or a community. Home ownership. All of that is at risk \nfor too many of our fellow citizenry.\n  Over these last many days, the Senator from Alabama and I and others \nhave tried not to solve every problem in that area but to take a major \nstep forward in addressing the issue of foreclosure, the housing \ncrisis, and the economic problems we face. I think we have done that \nwith this bill. This legislation includes the original ideas we were \nable to work out a week or so ago dealing with FHA modernization, \ndealing with disclosure, dealing with mortgage revenue bonds, and \ndealing with the idea of providing some tax relief for people who are \nwilling to move in and occupy foreclosed properties, which provides \nassistance to communities that would otherwise lose as a result of \nhaving dilapidated and boarded-up properties in their midst. And there \nwere a number of other provisions, including counseling services and \nthe like, included in that core piece of legislation.\n  But over the past week, a little less than a week, we have added a \nnumber of other provisions to this bill at the behest of our \ncolleagues, working with both the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee as well as members of the Banking Committee and \nthose who are interested in this legislation. The underlying bill and \nthe important provisions in it contained many good increases in support \nfor various things we need to accomplish.\n  In addition, the managers' package, which was adopted last evening, \naccommodates 16 different amendments, Mr. President. These amendments \nhelp veterans meet their housing needs. We actually increased some \ncounseling funds that Senator Murray and Senator Mikulski and Senator \nSchumer were interested in. We improved coordination at counseling \nagencies. We were able to accommodate a number of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I particularly want to express my gratitude to Senator Salazar for \nhis amendment, Senator Boxer, Senator Carper, and Senator McCaskill, \nwho offered some very good ideas. I mentioned Senator Murray and \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Leahy, Senator Johnson, Senator Crapo, along \nwith Senators Harkin and Sanders and Pryor, and Senator Ensign, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Gregg, Senator DeMint, and Senator Cornyn, who all \noffered ideas which we were able to accommodate.\n  Members of both sides had a lot of very good ideas which strengthen \nthis bill. So we are very grateful for their participation and \ninvolvement in allowing us to come to where we are today.\n  I should have actually begun my remarks by thanking the majority \nleader. Senator Reid made this possible. When I talked with Senator \nReid about a week and a half, 2 weeks ago, after having a conversation \nwith Senator Shelby and other members of the Banking Committee, we \nbelieved we could come forward with a core group of ideas and offer our \ncolleagues the opportunity to begin to move on this housing crisis. \nSenator Reid approached the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, and \nas a result of their leadership, they provided this opportunity, \nresulting in where we have arrived today, coming to this accommodation. \nSo Senator Reid and his staff deserve, along with Senator McConnell, a \nvery special thanks for making it possible for us to achieve what we \nhave.\n  Let me say very quickly that this bill is called the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act. Quite candidly, what we have done doesn't quite live up \nto the title. We have more work to do. We don't do enough, in my view, \nin preventing more foreclosures in the country. We do some things but \nnot enough. But I would say to my colleagues who are concerned, we are \nnot done yet. There is more work that needs to be done.\n\n  In fact, this morning, Senator Shelby and I and the committee were \nhaving a hearing on how to deal with additional foreclosures in the \ncountry. We have more work to do--another hearing next week. We have to \ndeal with the Government-sponsored enterprise legislation, we have \nflood insurance to deal with, and a number of other issues that require \nour attention, and our intention is to work on those issues. So more \nwork needs to be done, but at this juncture we believe we have \npresented a good package.\n  Mr. President, Congressman Barney Frank, the chairman of the House \nFinancial Services Committee, is holding hearings this very morning, as \nhe has over the last day or so, on these issues. My hope is we can get \nquickly to a conference with the other body on this package and come \nback with a compromise that is as strong as the one we are sending out \nfor consideration.\n  Again, I thank Senator Shelby, my friend and colleague from Alabama. \nWe have worked closely together over the years on the Banking \nCommittee. I served under his chairmanship of the committee where he \nhad good strong leadership and offered some very strong ideas that were \nadopted by the Congress of the United States. The tide has turned. I am \nnow chairman. But I have a good partner in Senator Shelby and his staff \nin helping us work through these issues.\n  I mentioned Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, and their staffs for their work as well on this legislation, \nbut we don't often thank or mention the names of the people who do all \nof the late work, who stay up all night drafting and arguing, \ndisagreeing and debating on what to include in these packages.\n  So I want to thank, particularly in the leadership area, Gary Myrick, \nRandy Devalk, Lula Davis, who has been terrific with the floor staff--\nabsolutely wonderful in the last several days--Tim Mitchell, Mark \nWetjen on Leader Reid's staff, and Rohit Kumar and Dave Schiappa on the \nminority leader's staff. Dave, we thank you for your support and help \nin all of this. On Senator Shelby's staff, Bill Duhnke, Mark Oesterle, \nShannon Hines, Mark Calabria, and Jim Johnson all were helpful. And I \nwant to acknowledge all the positive efforts of my staff: Shawn Maher, \nthe staff director of the Banking Committee; Jonathan Miller, Jenn \nFogel-Bublick, Amy Friend, Julie Chon, Lynsey Graham Rea, and Drew \nColbert. These are all people--and there are others as well on these \ncommittees--who do a lot of good, hard work, and we thank them.\n  Again, Mr. President, before the close of business, another 8,000 \npeople may file for foreclosure in this country, so we have work yet to \nbe done in this area, but this bill is a major, positive step in the \nright direction. There are provisions that, frankly, I am not as \nenthusiastic about, but they were consensus provisions added to this \nlegislation. There are many provisions that I think take us exactly in \nthe right direction in minimizing the impact of what is occurring in \nour country and allowing us to get back on our feet, again restoring \nconfidence and optimism in the housing market, and for that I am very \ngrateful to all who have participated in allowing us to arrive at this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for all of his \ncooperation and his leadership on the Banking Committee and on the \nSenate floor, and I want to associate myself with his remarks, thanking \nthe staff of the Senate and also the staff of the Banking Committee, \nincluding my staff and his. It is good to work together where we can in \nthe Senate. And when we do, we get a lot of work done.\n  Mr. President, when crises such as the one we are now facing come \nabout, the American people expect us in the Senate to act in an \nexpeditious and an appropriate manner. I think this is what we have \nbeen doing the last couple of weeks. Senator Dodd and I, at the \ndirection of our respective leaders,\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nSenator Reid, the majority leader, and Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, have invested a considerable amount of time in \ndrafting a bipartisan and balanced piece of legislation that is focused \non addressing the growing number of foreclosures nationwide, which \nSenator Dodd just mentioned.\n  In an effort to maintain that balance and to preserve our bipartisan \nagreement, we were not able to agree to a number of amendments, some of \nwhich I believe have a great deal of merit, and I want to touch on \nsome. It is my hope that Senator Dodd and I can continue to work \nclosely on a number of those, such as the need for meaningful GSE \nreform, as well as a mortgage broker and banker licensing bill.\n  Senator Hagel introduced an amendment on GSE reform that I believe \nmay represent the foundation for a very promising approach to \naddressing a very complex but critical set of issues. I stand ready to \nwork with Senator Dodd at any time to reach an agreement on meaningful \nGSE reform.\n  Senators Feinstein and Martinez introduced an amendment on mortgage \nbroker and banker licensing that I hope also lays the foundation for \nfurther action by the Banking Committee, headed by Senator Dodd.\n  There are other provisions that are not in this bill and that I could \nnot support. These included the bankruptcy provision, or so-called \ncram-down, as well as an unprecedented expansion of the FHA guarantee \nto hundreds of thousands of homeowners who find themselves underwater \non their mortgages and stretched beyond their means.\n  Mr. President, when we began consideration of this bill, I said the \nfollowing:\n\n       While we are in agreement on the measures contained in this \n     bill, there is a line that we should not cross. That line is \n     represented by a taxpayer-funded bailout of investors or \n     homeowners that freely and willingly entered into mortgages \n     that they knew or should have known they could not afford.\n\n  With that in mind, I intend to examine closely any proposals to \nfurther expose the American taxpayer to the risks freely incurred by \nindividuals or investors. I understand that Chairman Dodd intends to \nhold additional hearings on just such a proposal. I intend to work \nclosely with him to ensure that all facets of this approach are \nexamined thoroughly before we expose those who made prudent financial \nchoices to the risks created by those who didn't.\n  First and foremost, I believe our primary responsibility is to the \nAmerican taxpayer. In our zeal to help those who find themselves in \nfinancial difficulty, we must make sure that we do not do more harm \nthan good. This bill does include a number of provisions that deserved \nmy colleagues' support, and that they supported. The bill makes the \nnecessary changes in the FHA program so that it can meet the needs of \ntoday's mortgage marketplace. The FHA language provides protections for \nthe American taxpayer, who ultimately bears the financial risk of the \nprogram. The FHA title provides immediate help to the marketplace by \nreforming the Federal Housing Administration, allowing it to provide \ngreater liquidity and thereby enhancing the options available to \nAmerica's homeowners.\n  The bill also provides additional funding for foreclosure prevention \ncounseling--Senator Dodd has spoken on this--which will help homeowners \nstay current on their mortgages and be able to remain in their homes. \nThat is our goal. This is an area in which I hope to work closely with \nSenator Dodd over the coming year. I believe we must conduct thorough \noversight to ensure that this money is being spent properly and \neffectively. Should additional funds be necessary, I believe they can \nbe provided during the normal appropriations process.\n  In order to prevent a repeat of the current housing crisis, the bill \nalso increases the disclosures made to consumers obtaining mortgages, \nwhich I think is very important. I believe giving consumers more \ninformation so they understand what they are doing and the ability to \nunderstand the choices they are making will help them avoid making the \npitfalls and bad decisions many uninformed consumers made in the past.\n  To protect our soldiers, sailors, and airmen, the bill extends \nadditional consumer protections and provides those returning from \ncombat a chance to get back on their feet before they face any type of \nforeclosure proceeding.\n  Mr. President, in an effort to provide communities with the ability \nto clean up the damage caused by the foreclosures that have already \noccurred, we have included funding to allow States and communities to \nbuy up and repair foreclosed residences through the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program.\n  Attached to this funding is a requirement that any profits from the \nsale of properties must be used to buy and repair additional \nproperties. I believe that reuse of this funding in this manner will \nmaximize the impact of these dollars and minimize the possibility that \nfunds will be wasted or profits inappropriately pocketed.\n  The bill also contains a number of tax-related provisions prepared in \na bipartisan fashion by the chairman and ranking member on the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, this bill also includes a managers' package that \ncontains a broad range of provisions offered by 13 separate Senators. \nChairman Dodd and I worked closely to come to agreement on including \nthis group of provisions that, I believe, strengthens the core bill.\n  The first group of provisions touch upon a number of veterans and \nmilitary service personnel housing programs. These measures provide \ngreater resources, flexibility, and options for veterans and military \npersonnel to help meet the particular challenges they face in regards \nto their housing needs.\n  The managers' package puts to greater use assets in the Home Loan \nBank system to help bring additional resources to the effort to deal \nwith current conditions in the housing market.\n  The package includes additional consumer protections for senior \ncitizens who participate in the FHA-insured reverse mortgage program. \nThe package requires enhanced scrutiny of loan originators \nparticipating in the FHA program, which should better protect the \nsolvency of the taxpayer backed mortgage insurance fund.\n  The package also ensures that funds are not used to provide \ninappropriate benefits to private entities by prohibiting the use of \nfunds in cases where eminent domain is used to benefit private parties.\n  Finally, the managers' amendment protects taxpayers by requiring that \nany profits made from the sale of rehabilitated homes that are not \nreinvested in the program are recaptured and returned to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a focused and targeted piece of \nlegislation that will address in an appropriate manner a number of the \ndifficulties we are now facing in the housing market.\n  While there are a large and growing number of homes entering \nforeclosure, we must remember that the vast majority of homeowners are \nliving within their means and making their mortgage payments.\n  While some would argue that we have a responsibility to aid those who \nfind themselves under water on their mortgages or unable to afford \ntheir increasing payments, I would argue that we also have equal \nresponsibility to those who have made prudent financial decisions. We \nmust not forget them as we seek to help others.\n  Mr. President, the eve of an election year can be a very difficult \ntime to reach consensus on just about anything.\n  When we are able to come together, it is incumbent upon us to seize \nthat opportunity and move forward.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a good bill overall, and I was pleased \nto see the vote of the Senate just a few minutes ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2861-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2861-S2919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONSOLIDATED NATURAL RESOURCES ACT OF 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of S. 2739, which the clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2739) to authorize certain programs and \n     activities in the Department of the Interior, the Forest \n     Service, and the Department of Energy, to implement further \n     the Act approving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the \n     United States of America, to amend the Compact of Free \n     Association Amendments Act of 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I know my colleague from New Mexico will \nbe here in a few minutes and wishes to make a statement in support of \nthe legislation that is before us now. I will start by making my own \nstatement, a general statement about it. I know Senator Wyden also is \nhere on the Senate floor and wishes to speak on this issue and on this \nlegislation. I know, of course, Senator Coburn is also very nearby and \nwishes to make a statement as well.\n  The Senate will consider at this time S. 2739. It is a collection of \nover 60 noncontroversial bills that have been reported from the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee dealing with various public land, \nnational park, water, and territorial issues.\n  Let me start by thanking Senator Reid, our majority leader, for \nmaking it possible for us to proceed with this bill at this time. This \nhas been a priority of his for several months now, to get this \nlegislation before the Senate. He deserves great credit for doing that.\n  All of the individual bills included in S. 2739 have been passed by \nthe House of Representatives and virtually all of the bills--or their \nSenate companion measures--have also been favorably reported by the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. The committee votes on \nreporting these bills have been unanimous.\n  Typically, these bills would be considered individually and passed \nunder a unanimous consent agreement. Unfortunately, as most Senators \nare aware, it has become virtually impossible to get unanimous consent \nto pass anything this year. So despite the fact these bills generally \ndeal with State-specific issues and have the strong support of the \naffected congressional delegation, and despite the fact that these \nbills are noncontroversial--having passed the House of Representatives \nand having been reported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support--we have not been able to get them \ncleared.\n  In an attempt to move these bills forward, last month I introduced S. \n2739, which simply incorporates every bill our committee has reported \nthat has also been passed by the House of Representatives. The package \nincludes roughly an equal mix of Democratic-sponsored bills, \nRepublican-sponsored bills, and bills with bipartisan sponsors. As I \nhave already noted, since these bills have been reported out of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee by unanimous votes, there really \nare not any outstanding issues in dispute. Many of the individual bills \nthat are included in this package have been on the Senate calendar for \nseveral months; in fact several were reported by our committee and have \nbeen pending on the calendar since January of last year--not January of \n2008 but January of 2007. A number of the bills have been approved by \nthe Senate--by unanimous consent, I might add--in previous Congresses, \nin some cases in several previous Congresses.\n  While the individual bills in this package may not be controversial, \nthey are nonetheless very important to the individual sponsors, and the \nSenate has an obligation to try and pass these bills. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to briefly identify some of the provisions included \nwithin S. 2739.\n  The bills included within S. 2739 encompass lands and activities in \nover 30 States and the District of Columbia. The first provision in the \npackage is Senator Murray's and Senator Cantwell's proposal to \ndesignate the 106,000-acre Wild Sky wilderness in Washington State, \nwhich the Senate has passed in each of the last three previous \nCongresses. The Wild Sky wilderness is an important addition to the \nNational Wilderness Preservation, and has strong local and national \nsupport.\n  Another provision in the bill includes language sponsored by Senators \nWyden and Akaka to give the National Park Service important new \nauthority to enter into cooperative agreements to protect threatened \nnatural resources in national parks.\n  S. 2739 also includes additions to the Minidoka National Monument in \nIdaho and Washington State, the Carl Sandburg National Historic Site in \nNorth Carolina, and the Lowell National Historical Park in \nMassachusetts, and the bill provides the National Park Service with \nimportant new authorities at Acadia National Park in Maine and Denali \nNational Park in Alaska.\n  It authorizes studies of potential new parks in Missouri, Texas, \nArkansas, California, Arizona, and Massachusetts to assess whether any \nwould be appropriate for addition to the National Park System, and it \nestablishes commissions to commemorate significant anniversaries of the \nHudson and Champlain expeditions in what are now the northeastern \nUnited States.\n  S. 2739 would designate two new Outstanding Natural Areas to be \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management: the Piedras Blancas Historic \nLight Station in California, and the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse in \nFlorida. It also allows for BLM land in Nevada to be transferred for \nuse by the Nevada National Guard.\n  The package includes a new addition to the Wild and Scenic River \nSystem in Connecticut, and a new addition to the National Trails \nSystem, the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' National Historic Trail in \nVirginia and Maryland.\n  The bill includes authorizations related to new commemorative works \nin the District of Columbia, including one honoring President \nEisenhower, and establishes a commission to study the potential \ncreation of a National Museum of the American Latino, here in \nWashington.\n  S. 2739 would establish three new National Heritage Areas: the \nAbraham Lincoln National Heritage Area in Illinois; the Niagara Falls \nNational Heritage Area in New York, and the multi-State Journey Through \nHallowed Ground National Heritage Area in Virginia, Maryland, West \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania, and it authorizes studies of potential new \nheritage areas in Oregon and Kentucky. It would also increase the \nauthorization ceiling for several existing heritage areas.\n  This bill will help address the water resource challenges facing many \nregions of the country. There are 16 provisions in the bill affecting \nStates west-wide, including sections that will promote partnerships \nbetween the Federal Government, States, and local entities in the area \nof water, including paying for security costs at Bureau of Reclamation \nfacilities; ensure a better understanding of groundwater resources; \nfacilitate a feasibility study of serious proposals to address water \nshortages and avoid litigation; transfer Federal property to local \nownership and eliminate Federal restrictions impeding water \nconservation projects; promote water recycling activities; and \nauthorize Federal participation in the Platte River Endangered Species \nRecovery Program, which is strongly supported in Colorado, Nebraska, \nand Wyoming.\n  Given the critical nature of many of these items, it's important that \nthese water-related authorities be enacted as soon as possible.\n  S. 2379 also reauthorizes two energy programs at the Department of \nEnergy. One clarifies the Secretary of Energy's authority to make \ngrants to advanced energy efficiency technology transfer centers under \nthe Energy Policy Act of2005, and the other reauthorizes the Steel and \nAluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of \n1988.\n  The package contains two important measures related to the \nterritories. The first involves the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands--CNMI--to respond to longstanding Federal concerns \nregarding immigration, labor, and law enforcement--concerns that are \ngreatly heightened following the September 11 attacks. This bill \nculminates 11 years of congressional and executive branch efforts to \nextend the U.S. immigration laws to the CNMI including the \nestablishment of Federal border control as anticipated by the 1976 \ncovenant agreement between the CNMI and the United States. The bill \nalso includes special provisions to meet the special needs of the \nislands' economy. The citizens of the CNMI have been U.S. citizens and \nmembers of the U.S. family for over 20 years, but they have been unable \nto participate in\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nAmerican democracy as have the other territories. S. 2793 rectifies \nthis by authorizing the election of a Delegate from the CNMI to the \nHouse of Representatives, a necessary step if we are to keep faith with \nour Nation's founding principle of representative government.\n  The final title of S. 2739 would make numerous amendments to the \nCompacts of Free Association between the United States and the Pacific \nisland nations of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.\n  As lengthy as that summary of the provisions in S. 2739 was, it \nreflects only a portion of the bills that have been considered in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee this Congress. This package \nreflects only a first step of Energy Committee bills that need to be \nconsidered this year. As soon as S. 2739 is passed, I will assemble a \nsecond package, with a similar number of bills, containing legislation \nthat has been approved by our committee, but which has not yet come \nover from the other body. Like this package, the second bill will be a \nwide-ranging collection of authorizing measures.\n  But regardless of whether the individual items in that package are \nlarge or small, all these bills will have been reported by our \ncommittee after a full public process. I know many Senators who have \nbills that will be, in fact, in that second package rather than in this \nfirst package and are eager for us to move ahead. I would point out the \nNew Mexico-specific bills I have sponsored will be in that second \npackage; they are not in the legislation before us today. So I share in \nthat desire to move expeditiously, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Domenici and the majority leader and, of course, the Republican \nLeader as well to try to get that second package ready for floor \nconsideration as soon as possible.\n  Senate rule XLIV requires the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction to certify that each Congressionally directed spending \nitem in any bill coming before the Senate has been identified and \ndisclosed on a publicly accessible Congressional Web site. The rule \ndefines ``congressionally directed spending items'' as spending items \n``included primarily at the request of a Senator.''\n  Although I included none of the House-passed bills in S. 2739, \nprimarily at the request of a Senator, in the interests of full \ndisclosure I have provided a list of all spending authorizations for \nspecific amounts targeted to specific localities contained in S. 2739, \nalong with the name of the sponsor of the Senate companion of the \nHouse-passed bill.\n  This list has been made available on the Web site of the Committee of \nEnergy and Natural Resources since March 11 and was previously printed \nin the Congressional Record on March 11, at page S. 1869.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the list, along with my \nletter to the Majority Leader accompanying the list, be printed in the \nRecord for the information of all Senators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: S. 2739, the Consolidated Natural \n     Resources Act of 2008, which I introduced yesterday, is a \n     collection of 62 separate legislative measures under the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources. The purpose of the bill is to facilitate \n     consideration in the Senate of the large and growing number \n     of measures relating to protection of natural resources and \n     preservation of our historic heritage that have been passed \n     by the House of Representatives and approved by the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources. Forty-three of the measures \n     in S. 2739 consist of the text of separate bills passed by \n     the House of Representatives, twelve are drawn from separate \n     titles, subtitles, or sections of two other House-passed \n     bills, and two are House-passed concurrent resolutions. Only \n     one provision, section 482, contains new matter that has not \n     passed the House of Representatives.\n       While S. 2739 incorporates a number of provisions of S. \n     2483, the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and \n     Reclamation Projects Authorization Act of 2007, which I \n     introduced three months ago, on December 14, 2007, there are \n     a number of differences between the bills that are dictated \n     by the amount of time that has elapsed since last December \n     and by action that has since taken place in the House of \n     Representatives. Two of the sections included in S. 2483 last \n     December were subsequently enacted into law as part of the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, \n     and, accordingly, have been left out of S. 2739. Eight new \n     provisions, drawn from eight separate House bills or \n     resolutions, have been added. Two of the effective dates in \n     title VIII of S. 2483 have been extended in S. 2739 in light \n     of the passage of time since S. 2483 was introduced. In \n     addition, minor modifications were made in a few other \n     provisions.\n       Although S. 2739 has not been referred to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources, all of the House bills that \n     make up S. 2739 or their Senate companions have either been \n     reported or ordered reported by the Committee.\n       Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides \n     that, before proceeding to the consideration of a bill, the \n     chairman of the committee of jurisdiction must certify that \n     each congressionally designated spending item in the bill and \n     the name of the Senator requesting it has been identified and \n     posted on a publicly accessible website. The term \n     ``congressionally designated spending item'' is broadly \n     defined, in pertinent part, to include ``a provision ... \n     included primarily at the request of a Senator . . . \n     authorizing . . . a specific amount of discretionary budget \n     authority . . . for . . . expenditure with or to an entity, \n     or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process.''\n       Fifteen of the House-passed measures incorporated into S. \n     2739 contain provisions authorizing the appropriation of \n     specific amounts targeted to specific entities or localities. \n     These authorizations are included in S. 2739 because they are \n     part of the text of the House-passed bills. No Senator \n     submitted a request to me to include them.\n       In the interest of furthering the transparency and \n     accountability of the legislative process, however, I have \n     posted a list of the specific authorizations in S. 2739 on \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources' website. The \n     list includes the name of the principal sponsor of the Senate \n     companion measure that corresponds to the House-passed bill. \n     A copy of the list is attached for your convenience.\n       I previously asked the principal sponsor of the Senate \n     companion measure of each House bill contained in S. 2483 to \n     certify that neither the Senator nor the Senator's immediate \n     family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and have posted \n     the certifications I have received on the Committee's \n     website. All certifications received in relation to S. 2483 \n     remain on the Committee's website, where they are available \n     for public inspection in accordance with paragraph 6 of Rule \n     XLIV. I have not received any requests for new \n     congressionally directed spending items to be included in S. \n     2739.\n       Thus, in accordance with Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of \n     the Senate, I hereby certify that each congressionally \n     directed spending item in S. 2739 has been identified through \n     a list and that the list was posted on the Committee's \n     publicly accessible website at approximately 3 p.m. on March \n     11, 2008.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Congressionally Directed \nSpending Item Certification Pursuant To Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules \n                             of the Senate\n\n\n        S. 2739--THE CONSOLIDATED NATURAL RESOURCES ACT OF 2008\n\n       Provisions in S. 2739 authorizing appropriations in a \n     specific amount for expenditure with or to an entity or \n     targeted to a specific State, locality, or congressional \n     district, other than through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                        Principal sponsor  of\n              Section                   Program or entity             State                  Senate bill\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n314(c).............................

While I have previously tried to describe all the \nprovisions in the package, I believe the individual sponsors can better \ndescribe the merits of some of their specific provisions. I am sure \nmany of them will want to do so.\n  Passage of S. 2739 will not only allow us to send this to the House \nand then to the President, it will also allow us to move forward and \naddress the many legislative pending requests within our Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee that have been awaiting consideration \nbehind this bill.\n  I think it is important to remember all the individual provisions \nincluded in the package were previously approved by the House of \nRepresentatives. I know in a few minutes the Senate will also be \nconsidering four amendments that have not been approved either in the \nHouse or by our Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  To ensure that we do not jeopardize the enactment of S. 2739, I will \nbe opposing all those amendments, and I will urge my colleagues to do \nso as well, so we can finally pass this bill in a form the House can \nquickly pass and send to the President for his signature.\n  As I indicated before, I know Senator Domenici wishes to make a \nstatement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Bingaman.\n  I rise today in support of S. 2739, the Consolidated Natural \nResources Act of 2008. This bill is a collection of 62 individual \nmeasures that were in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that \nhave been considered favorably and reported to the Senate.\n  Packaging individual bills into a single bill is not typically the \nway we get the natural resources side of the Energy Committee business \ndone. It is not my preference to do it this way. However, our customary \nprocedure has been turned on its head since the beginning of the 109th \nCongress, and the fact that we are here considering this bill on the \nfloor today reflects the frustration of many Members in this regard.\n  I have served on this committee for over 30 years, 4 of those as \nchairman and the past 2 as ranking Republican member. The recent \ncontroversy over consideration of this bill is simply a continuation of \nthe efforts by the junior Senator from Oklahoma, since the beginning of \nthe 109th Congress, to frustrate, in my opinion, the legitimate \nbusiness of this committee and the Senate in maintaining proper \noversight over the stewardship of Federal lands.\n  While I am pleased my colleague's concern about the unanimous consent \nprocess on an earlier version of this bill has been resolved, I \nnevertheless remain concerned about the ability of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to conduct its business and that of the \nMembers of the Senate. In addition to the 62 measures in this bill, we \nhave reported over 40 other bills that still need to be considered, and \nwe simply do not have sufficient floor time to consider each of those \nbills individually.\n  Typically, we have passed these bills by unanimous consent after \nhaving worked out any objections by individual Senators to specific \nprovisions. Yet that process we have used for years to get these types \nof bills passed has ground to a halt because of the generic objections \nabout authorizations from the junior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  When I, as chairman, and now Senator Bingaman as chairman, have tried \nto address the objections, we have been met with new ones each time we \nthink we have resolved the issue. Frankly, I believe much of this \nproblem can be attributed to a lack of understanding about the \njurisdiction of the committee, the importance of its business in \nensuring proper management of our Nation's natural resource treasures. \nA bit of history would shed some light on the reasons for many \nSenators' frustration and is certainly something that deserves \nattention.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee began as a public lands \ncommittee nearly 200 years ago, providing oversight over the lands \nacquired in the Louisiana Purchase. It was one of the first standing \ncommittees in the Senate. Over the years its jurisdiction obviously has \nexpanded to include energy issues as well, but easily more than half \nthe committee's business continues to be public lands issues.\n  Those of you who have served on the committee know this includes \neverything from our national parks and monuments to all the Bureau of \nReclamation water projects. The committee oversees the management of \nthe Department of Interior and the Forest Service, of 535 million acres \nof land, and includes 58 national parks, 88 national monuments, \nincluding those on the Mall, and over 428 million acres of wilderness \nareas. This is over 30 percent of the total area of the United States.\n  The committee also has oversight of the Bureau of Reclamation \nprojects that include more than 600 dams and reservoirs, including \nHoover and Grand Coulee Dams. Our job is to make sure our national \ntreasures are properly managed and that the departments of the \nexecutive branch charged with that task maintain a proper balance \nbetween the Federal, State, and local interests.\n  In addition, the committee oversees all matters related to U.S. \nterritories, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Because the \njurisdiction is vast, the number of bills the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee considers each Congress generally far exceeds that \nof other Senate committees.\n  In the 109th Congress alone, a total of 491 bills and resolutions \nhave been referred to the committee for consideration. Most of these \nmeasures, as with the measures that are embodied in 2739, the bill \ncurrently before us, are required because the administrative agencies \neither have not taken action in addressing such things as boundary \nadjustments, land exchanges, or other matters relating to Federal \nlands, as Senators feel are necessary within their States. But in the \n109th, we passed fewer than half of what we should have historically \npassed in previous Congresses because of the Senator from Oklahoma's \nobjections. I am hoping together we are learning and the Senator from \nOklahoma will work with us and understand all these bills are \nauthorization bills, authorizing bills. They do not spend money until \nsomething else is done.\n  Money must be appropriated or spent by some committee or \nadministrative body if it has authority because these bills authorize, \nthey do not appropriate. The futile exercise ignores the balance \nbetween authorizing committees and appropriations committees; that is, \nthe futile exercise that has been put upon us by the Senator from \nOklahoma over the last 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Let me pursue this point a little further, Mr. President.\n  The Constitution says, ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, \nbut in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . .'' Note that the \nConstitution says, ``appropriations.'' Under most circumstances, an \nauthorization does not compel an appropriation of money from the \nTreasury. So, as I have attempted to reason with the Senator from \nOklahoma, authorizations that involve the HOPE of appropriations occur \nall the time in this body. Most of the time, appropriations fall far \nshort of the authorized level of spending. A case in point is the \ndecision of Congress to not spend as much money on No Child Left Behind \nas the authorization bill would have allowed. In some cases, \nappropriations are made in the absence of authorization. So, clearly, \nthe passage of these lands bills compels no appropriations bill in the \nfuture, and, thus, no point of order under the Congressional Budget Act \nlies against\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\nthese bills. My attempts to persuade the Senator from Oklahoma of this \nfact have failed, leading to this Senator's frustrations. Let's be \nclear here: these are authorization bills, they compel no \nappropriations in most cases, and spending to carry out the intent of \nthe vast majority of these bills is contained in the salaries and \nexpenses of the Departments within whose jurisdiction these matters \nlie. So, the premise of the Senator from Oklahoma--that these bills \nwill inflate spending and increase the deficit--is fundamentally \nflawed.\n  As I have noted, most of these measures have no direct cost to the \nTreasury; rather, they set priorities for the Departments for the use \nof their administrative budgets that will be appropriated each year. \nBut one of the principal objections the Senator from Oklahoma has \nraised to all the bills the committee has is they cost too much money \nor, as he puts it: They will some day cost money.\n  That may be true. But the Congressional Budget Office reports on most \nof these bills that the administrative costs to implement them would be \nnegligible. In the rare instance where the bill would require \nsignificant resources, no action could be taken unless there were \nadditional appropriations.\n  So, basically, there have been no reasons for holding up these bills. \nThe business of the Committee that is before us in this bill should \nhave been able to have been taken a long time ago. I do not believe the \njudgment regarding park boundaries in Wyoming, a land exchange in \nArizona, a water project in Colorado, should supplant that of the 23 \nmembers of the committee--that one Senator should supplant that.\n  Those 23 members of this committee make their judgments on \ninformation compiled by a professional staff with a combined service of \nrelevant departments in Congress of over 70 years on the Republican \nstaff side alone. They spend a great deal of time on these bills. They \nknow more than anyone else. They give that knowledge to us, the 23 \nmembers, and we vote. It is not as if these bills are put together, \nbrought here, much time, effort and money and resources are put into \nthem before they are put together and before we ask the Senate to pass \nthem. I hope we will not find ourselves in this bind again.\n  We have four amendments offered by the junior Senator from Oklahoma. \nI have seen them all. I do not think any of them have received \nappropriate hearings. I do not think any of them have had the study \nthat goes into the bill, that are in this bill before us. For that \nreason and many others, I do not intend to vote for them.\n  I do thank the Senator from Oklahoma, the junior Senator, for finally \narriving at something that will conclude the matter. It will be \nconcluded today, and many Senators will be pleased and many House \nmembers will be pleased, and all I can tell them is: We have tried our \nbest to do this sooner, and we will try our best to do the next one \nsooner rather than later.\n  In the face of all of this, I cannot in good conscience vote to delay \npassage of at least some of the bills that we have worked so hard on in \nthe committee and that are packaged in S. 2739. The amendments the \nSenator has filed under the unanimous agreement are sweeping generic \nchanges to aspects of Federal land management. While aspects of some of \nthem may have merit, they should only be considered through the \ncommittee process where the substance and consequences can be \nilluminated and debated in hearings. I doubt that there is any Senator, \nincluding me, who is 100 percent supportive of every line in these \nbills that compose S. 2739; but, as with everything else we do around \nhere, there had to be give and take on both sides of the aisle to come \nto agreement on many of these measures. And since it has not been my \nexperience that we will ever be able to satisfy the junior Senator from \nOklahoma, I recommend that we proceed to pass this bill without \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and thank Senator Bingaman for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wished to begin this morning by thanking \nChairman Bingaman for his public assurance today that S. 2739, the \nConsolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, will not be the final \npublic lands bill taken up by the Senate this year.\n  I know that is going to be encouraging news to the people of my home \nState who, in particular, want to see our treasured Mount Hood receive \nadditional protection and want to make sure its scenic beauty will be \npreserved for future generations.\n  As the chair of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, I know \nfirsthand how important these public lands bills are to folks in the \nStates where the lands are located. There are several pieces of \nlegislation that involve my home State. The proposals contained in this \nbill have all passed the House, passed the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and I hope they will become law.\n  I especially express my appreciation to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, who has toiled month after month \nafter month on her extraordinarily important wild sky wilderness \nlegislation. She, of course, is joined in that by our colleague Senator \nCantwell. This is going to be something of great pride to all of us in \nthe Pacific Northwest. I congratulate Senator Murray and Senator \nCantwell on their efforts.\n  Today, though, as we deal with S. 2739, we also include in that \nlegislation that I authored, referred to by Chairman Bingaman, the Park \nService authority to enter into cooperative agreements to better \nprotect the parks' natural resources. Chairman Akaka has joined me in \nthis effort, and I commend him for all of his work to protect our \ntreasured national parks.\n  The legislation also includes another bill to study the Columbia \nPacific Natural Heritage Area, something that has been of great \nimportance to local communities. It also includes important legislation \nfor my home State to protect our water resources.\n  It is important to note that our work cannot be considered done with \nthis legislation. There is another public lands package reflecting the \nwork of many Senators in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nwhich also contains a number of important pieces of legislation that \nhave strong bipartisan support. Among those bills are two measures \nvitally important to the people of my home State: the Lewis and Clark \nMount Hood Wilderness Act of 2007 and the Copper Salmon Wilderness Act. \nThat is why it is my view that the Senate should move quickly on \ntoday's legislation, S. 2739, and then, with the bipartisan leadership \nof Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici and colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, go forward with other measures that have been, \nregrettably, stalled for much of this Congress.\n  I have been to the floor before to speak about the Mount Hood \nWilderness Act. This is a thoroughly bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat I and Senator Smith have worked on for many years. It passed \nunanimously out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nRegrettably, it has been held up for many months now. Mount Hood is one \nof the most photographed and visited wild places in the United States. \nThe legislation we have written to protect this icon is the result of \nmany meetings, scores of discussions from a diverse number of \nOregonians. They are anxious to see this legislation moved forward. \nThat is why it is so important that the Senate act after the Senate \npasses S. 2739. Countless Oregonians and other westerners have been \nfrustrated to see all their years' efforts to enact new wilderness \nprotections for Mount Hood, which has passed the Senate Natural \nResources Committee, get stalled here on the floor.\n  As I have noted in the past, the bill to protect scenic areas as \nLewis and Clark first saw them has now taken longer to get through the \nSenate than it took Lewis and Clark to get to Oregon. Our constituents \ndon't understand how a bill that has such strong bipartisan support is \nbeing held up. They don't want to see it held hostage, not for partisan \npolitics or for any other reason. They also feel that Copper Salmon is \na gem that deserves protection.\n  The bipartisan legislation to protect Mount Hood builds on existing \nMount Hood wilderness but adds more wild and scenic rivers and provides \na recreation area to allow diverse recreational opportunities. We would \nprotect the\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\nlower elevation forests surrounding Mount Hood and the Columbia River \ngorge. The protected areas include scenic vistas, almost 126,000 acres \nof wilderness and, in tribute to the great river-dependent journey of \nLewis and Clark, the addition of 79 miles on nine free-flowing \nstretchers of rivers would be added to the National Wild and Scenic \nRiver system. From what Senator Smith and I hear about our legislation \nand the places we have proposed for wilderness protection--and we have \ntalked to local community leaders, to environmentalists, to timber and \nmining interests--we believe we have gotten this legislation right.\n  The bill responds to the thousands of comments I have received on \nboth of my previous efforts to protect Mount Hood, input at public \nmeetings held in Oregon, and letters and phone calls. I have met with \nover 100 community groups and local government leaders, members of our \ncongressional delegation, the Governor and the Bush administration. \nAmong the comments we got was a resounding cry for additional \nwilderness, particularly more recreational opportunities.\n  There are currently 189,200 acres of designated wilderness on the \nMount Hood National Forest. The legislation we are talking about would \nincrease that amount by about 126,000 new acres of wilderness. These \nprotections, protections for such important Oregon places, should not \nbe held up by procedural wrangling. It is one thing if there is any \nsense on a piece of legislation involving wilderness of significant \ninterest groups not being consulted, not being allowed to participate. \nI can see every reason to hold up that kind of legislation. But when \neverybody feels they have been consulted, you have complete bipartisan \nsupport from the State and the Natural Resources Committee, we ought to \nbe in a position to move forward.\n  I am going to repeat today what I have said before: My doors are open \nto every Member of the Senate on this legislation and everything else. \nIf you want to get anything important done, you have to work with \ncolleagues. If there are additional objections to Senator Smith and me \nmoving forward with the Mount Hood legislation, we want anybody who has \nan objection to come to us, because we will meet them halfway in an \neffort to try to address their concerns. But we have to do what \nChairman Bingaman has pledged today, and that is to have an additional \npackage of bills that is so important. I know the distinguished \nchairman from New Mexico has measures that are important to him. He has \nbrought a bill to the floor of the Senate today because he wants to \nhelp all of the communities across this country that have worked to try \nto address these issues. I commend Chairman Bingaman for it. Frankly, I \nrespect his selflessness in this effort. But we have to move on after \nwe act today.\n  I hope this legislation will pass quickly, that it will then be \npossible for the Senate to turn to the next public lands bill, and we \nwill be able to adopt that swiftly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have listened patiently to what has been \nsaid. One of the things that has to be stated, if we want to change the \nrules of the Senate, that is fine, but it is important for the American \npeople to know what a unanimous consent request is. This bill contains \n26 separate pieces of legislation where on over four dozen of them we \nhave had no objection whatsoever, ever. Not one time have we raised any \nobjection. But a unanimous consent request says, No. 1, you agree with \nthe legislation. No. 2, you don't think it should be amended. No. 3, \nyou don't think the Senate ought to vote on it. We have a major \ndifference of opinion about what priorities are and what they should \nbe.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from New Mexico talk about \nfrustration. Who is watching out for the frustration a child born \ntoday, encompassing $400,000 of unfunded liabilities, is going to have \nwhen that bill comes due? Where is the worry about the frustration for \nfuture generations? People say this is noncontroversial. Let me tell \nyou, it is controversial when you are talking about infringing on the \nproperty rights of people without their permission. That is \ncontroversial. We have a difference of opinion on that. We think \nheritage areas and the disclaiming of heritage area has no impact on \nproperty rights.\n  That is absolutely untrue. It does impact. Property rights are a real \nright guaranteed in this country. We are going to set up boards that \nwill influence, with the money we give them, private property use and \nutilization without an equal influence by the private property owners. \nWe do have a difference of opinion.\n  At the end of this fiscal year, September 30, the accrued actual debt \non the books for this country will become $10 trillion. We are going to \nadd $3,000--2,800 and some odd dollars--per man, woman, and child at \nthe end of this year to the debt. People say it is noncontroversial. \nFour dozen of these are noncontroversial. But this idea that we have to \nauthorize, it is either a wink and a nod, or we are totally dishonest \nwith the American people. If we are authorizing it, we intend to spend \nthe money. We wouldn't be authorizing it if we didn't intend to spend \nthe money. My objections are not that we do the right things for \nprotecting our parks or creating the right environments in our forests \nand ensuring that the great treasures of our country are not protected. \nI want to make sure they are available. But to claim, when we have a $9 \nbillion deficit in terms of backlogged work in our parks right now, as \ndocumented by the U.S. Park Service, $9 billion of work that needs to \nget done that we can't get done, to say this isn't going to have any \nimpact on it, it is going to have an impact. It is going to delay the \nmaintenance on the very things we say we treasure. So what have we \ndone? What are we doing?\n  We are having a discussion about a small area that supposedly doesn't \ncost much money. It hasn't been scored, but those things in it that \nhave been scored, it is over $350 million per year, a third of a \nbillion dollars. What are we talking about? This debate is about \nwhether we face up to the priorities in front of us as a nation. It is \nnot about being against parks. It is not about being against the \nprocess. It is about making sure somebody in this body is standing up \nthinking about the future finances of this country and what we are \ngoing to do to our children. This is another example of what I \nbelieve--and I know I am in the minority--is a misplaced priority. How \ndo we justify it, when we own, as the Senator from New Mexico said, 30 \npercent--I thought it was 38.5 percent--of all the land in the country? \nWhen we are not taking care of the land we have, how do we justify \nadding more land? We added 90 million acres to Federal Government \nproperty in the last 8 years. That is 90 million acres that are taken \noff the property rolls of communities and States. We take it away. We \ncontrol it, and then we don't take care of it. But now we are adding \nmore. We are doing it more.\n  Let's talk about some of the issues. This is a noncontroversial bill \nis what we have heard. How about $2 million of our kids' money to \ncelebrate the 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton and the Claremont? At \na time when this year we are going to borrow $600 billion, we are going \nto spend $2 million on a celebration? Why don't we celebrate the fact \nthat we are going to put our kids in debt more? That is what we should \nbe celebrating, if we are so proud of this. How about $2 million to \ncreate a commission to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the voyage of \nthe Champlain. Do we have $2 million to throw away? We are going to \nthrow that away on something that is not important, considering where \nwe are in this Nation and the debt and the heritage we are going to \nleave our children. You bet we have a difference of opinion.\n  The American people want us to start thinking in the long term, not \nthe short term. Do we look good if we have done all these bills back \nhome? You bet. We wink and nod and say: We are doing it. Either we are \ngoing to appropriate the money or we were dishonest with them in the \nfirst place. We are going to spend the money. How do we walk out of \nhere and say: We got you what you wanted? We do not really intend to \nspend the money--unless we really do intend to spend the money, so then \nit really does make a difference, and we cannot maintain what we have.\n\n  There was a very wise historian, his name was Alexander Tytler. This \nis attributed to him. I am not sure it is really his, but the words \nwere spoken. They are not mine, but it is very apropos for where we \nare, not just on this\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nissue; I am not a voice of frustration just on this issue. My \ncolleagues know that. I think it is time for us to start thinking about \nthe long-term in this country and not the short-term politically \nexpedience that says we look good at home.\n  Here is what Tytler said: A democracy cannot exist as a permanent \nform of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that \nthey can vote themselves largess from the public treasury. From that \ntime on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the \nmost benefits--we got you done what you want done at home; whether we \ncan afford it or not does not matter, but we got it done--with the \nresult that a democracy always collapses due to loose fiscal policy, \nalways followed by a dictatorship.\n  That is the history of the world. We are contributing to our own \ndemise as we think short-term political expediency so we can look good \nat home, so we can satisfy demands at home.\n  Will Durant said:\n\n       A great civilization is [never] conquered from without \n     until it has destroyed itself [from] within.\n\n  We have now $79 trillion worth of unfunded liabilities that we are \ngetting ready to lay on our kids and grandkids, and we are not thinking \na thing about probably $1 billion with this bill of new additional \nexpenditures for next year, if it gets appropriated. It is the price of \ndoing business in Washington. We do not have that luxury anymore. We do \nnot have the luxury of mortgaging the future of our children anymore.\n  Why is the dollar at a historic low right now? Is it because we are \nin a slowdown or a recession? Is that it? No. It does not have anything \nto do with it. It has to do with the world confidence in our ability to \nrepay our debt and the debt the rest of the world sees coming to us, \nwhich comes out to, if you were born today, $400,000 over your \nlifetime. Now, how many of us have children or grandchildren who could \nabsorb just the interest on $400,000? A few, but most of us could not \ndo that.\n  So this debate is a philosophical debate. I am not worried about \nbeing a source of frustration in the Senate. I am worried about the \nfuture of our country, and if I create some scrapes and bruises on my \nway to wake us up to what the American people want us to do--which is \nthink long-term, fix the structural problems, and quit pandering back \nto our individual desires in the State--this Congress has become a \nparochial Congress. It is more important to do what is right for your \nState than it is for what is right for the country. How dare us. That \nhas nothing to do with our oath. None of us has our State mentioned in \nthe oath we take when we accept this office.\n  So we are about to pass 62 pieces of legislation, none of which had a \nhearing until after they passed out of the committee--17 hearings post \ncoming out of the committee. As to saying we have to meet this because \nit is bipartisan, it is a bipartisan failure to think about the future \nof this country and what is in the long-term best interests of the \ncountry, as we satisfy looking good at home to ensure our next election \nis put ahead of the next generation of this country.\n  I am not going to participate in that. I am going to continue to work \nto make sure any piece of legislation that comes to this floor is \nthinking about the long-term, not the short-term. If that creates ill \nwill among my colleagues, I apologize in advance. I would much rather \nbe remembered as somebody who was interested in protecting the future \nof our children than playing nice in the Senate. As Phil Gramm said: I \ndidn't come here to make friends, and I haven't been disappointed.\n  The real fact is, what did we all come here for? We all came here \nwith that in mind, to do what is best in the long-term interests of our \ncountry. It is important for us to be reminded when we are not doing \nthat. There can be a difference of opinion about priorities. There \ncannot be a difference of opinion about the amount of trouble we are \nin. There is no difference of opinion in terms of trouble. It does not \nmatter how we got here. The fact is, we are here. We are in trouble.\n  How is it that we put a delegate for an island territory in this bill \nthat has 60,000 residents that we are going to put $5.6 million into \nover the next 3 years? That we are going to create another delegate--\nwhat does that have to do with natural resources and lands? How did \nthat get in here?\n  We have added an intermodal transportation center in Trenton, ME. It \nauthorizes the Federal Government to pay 40 percent of it, no matter \nwhat it costs. There is no limitation that this will be a competitively \nbid contract. No matter what it costs, we are on the hook for 40 \npercent of whatever it costs. And we are on the hook for 85 percent of \nwhat it will cost to run it thereafter. The only problem is, there are \nthree other visitor centers within walking distance of this one. But we \nwanted to do it.\n  I could go on and on and on. The fact is, this debate is not about \nprocess. It may be to you, but it is not to me. This debate, for me, is \nwhether we are going to change our behavior at every point to start \nthinking about the long-term future of this country.\n  I have the greatest respect for Chairman Bingaman. He has been an \nabsolute gentleman to me in every way in every dealing. But we have a \nphilosophical difference. He is charged to move bills out, to get \nthings done. Most of them that have no cost he will readily agree I \nhave had no objection to. He knows that. We have not tried to block \nthose. But they are combined with the other bills because they know \nthat is a force to create the votes, to get things that might be \nsomewhat more controversial spending. That is his job. I understand \nthat.\n  I have no ill will toward anyone. What I have an ill will for--and \nwhen I leave the Senate, what I will take to my grave--is not being \ngood enough to convince us to do what we swore an oath to do, and that \nis to think long-term, think what is best for our country, not what is \nbest for our State; think what is best for our children, not what is \nbest for us; think what is best for our country, not what is best for \nour party; think what is best for America. We are losing. Consequently, \nwe see it happening in our country.\n  So it is time to really clarify what this debate is about. It is \nreally not about a lands bill; it is about the philosophy where we \ncontinue to work and run like a loose barge in the Mississippi River \nthat does not have a tug associated with it. Are we going to do that? \nBecause that is what is happening.\n  One amendment I am going to be offering just says we ought to know \nwhat things cost. How much land do we have and how much does it cost to \nhave it? We are going to have it objected to, not because it is not \ncommon sense but because we are afraid the whole package might not get \naccepted if something common sense is in it like knowing how much our \nland costs us, knowing how much land we have, having an inventory, and \nmaking a judgment, a metric about what we are doing. Nobody is thinking \nthe big picture. We are thinking the political picture. So here is the \namendment. It is not going to go anywhere, most likely, but it \nabsolutely makes common sense that we would do that, that we would know \nall the properties we own.\n  We have another amendment that is going to say that citizens have to \ngive their approval when somebody comes onto their land who does not \nown their land--just basic property rights saying: If somebody is going \nto set up a heritage area, they ought to get permission to come onto \nprivate land, if it is your land and somebody is coming on it. We take \nthat right away in heritage areas. It is gone. They do not have to do \nit. It is a commonsense amendment that says if you own land, you ought \nto have the right that is guaranteed you under the Constitution to have \nyour land protected. It is your land.\n  We have so much unwanted property where all the land agencies want a \nway to get rid of it, but yet they cannot. They cannot. They do not \neven have the money to get rid of it. So there is an amendment that \nsays: Let's take 1 percent of the cost of this bill and allow the \ndifferent agencies to get rid of the excess properties they have. It is \nnot complicated.\n  The other thing is, we are going to offer an amendment requiring that \ncitizens within a national heritage area are informed of the \ndesignation before it happens. If we are going to pass a law that is \ngoing to impact somebody's private property, shouldn't we tell them \nahead of time? Shouldn't they have notice? Shouldn't they have the\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nrights guaranteed to them under the Constitution?\n  I have spoken enough, but I think under the guise of the lands bill I \nhave explained the real problem. There is a difference of philosophy. I \nwill not stop fighting until we start thinking about the long-term \nproblems facing this country.\n  I will not stop objecting to spending money that we know we intend to \nspend. We are just playing the game that: Oh, it is not an \nappropriation. Well, almost 30 percent of the appropriations are not \nauthorized. So you cannot have it both ways. A third of the money we \nappropriate under the appropriations process is not authorized to begin \nwith. So authorizations actually do not mean anything, do they? Or do \nthey? Yes, they do, because they are not going to get appropriated, or \nthey are, and if they are, we ought to be talking about real money that \nis going to be spent.\n  I want to talk for a minute about the backlogs in our parks because I \nthink if the American people knew it, they would not stand for it until \nwe did something. The National Park Service faces, right now, a $9 \nbillion backlog. That is their number. That is not Tom Coburn's number. \nThat is their number, a $9 billion backlog. With this legislation, they \nare going to take on more responsibility with no increased funds, which \nmeans the backlog is going to grow.\n  The Facilities Management Division of the National Park Service \nreveals there are at least 10 States where National Park Service \nmaintenance backlogs exceed $100 million per park--$100 million per \npark. Twenty States have facilities with deferred maintenance exceeding \n$50 million. That does not include road maintenance, which is far \nhigher. None of these numbers include the road maintenance we have not \nsupplied the money for either.\n  They maintain 1,466 buildings built before 1900 but do not have the \nmoney to maintain them. They have 4,975 buildings constructed before \n1950 but do not have the money to maintain them. They have 2,500 fixed \nassets--2,500 fixed assets--they do not want but this committee will \nnot create a way for them to get rid of. They are still spending money \non 2,500 facilities--2,500 different buildings--that they do not want, \nthat they spend money on every year, that they are not using, but they \nhave to keep it up.\n  The National Park Service has 31 sites in California alone. They have \na State backlog, in California parks alone, of $584 million, exclusive \nof any roadwork. California is home to many of our treasures: Yosemite, \nGolden Gate, Sequoia.\n  New York national parks: They face a $347 million backlog--$347 \nmillion--home to Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of \nLiberty has a maintenance backlog of $185 million, work that needs to \nbe done on it. We are not doing it.\n  National parks in Wyoming: a $205 million maintenance backlog. That \nis Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Devils Tower. Yellowstone has a $130 \nmillion backlog. It is one of our great treasured western assets. \nEverybody who visits there has total enjoyment from it, and yet it has \na $130 million backlog which we have not addressed.\n  There are no increased authorizations for maintenance \nbacklogs. Glacier National Park in Montana, a backlog of $400 million; \nWashington, DC, home to our monuments, a $371-million maintenance \nbacklog; New Mexico, $41 million; Arizona, $192 million. The National \nParks Conservation Association said this: The average budget shortfall \namong 100 park units is 32 percent. In other words, we are supplying \ntwo-thirds of what they need to maintain their parks adequately, and \nwith this bill we are going to be adding to all that and other lands \nother things they are going to have to be doing because of this bill, \nbut we are not going to address the real needs.\n\n  Each of the new projects in this bill will siphon funds away one way \nor the other, directly or indirectly, from these important projects. \nAre we good stewards if we add things to be stewards of when we are not \ncaring for the things we have already?\n  There was a wise man who once said: He who is faithful with small \nthings will be faithful with big things. I would surmise and put \nforward to this body that we have not been good stewards with what we \nhave already. Yet we are going to add to them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4522\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4522, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be read and that Mr. McCain be added as a cosponsor of \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4522.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require the Director of the Office of Management and \n  Budget to determine on an annual basis the quantity of land that is \n   owned by the Federal Government and the cost to taxpayers of the \n                         ownership of the land)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                        TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 901 ANNUAL REPORT RELATING TO LAND OWNED BY FEDERAL \n                   GOVERNMENT.\n\n       (a) Annual Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), not later than \n     May 15, 2009, and annually thereafter, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget (referred to in this section \n     as the ``Director'') shall ensure that a report that contains \n     the information described in subsection (b) is posted on a \n     publicly available website.\n       (2) Extension relating to certain segment of report.--With \n     respect to the date on which the first annual report is \n     required to be posted under paragraph (1), if the Director \n     determines that an additional period of time is required to \n     gather the information required under subsection (b)(3)(B), \n     the Director may--\n       (A) as of the date described in paragraph (1), post each \n     segment of information required under paragraphs (1), (2), \n     and (3)(A) of subsection (b); and\n       (B) as of May 15, 2010, post the segment of information \n     required under subsection (b)(3)(B).\n       (b) Required Information.--An annual report described in \n     subsection (a) shall contain, for the period covered by the \n     report--\n       (1) a description of the total quantity of--\n       (A) land located within the jurisdiction of the United \n     States, to be expressed in acres;\n       (B) the land described in subparagraph (A) that is owned by \n     the Federal Government, to be expressed--\n       (i) in acres; and\n       (ii) as a percentage of the quantity described in \n     subparagraph (A); and\n       (C) the land described in subparagraph (B) that is located \n     in each State, to be expressed, with respect to each State--\n       (i) in acres; and\n       (ii) as a percentage of the quantity described in \n     subparagraph (B);\n       (2) a description of the total annual cost to the Federal \n     Government for maintaining all parcels of administrative land \n     and all administrative buildings or structures under the \n     jurisdiction of each Federal agency; and\n       (3) a list and detailed summary of--\n       (A) with respect to each Federal agency--\n       (i) the number of unused or vacant assets;\n       (ii) the replacement value for each unused or vacant asset;\n       (iii) the total operating costs for each unused or vacant \n     asset; and\n       (iv) the length of time that each type of asset described \n     in clause (i) has been unused or vacant, organized in \n     categories comprised of periods of--\n\n       (I) not more than 1 year;\n       (II) not less than 1, but not more than 2, years; and\n       (III) not less than 2 years; and\n\n       (B) the estimated costs to the Federal Government of the \n     maintenance backlog of each Federal agency, to be--\n       (i) organized in categories comprised of buildings and \n     structures; and\n       (ii) expressed as an aggregate cost.\n       (c) Use of Existing Annual Reports.--An annual report \n     required under subsection (a) may be comprised of any annual \n     report relating to the management of Federal real property \n     that is published by a Federal agency.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment. It \nrequires an annual report of the Federal Government detailing the \namount of property the Federal Government owns and the cost of \nGovernment and landownership to taxpayers.\n  This is just a small chart that shows the amount of land the Federal \nGovernment owns. As my colleagues can see, two-thirds of the Western \nUnited States is owned by the Federal Government in one form or \nanother. It recognizes all of the core land, the parkland, the forest \nland, the heritage areas that are not--it doesn't recognize the \nheritage areas that we don't own, but it does recognize all the land \nholdings. Nobody has a metric on what we own. Not any one agency knows \nwhat we own in total, nor does anybody know\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\nwhat it costs us to own it, nor does anybody know what it costs the \ncommunities for us to own it because it has been taken off the tax \nrolls.\n  Each year, the Office of Management and Budget would be required to \nissue a public report detailing Federal landownership. The report would \nspecifically include the total amount of land in the United States and \nthe percentage that is owned by the Federal Government; the percentage \nof all U.S. property that is controlled by the Federal Government--not \nnecessarily owned, but controlled--the total cost of operating and \nmaintaining Federal real property, including land, buildings and \nstructures; a list of all Federal property that is unused and vacant--\nbecause why should we continue to maintain properties that are unused \nand vacant--including all buildings and structures; and the estimated \ncost of the maintenance backlog at each Federal agency with regard to \ntheir land holdings.\n  What this will do is give the taxpayers some transparency about the \nreal nature of what we are doing. We are going down an alley blindly. \nWe don't know what the cost is. We don't know what the total is. We \ncertainly don't know what we are creating when we add more to it when \nwe don't know the metrics on what we have already.\n  One of the things we need is greater accountability on the \nmaintenance. It is strange to me that we can do what we are doing with \nthis bill and not already know this information. Why would we not know \nwhat our total land holdings are and what their costs are? There are no \nrequirements under current law to require public disclosure of the \namount of land controlled by the Federal Government or the cost of such \noccupation to the taxpayers. There was an Executive order issued in \n2004 that would require some of it to become publicly available, but \nwhat this amendment says is it all should be. It is an inventory. Every \nother organization, including the States, know what they own, and they \nknow the cost to manage what they own. It is called management \naccountability. Transparency is the thing that leads to accountability.\n  When the President directly required the Office of Management and \nBudget to release a high-level report giving a picture of property \nownership between 2004 and 2005, the Government decided to stop \nreleasing the information on public domain lands. Wonder why that is. \nWhat happened is 90 percent of the lands aren't reported. So this \namendment would legally require the Government to release information \non all land it owns, how much it costs to maintain, and require the \nGovernment to track the growth of Federal landownership around the \ncountry.\n  This isn't hard to do. Once you have the database, all you do is add \nand subtract. The first year it will be tough. Every year after that it \nwould not be hard at all. It is a computer program.\n  Governments track the property that individuals own. The Government \ntherefore should disclose the same information about the land holdings \nthat it has. The Government knows what land we own. Why shouldn't the \nAmerican people know what land the Government owns? It is just common \nsense. If we want to manage our resources and manage our properties, \nthen we have to know what it is and what it costs, but we don't. We \ndon't use zero-based budgeting. Whatever they spent last year, they \njust ask for more. At the end of the year, if it is not all spent, they \nmake sure they spend it; otherwise, they are liable to get a cut. So we \nare not putting the money in based on what we know the need is; we are \nputting the money in based on a historical record that is obviously \nfailing to maintain our national parks.\n  I will discontinue with any further debate on this amendment and \nyield to the chairman of the committee. I would just say commonsense \nknowledge about what we own and what it costs us is something the \nAmerican taxpayer ought to have, and to vote against this for some \nreason because we can't goes back to the same philosophical argument. \nWe are going to have the short-term excuse for the long-term problem, \nand we are never going to get out of this hole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond on this particular \namendment that the Senator from Oklahoma has presented or called up for \nconsideration.\n  The amendment does require the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to post an annual report on the Internet that details quite \na few different things. First, how much land is ``within the \njurisdiction of the United States;'' second, how much of that land is \nowned by the Federal Government, both in total and on a State-by-State \nbasis; third, a description of how much it costs to maintain all lands, \nbuildings, and structures on an agency-by-agency basis; fourth, \nextensive information on the number of unused and vacant assets and the \nvalue of operating costs for each such vacant asset; fifth, the \nestimated maintenance backlog of each Federal agency, presumably on \nthese various assets.\n  The amendment does not just apply to national parks and national \nforests and reclamation projects and public domain lands which, of \ncourse, our committee would have jurisdiction of, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, but also the national wildlife refuges, \nIndian trust lands, GSA properties, post offices, military bases and \nfacilities, veterans hospitals. And those, of course, are under the \njurisdiction of other committees I do not serve on.\n  To give a sense of the breadth of the amendment, the Office of \nManagement and Budget would have to provide detailed information each \nyear on approximately 1.2 billion real property assets worldwide and \nover 636 million acres of land.\n  There is no provision in the amendment to exempt any sensitive \ninformation that the Department of Defense might wish to withhold or \nthe Department of Energy or the CIA or any other agency that has a \nnational security responsibility.\n  While there is certainly room for improvement in Federal property \nmanagement--and in that regard I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma--\nI do not believe we are ready to act on this amendment at this time or \nadopt this amendment. I believe compliance with the amendment would be \nvery burdensome, time consuming, and expensive, and, of course, it is a \nresponsibility that would have to be updated each year.\n  My own view is, this amendment, if proposed as a freestanding bill, \nwould not be referred to our committee, not the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I believe it would be referred to the Homeland \nSecurity Committee because they have Government-wide responsibility. We \nhave no idea how much cost would be involved to each agency in \ncompiling this information for the Office of Management and Budget. I \nassume it would be a substantial cost, and it is not one that I think \nwe should act upon with this bill without any idea of that cost.\n  So my own preference, frankly, would be that if the Senator wishes to \nhave a report such as this developed, the appropriate way to proceed \nwould be to go to the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, ask for a hearing on this proposal, get that \ncommittee to look seriously at what can be done to develop this kind of \nreport, what cost is involved in developing this kind of report, \nwhether there are needs that national security would require for \nputting some exemptions into this report so that we would not be \nputting on the Internet information that some of our national-security-\nrelated agencies would not want posted on the Internet. That would be \nthe approach I would urge on my colleague.\n  So for all of those reasons, I oppose the amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it when it comes to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will defer to my colleague from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, would my colleague yield for just a moment \nso I may respond?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. COBURN. I want the chairman of the committee to know that we \nworked very closely with OMB as we developed this amendment. This is \nnot a significant cost because they have been gathering this data to a \ncertain extent already. I would gladly take a second-degree amendment \nto offset any sensitive\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\ndata that might be incurred so it would not be made available.\n  There is no question there is some cost to it, but the yearly cost is \nminimal, and OMB has already stated that. The cost of establishing it, \nyes, I agree, it would be hard. But what my colleague has said is we \nreally don't want to manage all of the properties because we don't want \nto know. That is the important thing, that we can't directly manage \nthem unless we do that.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma, with \nwhom I do not agree on many things, but I know he speaks with integrity \nand from the heart.\n  I rise to speak in support of S. 2739, the Consolidated Natural \nResources Act of 2008, which we are working on. I wish to thank my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Chairman Bingaman, and Vice Chairman \nDomenici for their leadership on this legislation. We have waited a \nlong time for it. In the Senate we need to get just about everyone on \nboard. Due to some Senators' steadfastness, including Majority Leader \nReid's, we are here today.\n  All provisions of the legislation are important, but there is one \nprovision for western New York for which we have waited a very long \ntime, and that is the provision that would designate land at thematic \nsites along the entire Niagara River corridor--from Buffalo in the \nsouth to Lake Ontario in the north--as a national heritage area.\n  Establishing this heritage area will allow us to protect the world \nclass natural resources of Niagara Falls while promoting tourism and \neconomic development in the region. For the first 5 years of this \nheritage area, a Federal commission would work to implement a \nmanagement plan to capture the full benefits of the natural, historic, \ncultural, and recreational resources of the entire Niagara Falls \nregion.\n  Known the world over, Niagara Falls, of course, is a geological \nwonder that has drawn visitors for more than 200 years. But the region \nhas so much more than just the profound drama of beautifully cascading \nwaters.\n  The Niagara River corrridor has played an important role in our \nNation's history. Native American culture, early European exploration, \nthe French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the War of 1812, \nthe Underground Railroad, and the development of hydroelectric power \nall have strong connections to the region.\n  Furthermore, the Niagara River corridor abounds with scenic beauty \nthat offers something for recreational enthusiasts of all stripes. With \nnumerous State parks in the area, hikers, fishermen, birders, and \nhunters flock to the region to enjoy its outdoor splendor.\n  Despite these strong assets for tourism, visitors to the U.S. side of \nNiagara Falls have been on the decline for several years. Too much of \nthe New York side of the border is marked by aging infrastructure and \nblighted land. And all too frequently, visitors spend far more time on \nthe Canadian side of the falls, while barely visiting the New York \nside. We must reverse this trend.\n  Let me be clear. The attractions and resources exist for the Niagara \nRiver corridor to become a world class destination. But the attractions \nit offers lack a comprehensive, unifying thread that ties the elements \ntogether in a meaningful way for the visitor.\n  Designating the land a heritage area will help us link the existing \nsites of interest in a coordinated fashion, marking the region \neffectively, and attract more visitors. It will promote collaboration \namong Federal, State, and local resources and help spur investment and \neconomic development in the region.\n  Let me say that this heritage area has been years in the making. When \nI first was elected to the Senate in 1999, people in Niagara Falls said \nwe have to do something. It probably surprises my colleagues that there \nis virtually no Federal involvement at Niagara Falls, one of our \ngreatest scenic wonders. We tried to figure out the way to go. Some \nadvocated it should be a national park, and there were other things. We \nconcluded that the heritage area is the right way to go. It will allow \nFederal help to come to the region, Federal resources and experience, \nwith planning and linking the great wonder of Niagara Falls to other \nhistoric and tourist attraction sites, but at the same time it will \nallow the local region to maintain control.\n  So in 2001, at my request, the NPS reconnaissance team visited the \nregion and recommended a congressionally authorized study be undertaken \nto determine the best development strategies for the area along the \nNiagara River. We asked them to look at the heritage area.\n  In 2005, the National Parks Service completed that study. I thank the \nPark Service, because they certainly relied on local input. There was \ntremendous local input here, so nobody in the Niagara Falls area felt \nanything was being rammed down their throat. What they found--the Park \nService--is strong local support for a heritage area, as well as a very \ngreat need for the resources it would offer. The report wrote:\n\n       In order for Niagara Falls to fulfill its strategic role as \n     a key regional attraction, it is necessary for it to upgrade \n     the visitor experience to match the expectations of 21st \n     century travelers.\n\n  That sums up the challenge we face in Niagara Falls. The study \nconcluded that based on Niagara Falls' natural and cultural resources, \nthe evidence of a thematic framework, the potential for effective \npublic and private partnerships, as well as strong public support, the \nregion met the criteria for designation as a National Heritage Area.\n  Last May, the Subcommittee on National Parks held a hearing on this \nissue, where I testified in support of the bill. After the hearing, we \nworked closely with both the National Park Service and the Energy \nCommittee staff--whom I thank for the good work they do--to iron out \nthe technical corrections to the bill so it could be discharged by the \nfull committee. The heritage area has been studied now for more than 7 \nyears. It has broad public support, and it is time for it to become \nlaw.\n  The $10 million authorized under this act should help Niagara Falls \nrealize a substantial return on that investment. First and foremost, \nany Federal expenditures will be matched by State, local, or private \ncontributions, adding millions more to the investment in the region.\n  Second, it is estimated that implementing the heritage area would \nattract 140,000 new visitors per year, and some estimates project that \nthis would infuse up to $20 million into the local economy annually.\n  With the summer tourist season fast approaching, we are reminded that \nfar too many visitors only view Niagara Falls from the Canadian side of \nthe border. They have missed out on the history, culture, recreation, \nand natural beauty that is found in equal measure on the New York side. \nThis legislation will take great strides in balancing that inequity and \nhelp revitalize an area of our country in need of investment and \neconomic development.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank my colleague for working so \nlong and hard with us to make this legislation today a reality.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Oklahoma has \nthree additional amendments he wants to present. I believe he has 30 \nminutes on his side and I have less than 15 on our side. I will defer \nto him to go ahead, and then I will have a few minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4521\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think we will finish well before 2:15. \nThat is my hope. So if we are looking at votes, I hope they will have \nsome notice about that time. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and bring up my amendment No. 4521, and I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator McCain be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4521.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require approval prior to the assumption of control by the \n                 Federal Government of State property)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\n                        TITLE IX--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 901. REQUIREMENT OF APPROVAL OF CERTAIN CITIZENS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsections (b) and (c), the \n     Department of the Interior, the Department of Energy, and the \n     Forest Service, acting individually or in coordination, shall \n     not assume control of any parcel of land located in a State \n     unless the citizens of each political subdivision of the \n     State in which a portion of the parcel of land is located \n     approve the assumption of control by a referendum.\n       (b) National Emergencies.--The requirement described in \n     subsection (a) shall not apply in the case of a national \n     emergency, as determined by the President.\n       (c) Private Landowners.--The requirement described in \n     subsection (a) shall not apply in the case of a voluntary \n     exchange between a private landowner and the Federal \n     Government of a parcel of land.\n       (d) Duration of Approval.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to a parcel of land described \n     in subsection (a), the approval of the citizens of each \n     political subdivision in which a portion of the parcel of \n     land is located terminates on the date that is 10 years after \n     the date on which the citizens of each political subdivision \n     approve the control of the parcel of land by the Department \n     of the Interior, the Department of Energy, or the Forest \n     Service under that subsection.\n       (2) Renewal of approval.--With respect to a parcel of land \n     described in subsection (a), the Department of the Interior, \n     the Department of Energy, or the Forest Service, as \n     applicable, may renew, by referendum, the approval of the \n     citizens of each political subdivision in which a portion of \n     the parcel of land is located.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the American Farm Bureau and American \nfarmers and ranchers had endorsed all of these amendments at an earlier \ntime. I assume they would again, because it is the same language that \nwas used in the past. Today, the National Taxpayers' Union endorsed \nthese as commonsense freedoms for us.\n  This amendment is pretty straightforward. It says that if the \nGovernment wants to take your land, you ought to be able to say, yes, I \nagree or you ought to be able to say no. What this bill does is it \nauthorizes the Federal Government--they can still acquire new lands, \nbut if it is going to have an impact on your land--not their land but \nyour land--the citizens ought to get a vote on it. It is called real \ntransparency in government and real participatory democracy.\n  A lot of Americans are concerned about the excessive Government \ninfluence over their land. We can say they are not, but they are. \nPeople in my State of Oklahoma, in New Mexico, New York, and every \nother State have great concerns about property rights. This amendment \nis intended to address those concerns. It simply requires the citizens \naffected by Federal Government land grabs, or heritage areas, or others \nwhere we are talking about private lands being impacted, to have a \nvote, to have a say in the matter. It authorizes the Departments of \nAgriculture and Interior to continue to acquire land by purchase or \nexchange. It will not affect that.\n  The amendment would only apply to situations involving Federal \neminent domain, when the Government takes property without the consent \nof the owner, or State and local governments cede private land to the \nFederal Government. The decision to cede property to the Federal \nGovernment may be voluntary by the State and local governments, but \nsuch a decision impacts the whole community. So all residents of an \narea, therefore, should have a voice in the decision to turn over \npublic property that is controlled by bureaucrats in DC.\n  Do you realize that in all of our Western States, any single \nbureaucrat has more control in that State than the Governor of the \nState, where they own the majority of the land? Their implied power is \ngreater than the highest elected official in the State. What they say \ngoes, because it is the Federal Government. So whether it is a park \nranger or forest ranger or manager of a forest or the BLM, what they \nsay has more power than what the chief executive of any of those States \nsays. When we look at this, we are saying if the Federal Government is \ngoing to take something by eminent domain, the people it will impact \nshould get a chance to say yea or nay.\n  This goes back to the concept that we have a real right to own and \nhold property in this country. That is something many countries don't \noffer their citizens. We ought to be about protecting it at every \nlevel.\n  This amendment would involve local residents in Government decisions \nabout their neighborhoods and communities. Sam Adams profoundly \nquestioned, ``What liberty can there be where property is taken away \nwithout consent?'' What liberty is there when your property is taken \naway without consent or impacted without your consent or your zoning \nordinance, because some bureaucracy from Washington funded through a \nheritage area decided what the zoning ordinances are going to be and \nhas millions of dollars to move it, to your detriment, the private \nowner of property. What liberty is there when property rights are taken \naway? This amendment ensures both liberty and consent. It is very \nstraightforward. It doesn't affect Federal transportation projects, \nnational defense, or homeland security.\n  Delegating property decisions is not unusual. Eminent domain has been \nexercised through both legislation and legislative delegation. It is \nusually delegated to another government body. But the power may be \ndelegated to private corporations, as we saw in Connecticut, such as \npublic utilities, railroads, and bridge companies.\n  This amendment will delegate the final decision to the property \nholders who are being impacted--real property rights. If we agree as a \nmajority, it happens; if we disagree, it doesn't.\n  The Supreme Court has approved the widespread use of the power of \neminent domain in conjunction with private companies to facilitate \nurban renewal, for low-cost housing, for deteriorated housing, and the \npromotion of values, as well as economic development. In Berman v. \nParker, a unanimous Court observed:\n\n       The concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive. \n     The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, \n     aesthetic, as well as monetary. It is within the power of the \n     legislature to determine that the community should be \n     beautiful as well as healthy, spacious, as well as clean, \n     well-balanced, as well as carefully patrolled.\n\n  This ever-expanding government power essentially allows Congress and \nunelected bureaucrats for any reason to take private property from \ncitizens with little, if any, recourse. What liberty when property \nrights are not preserved?\n  This amendment is designed to provide some check on the ever-growing \nexpansion on private property rights within this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly in opposition to \nthis amendment and explain my understanding of it. This amendment \nprohibits the three agencies, the Department of Interior, Department of \nEnergy, and the Forest Service, from assuming control--that is the \nphrasing in the amendment--over any parcel of land except through a \nvoluntary exchange, unless the citizens of the political subdivision in \nwhich the parcel is located approve the assumption of control by \nreferendum. Even if the assumption of control by the agency is approved \nby a referendum, that approval terminates at the end of 10 years, \nunless there is another referendum that extends it beyond 10 years.\n  It seems likely to me that the amendment would affect more than just \nthe acquisition of fee title to land. It appears to include the \ninterests in lands, such as rights of way, easements, possibly water \nrights, taking lands into trust for Indian tribes, and perhaps even \nfriendly condemnations for public purposes.\n  As I read the amendment, since the only exception is for voluntary \nexchanges of property, I would think the sale of property--if one of \nthese agencies wants to buy the land and a private landowner wants to \nsell the land to the agency, it would have to be approved by \nreferendum. The amendment would give counties and communities, \npolitical subdivisions, veto authority over any Federal land ownership \nby these three agencies. I think it would frustrate congressional \nefforts to purchase or protect lands to make it virtually impossible to \nprovide for any long-term Federal management or protection, such as is \nattempted in our national parks and monuments, wildlife refuges, \nhistoric sites, and wilderness areas. The amendment would adversely \nimpact much more than land designated for conservation purposes. It \nwould also impact Bureau of Reclamation dams, reservoirs, energy \npipelines, and DOE facilities.\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n  I think the concept of having to do another referendum every 10 \nyears--I don't know how that would work, frankly. I don't know what \nwould happen if you lose. Suppose the Federal Government goes ahead and \nacquires land through whatever means for a reservoir. At the end of the \n10 years, there has to be another referendum on whether the Federal \nGovernment should maintain that land for that reservoir. If the \nreferendum fails, I don't know what we would do with that reservoir at \nthat point. There is not much of a private market for reservoirs. I \ndon't know what action the Government would be expected to take at that \npoint.\n  For a variety of reasons, I do not think this is a workable \namendment, and it is one I urge my colleagues to oppose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to try to move this debate \nforward. I see the Senator from Washington. Does she have debate on a \nspecific amendment or comments on the bill?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Just comments.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are going to try to get through our \ntime agreement. I have two more amendments, if that is agreeable with \nthe Senator from Washington.\n  I will make one comment on what the Senator from New Mexico said. \nWhat I heard him say is there is something wrong with people deciding \nit. The real concept of our country is we get to decide, and we have \nbastardized that by saying the Federal Government knows best.\n  I believe the people out there kind of know how things impact them. I \nthink a plebiscite about what we are doing would be something that \nalmost every American would welcome.\n  Will there be problems with it? You bet. Democracy is messy, but it \nis free. Giving them the right to have that answer and to vote, that is \nsomething that was guaranteed in the Constitution before we had an \nactivist court that took it away. This is about putting it back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4520\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and \namendment No. 4520 be called up, and I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator McCain be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4520.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that all individuals who reside, or own property \n that is located, in a proposed National Heritage Area are informed of \n             the designation of the National Heritage Area)\n\n       On page 203, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\nSubtitle G--Notification and Consent Requirements Relating to National \n                             Heritage Areas\n\n     SEC. 491 NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior shall not approve a \n     management plan for a National Heritage Area designated by \n     this title unless the local coordinating entity of the \n     proposed National Heritage Area provides written notification \n     through the United States mail of the designation to each \n     individual who resides, or owns property that is located, in \n     the proposed National Heritage Area.\n\n     SEC. 492. WRITTEN CONSENT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       With respect to each National Heritage Area designated by \n     this title, no employee of the National Park Service or \n     member of the local coordinating entity of the National \n     Heritage Area (including any designee of the National Park \n     Service or the local coordinating entity) may enter a parcel \n     of private property located in the proposed National Heritage \n     Area without the written consent of the owner of the parcel \n     of property.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is another straightforward, what I \nbelieve most Americans would agree with, commonsense amendment. It says \ncitizens within a national heritage area are informed of the \ndesignation and that governing officials must receive permission to \nenter private property. It is simple.\n  If I am in a heritage area, what happens often now is those who are \nempowered by the heritage area stake and survey your land, do all these \nthings without your permission to enter your land--your land, not their \nland, your land. What we do is we broadly give the ability to violate \nproperty rights through the heritage area laws so people can access \nprivate property without permission. If I am wrong about that, then \nthis amendment would cause absolutely no harm. But the fact is, I am \nright about it.\n  This amendment reestablishes the right of private property owners to \ncontrol who goes on their land, when they go on their land, and what \nthey are doing with their land. It reaffirms that if you have \nownership, it is your land, and it does not take that right of a \nproperty owner away because it happens to be in a heritage area.\n  More and more heritage area designations are being made with little \nknowledge of the landowners involved. S. 2739 establishes three new \nheritage areas and extends the authorization and funding of several \nexisting national heritage areas.\n  There is no requirement for the Federal Government to notify the \nindividual within the area of its designation or its meaning. If we are \ngoing to have national heritage areas--and I agree at points they are \ngreat--do we not have an obligation to tell the landowner their land is \ngetting ready to be subjected to all the parameters associated with a \nnational heritage area? Do we not have the right and the obligation to \nensure their property rights are protected as they are brought into a \nnational heritage area?\n  I believe the Constitution says we ought to do this, we ought to \nrestore what was already there. What is liberty without the rights of \nproperty?\n  I yield back the remainder of my time on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak in opposition to this \namendment as well.\n  This amendment would establish new restrictions for the three \nnational heritage areas that are designated in this bill. It would \nprohibit the Secretary of the Interior from approving a management plan \nfor a heritage area unless the local coordinating entity, which is \nusually a nonprofit group that is promoting tourism in this heritage \narea and developing the management plan, has provided written \nnotification to each individual residing or owning property there.\n  The amendment also prohibits employees of the National Park Service \nor the local coordinating entity, usually the nonprofit group, from \nentering any private property within the heritage area without the \nwritten consent of the property owner.\n  The amendment, in my view, fails to understand what the designation \nof a heritage area means. Let me read some boilerplate language we put \nin every one of these national heritage area bills. It says in the \nbill, and we have this three times in this legislation because there \nare three heritage areas: Nothing in the subtitle abridges the rights \nof any property owner, including the right to refrain from \nparticipating in any plan, project, program or activity conducted \nwithin the heritage area. Nothing in the subtitle requires any property \nowner to permit public access to the land. Nothing in the title alters \nany duly adopted land use regulation. Nothing in the title authorizes \nor implies the reservation or appropriation of any water or water \nrights. Nothing in the title creates any liability, affects any \nliability under any other law of any private property owner with \nrespect to any person injured on private property.\n  There is substantial confusion, I believe, about the idea that there \nis some great decrement of private property rights by the designation \nof these heritage areas.\n  The prohibition against employees of the National Park Service or \ncoordinating entity from being able to enter private property without \nwritten permission of the landowner does not make sense, in my opinion. \nHeritage areas do not involve acquisition of Federal land. The \namendment applies to any private land within large areas of the State. \nWe have one in northern New Mexico which I was urged to try to \nestablish--and we were able to establish it--by people who wanted to\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\npromote tourism in northern New Mexico.\n  Under this language, a member of the Park Service or the coordinating \nentity would not be able to go to a mall or a restaurant or go to any \nother private property in northern New Mexico in a three-county area \nwithout written consent of the landowner.\n  In my view, the amendment should be defeated, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it when the time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, in response, I wish to take a moment and \nread what three experts say about what the Senator from New Mexico \nsaid.\n  James Burling, principal property rights attorney for the Pacific \nLegal Foundation:\n\n       The so-called protections for private property are largely \n     symbolic; so long as regulators can browbeat landowners into \n     becoming ``willing sellers'' we will continue to see the \n     erosion of fee simple property ownership in rural America. \n     With the influx of federal funding, the regulatory pressure \n     on landowners to sell will, in many cases, be insurmountable. \n     The legacy we will leave to future generations will not be \n     the preservation of our history, but the preservation of a \n     facade masquerading as our history subverted by the erosion \n     of the rights that animated our history for the first two \n     centuries of the Republic.\n\n  Joe Waldo, president of the Virginia property rights law firm Waldo \nand Lyle, said this:\n\n       The bill before Congress has nothing to do with a \n     ``heritage trail'' but will result in a ``trail of tears'' \n     for those least able to stand up for their property rights. \n     This is no more than an effort to overreach by the federal \n     Government with regulations that will restrict homeowners, \n     farmers and small business people in the use of their \n     property.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, because of time limitations, to have printed \nin the Record the rest of these comments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nReal Private Property Protections in the Bill? What Do the Experts Say?\n\n       (1) James Burling, principal property rights attorney for \n     the Pacific Legal Foundation, had this to say about H.R. 5195 \n     (similar ``protections'' in 109th Congress)\n       ``The so-called protections for private property are \n     largely symbolic; so long as regulators can browbeat \n     landowners into becoming `willing sellers' we will continue \n     to see the erosion of fee simple property ownership in rural \n     America. With the influx of federal funding, the regulatory \n     pressure on landowners to sell will, in many cases, be \n     insurmountable. The legacy we will leave to future \n     generations will not be the preservation of our history, but \n     of the preservation of a facade masquerading as our history \n     subverted by the erosion of the rights that animated our \n     history for the first two centuries of the Republic.''\n       (2) Joe Waldo, president of the Virginia property rights \n     law firm Waldo and Lyle, said this regarding H.R. 5195:\n       ``The bill before Congress has nothing to do with a \n     `heritage trail' but will result in a `trail of tears' for \n     those least able to stand up for their property rights. This \n     is no more than an effort to over reach by the federal \n     Government with regulations that will restrict homeowners, \n     farmers and small business people in the use of their \n     property.\n       ``Traditionally the elderly, minorities and the poor are \n     most impacted by regulatory measures that restrict property \n     owners in the use of their land. Protecting our heritage is a \n     noble ambition, however these matters need to be handled at \n     the local level by those closest to the issues at hand. It is \n     important that the fundamental right of private property not \n     be threatened by more misguided federal legislation.''\n       (3) R.J. Smith, recognized property rights expert and \n     senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy \n     Research, said:\n       ``The name itself for this National Heritage Area raises \n     serious questions. It seems improper, even indecent, to name \n     this the Hallowed Ground corridor and claim it is to \n     `appreciate, respect and experience this cultural landscape \n     that makes it uniquely American' when it tramples on the very \n     principles of private property rights, individual liberty and \n     limited government that the Founding Fathers risked and gave \n     their lives for. Lincoln himself reminded us in the \n     Gettysburg Address that `we cannot dedicate--we cannot \n     consecrate--we cannot hallow this ground.' He reminded us \n     that we must be dedicated to see that this `new nation' \n     `conceived in liberty' had `a new birth of freedom' and did \n     `not perish from the Earth.' Rejecting the very principles of \n     the Founding Fathers that created our liberty and freedom is \n     not a journey any free person should want to undertake.\n       ``Any legitimate effort to attract tourism to old homes and \n     mansions and to quaint little country main streets should \n     properly be done privately and voluntarily by chambers of \n     commerce, booster groups, and preservationist organizations. \n     Not by the compulsory diktat of the National Park Service, \n     the U.S. Congress, and anti-growth Greens. If you want to \n     attract visitors try billboards, not federal force.''\n       (4) And as Dr. Roger Pilon, director of the Cato \n     Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, notes:\n       ``There's nothing wrong with historic preservation--in \n     fact, it's commendable--but it's got to be done the right \n     way. However worthy your ends, when you prohibit people from \n     using their property as they would otherwise have a perfect \n     right to do, you've got to pay them for their losses. Indeed, \n     it is not a little ironic to simply take those historic \n     rights in the name of historic preservation.''\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, here is what I would say in response to \nthe chairman's comment. It is not unreasonable to have somebody who \ndoes not own your land, has no real business on your land, ask \npermission to come on your land. That is an absolute subrogation of the \nrights guaranteed under the Constitution which we are now embracing and \nsay it is fine to not have to get permission. That is not what comes \nwith property rights under the Constitution. If our defense is we do \nnot believe in the Constitution and the rights of private property \nrights, then I would say we are misguided in what we are doing.\n  This is a simple way of saying, if we are going to have heritage \nareas and if I am a private property owner in a heritage area and you \nwant to come on my property and survey, you ought to have to get my \npermission. You should not be able to come on my land without \npermission to do so.\n  The fact is, example after example--and I will submit additionally an \narticle from the Nation magazine on examples of exactly what happens in \nheritage areas to private property rights. It is called ``An Ugly \nHeritage.'' I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this \narticle.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Nation, Jan. 28, 2008]\n\n  An Ugly Heritage--The Poor Man's National Park; The Citizen's Burden\n\n                          (By John J. Miller)\n\n       A few years ago, Lee Ott was driving around his vegetable \n     farm in Yuma, Ariz., when he spotted a crew of surveyors \n     putting stakes in his land. ``I stopped and asked them what \n     was going on,'' he recalls. It turned out they were marking \n     the boundaries of the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. \n     Ott's farm fell entirely within its 22 square miles, and \n     nobody had bothered to tell him. ``I became worried because I \n     wanted to build a new house and a shop on the farm,'' he \n     says. ``I didn't need anybody to give me a bunch of rules \n     about how they should look or whether I could even build \n     them.''\n       So he decided to fight back. He met with the Yuma County \n     Farm Bureau, which then contacted all of the landowners \n     within the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. ``About 600 \n     people came to our meeting,'' says Harold Maxwell, a farm-\n     equipment distributor. ``When I asked for a show of hands \n     from those who knew they were in the NHA, only one hand went \n     up.''\n       National Heritage Areas are like a poor man's National \n     Park--they aren't actually owned by the federal government, \n     but they're zoned by it. Instead of employing Park Rangers in \n     stiff-brimmed hats, they're often administered by liberal \n     groups that want to weaken the property rights of the people \n     who hold a piece of land within or even near NHA boundaries. \n     This is generally done in the name of historic preservation \n     and environmental conservation. The Yuma Crossing National \n     Heritage Area, for instance, includes an old territorial \n     prison and some wetlands along the Colorado River. Yet NHAs \n     are perhaps best regarded as a clever combination of pork-\n     barrel spending and land-use regulations--and they're an \n     increasingly popular tool for slow-growth activists who \n     bristle at the thought of economic development that they \n     don't personally control.\n       Since the first NHA was created in 1984 to preserve a 61-\n     mile canal that runs between Lake Michigan and the Illinois \n     River, more than three dozen have come into existence. Today, \n     they're a growth industry: Ten were added in 2006 alone, and \n     last fall, the House of Representatives passed a $135 million \n     bill that swould set up six more. Some, such as the one in \n     Yuma, are just dots on the map. Others are sprawling. The \n     Tennessee Civil War National Heritage Area takes up the \n     entire state.\n       ``These are basically federal zoning laws,'' says Peyton \n     Knight of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a \n     free-market think tank that has tried to draw attention to \n     the problem. The rules governing NHAs vary from place to \n     place, but they tend to have a few features in common. One \n     important element is the involvement of a ``management \n     entity'' that works in conjunction with the Park Service to \n     come up with a plan--in the case of one NHA, this means \n     creating an ``inventory'' of properties of ``national \n     historic significance'' that it wants ``preserved,'' \n     ``managed,'' or ``acquired.''\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\n       Sometimes the ambitions of an NHA amount merely to a bit of \n     parkland pump-priming. The website of the Rivers of Steel NHA \n     near Pittsburgh boasts that it ``is spearheading a drive'' to \n     have the National Park Service absorb an old steel mill and \n     mentions a bill in Congress. So it's a federally funded \n     organization that lobbies Washington for ever more subsidies.\n       But does the National Park Service really need more parks? \n     It already operates almost 400 sites. Although some remain \n     incredibly popular, visits within the system have declined in \n     the last decade--a trend that started before the terrorist \n     attacks of 9/11 resulted in fewer foreign visitors. What's \n     more, the Department of the Interior is having trouble \n     maintaining the properties it already runs. Its maintenance \n     backlog is a multibillion-dollar wish list of unfunded \n     repairs and improvements. The National Parks Conservation \n     Association, a non-profit group, says that the parks need an \n     extra $800 million per year just to fund their existing \n     operations adequately. This certainly isn't the result of a \n     Scrooge-like Bush administration: The Park Service is \n     spending more money per visitor, per acre, and per employee \n     than ever before.\n       Supporters of NHAs insist that they aren't in the business \n     of buying or regulating property, which is true in the sense \n     that NHAs do neither of these things directly. But they work \n     to achieve these results indirectly, by encouraging local \n     governments to implement restrictive land-use plans. ``That's \n     how they achieve their goals--by pushing counties and towns \n     to do what they can't do for themselves,'' says Cheryl \n     Chumley, a Virginia writer who has tracked NHAs.\n       They do this by dangling the prospect of federal largesse \n     in front of potential recipients. West Virginia's Wheeling \n     NHA, which is basically a downtown preservation project, \n     makes this explicit, according to a Heritage Foundation \n     report by Chumley and Ron Ott. Its management plan calls for \n     new zoning ordinances and the acquisition of private \n     property. And how will it achieve these goals? As Chumley and \n     Ott write, ``Major funding to support the activities . . . \n     and the recommendations of this plan will be coming from the \n     National Park Service.'' In the year prior to its most recent \n     available tax filing, the Wheeling NHA received more than \n     $2.5 million in government contributions--and not a dime from \n     private sources.\n       One of the most controversial NHAs is the proposed Journey \n     Through Hallowed Ground, which would encompass a corridor \n     roughly 175 miles in length between Charlottesville, Va., and \n     Gettysburg, Pa. The exact boundaries aren't determined \n     because this NHA at least technically remains on the drawing \n     board. But that didn't stop Congress in 2005 from giving a $1 \n     million earmark to the Journey Through Hallowed Ground \n     Partnership, a non-profit group that's pushing for the NHA. \n     The organization's board is full of slow-growthers, including \n     Peter Brink, the senior vice president of the National Trust \n     for Historic Preservation. ``If this NHA becomes a reality, \n     it would essentially deputize the National Trust and its \n     allies to oversee land-use policy in the whole region,'' says \n     Knight.\n       Once upon a time, historic-preservation groups operated \n     public-education programs and tried to save old homes and \n     hotels, often by purchasing them. Nowadays, however, they're \n     much more interested in regulating land that they don't own. \n     In Oregon and Washington state, where property-rights \n     advocates have put forth ballot initiatives to compensate \n     landowners when government regulations lower the value of \n     their property, the National Trust has campaigned to defeat \n     them. It even worked to derail a transportation project in \n     Virginia because a proposed road expansion would have \n     increased traffic near the Chancellorsville battlefield--not \n     in it, just near it. Three years ago, Emily Wadhams of the \n     National Trust testified to Congress that ``private-property \n     rights have never been allowed to take precedence over our \n     shared national values and the preservation of our country's \n     heritage.''\n       Last October, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground \n     Partnership issued a report on how it would pursue its \n     objectives in an NHA: ``Farmland, in particular, is a \n     threatened resource. . . . There are many opportunities to \n     further protect these resources through conservation \n     easements, Rural Historic District designations, Agricultural \n     and Forestal districts, and private and public easement and \n     land acquisition.'' Except for easements, in which landowners \n     sell certain rights to their land, each of these suggestions \n     would amount to having government agencies tell property \n     holders what they can do--or, more likely, what they can't \n     do. In September, more than 110 groups, including the \n     American Conservative Union, the Family Research Council, and \n     Freedom Works, signed a letter urging Congress to reject new \n     NHAs.\n       Backers of Journey Through Hallowed Ground, including \n     Republican congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, cite a poll to \n     claim that the public is behind them. What they don't reveal \n     is something that the Fauquier Times-Democrat, a local \n     newspaper, uncovered: The poll was sponsored by a group that \n     endorses, the NHA, and 96 percent of the people in the survey \n     didn't even know what the NHA is.\n       That's what happened in Yuma, Ariz.: Congress created the \n     Yuma Crossing NHA, and hardly any of the locals knew about it \n     until Lee Ott saw the surveyors on his property. The good \n     news is that, Yuma's farmers fought back--they'asked members \n     of Arizona's congressional delegation to intervene, and \n     eventually the NHA was downsized dramatically. Today, it \n     covers only, four square miles. Threats loom elsewhere, \n     however, and an exhibit on the Yuma County Farm Bureau's \n     experience will be featured at this year's American Farm \n     Federation Bureau convention.\n       Although Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, is run \n     by a private group rather than the federal government, \n     supporters of the Journey Through Hallowed Ground like to \n     mention that the boundaries of their NHA would include it. \n     They would do well to read Jefferson's words, and in \n     particular a line that their foes enjoy quoting: ``The true \n     foundation of republican government is the equal right of \n     every citizen in his person and property and in their \n     management.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before we leave this amendment, I wish \nto make one more point. I read the language that is in the bill in each \nof these heritage area provisions that says there is nothing that \nprohibits or restricts the right of the landowner to deny access to his \nor her private property. That is the case under State property law in \nevery State in the Union.\n  If I own a piece of property, if I am a private landowner and I don't \nwant people coming on the land, I have the right to deny them access on \nmy land. That includes Federal officials, surveyors, anybody I want to \ndeny the right to come on my land. There is nothing in our legislation \nthat in any way changes that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4519\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 4519 be the pending business. \nI also ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 4519.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the transfer of certain funds to be used by the \nDirector of the National Park Service to dispose of assets described in \n   the candidate asset disposition list of the National Park Service)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                 TITLE IX--DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN FUNDS\n\n     SEC. 901 CANDIDATE ASSET DISPOSITION LIST.\n\n       For fiscal year 2008, and each fiscal year thereafter, \n     amounts made available to be used by the Director of the \n     National Park Service to dispose of assets described in the \n     candidate asset disposition list of the National Park Service \n     shall be equal to 1 percent of, and derived by transfer from, \n     all amounts made available to the Secretary of the Interior \n     carry out this Act for each such fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will try to do this fairly quickly \nbecause I know we are under a time constraint. Amendment No. 4519 \nrequires 1 percent of the----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To inquire, I heard the Senator ask who be made a \ncosponsor?\n  Mr. COBURN. Senator McCain.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator have an opportunity to discuss this \nwith Senator McCain?\n  Mr. COBURN. Senator McCain contacted me and asked me, requested to be \na cosponsor of my amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of all these amendments.\n  Mr. COBURN. All four of these amendments, yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I see. I will speak to that in my turn. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment requires 1 percent of the \nnew spending authorized in this bill to be used to dispose of excess, \nunused, and unneeded Federal property to offset some of the cost of the \nbill.\n  What we know is we have a tremendous backlog in our parks. We have a \ntremendous backlog in almost every land ownership we have. We have \ntremendous maintenance needs in the Forest Service and tremendous \nmaintenance needs in BLM. We are suffering to care for what we have.\n  All this amendment says is take 1 percent--they listed 6,500 \ndifferent\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\nitems they want to get rid of--and use the money to help them get rid \nof them so they do not continue to spend money maintaining what they \ndon't want and don't need. At a minimum, this bill authorizes $380 \nmillion of new spending, which only represents a fraction when we \nactually see what will happen. We will track this. My staff will track \nthe actual spending that comes out of this bill in terms of \nappropriations so we will have it for historical reference. My \namendment says to take 1 percent for use to get rid of these items and \nthen take them away. When we have gotten rid of the excess items, we \nwould not use the money to do that and that money will go to maintain \nthe public parks we all value so much. It will help offset the hundreds \nof millions of dollars of new spending in the 2,000 property assets \nthat in the Park Service alone have been slated for disposal but cannot \nbe sold off solely due to the lack of funding to get rid of them.\n\n  So all this does is it directs some authorization and says: Park \nService, take these 2,000 things, here is some money, get rid of them--\nthe things you want to get rid of. And everybody agrees we should get \nrid of them. They haven't because they don't have the money because \nthey have to go through all these various steps under the Federal \nGovernment's property rights legislation. But we say to them: Here is \nthe money, so you don't continue to spend money on that, and instead \nyou continue to spend money against this $9 billion backlog in our \nnational parks.\n  What this does is it allows them to get rid of assets they no longer \nneed. This gives them a way and the funds to do that. It allows them to \ntruly dispose of what they want to dispose of.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak briefly on this amendment \nand in opposition to this amendment as well.\n  The amendment provides 1 percent of all amounts made available to the \nSecretary of the Interior to carry out the various provisions of the \nlegislation--that is to the 60-some odd bills that are included here--\nbeginning in 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, be made available to \nthe Director of the Park Service to dispose of assets described in the \ncandidate asset disposition list. This is a list of structures the Park \nService intends to demolish or to dispose of.\n  I think the description the Senator from Oklahoma made contemplated \nthe sale of property. The truth is this is a list the Park Service \nkeeps of buildings they no longer want to maintain. They wish to \ndispose of these, in the sense of destroying them, or tearing them \ndown.\n  The amendment is essentially a tax on future appropriations for all \nof the programs in this package to pay for a specific asset disposal \nprogram of one agency within the Department of the Interior. Many of \nthe programs authorized in this legislation have nothing to do with the \nNational Park Service. It makes no sense, in my view, to reduce amounts \nappropriated for various unrelated programs and to other agencies, \nespecially when the Park Service has never identified funding of its \nasset disposal program as a problem.\n  Each year we get a budget from the Department of Interior. They have \nnever requested specific funds for this purpose. Instead, they use \ntheir regular construction funding to destroy property, to destroy \nthese buildings when they determine that is a priority for them.\n  The amendment, of course, in my view also impinges upon the \njurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. I am not on the \ncommittee, my colleague Senator Domenici is, but we are essentially \nsaying here that all future appropriations that relate to bills that \nare part of this legislation shall be taxed by 1 percent for this other \npurpose. That seems to me an unusual way for the Congress to begin \nundermining, through an authorizing bill, the appropriations that \notherwise should be made by the Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask my colleague from New Mexico, how much time \ndo you have left?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 2 minutes is remaining?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For both of us?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I gather that is in our total hour?\n  I am glad to yield that to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleague.\n  Senator, were you going to get some time on an amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to speak on the \nbill. If I could--I understand we may be delaying the votes because of \nother reasons. If I could get 12 minutes to speak, after Senator \nDomenici, on the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I want to say to the Senator from \nOklahoma that I have nothing but respect for him, and we have talked \nabout the profession he practiced before he was a Senator, saving lives \nand being a doctor. But I do want to say that I wholeheartedly disagree \nwith his approach to these bills and to what the Senator is doing in \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in producing these bills \nfor a vote. I think the Senator is wrong. I hope the Senate understands \nwhat he is doing, and I think if they do, they could each say to him: \nWe appreciate what you are trying to do, but it is the wrong way to do \nit. It won't work.\n  Now, if you talk to Senators about what is going on in the Senate, I \nthink most of them will tell you today that the Senate is borderline \ndysfunctional. We can't get things done. There are too many nuances \nthat have been imposed upon us that we didn't know when we were putting \nthem on that they were going to run us in all different directions, but \nwe are there. So we can hardly get things done. It is kind of a \ndysfunctional body.\n  Along comes a bright Senator, and here is a package of bills, and so \nhe looks at them and says: Oh my, this is a way to show I am going to \nsave money. Well, Senator, you have the wrong package of bills. You \nhave got the wrong package of bills. There will be plenty of \nopportunity for you to save the taxpayers money. Every appropriations \nbill or facsimile thereof--supplemental--put them together, 10 in 1 or \none at a time, but plenty of opportunity for you to save money by \nattacking pieces of the appropriations bills. That is how you save \nmoney.\n  And for all those who are watching the good Senator from Oklahoma, \nall they have to do is say: Senator, we think you are on the right \ntrack, go after the appropriations bills. I am not asking you to, \nbecause I am an appropriator, but I am telling you if you want to save \nmoney for the taxpayers, that is what you should do, and there is \nplenty of opportunity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had intended to ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes. \nDid I not get it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Secondly, Senator, if you want to save the taxpayers money, then go \nafter the place where the money is that is about to break your country, \nand that is the entitlements for Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. If you want to save your taxpayers from ruination, then get \ninvolved in reforming those programs so they do not make us go broke. \nAnybody who knows about your government will tell you, dear Senator, if \nthat is what you want to do, Domenici is right, go after \nappropriations; that is where money is spent. Go after entitlements; \nthat is where money is spent that is going to break your country.\n  And to prove to you that this bill does not spend money, all I can do \nis do it the way the Senate does it and ask the Congressional Budget \nOffice: How much do these bills cost the taxpayers? Senator Bingaman, \nyou asked that, and I don't know whether you already said it, but I am \ngoing to repeat it. This is Senator Bingaman's letter. He asked the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Now, we have to have institutions that take care of things, don't we? \nThe Congressional Budget Office, not the Senator from Oklahoma, is \ncharged with evaluating a bill and telling us about it. You know what \nthey told us about this bill? Not only does it not\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\ncost money, it makes money. This bill will bring into the Treasury in \nthe next 4 years $48 million, because we have authorized the \ndisposition of a couple of boats that were under lease. We said: Okay, \ngo ahead and buy them, and they gave us the money.\n  So contrary to all the debate about costing money, and the taxpayers \ngoing broke, the bill makes money. Now, you can say: Oh no, it doesn't, \nI have another way of figuring it out. That is what the Senator says. \nBut we can't have another way to do everything around here, another way \nto figure out what bills cost. We already have enough ways to figure \nthem out, and they have got us so confused with what we have that we \ndon't need any more. But if the Senator thinks he has a new one, and \nthat is to delay this bill and take a piece of it and talk about it and \nsay it is a bad piece that doesn't make sense, that is fine. But don't \nsay you have a new way to protect the great public of America from \noverspending and that is to take after a lands bill full of \nauthorization that nobody heretofore has thought of taking on for \nappropriations purposes, because it doesn't appropriate.\n  The good Senator is phenomenal. He is a phenomenon. But he isn't so \ngreat that of all the time in history we have had to look at these land \nbills nobody has said: We are going to follow each one and see how much \nit costs. That is one of his amendments, to follow its cost into \ngovernment. You know what that means? It means there is a whole new set \nof books we have to set up. His approach will cost more money and wreak \nmore havoc if we have to do that--find out how much they cost, even if \nhe does them himself, as he suggested. He is going to see how much \nthese authorizations cost, if anything, as they reach fruition--if they \ndo.\n  Now, having said that, each and every one of the amendments offered \nby the Senator is very erudite. They lend themselves to discussion and \ndebate. But every one of them, Mr. President and fellow Senators, every \none of the amendments is so complicated, so full of contortions and \nturning the government this way and that way, that they ought to at \nleast have a hearing. They haven't had a hearing. They shouldn't be \nadopted on this bill, where we have carefully had hearings on the bill, \nhad votes on the bill, with 23 Senators participating before we put \nthem in this package.\n  We should not put these four new ones on, one of which has to do with \nlocal government approving the acquisition of property by the Federal \nGovernment for parks. Before you can sell your property to the \ngovernment, local government has to take a vote, and then 10 years \nlater they have to take another vote to see if they were right. Do you \nunderstand, in the argument for simplicity of government, for making \nsure everybody can have their way, we have made government more complex \nby these amendments than anybody could ever imagine?\n  I, for one, say my hat is off to the Senator. I hope he finds a new \napproach, something new to attack to save money, but not a group of \nlands bills that are authorization bills only, that we have been told \nby the Congressional Budget Office will cost nothing in the way we \nhandle bills here.\n  Now, if you want to change the way and have a new way to figure out \nhow much bills cost, then we will have to have a long debate on which \nway we are going to do that.\n  I thank the Senate for listening, and I thank the Senate for yielding \nme some time, and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for letting me \nspeak as long as I have.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment \nNo. 4519 offered by my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma.\n  This amendment mandates a 1 percent across-the-board redirection of \nfunds each year from all amounts appropriated to programs in this bill \nfor the sole and specific purpose of removing assets--mostly old \nbuildings and facilities--from Park Service operated lands that are \ndetermined to be surplus to need.\n  This 1 percent ``off the top'' charge has the effect of setting the \ndisposal of National Park Service surplus assets above all other \nprograms that are in this bill. In essence, it ties the hands of the \nappropriations committee to determine what amounts should be devoted to \nthe disposal of Park Service surplus facilities each year.\n  Also, there is no connection between the wide variety of programs and \nprojects that are in this public lands bill, and would be assessed this \n1 percent charge, and the need to remove old buildings from parks. Put \nsimply, this amendment does not make good sense.\n  As the ranking member of the Interior Appropriations subcommittee \nthat provides the funding for the Park Service, I simply can't support \nsuch a proposal. It is up to the Appropriations Committee to review the \nagency's budget each year and set the appropriate funding levels for \nthe various activities of the Service, including the disposal of \nsurplus facilities.\n  Budget priorities change each year based on many factors, including \nthe shifting needs of the agencies and the amount of money we have to \nwork with under the budgetary caps set by Congress. That is why we have \nan annual appropriations process to weigh these variables.\n  To transfer 1 percent of funds appropriated under this act for one \npurpose forevermore takes away the Appropriation Committee's \ndiscretion, and indeed, its obligation to set priorities each year for \nthe needs of our Nation's parks.\n  Last year, the Interior subcommittee provided the National Park \nService nearly $1 billion to address maintenance and construction \nneeds. I believe these funds are sufficient to allow the Park Service \nto address the most critical maintenance requirements including the \nremoval of unneeded assets.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources committee and oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will speak a minute or two, and then I \nwill yield the Senator from Washington 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will speak after.\n  Mr. COBURN. We actually have a time agreement on the vote, so I am \nhappy to yield the Senator some of my time, is what I am trying do, so \nI end up finishing. Is there a certain amount of time you need?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I was going to ask unanimous consent to \nspeak after all of the votes. I wanted to speak for about 12 minutes, \nand the other Senator from Washington, Senator Cantwell, wanted to \nspeak for 3 or 4 minutes. I know everyone wants to get to the vote, so \nI will use my time after the vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of all of the \nvotes on this package, on final passage, I be recognized to speak for \n12 minutes, and the other Senator from Washington, Senator Cantwell, be \nallowed to speak for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated January \n31, 2008.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2008.\n     Hon. Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This letter responds to your request for \n     information on the estimated discretionary costs of S. 2483, \n     the National Forests, Parks, Public Land, and Reclamation \n     Projects Authorization Act of 2007, as introduced on December \n     13, 2007. Because the bill was not reported from committee \n     (the point at which we typically prepare estimates), CBO has \n     not prepared a complete cost estimate for S. 2483; we \n     transmitted a table showing the direct spending and revenue \n     effects of the bill to the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources on January 24, 2008.\n       Although we have not completed our analysis of S. 2483, we \n     have previously completed cost estimates for bills (mostly in \n     the House) that authorize projects similar or identical to \n     nearly all of those authorized by S. 2483. The estimated \n     discretionary costs contained in those previous estimates \n     totaled nearly $320 million over five years, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts. That figure is a \n     reasonable approximation of the potential discretionary costs \n     of S. 2483.\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\n       If you wish further details about S. 2483 or our previous \n     estimates, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff \n     contact for this estimate is Deborah Reis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n                                                         Director.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this letter shows a cost of $320 million \nfor these bills over the next 5 years. So this is the Congressional \nBudget Office. This isn't my paper, this is theirs.\n  I will spend a few minutes, and then I will yield back my time \nbecause I know people want to get to some votes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Doesn't that letter say ``if appropriated''?\n  Mr. COBURN. Assuming appropriation. Yes, it does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That means if it is not appropriated, it doesn't cost \nanything.\n  Mr. COBURN. If it is not appropriated. But we are not passing these \nbills under the assumption they are not going to be appropriated. We \nare passing these bills under the assumption they will be appropriated.\n  As a matter of fact, the promise is made as we pass this. And either \nit is a hollow promise you are sending back home so you can say, yes, I \ndid this, and lie to your constituents, or we are going to appropriate \nthe money. It is one or the other. So either we are dishonest with whom \nwe are telling we are doing something for or we absolutely intend to \nappropriate it. There isn't any other option.\n  I will finish up by saying this. Obviously, the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico did not hear my earlier comments. We are in tremendous \neconomic straits in the long term. This debate is not about the lands \nbill. It is about will we change the philosophy, will we honor our \noath, and will we start doing what is right in the long term for those \nwho come after us. The heritage we have embraced in this country is one \nof sacrifice--one generation sacrifices so the next has opportunity. If \nwe keep doing this without regard--we don't know how much we are \nspending; we don't know how much the monthly costs are; we are not \ntaking care of the parks as we should because we do not have an idea; \nwe have a hodgepodge; we have a barge floating down the river without a \ntug on it--we are going to make the problem worse. I will remind my \ncolleagues, the true accounting of this year's estimate is a $607 \nbillion deficit. That is over $2,000 for every man, woman and child in \nthis country. Every child born today in this country inherits an \nunobligated obligation they will have to pay, that they got no benefit \nfrom, of $400,000.\n  Am I frustrating the Senators from New Mexico? You bet. Are our \nchildren worth it? You bet. I am not going to stop. I am going to stand \nand say we are going to think long term, we are going to start \nprotecting property rights, we are going to start thinking about our \nchildren, and we are not going to give up because we get lectured \nbecause we are not doing it the way we have always done it. The way we \nhave always done it has us bankrupt. It is time for a change. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, our children are worth it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on each of \nthe amendments of the Senator from Oklahoma, if that is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to that request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4519.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we vote on the \namendments in the order in which they were presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 4522.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), and the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today, I express my support of S. 2739, \nthe Consolidated Natural Resources Act. I commend the chair and ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for \ntheir leadership and the work of their staff on this important \nlegislation. This bill represents a bicameral-and-bipartisan supported \npackage of bills. It has many good initiatives that demonstrate our \ncommitment to be responsible stewards of our national treasures and \nhistoric sites. The legislation also has targeted provisions that \naddress unique circumstances and issues occurring in the Pacific \nregion.\n  I express my support for titles VII and VIII of S. 2739 that relate \nto the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI, and the \nFreely Associated States, the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic \nof the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.\n  The CNMI is a group of islands located east of the Philippines and \nsouth of Japan. Following World War II, the United States administered \nthe islands under a United Nations trusteeship. In 1975, the people of \nthe CNMI voted for a political union with the United States. The 1976 \ncovenant enacted by Congress gave U.S. citizenship to CNMI residents \nand extended most U.S. laws to the CNMI. However, the covenant exempted \nthe CNMI from U.S. immigration law. As a result of the CNMI's policies, \ntoday the population has increased fivefold, from 16,000 to 80,000. \nThis growth has made both U.S. citizens, and the indigenous people of \nthe islands, minorities in their own communities.\n  This legislation meets the Federal Government's interest in further \nimplementation of the covenant, securing our borders, and in the \nestablishment of stable immigration and labor policies on which the \nCNMI can build its future. The provisions included in title VII are \nidentical to those passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on \nDecember 11, 2007. As the sponsor of the companion CNMI bill, I am \npleased to report the CNMI provisions contained in S. 2739 are \nsensitive to the special circumstances and to the current economic \ndownturn in the CNMI. The legislation provides a basis to transition \nthe CNMI to Federal immigration laws, while protecting the local \neconomy. These provisions are crucial to address the immigration abuses \nthat have persisted in the CNMI for the past 20 years.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I am particularly \npleased to join Senator Wyden in including a provision on cooperative \nagreements that will protect the natural resources on our national \nparks. Title III of S. 2739 will give the Secretary of the Interior the \nauthority to enter agreements with Federal, public, nonprofit \norganizations, and even private landowners to protect our coasts, \nwetlands, and watersheds contained within and outside of national park \nboundaries. This act supports collaborative efforts that will greatly \nbenefit generations of park visitors.\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\n  Just as important as having cooperative agreements is the ability of \nthese entities to work together and use them to combat the spread of \ninvasive species. Invasive species are one of the greatest threats to \nour natural and cultural heritage. Invasive species are the primary \ncause of decline in Hawaii's threatened and endangered species, and \ncause hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to Hawaii's \nagricultural industry, tourism, real estate, and water quality.\n  One very successful public-private partnership in my State is \noccurring at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the island of Hawaii. \nThe Ola'a-Kilauea Partnership is a cooperative land management effort \ninvolving State and Federal entities and willing private landowners. \nThis partnership has jointly fenced 14,100 acres on State and private \nlands and eliminated the feral pig population from 9,800, while also \ncontrolling feral pigs in an additional 4,300 acres.\n  There are other examples, such as efforts on the island of Maui. I am \nproud to mention the work of the Maui Invasive Species Committee, which \nbrings together the resources of individuals, and the Federal and State \ngovernments to collaborate and combat invasive species. One of the \nbarriers they have faced in the past is the inability to spend Federal \nfunds on projects that treat invasive species on lands adjacent to \nnational park borders, where there is a clear and direct benefit to \nparks. This bill will provide the necessary authorization to support \nsuch efforts. This is especially vital as such cooperative agreements \nfocus cooperative action to reduce invasive species on our national \nparks and other lands across the country.\n  The cooperative agreement provisions of Title III provide a very \nimportant step in controlling invasive species that are crossing \ngeographic and jurisdictional boundaries. Land managers and other \ninvolved governments and organizations will have another tool to help \naddress their invasive species management issues. Also it will allow \nthe Secretary of the Department of Interior to protect park resources \nthrough collaborative efforts in lands within and outside of National \nPark System units.\n  I stand in strong support for the Consolidated Natural Resources Act. \nI encourage my colleagues to join in keeping our precious national \nresources and historic sites available for future generations, as well \nas meeting the needs of the Pacific region.\n Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate \npassed the Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act of 2007, which was included \nas part of the larger public lands package, S. 2739. The bill would \nauthorize the National Park Service to study whether any of the sites \nsignificant to Chavez's life meet the criteria for being listed on the \nNational Register of Historic Landmarks. The goal of the study is to \nestablish a foundation for future legislation that would then designate \nappropriate sites for national historic landmark status.\n  Since the 107th Congress, I've worked to pass the Cesar Chavez study \nlanguage. It has received an overwhelming positive response, not only \nfrom my fellow Arizonans, but from Americans all across the Nation.\n  Cesar Chavez was a humble man of deep conviction who understood what \nit meant to serve and sacrifice for others. Honoring the places of his \nlife will enable his legacy to inspire and serve as an example for our \nfuture leaders. It is important that we remember his struggle and do \nwhat we can to preserve appropriate landmarks that are significant to \nhis life.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today the Senate takes an important step \nforward in celebrating and commemorating one of our Nation's most \nimportant emblems and historic periods. Included in the Consolidated \nNatural Resources Act of 2008 is legislation that I authored, the Star-\nSpangled Banner National Historic Trail Act. I am proud to be joined by \ncosponsors of the original bill, including Senators Mikulski, Warner, \nWebb, and Kennedy.\n  This land and water trail of almost 300 miles covers parts of \nMaryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia to commemorate the \nevents leading up to the writing of the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' during \nthe Chesapeake Campaign of the War of 1812.\n  The trail traces the following major events: the arrival of the \nBritish fleet on the Patuxent River; the landing of the British forces \nin Benedict, MD; the sinking of the Chesapeake Flotilla at Pig Point in \nPrince George's County and Anne Arundel County, MD; the American defeat \nat the Battle of Bladensburg; the siege of the Nation's Capital and the \nburning of the U.S. Capitol and the White House in Washington, DC; the \nroute of the American troops from Washington through Georgetown, the \nMaryland counties of Montgomery, Howard, and Baltimore, and the city of \nBaltimore to the Battle of North Point; and the ultimate victory of the \nAmericans at Fort McHenry on September 14, 1814.\n  The National Park Service will administer the trail and coordinate \nthe efforts of public and private entities on trail administration, \nplanning, development, and maintenance. Fort McHenry will be the lead \npark unit for trail operations. The land routes would follow existing \npublic roads, along which British and American troops traveled. Over \ntime, the routes will be marked on the ground and at water access \npoints. In cases where the original routes have been lost to \ndevelopment or other causes, they could be interpreted through waysides \nas appropriate and feasible.\n  The bill requires the Secretary to encourage public participation and \nconsult with landowners, Federal, State, and local governments on the \nadministration of the trail. The bill prohibits land or interest in \nland outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered area \nfrom being acquired for the trail without the consent of the owner.\n  The trail will open new economic opportunities for many Maryland \ncommunities, including Calvert County, our Port Towns of Prince \nGeorge's County, and Baltimore City. More importantly, the Star-\nSpangled Banner National Historic Trail will guide Americans on a path \nthat will help them understand the events that lead up to the epic \nbattle at Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor.\n  At the fort, the garrison flag was flown on September 13 and 14, \n1814, during the Battle of Baltimore. As the routed British ships \nsailed out of Baltimore Harbor on the morning of the 14th, lawyer \nFrancis Scott Key was inspired to write the patriotic and defiant words \nof a poem that became the rallying cry for Americans who had fought \ntheir first war as a united nation. The poem was set to music and the \nsong became the national anthem in 1931.\n  The ``Star-Spangled Banner'' was given to the Smithsonian Institution \nin 1907 by the grandson of the commander of Fort McHenry, LTC George \nArmistead, so that it could be preserved and displayed for the public. \nWhile the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History is \ncurrently closed for extensive renovation, its reopening this summer \nwill showcase the Banner in an impressive new exhibit.\n  Mr. President, every day across the country, Americans salute the \nAmerican flag. The Senate recites the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag \nevery legislative day. In sports arenas and countless other venues, we \nsalute the flag daily. Today, I salute the work of the Senate in \npassing the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail as part of the \nConsolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. Through this legislation, \nmillions of visitors will be inspired with the history of this iconic \nobject and its significance during this important period of American \nhistory.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to speak on an \nitem included in the bill before us. Before I address this particular \nissue, I first want to voice my strong support for some of the \nindividual components that have been assembled in the consolidated \npackage currently before the body.\n  The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail extension and the Platte \nRiver Recovery Implementation Program and Pathfinder Modification \nProject authorization are measures I have been working on for some \ntime, and I want to thank Chairman Bingaman for his efforts in bringing \nthese measures to the point where they will shortly pass the Senate.\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\n  But there is another matter in this bill that is of some importance \nto Nebraska and to my constituents. Included in the bill is a section \nexpressing the sense of Congress that a museum located in Paducah, KY \nshould be designated as ``the National Quilt Museum of the United \nStates.'' Now, this measure is nonbinding and carries no legal \nauthority. As far as we can tell, it confers no authority for funding \nor anything of that nature. However, I would be remiss if I failed to \nmention that I had been working to resolve some concerns that I and \nsome of my constituents have with this section.\n  You see, just the week before last, the International Quilt Study \nCenter & Museum opened its doors in Lincoln, NE. This is a remarkable, \n37,000 square foot facility that houses the world's largest privately \nheld collection of quilts.\n  Thus, back in February, I objected to a unanimous consent request to \npass H. Con. Res. 209, a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of \nCongress regarding the designation of the museum. That resolution had \npreviously passed the House of Representatives unanimously. I have been \nworking with the distinguished minority leader, Mr. McConnell, and \nCongressman Whitfield of Kentucky, whose district includes Paducah, to \ncraft a solution that would appropriately praise both museums for their \nindividual and unique contributions to the world of quilts and quilt-\nmaking. I would like to thank them for their willingness to work with \nme.\n  Unfortunately, the entirety of H. Con. Res. 209 was included in \nsection 335 of this bill before these discussions were able to run \ntheir course. I have filed an amendment to strike this section from the \nbill, so that we might continue to work out a resolution that properly \nhonors the Paducah museum while not making any exclusive designations \nthat exclude the International Quilt Study Center, but I understand the \nsituation is such that my amendment is prevented from consideration \nbefore the full Senate.\n  Looking forward, I plan to honor this remarkable organization at the \nUniversity of Nebraska in an appropriate manner. For purposes of \nbalancing the record here today, I want to mention a few things about \nthe remarkable facility in Nebraska.\n  The International Quilt Study Center & Museum has 37,000 square feet \nof exhibition galleries, collections storage, collections care, a \nreception hall, a library, reading room and classroom space. It is \nhoused in a beautiful, newly constructed building designed by world-\nrenowned architecture firm Robert A.M. Stern Architects and built with \n$12 million in private donations.\n\n  The mission of the International Quilt Study Center & Museum is to \ncollect, preserve, study, exhibit, and promote discovery of quilts and \nquilt-making traditions from many cultures, countries, and time \nperiods. The International Quilt Study Center & Museum is a dynamic \ncenter of formal and informal learning and discovery for students, \nteachers, scholars, artists, quilters, and others from across the \nNation and around the world.\n  The International Quilt Study Center & Museum has the largest \nprivately held quilt collection in the world--more than 2,300 quilts \nfrom 49 States and 23 foreign countries.\n  The International Quilt Study Center & Museum is centrally located in \nthe heart of the United States and is open to the public year-round. I \nwish I could share information on the number of visitors who enjoy the \nmuseum each year, but the new facility is so new that such data is \nunavailable. However, we do know that individuals from all 50 States \nand from more than 15 foreign countries have visited the International \nQuilt Study Center & Museum in its previous homes.\n  The International Quilt Study Center & Museum has an international \nadvisory board and annual supporters from all 50 States and many \nforeign countries, and hundreds of supporters, volunteers, and quilt \nguilds have supported the International Quilt Study Center annually \nsince its formation in 1997.\n  The International Quilt Study Center's collections represent the \nentire gamut of quilt making in the United States, plus its antecedents \nin Europe. In addition, the International Quilt Study Center holds \nexamples of cultural traditions from more than 23 countries.\n  In closing, the International Quilt Study Center & Museum in Nebraska \nis recognized nationally and internationally for its place of \nprominence in its field. It has the largest publicly held collection of \nquilts in the world; it is the largest quilt museum in the world; it is \nthe only academic center devoted to quilt studies; it offers the only \ngraduate program in textile history with a quilt studies emphasis. At \nthe appropriate time, I hope the Congress will see fit to bestow upon \nit an honor befitting its contributions to our Nation's art, our \nheritage, and our history.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as the Senate considers the Consolidated \nNatural Resources Act, I would like to highlight two provisions that \nare important for Illinois: the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area \nand the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Extension.\n  Illinois is known as the Land of Lincoln for good reason. Our 16th \nPresident spent more than 30 years of his life in central Illinois, \nstarting in 1830 when his family moved to Macon County from Indiana. \nAbraham Lincoln had virtually no formal education--perhaps 18 months of \nschooling. His rise from humble origins to the highest office in the \nland and his decisive leadership through the most harrowing period of \nU.S. history brings hope and inspiration to all of us.\n  Next year marks the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth. Among the public \nactivities planned to honor his life is development of the Abraham \nLincoln National Heritage Area. Communities in 42 Illinois counties \nhave worked together to document Lincoln's time in the State, assess \nthe status of the places that played a role in his life and career, and \nrecommend a plan to help develop the narrative of Lincoln's imprint on \nIllinois. The goal is to help develop sites in places where there is a \nLincoln story to tell but no place to tell that story. Although the \nheritage area focuses on the life of Abraham Lincoln, the heritage area \nalso brings out the rich history of each participating community, \ncreating a broader context for Lincoln and his times.\n  Illinois features prominently in another important, earlier story in \nthe making of America--the historic expedition of Meriwether Lewis and \nWilliam Clark across the western frontier. Much has been said and \nwritten about that western journey, but equally fascinating is the \n``Eastern Legacy'' of the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n  The journey began right here in the District of Columbia. That is \nwhere President Thomas Jefferson directed his private secretary \nMeriwether Lewis in June 1803 to lead a mission through the vast \nunknown territory west of the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean. \nLewis gathered supplies and men in many Eastern States before meeting \nup with William Clark in Kentucky and traveling to Illinois.\n  Lewis and Clark established their winter camp at the mouth of the \nWood River in Illinois. The following spring their Corps of Discovery \ndeparted Camp Dubois and began their historic scientific expedition \nwest. Lewis marked this spot near present-day Wood River, IL, as the \nofficial ``point of departure.'' Two and a half years later, the team \nreturned to this camp after its remarkable adventure to the Pacific \ncoast.\n  The bill the Senate is considering will preserve this important and \nfascinating story through the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail \nExtension, which will include sites associated with the preparation and \nreturn phases of the expedition--the Eastern Legacy. The trail \nextension includes sites in 11 Eastern States and the District of \nColumbia. The trail in Illinois includes sites from Metropolis along \nthe Ohio River to Wood River at the confluence of the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers.\n  These two initiatives are very important to Illinois. I know the bill \nincludes similar initiatives in other States. These development areas \nare significant, not just for the historic and cultural legacy but also \nfor the economic development value for the host communities. Many \nIllinois communities participating in these heritage areas are very \nrural--with populations less than 3,000, few resources, and high \nunemployment rates.\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\n  The bill does much to preserve areas of natural beauty and expand our \nnational historic trail system and national heritage areas that bring \nfamilies outdoors and across our Nation to discover important events \nand geographic locations in the creation of America. It also celebrates \nNative American, Colonial American, European American, Latino American, \nand African American heritage. Finally, the bill establishes memorials \nand museums to honor our past and authorizes studies as the first step \ntoward preserving historic sites that are at risk of being forgotten\n  Illinoisans are proud of our heritage and our place in history. The \npreservation programs in the Consolidated Natural Resources Act help \ntell America's stories--stories of sacrifice, bravery, and awe of the \nland's natural beauty--so that we and our children can carry on the \nhistorical traditions that others have handed down to us.\n  The Consolidated Natural Resources Act is a bipartisan package that \nbrings together nearly four dozen projects to preserve our Nation's \nland and our Nation's heritage.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today I join my colleagues in supporting \nthe passage of S. 2739, the omnibus lands bill, which included two \nissues of special interest to me. First, the bill seeks to correct \nprofound problems in local immigration laws that have enabled the \nimport of low paid, short termed indentured workers to be brought to \nthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI. Some were \nbought to work in garment factories. Others arrived in the CNMI, only \nto find that there was no job waiting for them, and were forced to find \nunpalatable means to work off their bondage debt. I am pleased that \ntoday, this bill will address longstanding concerns regarding the \nCNMI's immigration problems.\n  Secondly, this bill also includes a provision to expand the boundary \nof the Minidoka Internment National Monument, and establish a unit on \nBainbridge Island, Washington, for a new Japanese American Memorial at \nthe Eagledale Ferry Dock. The Minidoka site is significant, because the \nMinidoka Internment Camp featured the highest level of military \nparticipation in any of the camps, and Bainbridge Island was the first \ncommunity for Japanese Americans to be relocated to. I believe that we \nneed to do all that we can to preserve internment camp sites, because \nthey serve as a powerful reminder of how important it is to have a \nvibrant democracy that protects the civil liberties of all.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nConsolidated Natural Resources Act, S. 2739. This omnibus package \nincludes language that is especially important to my State, as well as \nthe Nation. Amongst other things, S. 2739 would designate some of \nAmerica's most historic and beautiful lands as National Heritage Areas, \nincluding the area along Route 15 in Virginia. Known as the Journey \nThrough Hallowed Ground, this effort has been championed by myself, my \ngood friend Congressman Frank Wolf, and Senator Jim Webb. I thank them \nfor all their efforts on behalf of this legislation.\n  As my colleagues are aware, National Heritage Areas are intended to \nencourage residents, government agencies, nonprofit groups, and private \npartners to collaboratively plan and implement programs and projects to \nrecognize, preserve, and celebrate many of America's defining \nlandscapes. Today, there are 37 National Heritage Areas spread out \nacross the United States.\n  In Virginia, we are lucky enough to have a landscape that is worthy \nof the recognition and celebration that a National Heritage Area \ndesignation would afford it. Stretching through four States, and \ngenerally following the path of the Old Carolina Road, today's Route \n15, the proposed Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area \nis home to some of our Nation's greatest historic, cultural, and \nnatural treasures. The region's riches read like a star-studded list of \nAmerican History: Monticello, Montpelier, Manassas, Gettysburg. The \nlist goes on. In all, there are 15 National Historic Landmarks, 47 \nhistoric districts, a number of Presidential homes, and the largest \ncollection of Civil War battlefields in the Country. It is an area, \nliterally, where America happened.\n  With basic, technical assistance from the National Park Service, this \nproposed Heritage area would be managed by The Journey Through Hallowed \nGround Partnership, a nonprofit entity whose sole purpose is to trumpet \nthe magnificence of the Hallowed Ground's offerings. Already, the \nPartnership has provided opportunities for thousands of visitors to \nenjoy the region's spectacular natural and historical resources, and \nthey have worked hard to get this area the designation and recognition \nit deserves.\n  Now, before I conclude, I would like to take a quick moment to \naddress several of the arguments voiced by critics against national \nheritage areas. First and foremost among these arguments, is that \nnational heritage areas infringe upon private property rights. This \nsimply is not accurate. As the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nnoted in testimony to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \n``National heritage areas do not appear [to affect] private property \nrights'', GAO-04-593T. Furthermore, as an example that they don't, I \noffer up the State of Tennessee, in its entirety, which today is \ndesignated a national heritage area and has had no intrusion on \nproperty rights. And, lastly, I point to language in this legislation \nthat I specifically put in to ensure that no intrusion on property \nrights occured. It states, in some detail, that ``nothing in this \nsubtitle abridges the rights of any property owner.''\n  Other criticisms include concerns about the costs of heritage areas, \nand also that heritage areas increase the role of the Federal \nGovernment. To the issue of costs, I note that heritage areas provide a \nway for the Federal Government to highlight our Nation's historical, \ncultural, and natural resources without having to actually own and \nmaintain them--which, as we know by the current maintenance backlogs in \nthe Park System, are quite costly to the American taxpayer. Secondly, I \nwould like to remind my friends that often heritage areas require a \nfunding match before a single Federal dollar can be appropriated. This \nis the case for the heritage area which I come to champion today--The \nJourney Through Hallowed Ground. Every taxpayer dollar that is \nappropriated to the Journey Through Hallowed Ground must be matched \nequally by non-Federal entities.\n  As for the other criticism, that heritage areas increase the role of \nthe Federal Government and impose upon State and local governments, I \nnote that heritage areas require and provide exorbitant opportunity for \nState and local input. In fact, in forming the Hallowed Ground, the \nlocal coordinating entity sought and received support from every local \ncity, county, and town within the proposed Heritage Area. The Governor \nand Virginia General Assembly, whom I sincerely thank, also supported \nthis effort. I commend the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership \nfor reaching out to all these groups.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation, and I thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of \nThe Journey Through Hallowed Ground.\n  Mr. DOOD. Madam President, I support of S. 2739, the Consolidated \nNatural Resources Act of 2008, sponsored by Senator Bingaman, the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This \nlegislation will protect and preserve natural treasures all across this \ncountry. It is of particular importance to me and to the people of \nConnecticut, as it contains a provision I authored that would ensure \nthe preservation of the Eightmile River watershed under the auspices of \nthe Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n  As elected representatives, I believe that one of our most important \nobligations is to ensure that this country's vast array of natural \nresources and wilderness is managed in an environmentally responsible \nand sustainable way. We owe it to future generations of Americans to \nprotect the areas of pristine beauty and ecological diversity that \nfigure so prominently in our Nation's history and character. Since \n1968, the National Wild and Scenic River Act has played a critical role \nin furthering this mission by making it the policy of the United States \nto preserve in free-flowing fashion, rivers of, to quote the act, \n``scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic,\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\ncultural or other similar values . . . for the benefit and enjoyment of \npresent and future generations.''\n  Designation of the Eightmile River as a Wild and Scenic River enjoys \nextraordinarily broad support in my home State, and a 3-year study by \nthe National Park Service found that the river meets the criteria to \nreceive a ``scenic'' designation. The entire Connecticut Congressional \ndelegation supports this legislation, as does the Connecticut State \nLegislature, which passed a resolution of support. Most importantly, \ndesignation is supported by the communities that will be most affected \nby this designation, those in the Eightmile watershed. This effort to \npreserve the special attributes of the Eightmile is a product of the \ncommunities' recognition of the beauty and fragility of the special \nplace in which they live. Votes in each community were strongly in \nfavor of designation, in part because the study process and debate \nallowed for many perspectives to be heard.\n  The attributes of the river that are so valued by the residents of \nConnecticut include its clean water, with 92 percent of the watershed's \nstreamwater meeting the State's highest quality standards, and no point \nsources of pollution. The streams flow freely with no dams or \ndiversions--rare in a State that has been densely populated as long as \nConnecticut. Eighty percent of the land area is forested. The natural \nstreams and large areas of interconnected forest provide habitat for \nrare species. In fact, the study for eligibility determined that the \nEightmile River watershed ranks in the 99th percentile in New England \nfor globally rare species per unit area. The residents of this unique \narea treasure the beautiful character of the Eightmile watershed. It is \na quintessential rural New England landscape, dotted with colonial \nhomes and historic churches and unmarred by modern industrial \ndevelopment.\n  The towns within the watershed have begun to implement the parts of \nthe watershed management plan that are in their jurisdiction. \nCongressional designation as a Wild and Scenic River will bolster these \nefforts and provide the stability for ongoing long-term preservation. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, \nand I thank the chairman of the Energy Committee for his extraordinary \ncommitment to protecting this country's natural treasures.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n2739, a package of natural resource bills that Chairman Bingaman has \nassembled. The bills that are in this package have received the \nunanimous endorsement of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee and have cleared the House. I want to thank Senator Bingaman \nfor his leadership in the Committee and I want to thank Majority Leader \nReid for bringing this package before the Senate for consideration.\n  There are four bills in this package that I am particularly proud to \nsupport: S. 500, a bill that would form a commission to study the \npossible creation of the National Museum of the American Latino; S. \n1116, a bill that would help make better use of the water that is \nproduced as a byproduct of energy development; S. 752, a bill that \nwould authorize a program to assist with endangered species recovery \nalong the Platte River in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming; and S. 327, \nthe Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act, which would help preserve the \nlegacy of one of our Nation's most important civil rights leaders.\n  I want to spend a couple minutes talking about each of these bills, \nbut first, Mr. President, I want to discuss the process through which \nwe are debating these bills.\n  This is, as my colleagues all know, a highly unusual process for \ndebating natural resource bills. Typically, the Senate is able to take \nup and pass with the strong support the 100 Members in this Chamber--\nmost bills that pertain to national parks, forests, national museums, \nhistoric preservation, and cultural resource protections. If a bill \nclears the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by unanimous \nconsent it is likely that the full Senate will clear it by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Why has this been the practice? Because most of the bills we pass out \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee are bipartisan, \nnoncontroversial, and easily garner the unanimous support of 100 \nMembers.\n  This is how Congress established the Black Canyon of the Gunnison \nNational Park in Colorado in 1999. It is how we passed the Great Sand \nDunes National Park and Preserve Act in my native San Luis Valley in \n2000. It is how we established the Sand Creek Massacre National \nHistoric Site in Kiowa County in 2005.\n  It is how we pass bills like the Buffalo Soldiers Commemoration Act, \nthe Eisenhower Memorial Act, and the Ojito Wilderness Act. The list \ngoes on and on.\n  Mr. President, on issues like health care, the economy, and Iraq, the \nparties do have real and substantial differences, and those differences \nmerit serious debate here on the floor. But on how to protect our \nnational treasures and traditions, we are usually in lock step.\n  Unfortunately, that has not been the case this year. Instead, every \nsingle bill that leaves the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nregardless of its subject or content, has encountered an objection.\n  Mr. President, each of us is certainly within our rights in objecting \nto a bill. That is a solemn right in this chamber, and it is one that \nensures that when a Member has a strong, substantive objection to a \nbill, he or she can be heard.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, I fear that the objections to these \nbills make it even more difficult to make progress on the issues that \nface our Nation.\n  All the bills in this package have my support and the support of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, but there are four bills of \nwhich I am particularly proud.\n  The first, S. 500, would help us determine how we can more properly \nrecognize the contributions of Hispanic Americans to our nation's \nhistory. The Commission to Study the Potential Creation of the National \nMuseum of the American Latino Act of 2007 would do what its title \nsuggests: it would establish a commission to study the potential \ncreation of a national museum dedicated to the art, culture, and \nhistory of Hispanic Americans. The Commission will be tasked with \nstudying the impact of the potential museum and the cost of \nconstruction and maintenance. It will also be tasked with developing an \naction plan, a fundraising plan, and a recommendation on whether to \nproceed with construction of the museum.\n  The second, S. 1116, is a bill I worked on with my colleague from \nColorado, Representative Mark Udall, which would help make better use \nof the water that is produced during energy development. Each day, more \nthan two million gallons of useable groundwater are wasted, turned into \nwhat is known as ``produced water,'' after it is brought to the surface \nduring oil and gas drilling or coal bed methane extraction. This water \nis often contaminated beyond use.\n  The ``More Water, More Energy, Less Waste Act of 2007'', cosponsored \nby Senators Bingaman, Domenici, and Enzi--along with the late Senator \nThomas--initiates a feasibility study on recovering ``produced water.'' \nIt also establishes a grant program to test technologies that would \nconvert ``produced'' water to ``useable'' water.\n  This bill will be of great value in the arid West, where we are \nconstantly looking for ways to increase our water supplies for crop \nirrigation, livestock watering, wildlife habitat, and recreational \nopportunities. It is deserving of swift passage.\n  The third bill I would like to highlight is S. 752, the Platte River \nRecovery Implementation Program and Pathfinder Modification \nAuthorization Act of 2007. It is a bill that Senator Ben Nelson, \nSenator Allard, Senator Hagel and I introduced. The bill authorizes the \nSecretary of the Interior to participate in a program to help \nendangered species recovery along the Platte River in Nebraska, \nColorado, and Wyoming. The Governors of Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming \nand the Department of Interior spent nine years developing the plan for \nthis program, which they finalized in 2006.\n  S. 752 authorizes the Secretary of Interior to carry out the \nEndangered Species Recovery Program in partnership with the States. \nUnder the bill, the States and Federal Government will share costs, 50-\n50, on projects that provide benefits for endangered and threatened \nspecies recovery and that\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\nhelp with the monitoring and research on the benefits of the program. \nThe bill authorizes $157 million to support the federal portion of the \nwork.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this package includes a bill, S. 327, that \nwould help preserve the legacy of one of our Nation's top civil rights \nleaders, Cesar Estrada Chavez.\n  We all know the story of Cesar Chavez. From a family of migrant farm \nworkers, Cesar Chavez began working in the fields at age 10. He moved \nfrom job to job across the Southwest, enduring the hardships and \ninjustices of farm worker life. In 1952, at age 35, Chavez started \nworking as a community activist, fighting for civil rights for all \nworkers. Ten years later, he founded the National Farm Workers \nAssociation, which became the United Farm Workers of America, and led \nefforts to improve wages and working conditions. Chavez, through his \nwork to improve the lives of farm workers across the country, is one of \nour nation's most important civil rights leaders. We must honor his \nmemory and remember the sacrifices he made on our behalf.\n  To that end, the Cesar Estrada Chavez Study Act would authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to conduct a resource study, not later than 3 \nyears after funds are made available, of sites associated with the life \nof Cesar Estrada Chavez. The study would help determine whether those \nsites meet the criteria for being listed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places or possible designation as national historic landmarks. \nI am a proud co-sponsor of this bill and will continue to fight until \nit is passed.\n  Mr. President, I want to again thank Chairman Bingaman and Majority \nLeader Reid for their leadership in bringing this package of lands \nbills to the floor and for working to overcome the obstructionism that \nhas, unfortunately, become so common in this body. These are \nbipartisan, common-sense bills that will help protect our nation's \nnatural, cultural, and historic heritage, and I urge their prompt \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

COMMEMORATIVE WORK TO HONOR BRIGADIER GENERAL \n                   FRANCIS MARION AND HIS FAMILY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Francis Marion was born in 1732 in St. John's Parish, \n     Berkeley County, South Carolina. He married Mary Esther \n     Videau on April 20th, 1786. Francis and Mary Esther Marion \n     had no children, but raised a son of a relative as their own, \n     and gave the child Francis Marion's name.\n       (2) Brigadier General Marion commanded the Williamsburg \n     Militia Revolutionary force in South Carolina and was \n     instrumental in delaying the advance of British forces by \n     leading his troops in disrupting supply lines.\n       (3) Brigadier General Marion's tactics, which were unheard \n     of in rules of warfare at the time, included lightning raids \n     on British convoys, after which he and his forces would \n     retreat into the swamps to avoid capture. British Lieutenant \n     Colonel Tarleton stated that ``as for this damned old swamp \n     fox, the devil himself could not catch him''. Thus, the \n     legend of the ``Swamp Fox'' was born.\n       (4) His victory at the Battle of Eutaw Springs in September \n     of 1781 was officially recognized by Congress.\n       (5) Brigadier General Marion's troops are believed to be \n     the first racially integrated force fighting for the United \n     States, as his band was a mix of Whites, Blacks, both free \n     and slave, and Native Americans.\n       (6) As a statesman, he represented his parish in the South \n     Carolina senate as well as his State at the Constitutional \n     Convention.\n       (7) Although the Congress has authorized the establishment \n     of commemorative works on Federal lands in the District of \n     Columbia honoring such celebrated Americans as George \n     Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln, the \n     National Capital has no comparable memorial to Brigadier \n     General Francis Marion for his bravery and leadership during \n     the Revolutionary War, without which the United States would \n     not exist.\n       (8) Brigadier General Marion's legacy must live on. Since \n     1878, United States Reservation 18 has been officially \n     referred to as Marion Park. Located between 4th and 6th \n     Streets, S.E., at the intersection of E Street and South \n     Carolina Avenue, S.E., in Washington, DC, the park lacks a \n     formal commemoration to this South Carolina hero who was \n     important to the initiation of the Nation's heritage.\n       (9) The time has come to correct this oversight so that \n     future generations of Americans will know and understand the \n     preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation \n     of Brigadier General Marion's contributions. Such a South \n     Carolina hero deserves to be given the proper recognition.\n       (b) Authority To Establish Commemorative Work.--The Marion \n     Park Project, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation \n     Foundation, may establish a commemorative work on Federal \n     land in the District of Columbia and its environs to honor \n     Brigadier General Francis Marion and his service.\n       (c) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The \n     commemorative work authorized by subsection (b) shall be \n     established in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United \n     States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works \n     Act'').\n       (d) Use of Federal Funds Prohibited.--Federal funds may not \n     be used to pay any expense of the establishment of the \n     commemorative work authorized by subsection (b). The Marion \n     Park Project, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation \n     Foundation, shall be solely responsible for acceptance of \n     contributions for, and payment of the expenses of, the \n     establishment of that commemorative work.\n       (e) Deposit of Excess Funds.--If, upon payment of all \n     expenses of the establishment of the commemorative work \n     authorized by subsection (b) (including the maintenance and \n     preservation amount provided for in section 8906(b) of title \n     40, United States Code), or upon expiration of the authority \n     for the commemorative work under chapter 89 of title 40, \n     United States Code, there remains a balance of funds received \n     for the establishment of that commemorative work, the Marion \n     Park Project, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation \n     Foundation, shall transmit the amount of the balance to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the account provided \n     for in section 8906(b)(1) of such title.\n       (f) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the \n     terms ``commemorative work'' and ``the District of Columbia \n     and its environs'' have the meanings given to such terms in \n     section 8902(a) of title 40, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 332.

and\n       (C) the watershed as a whole, including its protection, is \n     itself intrinsically important to this designation.\n       (4) The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee \n     took a watershed approach in studying and recommending \n     management options for the river segments and the Eightmile \n     River watershed as a whole.\n       (5) During the study, the Eightmile River Wild and Scenic \n     Study Committee, with assistance from the National Park \n     Service, prepared a comprehensive management plan for the \n     Eightmile River watershed, dated December 8, 2005 (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Eightmile River Watershed \n     Management Plan''), which establishes objectives, standards, \n     and action programs that will ensure long-term protection of \n     the outstanding values of the river and compatible management \n     of the land and water resources of the Eightmile River and \n     its watershed, without Federal management of affected lands \n     not owned by the United States.\n       (6) The Eightmile River Wild and Scenic Study Committee \n     voted in favor of inclusion of the Eightmile River in the \n     National Wild and Scenic Rivers System and included this \n     recommendation as an integral part of the\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\n     Eightmile River Watershed Management Plan.\n       (7) The residents of the towns lying along the Eightmile \n     River and comprising most of its watershed (Salem, East \n     Haddam, and Lyme, Connecticut), as well as the Boards of \n     Selectmen and Land Use Commissions of these towns, voted to \n     endorse the Eightmile River Watershed Management Plan and to \n     seek designation of the river as a component of the National \n     Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n       (8) The State of Connecticut General Assembly enacted \n     Public Act 05-18 to endorse the Eightmile River Watershed \n     Management Plan and to seek designation of the river as a \n     component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n       (b) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (167) (relating to the \n     Musconetcong River, New Jersey) as paragraph (169);\n       (2) by designating the undesignated paragraph relating to \n     the White Salmon River, Washington, as paragraph (167);\n       (3) by designating the undesignated paragraph relating to \n     the Black Butte River, California, as paragraph (168); and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(170) Eightmile River, Connecticut.--Segments of the main \n     stem and specified tributaries of the Eightmile River in the \n     State of Connecticut, totaling approximately 25.3 miles, to \n     be administered by the Secretary of the Interior as follows:\n       ``(A) The entire 10.8-mile segment of the main stem, \n     starting at its confluence with Lake Hayward Brook to its \n     confluence with the Connecticut River at the mouth of Hamburg \n     Cove, as a scenic river.\n       ``(B) The 8.0-mile segment of the East Branch of the \n     Eightmile River starting at Witch Meadow Road to its \n     confluence with the main stem of the Eightmile River, as a \n     scenic river.\n       ``(C) The 3.9-mile segment of Harris Brook starting with \n     the confluence of an unnamed stream lying 0.74 miles due east \n     of the intersection of Hartford Road (State Route 85) and \n     Round Hill Road to its confluence with the East Branch of the \n     Eightmile River, as a scenic river.\n       ``(D) The 1.9-mile segment of Beaver Brook starting at its \n     confluence with Cedar Pond Brook to its confluence with the \n     main stem of the Eightmile River, as a scenic river.\n       ``(E) The 0.7-mile segment of Falls Brook from its \n     confluence with Tisdale Brook to its confluence with the main \n     stem of the Eightmile River at Hamburg Cove, as a scenic \n     river.''.\n       (c) Management.--The segments of the main stem and certain \n     tributaries of the Eightmile River in the State of \n     Connecticut designated as components of the National Wild and \n     Scenic Rivers System by the amendment made by subsection (b) \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Eightmile River'') \n     shall be managed in accordance with the Eightmile River \n     Watershed Management Plan and such amendments to the plan as \n     the Secretary of the Interior determines are consistent with \n     this section.

Madam President, I know the Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Murray, is waiting to speak, and I will not take much time except \nto say Senator Domenici and I obviously had tremendously good help from \nour staffs. They worked long and hard to put this legislation together \nand get it into a form where it could be considered by the Senate.\n  We will seek time later this afternoon to elaborate as to the \nindividual members of our staffs who participated and to thank them for \ntheir good work.\n  I will yield the floor and allow Senator Murray and Senator Cantwell \nto speak as provided in the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico \nfor his tremendous work. I rise to thank all of my colleagues for \nsupporting the public lands and natural resources package that was just \npassed by the Senate.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, have a vested interest in this bill. \nIt contains my Wild Sky Wilderness Act which will designate over \n100,000 acres as wilderness. This proposal is the result of almost 9 \nyears of work by myself and Congressman Larsen of my home State. It has \nthe support of the vast majority of the communities around the area, as \nwell as outdoor enthusiasts, area businesses, and literally thousands \nof Washington State residents.\n  Congressman Larsen and I began working on Wild Sky back in 1999 \nbecause we were troubled by the rapid growth in Seattle and surrounding \nareas. We are so fortunate in our State to have unique and beautiful \nnatural landscapes from the peaks of the Cascade Mountains, the \nnorthwest rain forest, the Olympic Peninsula to the mighty Columbia \nRiver. But many of our special lands could be jeopardized if we do not \ntake action to preserve them now.\n  The Wild Sky Wilderness area will ensure that 106,000 acres of \nrolling hills, rushing rivers, and low-elevation forest in Washington \nState's Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest are going to be \npreserved for generations to come.\n  I am immensely proud of this legislation. The Wild Sky Wilderness \narea is just 90 minutes away from downtown Seattle. It will give more \nthan 2.4 million from Snohomish, King, and Skagit Counties easy access \nto hike and camp in a distinctive northwest landscape, it will preserve \nunique low elevation ecosystems, and it is going to give the \nsurrounding towns a great economic boost by increasing the number of \nvisitors.\n  I am especially proud because so many people in Washington State are \nso excited about this wilderness proposal. Newspapers have endorsed it \nin more than 50 editorials, and more than 200 newspaper articles, op-\neds, and letters to the editor have raved about it.\n  This is the fourth time the Senate has considered this bill. Wild Sky \nin the past has passed the Senate unanimously three times because we \nsaw the value of this wilderness proposal and recognized that this bill \nis something my State supports.\n  Last year, for the first time, Wild Sky passed the House, and now \npassing the Senate, we are so close to making this truly a reality.\n  With that in mind, I want to take a few minutes to share with my \ncolleagues what they just did. I want them to see some of the benefits \nthis bill offers my home State of Washington and why people in my State \nare so eager to create the Wild Sky Wilderness.\n  Since the days when Native people and early settlers harvested salmon \nand timber from our streams and forests, people who live in Washington \nState have recognized the importance of our natural heritage. We have a \ngreat tradition in my State of respecting and enjoying the natural \nbeauty that surrounds us.\n  Washington State is home to tremendously natural resources, and we \nhave a proud history of embracing our national parks and our forests. \nThe Wild Sky area is already being enjoyed by many of our citizens who \nhike or hunt or raft or camp there. And since we proposed designating \nit as wilderness, literally thousands of people have written \nCongressman Larsen and me to share their support. Many of those writers \ntold personal stories about their experiences in the Wild Sky area.\n  Mike Town is a high school science teacher from Duvall, WA. He \ndescribed introducing his students to a wild salmon spawning site near \nthe Wild Sky Wilderness. Because that river's headwaters are in the \nproposed wilderness area, the water is still so pristine there that \nsalmon are able to thrive, and today it is the one of the few places \nleft in the Cascades where spawning salmon are still so numerous you \ncould actually walk across the river on their backs.\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n  Mike called that river one of the greatest spectacles in nature, and \nhe said to me:\n\n       I cherish the belief that with federal protection for this \n     area, my teenage students will have the ability to share the \n     experience of spawning wild salmon with their grandchildren.\n\n  So the first reason we are so excited about Wild Sky is because it \nreflects the values of the people of Washington State.\n  But another reason this bill has so much support is because we worked \nhard to accommodate the needs of the users of this area. Very early on \nin the process, we reached out to all the local stakeholders to gauge \ntheir interest and ask if they had any concerns, and we were able to \nwork with them and address many of the issues they raised.\n  We worked with Longview Fibre, a paper company that had some land in \nthe proposed boundary. As a result, we were able to draw out certain \nareas and prioritize others that the company was willing to sell.\n  We heard from local and State snowmobile groups concerned that the \nboundaries of our original proposal would shut out important riding \nareas. So we took out a vast majority of those areas.\n  We ensured that float planes still have access to Lake Isabel.\n  We worked with the Forest Service and excluded heavily used areas \naround Barclay Lake and the only two areas where timber sales were \nbeing considered.\n  We made sure that Snohomish County and the Forest Service were \ncomfortable with the emergency communication capability in and around \nthe wilderness area.\n  And last winter, massive floods altered the path of the Skykomish \nRiver and displaced and destroyed parts of that road that provides \naccess through our proposed wilderness area. So Congressman Larsen and \nI got back together and brought together Snohomish County, the Forest \nService, and local advocates to responsibly adjust the boundaries of \nthis wilderness to make sure the road could be rebuilt and remain open \nfor future use.\n  Thanks to all of this work, we have the support now of many of the \nlocally elected officials and most of the surrounding towns and \ncounties. Local conservation, hunting, and fishing groups back this \nbill. The Seaplane Pilots Association and many local businesses endorse \nit, and the Under Secretary of Natural Resources for the Forest \nService, Mark Rey, said the President will sign this bill.\n  Even though many people in Washington State understand and appreciate \nthe value of wilderness, this bill has a lot of support because we were \nalso willing to work with the diverse groups of people who have an \ninterest in how this land is used. This truly was a public process.\n  Although we, of course, could not meet every single need, we have \nmade every effort to accommodate everyone who engaged in this process, \nand thanks to this effort, this bill is an example of wilderness done \nthe right way.\n  I wish to talk about the benefits of Wild Sky because I am so excited \nabout what it offers people who live in my State and those who visit. \nSeveral years ago, I took a trip through the area where the Wild Sky \nWilderness would be. It is very hard to put into words how beautiful \nthis stunning, amazing area is that is 90 minutes from downtown \nSeattle.\n  A significant part of this wilderness is seemingly endless expanses \nof meadows. Rolling mountains can be seen that are covered with stands \nof huge old moss-covered trees, and some of those trees are over 100 \nyears old. From the ridges, you have incredible views of the western \nslopes of the Cascade Mountains.\n\n  This area is so unique. And one of the things that makes it unique is \nits relatively low elevation. About one-third of Wild Sky is below \n3,000 feet. So the Wild Sky Wilderness area is going to bring new \necological systems into our wilderness lands that are underrepresented \nright now.\n  Wild Sky links our forests and meadows and steep craggy peaks, as you \ncan see, and it is going to create a protected habitat corridor for all \nthe wildlife living in this area. We have wolves and mountain goats, \nblack and grizzly bears, and deer and trout.\n  Salmon spawning grounds teeming with fish--just like the one my \ntown's science teacher showed his students--used to be very common, but \ntoday many of those species are struggling to survive. So at a time \nwhen we are asking private landowners to assist in recovering wild fish \nruns, I believe the Federal Government ought to do everything it can on \nits own land to help protect and restore that wildlife habitat.\n  Secondly, Madam President, the Wild Sky Wilderness is going to offer \nus great new recreational opportunities for people in a growing region. \nWild Sky is unusually accessible because of its low elevation, and it \nis near an urban area. So families looking for a quick and easy access \nto nature are going to be able to enjoy this very pristine land. \nClimbers and hikers, hunters and anglers have already sent us letters \nand e-mails talking about the opportunities that Wild Sky offers.\n  Mark Heckert, who is a fish and wildlife biologist from Puyallup, \nwrote to me that he has taken his two sons to camp and hunt and fish in \nthis area. He wrote me about how much he values the outdoors and said \nhe hopes to secure the Wild Sky Wilderness for his children to enjoy. \nHe said to me:\n\n       Wild landscapes like those provided in the Wild Sky provide \n     the stage for a generational right of passage where young \n     boys and girls can discover their connection to our land.\n\n  Creating this Wild Sky Wilderness is going to ensure that Mark and \nhis sons can return to Wild Sky in the years to come.\n  Finally, Madam President, hikers, climbers, rafters, hunters, and \nanglers who visit us in the Puget Sound area--and I invite everyone who \nis listening to come and enjoy Wild Sky--will spend their money as they \ntravel through this area. Recreational enthusiasts will see Wild Sky in \nthe future listed on maps and guide books as a special destination, and \nthose tourists will come and stay in our hotels and our campgrounds and \neat in our restaurants and use local guides and outfitters.\n  In recent years, the outdoor recreation business appears to have \nstayed healthy, even during bad economic times, and Wild Sky is going \nto help contribute to that in the future. And, again, I invite all who \nare listening to come and enjoy this beautiful place that you saw get \nvoted on here in the Senate this afternoon.\n  Madam President, those are just a few of the benefits of this Wild \nSky Wilderness. We have done a lot of hard work on this bill in the \nlast 8 years, and we couldn't have done it without the help of a lot of \npeople. So let me take the last few minutes and thank all of the people \nacross my State and here in the Senate who have worked so hard to get \nthis bill done.\n  I thank Chairman Bingaman and his great staff, especially Bob Simon \nand David Brooks, for their help and their unwavering support of Wild \nSky throughout all the years.\n  I thank Senator Domenici, who is leaving us this year to retire. \nWithout him and his hard work on this bill, we wouldn't be here today.\n  I thank Senators Crapo and Murkowski for all they did over the past \nweeks and months to move this package forward. I couldn't have gotten \nhere--we couldn't have gotten here--without their hard work.\n  I thank many of my staff members, especially Doug Clapp, who helped \nme originally develop this bill many years ago; Jaime Shimek, Evan \nSchatz, and Mike Spahn. I can't even begin to say all the names of my \nstaff members who over the years have worked with us as we have \ndeveloped this bill and gotten it over the finish line. I thank all of \nthem.\n  I recognize the hard work and support of Congressman Larsen and his \nstaff, Senator Cantwell and her staff. She is on the Senate floor this \nafternoon as well and serves on the committee. I could not have done it \nwithout her help and support. I know she has climbed into the Wild Sky \nand seen it as well as I have and is as excited as I am to be out there \nto see this completed.\n  I thank Under Secretary Mark Rey of the administration, who supported \nthis bill for many years.\n  But above all, Madam President, I thank the people of my home State \nof Washington who have worked tirelessly to bring this idea from a \nproposal on a\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\npiece of paper 9 years ago to legislation that was passed in the Senate \nthis afternoon.\n  I am going to be back when the President signs this bill into law and \nthank a broader list of people who have been so essential, but as I \nfinish this afternoon I want to note the work of Tom Uniack and Mike \nTown, and I thank them personally for all their work. They have been so \nwilling to listen and to answer questions and to give tours of the Wild \nSky country and have worked with us every step of the way.\n  Tom and Mike, thank you. All your hard work has paid off, and we now \nhave passed in the Senate a very popular bill.\n  Wild Sky is going to help my State take a great step forward in \nprotecting our environment. It is going to enhance our economy, it is \ngoing to improve our recreational opportunities, and I can tell you, \npeople from my State are eager to get this bill through the House \nquickly and on to the President's desk to be signed.\n  We took a major step forward toward this goal today, and, again, I \ninvite all of you who are listening to come to the State of Washington \nand visit Wild Sky.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to speak a few minutes about \nthe public lands bill we just voted out of the Senate with a pretty \nresounding majority of Members.\n  Within that public lands bill we just voted on is the only wilderness \ndesignation, the one my colleague from Washington just described--the \nWild Sky Wilderness area. And I am here to not only congratulate her on \nthis important legislation but to also speak because so much was said \nprior to the vote about why we would have such legislation on the \nSenate floor, and about the issue of Federal lands in individual \nStates.\n  I think my colleague from Washington just articulated exactly why \nsuch an important piece of legislation is needed, the fact that it is \nthe designation of a wilderness area that she has been trying to get \never since I have been in the Senate. In fact, she mentioned 9 years \nshe has been working on that legislation. Since at least 2001, I have \nseen this legislation in various forms move through either the House or \nthe Senate. I am sure her enthusiasm today is about the prospect of the \nSenate and the House, under Democratic control, actually getting this \nlegislation passed.\n  But let me make a couple of points because my colleague, Senator \nMurray, brought up this issue, the specifics of Wild Sky's designation. \nIt is a beautiful place. I have had the opportunity to hike there and \nto see the beauty firsthand. But people don't understand the \ndesignation of these Federal lands. I will say right now that I know \nhow much Federal land is in Washington State. We have 12.2 million \nacres out of over 42 million acres. That is 29 percent of our State. I \nunderstand other States may not like that kind of designation, but for \nus in Washington State it has been part of our lifestyle and part of \nwhat we want to preserve.\n  In fact, Mount Rainier, one of our most visited special places, over \n1 million people visit it on an annual basis. And a little company some \npeople may have heard of, REI, based in Seattle, has outdoor \nrecreational gear and does about $1 million worth of business annually. \nSo there are people who very much believe in the outdoors.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer knows very well that the beauty of \nspecial places is worth preserving, and it is a great boon to our \neconomy.\n  Senator Murray did an unbelievable job in shepherding this \nlegislation through the Senate and working with her colleague in the \nHouse, Congressman Larsen, now for 7 years. There were many times in \nwhich she could have gotten detoured by various Members. Actually, this \nhas passed three times in the Senate on the consent calendar but has \nbeen either delayed in the House or a Member held it up, and really \nheld up an opportunity for many people to enjoy what our State has, in \na very bipartisan way, been supporting.\n  In Washington State, many people are conservationists. Before they \nare Republicans or Democrats or Independents, they are conservationists \nfirst. Senator Murray has had to persevere with this legislation \nthrough various individual Members holding it up. So I say a special \nthanks to her. And I know if Scoop Jackson were alive, Scoop Jackson \nwould be here to also congratulate her, as someone who did the original \nwilderness designation. She would be very honored to know that someone \nsuch as Scoop, in writing this original legislation, had the issues of \nWild Sky very much in mind.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 3 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I want to also mention another piece \nof the underlying legislation because, again, some people have \nquestioned, why do a public lands bill of this nature. Another piece of \nthis legislation that I have worked on with my colleague, Congressman \nInslee of Bainbridge Island in our State, is to preserve an area known \nas the Eagledale Ferry Dock site on Bainbridge Island as a unit of the \nnational monument designation under our national park system.\n  People may say, well, why designate this particular area? During \nWorld War II, over 120,000 Japanese Americans were forced into \ninternment camps, and the first place from which they were forced to \nleave and to go to the internment camps was from this site on \nBainbridge Island in Washington State. On March 30, 1942, 227 residents \nof Bainbridge Island were asked to report to this ferry dock site and \nwere taken to internment camps in Minidoka, ID, and Tule Lake in \nnorthern California.\n  So this is what this lands bill is about. It is about protecting \nwilderness and making designations of sites that should be remembered. \nSo I am very proud we got this bill off the floor, and I hope we will \nsee immediate action by the House.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2919-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2919-S2933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATIONS OF BRIAN STACY MILLER, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS; JAMES RANDAL HALL, TO BE UNITED \n STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA; JOHN A. \nMENDEZ, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF \nCALIFORNIA; STANLEY THOMAS ANDERSON, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n  FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE; AND CATHARINA HAYNES, TO BE \n      UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT OF TEXAS.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Brian Stacy \nMiller, of Arkansas, to be United States District Judge; James Randal \nHall, of Georgia, to be United States District Judge; John A. Mendez, \nof California, to be United States District Judge; Stanley Thomas \nAnderson, of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge; and \nCatharina Haynes, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I am honored to recommend Brian Miller \nfor confirmation as a Federal judge of the Eastern District of \nArkansas.\n  Without hesitation, the Judiciary Committee confirmed Judge Miller on \nMarch 6. During the confirmation process, they learned what many \nArkansans already know--Judge Miller has presided and will continue to \npreside with impartiality and integrity.\n  In my mind, Judge Miller has all the tools to be a great judge. I \nhave reviewed his work and have been impressed with his record. His \nbroad range of experience in civil and criminal matters, representing \nboth sides of the law, is extraordinary. He exemplifies the proper \ncredentials as well as\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nthe temperament the people of Arkansas can be comfortable with.\n  I have heard validation from colleagues and acquaintances on the \nArkansas bar and throughout the legal community. When Judge Miller's \nname began to circulate for this nomination, I only received praise \nfrom his colleagues. In fact, it is one of the few occasions when I did \nnot hear a single person criticize his possible nomination.\n  While this body has seen more than its share of polarizing nominees, \nJudge Miller is the rare exception. He brought integrity and \nimpartiality to the bench while serving on the Arkansas Court of \nAppeals and earlier as a city judge for both Holly Grove and Helena, \nAR. His work as the deputy prosecuting attorney for Philips County has \nalso been praised.\n  Before practicing law in private practice for 9 years, Judge Miller \nearned his law degree from Vanderbilt University Law School. He \ngraduated with honors from the University of Central Arkansas and \nPhillips Community College of the University of Arkansas. Even before \nserving on the bench, Mr. Miller was serving our Nation in the Navy and \nthe Navy Reserve from 1985 to 1992.\n  Judge Miller has big shoes to fill following the service of the late \nGeorge Howard, Jr. I am confident, however, these shoes will fit Judge \nMiller quite well.\n  Madam President, I also want to add my appreciation for the Judiciary \nCommittee and Judiciary Committee staff on both sides because they \nworked very quickly on this nomination. What I said in my statement is \nabsolutely true, and the more people are exposed to Brian Miller, the \nmore impressed they are with him as a person and as a judge. He really \ndoes have a distinguished and exemplary record in Arkansas, but he also \nis a fine man. I think Judge Miller will be a great judge.\n\n  I mentioned George Howard, who was an outstanding judge in the \nEastern District of Arkansas for a long time and really paved the way \nin a lot of ways for a lot of lawyers in our State.\n  Judge Miller will be in that same vein. If possible, he could even be \nbetter. He is a person who comes to this nomination with a lot of \ncredentials and a lot of support from the legal community in Arkansas. \nAs I said a minute ago, I don't think we have heard one person in our \nwhole State who has come out against his nomination. He is that good. \nWe are so pleased the President nominated him.\n  I also thank my colleague and friend on the House side, Congressman \nJohn Boozman, who was instrumental in pushing this nomination, getting \nit to the White House and pushing it through the White House, and \ngetting it over here to the Senate. It truly has been a team effort.\n  Judge Miller is from Senator Lincoln's hometown. She feels a special \nconnection to him, as she should; her family and his family have been \nfriends for a long time.\n  Certainly, I am very proud and honored to recommend him to my \ncolleagues to sit on the Federal bench for the Eastern District of \nArkansas.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum, with the time being equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, while the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas is on the floor, I think it appropriate to comment. I believe \nthe nominee of whom he has spoken is well qualified for the position. \nMr. Brian Stacy Miller graduated with honors from the University of \nCentral Arkansas in 1992. He has a law degree from Vanderbilt, has a \ndistinguished record in private practice, served as city attorney, was \ndirector of some very important organizations, and received a unanimous \n``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association.\n  I will abbreviate my presentation at this time, but I believe the \nSenator from Arkansas and his colleague have brought us a good nominee, \nas is the Senator's custom.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his resume printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Brian Stacy Miller\n\n\n   United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas\n\n       Birth: 1967, Pine Bluff, Arkansas.\n       Legal Residence: Arkansas.\n       Education: B.S., with honors, University of Central \n     Arkansas, 1992.

I yield the floor, and I await the arrival of the \ndistinguished chairman to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are not.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Chair. I will be brief because I know \nMembers of the Senate are anxious to make their weekend plans, but I \ncome to the floor to thank Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for \nreporting out these judges today--in particular, for reporting out \nRandy Hall of Augusta, GA.\n  We were very pleased to recommend Randy to the President of the \nUnited States, very pleased the President decided to nominate him, and \nparticularly pleased the Judiciary Committee is giving this Senate a \nchance to confirm a fine jurist to the bench in the Southern District \nof Georgia.\n  Prior to this nomination, Randy Hall served in the Georgia State \nSenate from District 22, which incorporates all of Augusta, GA, which \nis the No. 1 location on the map today with the Masters starting its \nfirst round. Randy is a distinguished attorney, with expertise in real \nestate, banking, corporate matters, and commercial litigation. He has a \nreputation for absolute integrity and character. He is a native of \nAugusta, which is important to many because this is the heart of the \ndistrict.\n  He graduated from Augusta College in 1979 and from the University of \nGeorgia College of Law in 1982. He serves on the Augusta-Richmond \nCounty Community Partnership for Children and Families and attends the \nTrinity on the Hill United Methodist Church.\n  Randy Hall is an outstanding Georgian, outstanding American, \nqualified jurist, and I commend him to the Members of the Senate for \nhis confirmation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. While the distinguished Senator from Georgia is on the \nfloor, I compliment him for the selection of James Randal Hall for the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. I have \nreviewed his academic record, which is excellent--a bachelor's degree \nfrom Augusta College, a J.D. from the University of Georgia School of \nLaw. He has exceptional activities. In 2001, he received the \nOutstanding Family and Children's Advocate Award, and in 2004 he \nreceived the Outstanding Advocacy Award from the Community Mental \nHealth Center of East Central Georgia. He has a substantial majority \n``well qualified'' rating by the American Bar Association, and I think \nhe has the potential to be an outstanding U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of Georgia. I am pleased to endorse him and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a fuller statement of his resume \nprinted in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           James Randall Hall\n\n\n   United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia\n\n       Birth:1958, Augusta, Georgia.\n       Legal Residence: Georgia.\n       Education: B.A., Augusta College, 1979.

I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as many of \nmy other colleagues have, to support Judge Brian Miller, who has been \nnominated to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of our \nState of Arkansas. As the senior Senator from Arkansas, I am very \npleased to support Mr. Miller for this very important post.\n  After reviewing his record and speaking with many of his friends and \ncolleagues in Arkansas, I can assure my colleagues in the Senate that \nBrian Miller is not only a superb lawyer and a public servant, he is \nalso a trusted friend who is held in high regard by so many in our \ngreat State.\n  Mr. Miller is a native of Helena, AR, which also happens to be my \nhometown. After high school, Brian Miller continued his education, \ngraduating from the University of Central Arkansas in 1992. He \ncontinued his education by earning a law degree from Vanderbilt \nUniversity, and one of the other great distinctions and certainly, I \nguess, pieces of pride I have about Mr. Miller is that Brian also had \nthe distinction of serving as one of the first interns for my office in \nthe House of Representatives in the summer of 1993.\n  Brian began his professional career up the Mississippi River, in \nMemphis, TN, at the firm of Martin Tate Morrow & Marston. In 1998, \nBrian ran a successful campaign to be the city attorney for our \nhometown of Helena. While he served as city attorney, his father also \nserved as mayor. He continued to work part time with his firm in \nMemphis until January 2007, when he was selected by then-Governor Mike \nHuckabee to be a State appellate judge.\n  Throughout his career, Judge Miller has been no stranger to the \ncourtroom. In addition to the positions mentioned above, he also was \nappointed deputy prosecuting attorney for Phillips County. In fact, \nbetween January 1999 and January 2006, Brian spent 3 days a week, every \nweek, in the courtroom, either in his capacity as a prosecutor or on \nbehalf of his clients. He has a reputation for being a tough but fair \nlitigator, who is a respected prosecutor and a tireless advocate. He \nhas received overwhelming support from the legal community all around \nour great State of Arkansas for his nomination.\n  When evaluating lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, I always \ncarefully consider a nominee's skills, their experience, their \nintellect and ability to understand and ably to apply established \nprecedent. Fundamentally, I am interested in knowing a nominee can \nfulfill this responsibility under the Constitution to apply the law \nfairly, without political favor or bias. I am absolutely satisfied \nBrian has met that standard.\n  I would be remiss, however, if I didn't also recognize Judge George \nHoward, Jr., who served on the bench for nearly 27 years. This is the \nseat Judge Miller will be taking. Judge Howard was a true pioneer. His \nmany contributions to civil rights and to the legal community made a \nlasting impact on Arkansas and our Nation. I was proud to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Pryor last year that honored Judge Howard's \nlegacy by naming the Federal building and the courthouse in Pine \nBluffs, AR, as the ``George Howard, Jr. Federal Building and \nCourthouse.'' Judge Miller certainly knows that, following Judge \nHoward, he certainly does have big shoes to fill, but I am confident he \nwill serve Arkansas and this Nation with distinction for years to come.\n  In closing, I thank the majority leader and the Republican leader, \nalso Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter and the entire Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for working with Judge Miller, for working with my staff and \nwith me to move this nomination forward. We have a great opportunity in \nJudge Miller. He is, as I said, a tremendous judicial nominee, but he \nis also a great citizen. And not coming from the legal world, as many \nof my colleagues do, this is an occasion where I actually happen to \nknow someone personally for one of these judicial nominations in whom I \nhave great confidence. I have a feeling of overwhelming pride that this \nyoung man, who not only interned in my House office but grew up in the \nsame hometown I did, could come before the Senate and be nominated and \nconfirmed.\n  I thank all the staff, as I said, of the Judiciary Committee, and the \nmajority leader, Chairman Leahy, and Senator Specter. I have full faith \nand confidence in Mr. Miller's ability. I do encourage Members of this \nbody to support this confirmation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I see the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nI would like to ask, through the Chair, if it would be appropriate to \nmake a few remarks about the judicial nominee from Tennessee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire how much time the Senator from Tennessee \nwould like? We are limited to no more than an hour.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Take whatever time you need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I rise to thank and congratulate \nPresident Bush and to thank Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter for \nbringing to the Senate floor the nomination of Tom Anderson to be a \nU.S. district judge for the Western District of Tennessee.\n  I would offer three reasons why Judge Anderson's nomination to serve \nas a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Tennessee is an \nespecially worthy one and one that I hope today will receive approval \nby the entire Senate.\n  First, Tom Anderson is already a judge. In 2003, the Federal district \njudges of the Western District of Tennessee selected Tom Anderson \nunanimously as a U.S. magistrate judge following a merit process that \nincluded more than three dozen applicants.\n  I see the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has arrived. I would \nsay to Senator Leahy, I am in the midst of about a 3- or 4-minute talk \nabout the judicial nominee from Tennessee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As I said before he came, I greatly appreciate the \nfact that Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter held a hearing, which \nincluded Tom Anderson, and that the Judiciary Committee sent his \nnomination to the full Senate with a favorable recommendation.\n  As I was saying, the first reason to support him is that he is \nalready a judge. In 2003, the Federal district\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\njudges of western Tennessee selected Tom Anderson unanimously as a U.S. \nmagistrate judge following a merit process that included more than \nthree dozen applicants.\n  Second, Tom Anderson has been first chair on more than 200 cases \ntried in Federal court and has earned extraordinary respect from \nlawyers and judges in Tennessee. For example, Senior District Judge Tom \nHiggins drove more than 100 miles from Nashville to Tom Anderson's \ninvestiture ceremony as a magistrate judge in Jackson in 2003 to \ncommend Anderson's practice as an attorney.\n  Judge Higgins' unsolicited appearance for Judge Anderson was \nconsidered by all those in attendance as a great compliment to Tom \nAnderson's professionalism. I know Judge Higgins very well, as do other \nmembers of the bar in Tennessee. If he had thought Tom Anderson would \nhave been a bad judge and had been a less than professional lawyer, \nJudge Higgins would have driven 200 miles from Nashville to make a \nspeech in the other direction. So it was an enormous compliment to Tom \nAnderson that Judge Higgins would have driven to Jackson and made such \na speech.\n  So impressed was I with that speech of Judge Higgins that I am \nsubmitting a transcript of Judge Higgins' remarks from that ceremony on \nJanuary 16, 2004. I ask unanimous consent that it be included in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Prior to serving on the bench, Tom Anderson spent \nnearly 20 years in private practice. In addition to his extensive \nlitigation experience, he also served as an administrative law judge \nfor the Tennessee Claims Commission and as an assistant commissioner \nfor the Tennessee Department of Transportation.\n  Finally, although Judge Anderson has been nominated by a Republican \nPresident, he has strong support also from Tennessee Democrats. A \nnumber of west Tennessee Democrats wrote to the Judiciary Committee to \nurge confirmation of Judge Anderson, including State Senator Roy \nHerron; Charles Farmer, the former mayor of Jackson; James Strickland, \nJr., the former chairman of the Memphis/Shelby County Democratic Party; \nTommy Green, the chairman of the Tennessee Municipal League; and Mike \nMcWherter, a prominent local businessman and son of former Democratic \nGovernor Ned McWherter.\n  It is worth noting that Mike McWherter, who lives in Jackson, also \nhad formed an exploratory committee to challenge me in this year's race \nin the Senate before deciding to spend more time with his family. So \nJudge Anderson's nomination is one issue that would have united both \nparties' candidates on the campaign trail if Mike McWherter had decided \nto be a candidate for the Senate.\n  This deep reservoir of good will for Judge Anderson in Tennessee \nreflects the fact that he is experienced, fairminded, and well \nrespected. He is also a husband and father of three who has been active \nin the community, including having served as a board member of the \nMethodist Hospital in Lexington and the Carl Perkins Child Abuse Center \nin Jackson, as well as helping to establish the Beech River Branch of \nthe YMCA in Lexington and serving as its first chairman of the board.\n  Again, I congratulate the President, and I thank Chairman Leahy and \nSenator Specter and the full Judiciary Committee for reporting this \nnomination to the floor and setting it for a vote this afternoon.\n  I hope the entire Senate will agree with their judgment and confirm \nhim before Chief Judge James Todd, who has served with distinction in \nthis position, takes senior status.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Remarks of Senior Judge Thomas A. Higgins\n\n\nexcerpted from transcript of investiture of j. thomas anderson as u.s. \n             magistrate judge western district of tennessee\n\n                           (January 16, 2004)\n\n       JUDGE TODD: Thank you, Judge Pham.\n       The court now recognizes a special guest. This is Judge \n     Thomas A. Higgins. He is a senior judge in the Middle \n     District of Tennessee in Nashville. He didn't wear his black \n     dress today, but I can assure you that Judge Higgins is, in \n     fact, a judge. He has helped us in West Tennessee with some \n     of our cases, and we consider him to be an honorary West \n     Tennesseean.\n       Judge Higgins.\n       JUDGE HIGGINS: May it please the court and ladies and \n     gentlemen, two years ago, as Judge Todd alluded to, I was \n     designated and assigned by the Chief Judge of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to sit in the \n     Western District of Tennessee while this court was awaiting \n     the appointment and confirmation of a full complement of \n     judges to the court, and I tried cases in Memphis and here in \n     Jackson. In fact, I held court in the courtroom that is to be \n     assigned to Judge Anderson.\n       During the luncheon recesses during a lengthy trial, a jury \n     trial that I presided over here in Jackson, I would take a \n     tour of downtown Jackson, and I made an important discovery. \n     I learned that the gold standard for public speaking was \n     established here in Jackson in 1831. On the north side of the \n     Madison County Courthouse there's a marker that commemorates \n     the fact that Davy Crockett was defeated for reelection to \n     the Congress. He addressed the voters of Jackson and West \n     Tennessee and told them, and I quote, ``You can go to hell. \n     I'm going to Texas.'' Now, that's the gold-plated standard \n     for making public remarks.\n       And in that vein, I want to share with you what I wrote to \n     Judge Todd on July the 17th when I learned that Mr. Anderson \n     was being considered for the position of United States \n     Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. And I \n     quote, ``This is good news for you, the chief judge, and the \n     judges of the United States District Court for the Western \n     District of Tennessee and for the litigants and public at \n     large, I know Mr. Anderson well. He is an experienced and \n     superb lawyer and a perfect gentleman. As an advocate, he \n     represents his clients ably and with great zeal. As an \n     officer of the court, he is  punctual in every respect. When \n     he says something is so, it is so. If he is not familiar \n     with the case, he will make that clear to the court and \n     not try to bluff his way through. In sum, he is the kind \n     of a lawyer that any judge is comfortable having around \n     him and in the courtroom.''\n        Now, what is the basis upon which those assertions were \n     made? The basis is this. For a period of over ten years, I \n     have watched Mr. Anderson's work as a lawyer in the courtroom \n     first-hand. He has tried more jury cases before me than any \n     other single judge.\n        Now, why is that, a West Tennessee lawyer? Well, he was \n     employed by a client that would send him to close and distant \n     places. I handle all the cases in the Columbia division of \n     the Middle District of Tennessee, and I go to Columbia every \n     other month to hold court on the trailer docket.\n        Mr. Anderson has selected as many as three juries on the \n     same day and tried three jury cases back-to-back with three \n     sets of clients out in the hall and three sets of witnesses. \n     We would select one jury. I would instruct the jury and tell \n     the jury when to come back, the following week, two or three \n     days. We would select the second jury, and I would instruct \n     that jury and then tell them to come back Monday or Tuesday \n     of the following week. And we'd select a third jury and then \n     on the selection of that third jury, we would start \n     immediately to the trial of that case.\n        Now, he's a real lawyer. And he's got enormous energy and \n     willingness to work, and I don't' believe that the court \n     could have selected a finer lawyer with more experience. And \n     I told Judge todd in this same letter that ``I am convinced \n     that his appointment as a magistrate judge will be received \n     with the highest praise by his colleagues in the Western \n     District of Tennessee.'' And I'm satisfied that that will \n     prove to be the case.\n        Now, following the rule that Davy Crockett established, I \n     only have this to day, Judge Todd. I congratulate the judges \n     of the Western district of Tennessee in selecting Mr. \n     Anderson. I congratulate Mr. Anderson upon his appointment. \n     And I believe the expectations of the court will be fully \n     fulfilled.\n        I have two other observations to make. One, there is a \n     section in Title 28, United States Code, that makes it a high \n     misdemeanor for any justice or judge of the United States to \n     engage in the practice of law. I suggest to you that you \n     ought not to touch that case topside or bottom. It's the only \n     offense under federal law that is characterized as a high \n     misdemeanor. And it's obvious that the Congress intended to \n     make it an impeachable offense for a justice or judge to \n     engage in the practice of law.\n        And the last observation is to enjoy today. Take in all \n     the applause. Soak it up and enjoy the day. There's a lot of \n     misery ahead of you. There are going to be a lot of restless \n     nights, and there won't be another day like this until your \n     portrait is presented. So make the best of the day.\n        Thank you, Judge.\n        JUDGE TODD: Thank you, Judge Higgins.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to thank my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. As the Senator knows, he came to chat with me about \nthis nominee. I was not aware of him. But as soon as he did, I pulled \nthe file, looked at him, and I think we put him on for a hearing very \nshortly thereafter.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I have respected his opinion and \nhis\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nviews for years, whether he was in the Cabinet or here, and was happy \nto in this case. I also wish to thank him for the kind words he said \nabout me, as well as those of Senator Isakson and Senator Lincoln and \nSenator Pryor.\n  Mr. President, I have a longer statement to make, but I understand \nthe distinguished Republican leader wishes to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I yield to the distinguished leader \nwithout losing my right to the floor, if that is agreeable to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Post-Petraeus Wrap Up\n\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, Americans were vividly reminded this \nweek that, as our Nation struggles to help Iraq on its way to becoming \na stable country that can defend itself and be an ally in the war on \nterror, we are fortunate to have men like Ambassador Ryan Crocker and \nGen. David Petraeus representing us in Baghdad. Their commitment, \ndetermination, and skill in seeing America's interests promoted and \npreserved remind us that public service is a high calling, and that \ngood men and women are still answering that call in heroic ways.\n  Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus outlined to the Congress and \nthe country the complex challenges they confront every day in advancing \nour strategic interests in the Persian Gulf. Their patience and \nprofessionalism in doing so was commendable. And it was an important \nreminder to all of us that the men and women serving in Iraq are well \nled.\n  We were reminded this week that less than a year after the \ncounterinsurgency plan went into full effect, the security situation in \nIraq has improved dramatically. Overall violence is down. Civilian \ndeaths are down. Sectarian killing is down. Attacks on American forces \nare dramatically down. And, as a result of all this, General Petraeus \nwas recently able to recommend to the President that our forces be \ndrawn down to the pre-surge level of 15 brigade combat teams by July of \nthis year.\n  None of us should underestimate the complexity of managing this draw-\ndown. The logistical challenges involved in transporting soldiers and \nequipment safely and in large numbers are immense, as are the \noperational challenges involved in repositioning the remaining force in \na way that keeps pressure on al-Qaeida in Iraq while continuing to \nprotect the Iraqi people. But neither should we underestimate the \nimpact the surge has had in delivering security gains, allowing for a \nresponsible drawdown of thousands of U.S. servicemembers, and in \nallowing for the transition of our mission in Iraq, a transition that \nhas already begun.\n  As part of this ongoing transition, the President announced earlier \ntoday that he has accepted General Petraeus's recommendation to allow \nfor a 45-day period of evaluation and consolidation once the drawdown \nof surge brigades is complete.\n  Encouragingly, the President also announced that Admiral Mullen and \nSecretary Gates will now be able to reduce the tour lengths of soldiers \ndeploying to Iraq from 15-month to 12-month periods. This change in \npolicy will increase the amount of time our soldiers and marines are \nable to spend at home between deployments, a welcome and richly \ndeserved acknowledgment of the service and sacrifice of the greatest \nfighting force on Earth.\n  As U.S. soldiers and marines return home, they can be proud of the \nwork they have done these last months. In addition to a decrease in \nviolence, U.S. forces have paved the way for a corresponding increase \nin the size and the scope of the Iraqi Security Forces.\n  This so-called ``surge'' of Iraqi Security Forces is three to four \ntimes larger than our own: the Iraqi Army has ballooned by more than \n100,000 over the last year alone, and its ranks continue to expand. And \nlocal volunteer forces, the so-called ``Sons of Iraq,'' have swelled to \nnearly 100,000, a key factor in improved security at the provincial \nlevel. Their integration into the Iraq Security Forces is an important \nnext step.\n  Young Iraqis are signing up to join local police forces, to protect \nthe Iraqi border against incoming foreign fighters, and for special \noperations that will allow the Iraqis to track and kill high value \nterrorist targets on their own.\n  These are all encouraging signs. And we are also encouraged by the \npolitical progress in Iraq. Though significant political benchmarks \nremain unmet, progress on other significant benchmarks that seemed far \noff just a few months ago is underway.\n  The Iraqi Government is also beginning to show a new and welcome \nwillingness to shoulder more of the financial burden for their own \nsecurity and development. Iraq has committed, for instance, to \ngradually assume the salaries of the Sons of Iraq. And the Iraq C-130 \nplanes that were used to shuttle forces and supplies to Basra over the \nlast 2 weeks were built, of course, right here in America.\n  Overall, Iraq now covers three-fourths of the cost of its security \nforces. And we can now realistically expect the Iraqis at some point to \nassume the full cost of their own security.\n  On the development side, the Iraqis are also on a path to self-\nsufficiency. As of last month, Iraq had purchased more than $2 billion \nof goods and services from the U.S. The most recent Iraqi \nreconstruction budget vastly outspends the United States. And slowly \nbut surely, Iraq is approaching total financial control over large \nreconstruction projects.\n  As the Iraqis take over more of their own needs, Congress can help \naccelerate their path to independence by passing a supplemental \nappropriations bill that has been on request now for more than a year.\n  Our friends on the other side are rightly concerned about military \nreadiness. I share their concern. But the best way to ensure the \nmilitary's readiness is not to scrap a plan that has been working in \nIraq. The best way to ensure readiness is for Congress to quickly \napprove the Defense supplemental, without arbitrary withdrawal dates, \nand without nonsecurity spending. We also need to pass the regular DOD \nappropriations bill.\n  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker reminded us this week that \nprogress in Iraq is fragile and reversible, that much hard work lies \nahead. We are encouraged by the advances they detailed, but we are also \nsobered by the continuing short- and long-term challenges to our \ninterests in the Persian Gulf. We can't lose sight of the need to meet \nthese challenges.\n  We need to help Iraq defend itself against Iranian-backed special \ngroups as part of a broader effort to check Iran's apparent desire to \ndominate the gulf. And, in the best traditions of U.S. foreign policy, \nwe must continue to deal with the sad effects that decades of neglect \nby Saddam Hussein have visited on the Iraqi people.\n  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were clear about the \nchallenges we face. But they outlined a plan for continued progress \nthat is backed up by their achievements so far. They, and the Americans \nthey are fortunate to lead in Iraq, have brought us a good distance \nfrom where we were just 1 year ago. And this week they charted a \nrealistic course moving forward. Now it is time for the Senate to \ndemonstrate the same commitment and professionalism as these two men, \nby giving our forces in the field what they need.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Judge John A. Mendez to the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of California.\n  Let me begin by explaining the urgency of filling this judgeship. \nSimply stated, the Eastern District of California is in a crisis. In \n2005 and 2006, the district had the highest number of case filings in \nthe Nation. In 2007, the district ranked second out of all 94 Federal \njudicial districts in the number of new cases filed.\n  Regrettably, the bench in the Eastern District has been understaffed \nthroughout this period of heavy case filings. A temporary judgeship in \nthe district expired in 2004 because the Congress failed to extend it. \nAs a result, average caseloads in the Eastern District increased by 18 \npercent from 2004 through 2006, even as average caseloads nationwide \ndeclined.\n  In this Congress, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 1327, which \nwould recreate the temporary judgeship in the Eastern District. The \nbill has already\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\npassed the Senate and is currently pending in the House. I am also a \ncosponsor of S. 2774, which would create new judgeships to meet the \nneeds of California and other States throughout the Nation.\n  In addition to creating new judgeships, we clearly need to fill the \njudgeships that already exist in the Eastern District. Judge John \nMendez is the nominee for a seat that was vacated in June 2007.\n  Judge Mendez is a native Californian and is currently a judge on the \nSacramento County Superior Court. He was born in Oakland and graduated \nwith distinction from Stanford University, with a degree in political \nscience. He went on to earn a law degree at Harvard Law School.\n  After law school he returned to California and worked in private \npractice in San Francisco from 1980 to 1984. From February 1984 through \nJuly 1986, Judge Mendez served as an assistant U.S. attorney in San \nJose. He was assigned to the Criminal Division in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice and became a specialist in criminal law and procedure.\n  In 1986, Judge Mendez moved to Sacramento and returned to private \npractice. He focused on civil litigation and business litigation and \nrose to become a partner at the law firm of Downey, Brand, Seymour & \nRowher.\n  Judge Mendez was appointed as U.S. attorney in San Francisco in 1992, \nthe final year of George H.W. Bush's Presidency. He served as U.S. \nattorney for 1 year and was personally involved in major civil \nlitigation and a criminal appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  After leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office, Judge Mendez was of counsel \nto the law firm Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco from 1993 \nto 1995. In the summer of 1995 he returned to Sacramento and joined the \nfirm of Somach, Simmons & Dunn as a shareholder. His practice included \ncomplex commercial and environmental litigation and white-collar \ncriminal defense work, as well as counseling clients on regulatory \ncompliance.\n  Gov. Gray Davis recognized his potential as a judge in 2001 and \nappointed him to the Sacramento County Superior Court. Judge Mendez was \nelected to retain that position in 2002 and continues to serve as a \nsuperior court judge today.\n  In addition to his service to the State of California, Judge Mendez \nhas served the legal profession through leadership positions in the \nHispanic National Bar Association and the Sacramento Chapter of the \nFederal Bar Association.\n  In California we have developed a bipartisan process for selecting \nFederal district court nominees. Under this system a committee of \nlawyers known as the Parsky Commission, which includes Democrats and \nRepublicans, recommends qualified applicants to the President.\n  I am proud of this system and pleased to report that Judge Mendez was \nrecommended unanimously by the Parsky Commission to be nominated as a \nFederal district judge. By all accounts, he would make an excellent \naddition to the Federal bench in Sacramento.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of Judge Mendez.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the \nnomination of Judge Catharina Haynes to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. She is a very well-qualified and capable \nnominee to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which hears \nappeals from the Federal District Courts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nTexas.\n  Judge Haynes has extraordinary academic credentials. She graduated \nfirst in her class with a degree in psychology from the Florida \nInstitute of Technology at age 19, and she then finished second in her \nclass at Emory University School of Law at age 22. While in law school, \nshe also served on the Emory Law Journal.\n  Since graduating from law school, Judge Haynes has compiled a \ndistinguished record in private practice and as a State court judge.\n  In 1998, Judge Haynes was elected to be a district court judge in \nDallas, TX. Four years later, she was reelected to that same position. \nWhile she was running for reelection, the Dallas Morning News endorsed \nher and said of her: ``(She) has energy, intelligence and a strong \ncommitment to the law.'' They further added, ``She runs a fair, \nefficient court.''\n  While working as a trial court judge, Judge Haynes presided over 190 \njury trials and approximately 100 bench trials. She was able to dispose \nof over 7,000 cases related to a full range of civil topics including \ncomplex commercial disputes, commercial litigation, insurance issues, \npersonal injury, intellectual property matters, and employment \ndisputes.\n  Having recently concluded her time as a Dallas District Court Judge, \nJudge Haynes returned to private practice at the well-regarded national \nlaw firm of Baker Botts, LLP, where she is a partner working in the \nlitigation department.\n  While in private practice Judge Haynes has handled a wide range of \ncomplicated cases in before both State and Federal court. She has also \nargued cases before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the court to \nwhich she is nominated.\n  Judge Haynes has been heavily involved with the local bar \nassociations and has volunteered extensively in the community.\n  Judge Haynes has received numerous awards and professional honors, \nincluding the 2006 State Bar of Texas Presidential Commendation, 2006 \nFlorida Tech Alumni Association Outstanding Achievement Award, 2004 \nDallas Women Lawyers Association Louise B. Raggio Award, 2003 Dallas \nWomen Lawyers Association Outstanding Board Member Award, and 1996 and \n2002 Dallas Bar Association Jo Anna Moreland Outstanding Committee \nChair Award.\n  Her commitment to public service will serve her well on the Fifth \nCircuit and will reflect credit on the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the nomination of Catharina Haynes to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is being confirmed \ntoday by the Senate.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nCatharina Haynes to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have carefully reviewed \nJudge Haynes's confirmation hearing record. I asked Judge Haynes \nseveral questions in writing after her confirmation hearing in \nFebruary. I voted against her nomination in the committee last week, \nand I want to explain to my colleagues my reasons for voting against \nher today.\n  Let me begin by saying that I do admire Judge Haynes's commitment to \npublic service. She was elected to the bench in 1999 as a judge, 191st \nJudicial District Court, in Dallas County, TX. She was reelected to the \nbench in 2002 and lost her reelection bid in 2006. She now serves as a \npartner at Baker, Botts in Dallas, TX.\n  However, no one is entitled to a circuit court judgeship. In the vast \nmajority of cases, these courts are the final law of the land for the \nStates in their circuit when it comes to interpreting complex Federal \nstatutes and our Constitution. These judges have lifetime appointments \nand are second only to Supreme Court Justices in terms of their power \nand authority.\n  In reviewing her background, experience, confirmation hearing record, \nand her written responses to additional questions I posed to her, I am \nnot convinced that Judge Haynes is qualified for this position.\n  I start with the starkest fact about Judge Haynes's record: By her \nown admission, Judge Haynes has never written a single judicial \nopinion. In response to the Judiciary Committee questionnaire asking \nfor her opinions as a judge, she stated that she had none. She wrote \nthat ``[a]s a state district judge in Texas, I wrote orders (a few with \nexplanations), jury charges and findings of fact/conclusions of law, \nbut I did not write `published opinions' or `unpublished opinions'.''\n  A nominee for circuit court judge should have experience in writing \nsubstantive judicial opinions. Judge Haynes does not have this \nrequisite experience.\n  Judge Haynes, by her own admission, has very little experience with \ncriminal cases. According to her response to our committee \nquestionnaire, she stated that her percentage of practice in civil \nproceedings was 100 percent, and the percentage of her practice in \ncriminal proceedings was 0 percent. She also responded that as a judge \nin Dallas\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nCounty, TX, she heard civil cases, and her docket included almost \nexclusively civil cases.\n  A nominee for circuit court judge should have broad experience in \nboth criminal and civil cases. Her lack of any meaningful criminal law \nexperience does not give me confidence that she has a sufficient \nunderstanding of the criminal justice system and the rights of \ndefendants.\n  Judge Haynes, by her own admission, did not write opinions. Rather, \nshe wrote orders. Given that circuit court judges are often the final \nsay on the law of the land in a given circuit--due to the low rate of \ngranting certiorari by the Supreme Court--a circuit court judge has an \nunusual amount of authority and decisionmaking power.\n  We do not have any meaningful track record on which to judge Judge \nHaynes's views on substantive legal issues such as civil rights, civil \nliberties, worker's rights, reproductive freedom, environmental \nprotection, consumers' rights, employees' rights, or separation of \npowers.\n  Judge Haynes does not meet my test for Federal judicial nominees \nsince she does not have the requisite experience for a Federal \nappellate judge.\n  Finally, I want to talk about diversity. The U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit, which includes Mississippi, Louisiana, and \nTexas, presides over the largest percentage of minority residents, 44 \npercent--which includes African-American and Latino citizens--of any of \nthe regional circuit courts of appeal in the country outside of \nWashington, DC. Mississippi has the highest African-American \npopulation--36 percent--of any State in the country. Louisiana has the \nsecond largest African-American population--32 percent--of any State in \nthe country. It is disappointing that none of President Bush's \nnominations to the Federal bench in this circuit were African \nAmericans. Only one of the Federal judges that now sits on the Fifth \nCircuit is African American.\n  As Chairman Leahy stated at Judge Haynes's confirmation hearing, it \nwas the Fifth Circuit judges who took a lead role in tearing down Jim \nCrow society in the South and in implementing the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Indeed, the best known \nof these judges were four judges called the ``Fifth Circuit Four'' or \nsimply ``The Four'' by opponents of civil rights, in a reference to the \nFour Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Burke Marshall, the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy, told The \nNation in a 2004 interview that ``those four [Fifth Circuit] judges, I \nthink, have made as much of an imprint on American society and American \nlaw as any four judges below the Supreme Court have every done on any \ncourt . . . If it hadn't been for judges like that on the Fifth \nCircuit, I think Brown would have failed in the end.'' The Brown \ndecision and its progeny paved the way for equality in transportation, \nemployment, and so many other areas in the South. The Fifth Circuit \ndecisions on civil rights issues in the 1950s and 1960s affirmed by the \nSupreme Court helped to lay the groundwork for Congress to enact \nnational legislation to prohibit discrimination throughout the United \nStates, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights \nAct of 1965.\n  Mr. President, I recall the history of the Fifth Circuit because I \nwant to impress upon my colleagues the importance of this circuit in \nthe history of the country and the importance of this circuit today. We \nare still struggling today to guarantee civil rights to Americans today \nregardless of race. Too many Americans are still disenfranchised and \nunable to vote due to deceptive campaign practices targeted at scaring \naway minority voters. Too many Americans still face employment \ndiscrimination or unequal pay. Too many Americans are still treated \ndifferently because of the color of their skin.\n  These judges serve for lifetime appointments and will decide some of \nthe most fundamental legal and constitutional questions for the Fifth \nCircuit residents in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. I am not \nconvinced that Judge Haynes has either the experience or the proven \ntrack record on protecting civil rights and equal rights under the law \nfor this position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from \nVermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour 43 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 99 minutes 53 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is close enough; almost 100.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate turns to the consideration of another \nnomination for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench--Brian Stacy \nMiller for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Judge Miller currently \nserves as a State appellate judge on the Arkansas Court of Appeals. He \npreviously served as city judge in Holly Grove, AR, was a deputy \nprosecuting attorney for Phillips County, AR, and worked for several \nyears in private practice.\n  With this nomination, we continue our work toward building a more \nrepresentative Federal judiciary. I am pleased that, when confirmed, \nJudge Miller will be the 88th African-American currently serving on our \nFederal bench and the 74th African-American serving as a district court \njudge.\n  I thank Senators Pryor and Lincoln for their consideration of this \nnominee, and I thank Senator Feinstein for chairing the hearing on this \nnomination. I congratulate the nominee and his family on his \nconfirmation today.\n  Today the Senate also considers another nomination for a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal bench--Stanley Thomas Anderson for the \nWestern District of Tennessee. Judge Anderson is currently a magistrate \njudge for the Western District of Tennessee. He previously worked in \nprivate practice as the founder and owner of Anderson Law Firm in \nJackson, TN.\n  He served as a claims commissioner for the State of Tennessee \nDepartment of Treasury and as assistant commissioner for the Tennessee \nDepartment of Transportation. I acknowledge the support of Senators \nCorker and Alexander for this nomination. I congratulate the nominee \nand his family on his confirmation today.\n  Another nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench is \nthat of James Randal Hall for the Southern District of Georgia. Mr. \nHall is currently a partner at the Augusta, GA, law firm of Warlick, \nTritt, Stebbins & Hall.\n  He previously worked as corporate vice president and legal counsel \nfor Bankers First Corporation and worked in private practice for \nseveral other Georgia law firms. Mr. Hall held the distinction of \nserving the people of the 22nd District of Georgia as a State senator.\n  I acknowledge the support of Senators Chambliss and Isakson and thank \nSenator Feinstein for chairing the hearing on this nomination. I \ncongratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n  Then we turn to the consideration of yet another nomination for a \nlifetime appointment to the Federal bench--the nomination of John A. \nMendez for the Eastern District of California. Judge Mendez currently \nserves as a judge on the Sacramento County Superior Court. He \npreviously served as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of \nCalifornia and worked in private practice.\n  With this nomination, we continue our work toward building a more \nrepresentative Federal judiciary. I am pleased that, when confirmed, \nJudge Mendez will be the 58th Hispanic judge currently serving on our \nFederal bench and would become the only currently active Hispanic judge \nin the Eastern District of California.\n  I thank Senators Feinstein and Boxer for their support of this \nnomination. I congratulate the nominee and his family on his \nconfirmation today.\n  Mr. President, the Senate makes significant progress today by \nconfirming yet another appointment to one of our important Federal \ncircuit courts as well as four lifetime appointments of Federal \ndistrict court nominations. The circuit court nomination we are \nconsidering is that of Judge Catharina Haynes of Texas. Her \nconfirmation will fill the very last vacancy on the important court of \nappeals for the Fifth Circuit, but it is also a vacancy that has been \nlisted as a judicial emergency.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n  I acknowledge the support of Senator Cornyn and his work with me to \nschedule her nomination. Senator Cornyn had the time to sit down and \nexplain why she was important and brought her to my attention and \nhelped me report it from the Judiciary Committee last week. I imagine \nJudge Haynes' first phone call if confirmed this afternoon, as I \nexpect, will be to Senator Cornyn to say thank you.\n  Despite the progress we continue to make and will make today, some of \nthe rhetoric from the other side of the aisle suggests that judicial \nconfirmations is the most pressing and unsatisfied need facing our \ncountry. Now with an economic recession facing Americans, many would \nsay already here, the massive job losses this year, and the home \nmortgage foreclosures and credit, any partisan effort to create an \nissue over judicial confirmations is greatly misplaced, and the \nAmerican people can see through that facade.\n  The recent job loss reports from the Department of Labor are \ndramatic. In the first 3 months of this year the U.S. economy lost \n232,000 jobs. March marked the greatest loss of jobs during 1 month in \nat least 5 years. Instead of adding the 100,000 new jobs we would need \neach month to prevent unemployment from rising further, we have \nexperienced 3 months in a row of significant job losses. This year \nalone we are already half a million jobs behind where we need to be \njust to stay even and not lose economic ground.\n  Yet last week when I convened the Judiciary Committee to make \nprogress on bills to help homeowners in bankruptcy and to improve the \nFalse Claims Act to better target fraud, the priority of the \nRepublicans was none of these important legislative issues. Instead, \nthey engaged in a back and forth on judicial nominations. This \nadministration is apparently more worried about the jobs of a small \nhandful of controversial nominees--many, incidentally, who are not \nsupported by their home State Senators--than they are about the jobs \nand lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. With that massive loss \nof jobs, the Nation's unemployment rate has risen dramatically to over \n5.1 percent.\n  Let's take a look at where we are now. This is what has happened in \nthis Presidency. Unemployment has gone up more than 21 percent during \nthis Presidency. The price of gas has gone up more than 132 percent \nduring the Bush Presidency. The number of uninsured has gone up 11 \npercent during the Bush Presidency. The budget deficit has increased \n$590 billion, going from a quarter of a trillion dollar surplus to a \n$354 billion deficit. The trade deficit has gone up 87 percent. All \nthese things have gone up during the Bush Presidency. Meanwhile, \njudicial vacancies have gone down 46 percent, from 9.9 percent to 5.3 \npercent. And a lot of that, a significant part of that, happened during \na time when Democrats were in charge.\n  Just think about that. Now it costs more than a billion dollars a day \nto pay down the interest on the national debt and the massive cost of \nthe disastrous war in Iraq. Think about that, if you hear in your State \nyou have a bridge that is somewhat dangerous but they can't afford to \nfix it. Think about that in your State, when you are told that Federal \ndollars to help law enforcement protect Americans from crime is no \nlonger there because we have to send the money to the Iraqi police \nforce, a police force that cannot account for thousands of the weapons \nthat we gave them until some of them end up shooting at Americans. But \nsomehow that money has to go to fix up Iraq, and we do not have it to \nfix up America. It has to go to Iraq while we are paying almost $4 a \ngallon for gasoline, and Iraq has a huge budget surplus from $100-a-\nbarrel oil. They ask us to pay for the reconstruction, and to pay for \nit, we take the money from reconstructing America. That is a billion \ndollars a day, $365 billion this year that could be better spent not on \nIraq but on priorities such as health care for all Americans, better \nschools, fighting crime, treating diseases at home and abroad.\n  In contrast, one of the few numbers going down as the President winds \ndown his tenure is that of judicial vacancies. Judicial vacancies are \nless than half of what they were during the last Democratic \nadministration, when the Republican majority in the Senate chose to \nstall consideration of scores of nominees and maintained these \nvacancies, when they pocket filibustered over 60 of President Clinton's \nnominees. They succeeded in doubling the number of circuit court \nvacancies during those years and those vacancies rose to a high of 32 \nwith the resignations that accompanied the change of administration.\n  By contrast, Democrats have helped reduce circuit court vacancies \nacross the country to as low as 13 in 2007. That is going to be the \nnumber of remaining circuit court vacancies today, after the \nconfirmation of Judge Haynes. So that is half of what they were at the \nend of the last Democratic administration, when a Republican-led Senate \nwas in charge.\n  During the last Democratic administration, the Republican chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee argued that the 103 vacancies that then existed \ndid not constitute a vacancy crisis. I guess he meant that when you had \na Democratic President, it was not a crisis. He also argued on numerous \noccasions that 67 vacancies meant full employment on the Federal \ncourts, if you had a Democratic President. After today's confirmation, \nthe Administrative Office of U.S. Courts will list 47 vacancies. That \nis 20 below what Republicans used to deem full employment, below half. \nWe have cut in half the vacancy level they felt was appropriate for a \nDemocratic administration. In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee during President Bush's first term, we acted faster and more \nfavorably on more of this President's judicial nominees than any 17 \nmonths and either of the Republican chairmen who succeeded me.\n  During those 17 months the Senate confirmed 100 judicial nominations. \nWhen I reassumed the chairmanship last year, the committee and the \nSenate continued to make progress with the confirmation of 40 more \nlifetime appointments of judges to our Federal courts. That is more \nthan were confirmed during any of the 3 preceding years under \nRepublican leadership and certainly more than were confirmed in 1996, \n1997, 1999, and 2000. What is the difference? A Democratic-led Senate \ndid a lot better for a Republican President than a Republican-led \nSenate did for a Democratic President.\n  During this Presidency, while I have served as Judiciary chairman, \nthe Senate will have proceeded after today to confirm 145 lifetime \nappointments in only 3 years, compared to 158 during the more than 4 \nyears of Republican control. When the Senate confirms Judge Haynes \ntoday--here we are in April--we will have surpassed the total number of \ncircuit judges confirmed by Republicans during the entire 1996 session. \nIt was easy to do because a Republican majority refused to confirm even \none of President Clinton's circuit nominees, not one. Indeed, the first \nconfirmation of any judge that session didn't even take place until \nJuly 10, and that was a district court. So we are also 3 months ahead \nof the schedule followed by the Republican leadership during that \npresidential election year.\n  Some will undoubtedly repeat the partisan Republican talking point \nthat the Senate must confirm 15 circuit judges for Congress to match a \nmythical statistical average of selected years. God love those mythical \nstatistical averages. It is sort of like the man who puts one foot in \nboiling water and one foot in a block of ice and says: On average, I am \npretty darn comfortable.\n\n  Well, it is true that during the last 2 years of this President's \nfather's term, with a Democratic-led Senate, we confirmed an \nextraordinary number of circuit nominees: 20. It is true that during \nthe last 2 years of the Reagan administration, a Democratic-led Senate \nconfirmed 17 circuit court nominees. So what they are saying is, if we \nare going to use an average, we are going to use an average only when \nthe Democrats are in charge.\n  Maybe it would be different if after we set those high records--\nDemocrats with a Republican President--that even a little bit of that \nhad been reciprocated. Well, it was not. Instead, the Republican-led \nSenate, with a Democratic President, made sure that judicial vacancies \nskyrocketed to historic levels. It actually got to the point that Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, a conservative Republican, weighed in publicly to \ncriticize the Republican-led Senate.\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\n  Republicans do not talk about what they did. I do not believe they \ncan bear an accurate comparison of what we have accomplished and what \nthey did not.\n  So I wonder when the Republican leader and others who come to the \nfloor with accusations about slow-walking nominations will explain \ntheir roles during the Clinton years--especially the over 60 they \npocket filibustered, something joined by every Republican member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  Why was it that during the 1996 session--the end of President \nClinton's first term--the Republican-led Senate refused to confirm a \nsingle circuit nomination?\n  Why was it that Bonnie Campbell, the former attorney general of Iowa, \nwho was supported by both Senator Harkin, a Democrat, and Senator \nGrassley, a Republican, was never even allowed to be considered by the \nJudiciary Committee, to say nothing about the full Senate, after her \nhearing?\n  Why was it that Kent Markus, of Ohio, a law professor, a former high-\nranking Department of Justice official, who was supported by both his \nhome State senators--both Republicans, incidentally--was never \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee or this Senate?\n  Why was it that so many circuit vacancies were left without any \nnominees considered during the last years of the last Democratic \nadministration when Republicans controlled the Senate?\n  I remember one. When I asked them about that one, they said: Well, we \ncan't have her. We are not sure of her qualifications. That nominee is \nnow the dean of the Harvard Law School--one of the most prestigious \nlegal positions in America.\n  So Republican Senators have many questions to answer before they \nlevel accusations of any kind. To any objective observer, the answer is \nclear. The Republican Senate chose to stall consideration of circuit \nnominees and maintain vacancies during the Clinton administration in \nhopes they would have a Republican Presidency. Vacancies rose to over \n100. Circuit vacancies doubled. But as soon as a Republican President \nwas elected, they sought to turn the tables and take full advantage of \nthe vacancies they prevented from being filled. Well, they have been \nextraordinarily successful. Currently, more than 60 percent of active \njudges on the Federal circuit courts were appointed by Republican \nPresidents, and more than 35 percent have been appointed by this \nPresident.\n  Another way to look at their success and compare the better treatment \nshown to this President is to observe that the Senate has already \nconfirmed more than three-quarters of this President's circuit court \nnominees, compared to only half of President Clinton's circuit nominees \nconfirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate.\n  Now, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have turned the other \ncheek. I have worked hard to improve the treatment of nominees. To make \nprogress, I even chaired the Judiciary Committee's hearing on the \ncircuit nomination before us today during a congressional recess. I \nsaid that we would treat this President's nominees more fairly than the \nRepublicans treated President Clinton's, and we have. We have not \npocket filibustered more than 60 of this President's judicial nominees, \nas was done to President Clinton's nominees. We have not opposed them \nin secret or anonymously. In fact, during my chairmanship, the views of \nhome State senators, as reflected in the ``blue slips'' submitted to \nthe committee, were made public for the first time. No more secret \nholds. We did not allow that. We have considered nominations openly and \non the Record. We have proceeded with consideration of nominees whom I \nopposed, something that never happened under previous Republican \nleadership. If the Republican chairman opposed them, they never even \ngot a consideration.\n  I am glad we have Judge Haynes here because if she is confirmed, then \nthe Fifth Circuit will have no vacancies. I was almost worried whether \nshe would get here.\n  Even though she was already on the Judiciary Committee's agenda, she \nappeared at a political, partisan function at the White House, where \nthey were demanding that she be put on the agenda. Of course, she was \nalready there. It had been noticed for a couple days. Then, when we \nwere set to vote on her last week, Republicans almost filibustered her \nnomination. They talked so much, we virtually ran out of time, and I \nhad to keep this committee in an extra 10 minutes; otherwise, she would \nnot have been confirmed. It was then that I realized what was \nhappening--just like in February, when they refused to show up and make \na quorum throughout the whole month of February. If they had shown up, \nwe would have passed out a number of judges. But they were planning to \ngive speeches saying we are not passing out judges, so they would not \nshow up to make sure that happened.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, will the chairman yield?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the chairman.\n  I say to the Senator, I want to compliment you for the fairness in \nwhich you have conducted the confirmation process. It is interesting, \non the most controversial nominee we had, the vote was delayed at the \nrequest of the Republicans.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. CARDIN. We were prepared to vote. They wanted more time in order \nto get enough support to get that nominee out of the committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, they asked me several times, \nover a period of several weeks, to delay the vote.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I say to the Senator, I think you have been abundantly \nfair in scheduling these hearings. You mentioned Judge Haynes's \nconfirmation. I happen to oppose that nomination, but I have made no \nefforts at all to delay the consideration of that nomination, which has \nbeen true, I think, of all the members on our side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, who has been a tremendous help and a key member of our \ncommittee.\n  As I said before, if Judge Haynes is confirmed today, the Fifth \nCircuit will have no vacancies. We have proceeded despite the fact that \n12 of the 16 active judges on this court have been appointed by \nRepublican Presidents. I did this notwithstanding the fact that \nRepublicans blocked President Clinton's nominees. Judge Jorge Rangel, \nof Texas, Enrique Moreno, of Texas, and Alston Johnson, of Louisiana \nwere all blocked. They were told they could not even have hearings \nbecause it was a Democratic President. We have not done that. Every one \nof these circuit court nominees has had a hearing and a vote. In fact, \nI have held hearings on all six of the Fifth Circuit nominees of this \nPresident during my chairmanship. With today's vote, the Senate will \nhave voted on all of them.\n  Just understand this: Republicans would not hold hearings on \nPresident Clinton's nominees to that circuit. I have held hearings on \nthem, and we have voted on them all. And we will hear these crocodile \ntears on the other side that: Oh, woe is me, we are not getting any \ncircuit judges. Well, most of the time I have ignored it because it has \nbeen such balderdash that it is hard to think that anybody would \nbelieve it. But just in case somebody has been fooled by it, I thought \nwe would put the numbers in the Record.\n  In fact, vacancies on the Fifth Circuit are at an alltime low--zero \nafter today. Contrast this with the situation during the Clinton years, \nwhen the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared a circuit emergency \nbecause Republicans were pocket filibustering all of President \nClinton's nominees. That circuit-wide emergency was due to multiple, \nsimultaneous vacancies caused by the fact that the Republican-led \nSenate would not act on the nominees of a Democratic President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, without losing my right \nto the floor, I be allowed to yield to the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I so appreciate my friend yielding for me to \nsay a few words prior to these votes starting. Mr. President, if there \nis inadequate time, I will use my leader time. I think we do have an \nhour left on our side, so I think we have plenty of time. Is that \nright?\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the judge situation with me is very touchy. \nI have written a book. It will be coming out in a few weeks. In that \nbook, I have said--and as I have said a number of times on the floor--\nthe most important issue I ever worked on in all my political career is \nwhen the Republicans tried to turn the Constitution upside down with \ntheir so-called nuclear option. To think that they would throw away \nbasically having the Senate be the Senate. But they were willing to do \nthat until seven courageous Democrats and seven courageous Republicans \nstepped in and said: Enough is enough.\n  The person who has gotten all the abuse on our side is not me, not \nSenator Daschle; it has been the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  I want to do everything I can to process judges. I believe in \nquality, not quantity. We are going to do the very best we can. We have \na majority. It is very thin. We are going to treat the minority very \nfairly, as has been indicated in what my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, has said.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy for his work, not these last few months \nduring this year, not last year, but for his entire career in the \nJudiciary Committee, as the chairman and ranking member, which I have \nbeen able to watch up close. He has done a remarkably good job under \nvery difficult circumstances. How he was treated when he was in the \nminority is something the history books will recount as some of the low \ndays of the history of this institution.\n  Senator Leahy and I decided that it is not payback time. We were \ngoing to do to the Republicans what they did not do to us: treat them \nfairly. We have done that.\n  My friends have criticized the chairman for the pace of judicial \nconfirmations in this Congress. There is a Yiddish word for those \nRepublican complaints: ``chutzpah.'' What they have complained about is \nabsolutely without any foundation or basis--in fact, the gall to have \nthem do that.\n  Now, Mr. President, during the years President Clinton was sending \njudicial nominations to the Republican-controlled Senate, more than 60 \nqualified nominees were denied floor votes. The chairman referred to \nthem as pocket vetoes. Many were even denied a committee hearing. In \n1999, more than 6 months went by before Chairman Hatch agreed to \nprocess any judicial nominations.\n  As I have said many times, we should not hold a grudge. We are not \ndoing that. We should not live in the past. But as a result of the \nRepublican tactics during the Clinton years, some of the vacancies \nPresident Bush wants to fill are illegitimate vacancies--the seats are \nonly vacant because the Senate unreasonably withheld its consent to \nPresident Clinton's nominations. Republican complaints about the \ncurrent process must be considered in that light.\n  For example, one Clinton nominee--and there were lots we could use as \nexamples and talk about here--One Clinton nominee, a distinguished \nMissouri Supreme Court justice named Ronnie White, was defeated on a \nparty-line vote after Republicans accused him of being pro-criminal. \nPro-criminal. How do you like that? Another nominee, Elena Kagan, is \nnow the dean of the Harvard Law School. I don't know if Harvard is the \nbest law school in the country. I don't know if Yale is the best law \nschool in the country. I don't know if Stanford is the best law school \nin the country. But Harvard is a really good law school, and she is the \ndean of that law school. She was even denied a hearing because the \nRepublicans claimed the court to which she was nominated didn't have \nenough work to do. How about that?\n\n  So without going on more, other than to say the Republican record as \nto how it processed Clinton's nominees is dismal. Complaints about \nChairman Leahy should ring hollow, to say the least.\n  The fact is, 140 of President Bush's judicial nominations--90 percent \nof them--have been confirmed in the years the Democrats have been in \ncontrol of the Senate. Last year the Senate confirmed 40 judges, more \nthan during any of the 3 previous years with the Republicans in charge.\n  After we confirm Catharina Haynes today, more than 75 percent of \nPresident Bush's court of appeals nominations will have been confirmed. \nIn contrast, during the 8 years that President Clinton was President, \nthey confirmed 50 percent. So if we stop right now, we would be 25 \npercent ahead of them at the end of this year.\n  Well, we are not going to stop now; we are going to try to process \nmore of these nominations. Our treatment of President Bush's nominees \nhas been more than fair and fully in keeping with the Senate's \nconstitutional duty to provide advice and consent to Presidential \nnominees.\n  The Republican leader, my friend--I know how much he cares about \nthese judges--talks about the fact that there has been some kind of an \nagreement that we would confirm 15 of the President's court of appeals \nnominees in this Congress. We are going to do our very best to process \nnominations. But it would be a good idea--and we could process a few \nmore--if the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee would show up at \nthe hearings that the chairman holds so he could have a quorum.\n  Chairman Leahy and I are not making any specific numerical commitment \non behalf of Democrats. I said in a floor statement last May 10 that we \nshould measure the quality of nominees, not the quantity of the \nnominees. We should confirm mainstream, capable, experienced nominees \nwho are the product of bipartisan cooperation. But we should not \nconfirm nominees who are out of the mainstream and who are \nunacceptable, for example, to the home State Senators.\n  The judicial confirmation process has been the subject of much \nacrimony over the years. I talked about it a little bit earlier. To \nthink what the Republicans were going to do. It is hard for me to \ncomprehend that they were willing to do that, but they were. Senator \nLeahy and I have worked hard to diffuse those tensions, and I think we \nhave done a pretty good job. We have done it because we believe there \nare judges who need to be confirmed. We believe the confirmation of \nfive judges today is another step in that process.\n  I was so disappointed--and I expressed this privately to the \nRepublican leader today--we bring to the floor five nominees today, and \nthey spend all morning beating up on you. It is kind of a strange world \nwe live in here. Why did they have to do it today? What does that show?\n  We moved forward on these. We could have done two of them today, and \na lot of the Members would be happy. But if we didn't do them all \ntoday--it is going to take a lot of time but we decided, let's do \nthese. It is a showing of good faith. I am the one who talked to the \nchairman of the committee and said let's do them all. All they do is \ncome out and beat the daylights out of him all day.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. 1, I can't tell my dear friend from Nevada how much \nwhat he has said has meant. He has told me similar things in private as \nwell as in public. He and I have been close friends for well over 20 \nyears, and he knows of my huge respect and affection for him.\n  I chuckled as he put his finger on the issue, as he always does--the \nman from Searchlight shines the light on what happens--and talked about \nthis kabuki show we saw this morning on the floor, criticizing me \nespecially for moving judges. It kind of reminds me of what happened in \nFebruary where we had markups to confirm judges and the Republicans \nwould not show up. We wondered, why wouldn't they show up for their own \njudges? Why wouldn't they show up when they were given a chance to get \nout these judges? And then I find out. They were all giving speeches \nsaying it is terrible we are not getting out judges. Well, if they had \nshown up, of course, the speeches could not be given. It is kind of \ndamned if you do and damned if you don't.\n  I said when I became chairman the first time and again the second \ntime I would not do to them, or to President Bush, what they did to \nPresident Clinton and to us, and I have not. I do not intend to. I told \nthe President that. But I would like to see a little bit of cooperation \nfrom the White House in working with home State Senators and in working \nwith us not to get\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nidealogues that fit well in a fundraising letter, but instead to \nnominate people who are good for the Federal court.\n  So I can't tell the distinguished leader enough how much I appreciate \nhis constant support throughout this whole thing.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said to the leader, I would still \nrather see us work with the President on the selection of nominees the \nSenate can proceed to confirm than waste precious time fighting about \ncontroversial nominees to score political points. I will give an \nexample. We have a State with a highly respected Republican Senator and \na highly respected Democratic Senator, and they worked together to make \nrecommendations that were completely out of any kind of partisan \npolitics. They sent a list of several people who had gone through the \nscreening committee, talked to everybody on the bar--Democrats, \nRepublicans, people with no political affiliations--and said: Look, \nhere is a list of the best people we could possibly find in our State. \nWhite House, you go ahead and pick whomever you want out of this group. \nWe are happy with them.\n\n  They came and talked to me, and I said fine. I have huge respect for \nboth the Republican Senator and the Democratic Senator, and I am sure \nwe can move them through. Do my colleagues know what happened. The \nWhite House rejected that and sent up a totally controversial person. \nAgain, the fundraising letters went out touting how we have to have \nthis person. Both of the Senators said they would not return a positive \nblue slip; they wouldn't support this. It was not somebody they wanted \nto have on their record as supporting.\n  The White House finally withdrew that name. It went back to those \nSenators, and I am told by the Senators they have a nomination now that \nboth will support for the circuit court of appeals, and that person \nwill go charging through.\n  I recall another nomination this White House had made, strongly \nopposed by the two Senators, one of the more senior Members of the \nSenate, from their State. Those Senators said they did not want this \nnomination to go through and it did not. I still hear how terrible it \nwas we did not confirm that nomination, even after the nominee pled \nguilty to criminal fraud.\n  I can think of other examples of people whom my Republican colleagues \ncame and said: We really don't want to go with this person because of \ntheir situation back home--without going into a further description.\n  Now, Judge Catharina Haynes--and I see my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas on the Senate floor, Senator Cornyn--Judge Catharina \nHaynes is a former Texas State trial judge in the 191st District Court \nfor the State of Texas. She currently works as a partner at the law \nfirm of Baker Botts in Dallas--an excellent firm. The Fifth Circuit has \nplayed an extraordinarily historic role in the protection of civil \nrights in this country. As we moved from that terrible time in our \nhistory of segregation into civil rights for all, some of those judges \nwere among the most courageous this Nation has known.\n  I wish I knew more about Judge Haynes's attitude about civil rights \nthan her record and testimony reveal. But I listened to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas said, and I vote in favor of \nconfirmation with the hope that she will treasure and follow the \nexample of earlier judges in that court who made such a passionate \ncommitment to the rights of all Americans.\n  So I congratulate her and her family on what I expect will be her \nconfirmation today.\n  We have five nominations. I had been told the leadership has been \ntalking about having rollcalls. We still have a fair amount of time on \nboth sides; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 1 hour 5 minutes remaining. \nThe minority has 100 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, because I have been asked by both \nRepublican and Democratic Senators, with the American Airlines snafu \nand other things as we are trying to get flights out of here, I might \nask the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania how soon he would be \nwilling to start votes if I were to yield back all time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, Mr. President, I am not quite sure about that. I \nam quite sure that I waited here for 40 minutes for somebody to appear \nto start this debate, and I am quite sure we have heard very extensive \ndiscussion by the Democrats, but my practice is to be brief. I believe \nI will speak no more than 15 minutes, perhaps 20 at the outside. I hate \nto so understate it, but I don't think it takes a whole lot of time to \nrefute what the chairman and the majority leader have said. So I think \nwe are ready to start fairly soon. If we had some indication as to how \nmany rollcall votes we will have--if we have five, which will take us \nseveral hours, I might be a little more disposed to be even briefer, if \nI had some indication of that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to talk to the Senators who have \nproposed these nominations. I have been a little bit more lengthy than \nnormal, but that is after several hours that have been spent on the \nfloor of the Senate being critical of me--I did not respond to that \nuntil now--just as a great deal of time was spent in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee being critical of me which I did not respond to; \notherwise, we would not have Judge Haynes on the floor today because \nthe Republicans would have filibustered her nomination.\n  So I will not quite yet withhold the balance of time. I am prepared, \nif people want, to begin these votes within the next 5 minutes and to \nwork with--I understand a couple of the proponents of a couple of these \njudges are not going to require rollcall votes.\n  I want to be able to confirm that. If that is the case, I am prepared \nto begin in the next 5 minutes or so. I withhold the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask the chairman if his willingness to \nbegin in 5 minutes would leave me 5 or, perhaps, 3 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Georgia wants 4 minutes, and I would only have 1 minute. My \nquestion to the chairman would be, as a vocal, outspoken, voluminous \nproponent of fairness, if he thinks 1 minute would be sufficient to \nreply to the better part of an hour, which he has taken. Perhaps I can \nanswer that myself. I don't think it would be sufficient.\n  Mr. LEAHY. To answer that question, the Senator from Pennsylvania is \none of the most articulate, best trial attorneys in this place. He \ncould do in a minute what others would take an hour to do. I did try to \ntake far less time than was used to attack me this morning.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, we have heard the magnanimity of the chairman on \nthis one circuit nominee. So far this year, we have not confirmed any \nFederal judges. We have heard the magnanimous comments by the chairman \nabout Catharina Haynes. We might not have had one. We didn't have a \nhearing from September 25 to February 21. I don't think an argument of \nbeing magnanimous pertains.\n  I don't blame the chairman for departing the Chamber. He might not \nlike to hear what I have to say in response; although, I sat through \nhis entire speech. I will not comment on his departure beyond what I \nhave already said.\n  In listening to the presentation by the Senator from Vermont, I would \nhave thought he was running for President. He had this big, flamboyant \nchart about the Bush Presidency. The chart had statistics on the \nunemployment rate going up, gas prices going up, the budget deficit \ngoing up, the trade deficit going up, and the number of uninsured \npeople going up. For a moment, I thought I was listening to Senator \nHillary Clinton. And then, I thought I might be listening to Senator \nObama. Had either of those Senators been making that speech, I could \nunderstand the purpose, but it is a little hard to understand the \npurpose of the comments by the chairman.\n  When the chairman talks about Republicans not showing up for \ncommittee meetings, he is in fantasyland, as are a good many of his \ncomments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a detailed \nrebuttal. It would take considerable time to answer specifically, but \nthis can be in\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nthe Record to demonstrate proof and to establish the fantasy of the \nchairman's assertions that Republicans didn't show up.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Assertion: Chairman Leahy has asserted the Republicans \n     boycotted markups in February when he was trying to move \n     nominations\n       Rebuttal: Republicans did not boycott Committee business \n     meetings or obstruct the Committee's ability to vote out \n     judicial nominations.\n       Between the first business meeting of 2008 (Jan. 31) and \n     the April 3 business meeting when Chairman Leahy made the \n     above assertions, the Committee had held only four business \n     meetings (Jan. 31, Feb. 14, Feb. 28, and March 6), and had \n     held two judicial nominations hearings (Feb. 12 and Feb. 21), \n     even though the Senate had been in session eight weeks.\n       Neither the Jan. 31 meeting nor the Feb. 14 meeting agendas \n     listed any judicial nominations.\n       A total of five executive nominations were listed on Jan. \n     31 and Feb. 14 meeting agendas.\n       Even though no judicial nominations were listed on the Feb. \n     14 meeting, PI Ranking Member Specter arrived at the meeting \n     early and, finding no other Committee Members present, left \n     to testify before the Senate Finance Committee. When he \n     returned, the meeting had been adjourned. According to \n     Committee records, Senators Leahy, Specter, Kohl, Schumer, \n     Durbin, Kyl, and Brownback were the only Members present \n     before adjournment.\n       The Feb. 28 meeting was the first to list judicial \n     nominations and only listed two district court nominees--\n     Brian Miller (AR) and James Hall (GA).\n       A total of four Republicans and five Democrats were present \n     at the Feb. 28 meeting before Senator Specter left at 10:17--\n     hardly a boycott. A fifth Republican, Senator Hatch, arrived \n     after the gavel. (According to Committee records, Specter \n     arrived at 9:59, Coburn 10:00, Feinstein 10:02, Leahy 10:03, \n     Durbin 10:04, Cardin 10:05, Kyl 10:08, Grassley 10:16, Kohl \n     10:17, Hatch 10:19 after the gavel)\n       The next meeting was held on March 6 and the Committee \n     voted out four district court nominees: Brian Miller (AR), \n     James Randal Hall (GA), John Mendez (CA), and Stanley \n     Anderson (TN). According to Committee records, Senators \n     Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, Cornyn, Coburn, Leahy, Biden, \n     Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, Durbin, and Cardin were \n     all present for the Committee vote on the nominations.\n       Kevin J. O'Connor, nominee to be Associate Attorney General \n     and Gregory Katsas, nominee to be Assistant Attorney General \n     for the Civil Division, who were listed on the Feb. 14 \n     agenda, were also voted out on March 6.\n       Catharina Haynes was the only judicial nomination listed on \n     the April 3 meeting agenda and was the first circuit court \n     nomination listed on a Committee meeting since Nov. 1, 2007 \n     (5 months ago).\n       It is unclear what ``boycott' Chairman Leahy is referring \n     to given that the February 28 meeting was the only one \n     between January 1, 2008 and February 28 that listed judicial \n     nominees and a quorum was not reached by 10:15 even though \n     four Republicans were present.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Now, when the majority leader came to the floor and \ntalked about turning the Constitution on its head with the \nconstitutional option, he glossed over the point pretty fast and missed \nmost of the salient points--that there was enormous provocation that \nled some Republicans--and I say ``some'' Republicans--to consider \nraising the constitutional option. What we have seen is a practice \ngoing on now for two decades--20 years--since 1986, so it is 22 years \nnow--starting with the last 2 years of the Reagan administration, 1987 \nand 1988, when the Democrats had control, nominations were slowed down \nto a crawl. And then the same thing occurred during the last 2 years of \nthe first President Bush. Then Republicans retaliated with gusto in \nkind, exacerbating the problem.\n  The one thing I agree with the Senator from Vermont on is that the \nClinton nominees were not treated fairly.\n  That is true. They were not treated fairly, and I said so at the \ntime. I crossed party lines to support qualified Clinton nominees. But, \nwhat is happening in this body is just ratcheting it up again and \nagain. And then, after President Clinton's term, we had the virtual \ndisintegration of institutional prerogatives around here due to \nfilibusters that were conducted by the Democrats on the Bush nominees \nin 2004 and 2005.\n  The majority leader talks about the constitutional option. Well, the \nconstitutional option was not pursued by Republicans. There were \nsufficient Republicans to have put the constitutional, or nuclear \noption, into operation. There were sufficient Republicans to do that. \nUnder the plan, it would have taken 51, but the Republicans did not do \nthat, notwithstanding the Democrats' provocation.\n  The majority leader said, ``We have been fair to Republicans.'' That \ncomment sort of approaches this issue as if it is a private boxing \nmatch between Republicans and Democrats and an issue of fairness \nbetween Republicans and Democrats. Well, that is not the issue. The \nissue is what is fair to the American people. We are not here to spar, \nto argue or to fight; we are here to do the people's business. How fair \nis it to the American people to have these nominations delayed where \nthere are judicial emergencies in the courts of the United States? This \nis not Arlen Specter's idea. The Judicial Conference determines what is \na judicial emergency.\n  There is a judicial emergency in the Fifth Circuit, the court to \nwhich Catharina Haynes is nominated and up for a vote today. How long \nhas she waited? It has been over 260 days. Now, I don't consider it \nrelevant as to whether it is fair to Republicans; I consider the \nquestion whether it is fair to Americans--the people who live in the \nFifth Circuit who have had to wait for decisions to be made by an \nunderstaffed court. It may be a statistic to those of us who hold lofty \npositions--and it is a great privilege to be a Senator. It may be a \nstatistic to us, but if somebody has filed a lawsuit who has been \ninjured, say, in an automobile accident. Someone who has doctor bills \nand loss of wages, and that person has to wait and wait for the case to \ncome up, finally to be tried, and then to be appealed and waits and \nwaits--that is where the issue is.\n  Take a look at the waiting periods: Robert Conrad in the Fourth \nCircuit, a judicial emergency, waiting over 260 days; Raymond Kethledge \nin the Sixth Circuit, a judicial emergency, waiting over 650 days; \nStephen Murphy also in the Sixth Circuit and a judicial emergency, \nwaiting over 650 days. Shalom Stone in the Third Circuit, a judicial \nemergency, has been waiting over 250 days. Tom Farr in the District \nCourt of North Carolina has been waiting over 490 days. James Rogan has \nbeen waiting over 450 days. The list goes on and on. Peter Keisler is a \nvery distinguished nominee who has an extraordinary record, and I ask \nunanimous consent that his resume be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Peter Douglas Keisler\n\n\n    United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\n       Birth: October 13, 1960, Hempstead, New York.\n       Legal residence: Bethesda, Maryland.\n       Education: B.A., Yale University, 1981, Magna Cum Laude; \n     J.D., Yale Law School, 1985, Note Editor, Yale Law Journal.\n       Employment: Law Clerk, Judge Robert H. Bork, D.C. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, 1985-1986; Assistant Counsel, Office of the \n     Counsel to the President, 1986-1987; Associate Counsel, \n     Office of the Counsel to the President, 1987-1988; Law Clerk, \n     Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, Supreme Court, 1988; Associate, \n     Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood, 1989-1993, Partner, 1993-2002; \n     Acting Associate Attorney General, United States Department \n     of Justice, Oct. 2002-March 2003; Principal Deputy Associate \n     Attorney General, United States Department of Justice, June \n     2002-June 2003; Assistant Attorney General, United States \n     Department of Justice, Civil Division, July 2003-September \n     2007; Former Acting Attorney General, United States \n     Department of Justice, September 2007-November 2007.\n       Selected activities: Member, Advisory Committee on Civil \n     Rules; Director & Secretary, Federalist Society for Law and \n     Public Policy, 1983-2000; Member, Maryland Bar Association; \n     Member, District of Columbia Bar Association; Member, \n     Pennsylvania Bar Association; Member, American Bar \n     Association.\n       ABA rating: Unanimously Well Qualified.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Peter Keisler has waited for 650 days, \nand soon, it will be the 2-year anniversary of his nomination. So the \nreal question is not fairness to Republicans; it is a question of \nfairness to the American people. The American people have not been \ntreated fairly, and they have not been treated fairly by the Democrats, \nand they weren't treated fairly by Republicans when President Clinton \nsent nominees to this floor.\n  It is high time this stops. That is why I have introduced a \nresolution that would establish a protocol. The protocol would be, \nafter a nominee is\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nnominated, there be a hearing and then there is a committee vote. Then, \nthe nominee comes before the full Senate and we start to follow the \nConstitution. There is nothing in the Constitution about filibusters. \nThe Constitution talks about the President's prerogatives to nominate \nand the Senate's duty to consent or not to consent.\n  The majority leader made a big to-do about its being a matter of \nquality, not a matter of quantity. Well, if the majority doesn't like \nthe quality, all they have to do is vote the nominee down. All I am \nasking for is up-or-down votes. If they don't like the quality, say so. \nSay so. I think that, on an examination of the record, there would be \nno real issue about quality. These are quality people. But, if I am \nwrong, and their judgment is to the contrary, I will abide by that. \nVote no. Don't consent. Follow the Constitution and don't consent.\n  We have real problems with going forward when the chairman talks \nabout judicial vacancies not being the most pressing problem in \ncomparison to unemployment, the economy, and Iraq. I agree there are \nproblems of greater immediacy. But, we have time to handle them all. We \nmight have to work on Mondays and Fridays. A lot of Americans work on \nSaturdays. We could come in a little earlier, and we could use the \nfloor time a little more efficiently.\n  I do believe it is time we took stock in what we are doing in this \nbody. You can cite the statistics in many different directions, but I \nthink the real critical statistics are what has happened in the last 2 \nyears during President Bush's Administration in comparison to President \nClinton's final two years. There is a decisive discrepancy there. A \nRepublican Senate confirmed 15 of President Clinton's circuit judges in \nhis final two years in comparison to 6 for President Bush before the \nnominees are considered today. I hope it will go up to 7. President \nClinton had 57 district judges and President Bush had 34, and I expect \nit will go up to 38 today. Over the 8-year terms of the two Presidents, \nPresident Clinton had 65 circuit judges and President Bush had 57; \nPresident Clinton had 305 district court judges, and President Bush had \n237 judges.\n  So I hope we can move through the morass we find ourselves in. If we \ndon't, there is going to be an election this year, and there may be a \nDemocrat in the White House. I don't know what is going to happen. It \nis a close matter. The American people will decide that.\n  At some point, there will be another Democrat in the White House, if \nnot on this election, and there will be retaliation because one insult \nbegets another. As one side exacerbates, so does the other. The 20-year \nrecord is not a good record as to what we have here. I urge a truce.\n  On a personal level, no two Senators in this body have a closer \nrelationship than Senator Leahy and myself. It goes back a long time \nwhen we had important jobs--when he was a prosecuting attorney and I \nwas the same. We have worked together very closely, but we have a \ndisagreement on this issue.\n  I believe the Republican caucus is right today in its position, and I \nam prepared to lead the caucus on the issue. That is my job in my \ncapacity as ranking member. When the Republican caucus was wrong, I \nsaid so, and I voted with the Democrats on the Clinton nominees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request so we can move on?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Surely.\n\n\nVote on the Nomination of Catharina Haynes to be United States Circuit \n                                 Judge\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ncall up the nomination of Catharina Haynes of Texas to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, that the nomination be confirmed \nand sent to the President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I don't understand the import of that \nquestion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is talking about ways to move forward. I am \nasking by consent that we confirm by voice vote Calendar No. 515, \nCatharina Haynes to be a Fifth Circuit Judge.\n  Mr. President, is the Senator going to object?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I have something on \nwhich to agree. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nnomination is confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both sides \nyield back their time and we begin with a vote on Brian Stacy Miller of \nArkansas, which will be a rollcall vote, and if rollcall votes are \nrequired on the subsequent nominations, that they be 10-minute \nrollcalls.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That they be voice votes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. I should advise, I will ask, if time is all yielded \nback, for the yeas and nays on Brian Stacy Miller, but if the yeas and \nnays are requested on the subsequent nominees, that they be 10-minute \nrollcalls, although subsequent to the Brian Stacy Miller, the first \none.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire of the distinguished chairman if he \nintends to ask for the yeas and nays on the other nominees?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why don't we begin with this nomination, and the \ndistinguished ranking member, who is one of the closest friends I have \nin this body, and I may discuss that during that rollcall vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I respect the chairman's right not to answer. The \nSenator from Georgia has been waiting for a considerable period of \ntime. I agree with whatever Senator Leahy has had to say. I ask that \nthe Senator be given--how much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Up to 3 minutes, and I also ask that Senator Cornyn be \ngiven up to 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We just confirmed Senator Cornyn's nomination. Does he \nwant us to undo that?\n  Let me do this. I ask unanimous consent that at 5 minutes of 6, all \ntime be yielded back and the Senate go to a vote on the nomination of \nBrian Stacy Miller of Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be ordered \non Brian Stacy Miller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nJames Randall Hall to be United States District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Georgia. Randy Hall is supremely well qualified to fill \nthis position.\n  I am pleased the Senate will finally have an opportunity to vote on \nRandy's confirmation today. If confirmed, Randy will fill the vacancy \ncreated on August 2, 2006, when Judge Avant Edenfield took senior \nstatus. The Southern District of Georgia is designated as a judicial \nemergency, as just referred to by Senator Specter, by the nonpartisan \nJudicial Conference of the United States. This means the court dockets \nof the Southern District of Georgia are too busy and that litigants are \nwaiting too long for results.\n  To that end, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, as well as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, the ranking member, Mr. Specter, for their efforts \nand that of their staffs for shepherding Randy's nomination through the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Randy Hall is a native of Augusta, GA. He graduated from Augusta \nCollege in 1979 and from the University of Georgia School of Law in \n1982. His private practice has focused on commercial real estate, \nbanking, corporate matters, and commercial litigation. During his years \nas a private attorney, he built an impressive legal resume. He served \nas general counsel of Bankers First Corporation for over a decade, \nmanaging the entire legal function of the billion dollar corporation, \nincluding securities matters, State and Federal regulatory matters, \nlitigation, real estate acquisition and development, employment issues, \nand general corporate projects.\n  Mr. Hall also has a history of public service. In 1997, he was \nappointed to the Augusta-Richmond Planning Commission, a 12-member \nboard authorized\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\nto regulate the subdivision of land, plan for the orderly growth and \ndevelopment of Augusta-Richmond County, and zone all land into various \nuse classifications. He served on the commission until 2002, acting as \nits chairman from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Mr. Hall was elected to the \nGeorgia State Senate as a senator from the 22nd District in 2003 and \nserved there in 2003 and 2004.\n  Since 2004, Mr. Hall has been a partner with Warlick, Tritt, Stebbins \n& Hall in Augusta, GA. Those who know Randy describe him as a man of \nintegrity and someone with good moral character. His colleagues also \nsay he is totally committed to the rule of law, and that he is fair and \nhonest in all of his dealings and undertakings.\n  I believe the Southern District of Georgia will be well served to \nhave Randy Hall on the bench. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nhis confirmation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 3 minutes be \nyielded to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am grateful to the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for moving this nomination \nof Catharina Haynes to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I am \npleased she has been unanimously confirmed today by a voice vote.\n  Judge Haynes is actually a former State district court judge. I am \nproud to call her now Judge Haynes as a confirmed United States circuit \ncourt judge.\n  I am proud to concur with the American Bar Association's unanimous \nopinion that Ms. Haynes is well qualified for a seat on the Federal \nappellate bench. Her record as both a State judge and a member of the \ncivil bar amply demonstrates the legal acumen, the commitment to \njustice, and the dedication to public service required for those \nnominated to serve on our Nation's appellate courts.\n  It is truly a pleasure to recommend confirmation of a Texas lawyer \nwith a career-long record of dedication to public service and equality \nbefore the law. Ms. Haynes has served as a volunteer for pro bono legal \naid clinics, providing legal assistance to people who otherwise would \nbe unable to afford to have a will probated or resolve family law \nissues. Ms. Haynes helped develop a brochure for pro se litigants, \nopening the doors of justice in what can be a daunting and intimidating \nsystem for disadvantaged litigants.\n  This pattern of helping the less fortunate navigate the legal system \nbespeaks a commitment to the ideal of equal justice for all. This is \nbut one aspect of Ms. Haynes's service to her community.\n  Since 2005, Ms. Haynes has been a director of the Vickery Meadow \nLearning Center, a nonprofit organization that promotes literacy among \nthe residents of a low-income Dallas neighborhood. Ms. Haynes teaches \npre-GED classes at the Learning Center. Ms. Haynes's direct involvement \nher community demonstrates that her dedication to the rule of law is \nmatched by her passion for public service.\n  Ms. Haynes demonstrated this commitment to public service in 1998, \nwhen she gave up a prestigious and lucrative partnership at the Baker \nBotts law firm to take the bench as a State district court judge on the \n191st District Court in Dallas.\n  As a former district court and appellate judge, I can attest that the \ndistrict judge's experience seeing actual litigants and the real-world \nconsequences of their legal disputes is invaluable for later service on \nthe appellate bench.\n  The fundamentals of judging--analyzing the arguments presented to the \ncourt in light of the facts and the law--carry over from the trial \ncourt to the appellate level. And Ms. Haynes's experience as a trial \ncourt judge will undoubtedly remind her each day that the consequences \nof a judge's decisions always have a human face.\n  As a State judge, Ms. Haynes gained deep experience in many areas of \nsubstantive law including commercial litigation, personal injury, \nemployment, insurance bad faith litigation, and intellectual property. \nState court judges interpret and apply Federal statutory and \nconstitutional law, which are, of course, the supreme law of the land, \nbinding on judges in every State. In presiding over nearly 300 trials, \nJudge Haynes distinguished herself for her work ethic and commitment to \nthe rule of law.\n  Ms. Haynes's intellect and diligence have been evident throughout her \nlegal career, starting with her extraordinary academic record.\n  After graduating first in her class from Florida Institute of \nTechnology at the age of 19, Judge Haynes went on to graduate, with \ndistinction, second in her class at Emory University School of Law at \nthe age of 22. In her 21-year legal career, she has been involved in a \nwide variety of complex civil cases in both State and Federal courts.\n  Ms. Haynes's professional excellence has been repeatedly recognized \nand honored by her peers in the legal community. Her many awards \ninclude the State Bar of Texas Presidential Commendation, the Dallas \nAssociation of Young Lawyers Foundation Award of Excellence, and the \nDallas Women Lawyers Association Louise B. Raggio Award, which is \nawarded annually to a Dallas-area attorney who has worked to advance \nwomen in the legal profession, shown outstanding legal proficiency and \nthe highest level of ethics, and made a significant contribution to the \nprofession.\n  It is fitting that Ms. Haynes has received awards for her \ncontributions to the legal profession, given that she has dedicated \nsignificant energy to promoting the professionalism and ethics that are \ncentral to the rule of law. She has written and spoken extensively on \nissues of civil trial litigation, professionalism, and ethics.\n  Among her many professional leadership positions, she has served on \nthe board of the Dallas Bar Association and the Professional Ethics \nCommittee of the State Bar of Texas. Her life's work speaks to a belief \nin the high calling of a career in law and a steadfast and accomplished \npursuit of the profession's highest ideals.\n  I am pleased that the Judiciary Committee recently approved Ms. \nHaynes' nomination and the Senate just confirmed her.\n  The Federal bench needs more men and women of her caliber, drawn from \namong the best of the civil bar.\n  Mr. President, the People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy \ngroup, sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee last week urging the \ncommittee not to proceed with this nomination. To the credit of \nChairman Leahy and my Democratic colleagues, they rejected this \nbaseless and unfair attack.\n  The lack of any substantial reason to deny this nomination is clear \nwhen we look at the pretense offered by People for the American Way for \nopposing Ms. Haynes. The letter claims that Ms. Haynes has no ``record \nof commitment to civil rights progress in this country.''\n  First of all, I do not know exactly what that means. I believe that \nthis group is deliberately creating a vague standard that they can \ninvoke to reject any nominee. I think that it is clear that there is \nnothing in Ms. Haynes' background that they can reasonably complain \nabout with any specificity, so they fall back on vagueness.\n  I don't know what this group means by a ``record of commitment to \ncivil rights,'' so I can't respond to that other than by directing my \ncolleagues to Ms. Haynes actual record--a record that was discussed at \nlength in Ms. Haynes' hearing and that this letter ignores completely.\n  Ms. Haynes has served as a volunteer for pro bono legal aid clinics, \nvolunteering her time to protect the legal rights of those who can't \nafford a lawyer.\n  Ms. Haynes helped write a brochure for pro se litigants, giving \ndisadvantaged litigants the tools they need to vindicate their rights \nin courts of law.\n  Ms. Haynes serves as a director of the Vickery Meadow Learning \nCenter, a\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nnonprofit organization that promotes literacy among the disadvantaged. \nMs. Haynes teaches pre-GED classes at the center, aiding the less \nfortunate along the path to literacy, education, and a fuller civic \nlife.\n  By any fair reading, Ms. Haynes has an exemplary record of commitment \nto the high ideals of equal opportunity and equal justice before the \nlaw--ideals that I believe are at the core of civil rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I believe we are ready to vote.\n\n\n   Vote on the Nomination of Brian Stacy Miller to be United States \n                             District Judge\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Brian Stacy \nMiller, of Arkansas, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we can proceed to this bill. This is \nanother bipartisan piece of legislation. Senators Boxer and Inhofe have \nworked on this bill for months and months. It has been very difficult. \nIt has been like pulling teeth. They get one thing done and something \nelse crops up. It is now done.\n  I hope we can move to this bill. If there are those who want to offer \nan amendment, good. Let them offer an amendment. This is something that \nis important and we need to do. I hope, recognizing this bill relates \nto the highway bill that we passed 3\\1/2\\ years ago, any amendments \noffered would be in keeping with the content of the bill. I don't want \nto get off on Iraq or some tax issue. I hope we can confine it to this \nlegislation.\n  This is the Senate. After we get on the bill, I hope we could go \nimmediately to it; we wouldn't have to use the 30 hours. If there are \nthings that need to be done, no one is trying to stop anybody from \noffering amendments. We are not going to be, unless there is a change, \nand I will certainly give lots of prior warning to the Republican \nleader after we are on this a while. I hope we can just go through the \nordinary process, that we don't have to do any parliamentary maneuvers \nto get this very important bipartisan piece of legislation done.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the leader yield for a question--a comment and \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the leader very much. This is a very bipartisan \npiece of legislation that Senator Inhofe and I are very happy is \nfinally coming to the floor.\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\n  My question--it is really a comment in the form of a question. You \npointed out we are 3 years after the highway bill. This is correcting \nsome unanticipated errors in that bill. What is happening is, here we \nare in this recession. There are a lot of projects that are stymied. \nThey were unintended to be stymied, but we need to correct that.\n  My question is, Don't you think it is time to correct a bill that \npassed 3 years ago, and we are going to get to the new highway bill \nnext year? This is unfinished business. It is bipartisan. My point is, \ndo you believe as strongly as I do that the time has come to do this?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chair of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I appreciate the work done on a \nbipartisan basis to get us here. If there were ever a time we should do \nthis, a technical corrections bill on a bill that passed more than 3 \nyears ago, it is now. It has taken that long to get it done, especially \nsince we have the highway trust fund that now is $5 billion short of \nwhat it should be. There are construction projects that need to go \nforward. Many of them cannot go forward until this technical \ncorrections bill is passed.\n  This bill does not favor Democrats. It does not favor Republicans. I \nthink everyone should understand when Senators Boxer and Inhofe work on \na bipartisan bill, that is a bipartisan bill. We all know the \nreputations of the Senator from California and the Senator from \nOklahoma. This is a good piece of legislation, and I say to my friend \nfrom California, I hope we can get it done very quickly.\n  We have lots of things to do. I am disappointed we are not going to \nbe able to move to the patent bill. I am sorry about that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I may put the leader on the spot, but as I understand it, \nwe have had to file a cloture motion on this bill, which means a \nthreatened filibuster over going to a technical corrections bill to \namend and revise a highway bill that is 3\\1/2\\ years old. I know the \nRepublican minority set a record in the Senate with 62 filibusters last \nyear. I don't know if the majority leader can tell us the ongoing \nnumber of filibusters from the Republicans at this point. I assume it \nis over 70 filibusters. The previous record was 62 filibusters in 2 \nyears. Now we have had over 70 filibusters, and we are just into this \nnew legislative year.\n  I ask the majority leader, in his experience in the Senate, does he \never recall a filibuster being mounted on a bipartisan bill that is a \ntechnical corrections bill related to highway projects and other \nbuilding projects across the Nation, in both Democratic and Republican \nStates?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my distinguished friend, the answer to that is no. \nBut I do say this: That is why I made my remarks very clear. I think a \nlot of it has been unfounded, but we have had some distrust that some \nof the things we are doing will prevent people from offering \namendments; there will not be an opportunity to legislate on this bill.\n  I have no intention--I made it very clear--of filling the tree. I \nused kind of a buzzword because everyone knew what I was talking about. \nBut I have no intention of doing that. That is why I said I hope once \nwe get on the bill, the 30 hours will not need to be used; we can just \ngo to the bill and start legislating. That would be the right thing to \ndo.\n  We have now been in this session for 12-15 months. I would hope by \nthis time we know each other a little better, we can trust each other a \nlittle better, Democrats and Republicans. I think we just finished some \nvery good work. Today we passed an extremely important housing bill. It \nwas bipartisan.\n  I was with some people today, and they criticized: Why did you put \nthis provision in there dealing with homebuilders? It is something that \nthey don't need.\n  I personally disagree with that. In Nevada we have homebuilders who \nare doing everything they can to hang onto land so when this market \nbottoms out they will still have some land to build on. Anyway, I said \nto them we in the Senate today have a very slim majority, 51 to 49. I \nsaid to my friend--I asked this question: We have a number of things in \nthis bill that were put in that we did not especially like.\n  The Republicans got a number of things in this very important housing \nstimulus bill that they did not like. But that is what legislation is \nabout. That is the big speech I gave to my friend. I think he \nunderstood it after I said this a little better.\n  After that, we also did something on a bipartisan basis: passed, all \nin 1 bill, 80 different bills. There is no need to go back into the \nhistory of why this happened, but it happened, and we were only able to \nget it done because we worked on a bipartisan basis. I want to do the \nsame on this highway bill.\n  We have other things coming up that we need to do this work period. \nAs I indicated, because of the patent bill, for reasons that I am sure \nwill be written about over the next few weeks, we are not going to do a \npatent bill now. The chairman and ranking member could not work out \nwhat they wanted to bring to the floor. So, as a result of that, we \nhave a little extra time. I hope that because of that we can do highway \ncorrections, we can maybe move to that.\n  There is a veterans bill we are trying to get worked out. We know we \nhave more than 50 votes; we hope we have more than 60; we are very \nclose to that.\n  We have an FHA reauthorization. We need to do that. I spoke to \nChairman Rockefeller a few minutes ago.\n  So without belaboring the point, in answering the question of my dear \nfriend, the assistant Democratic leader, no, I don't remember ever a \nfilibuster being filed on a bipartisan bill. But I do not know the \nentire history. I hope we can move forward on this piece of legislation \nin regular order.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to make one brief comment to the \nleader.\n  I have no additional comment to make to the leader. I can pose it as \na question, but I do not really need to. The leader is aware that there \nis no intention on the Republican side to filibuster this bill. I \nconcur in his remarks about the bipartisanship that resulted in both of \nthe bills passing today.\n  There is one matter that needs to be resolved, as I understand it, \nwith respect to this technical corrections bill, which does need to be \ndealt with, as the chairman of the committee noted. As far as I know, \nthat is the only matter. There could be others, but I know of no \nintention on the part of anybody on our side of the aisle to raise \nextraneous matters to use the bill for any other purpose but to \ncomplete action on the bill. I am aware of the same matter that the \nmajority leader is right now as the only matter that exists on our \nside. So there is no intention on our side of the aisle to filibuster \nthe bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say also through the Chair to my friend, I \nhave spoken to that Senator, and still we might be able to work \nsomething out. If we cannot, he can offer an amendment and see what \nhappens that way.\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I feel comfortable with what we have been \nable to accomplish this week. I cannot say that every week we have left \nhere, but this has been a really good week. I think we have \naccomplished a lot that is good for the American people in the process.\n  We have a farm bill that is moving along. We had today an actual \nconference, Democrats and Republicans, trying to come up with a farm \nbill. It is wonderful that that is taking place because in recent years \nwe have not had a real conference. We have had little meetings take \nplace. But I think that is wonderful that we were able to get that \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2934-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

As I said during the \ndebate, S. 2739 is a collection of over 60 bills reported from the \nCommittee on Energy\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nand Natural Resources over the past 15 months.\n  This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work \nof our outstanding staff. Both the ranking member, Senator Domenici, \nand I are very fortunate to have a very dedicated and experienced \nprofessional staff. They service the committee and the Senate well. \nThey deserve our thanks.\n  On the Democratic staff of the committee, senior counsel David Brooks \nhad the lead role in assembling the bill. He deserves special \nacknowledgment. In addition, though, I want to particularly thank the \ncommittee's staff director, Bob Simon, for his wonderful work on this \nlegislation, as on all the legislation that comes through our \ncommittee; our chief counsel, Sam Fowler, for his superb work, as \nalways; counsels Mike Connor, Kira Finkler, and Scott Miller, and \nprofessional staff members Angela Becker-Dimmpann, Jonathan Epstein, \nand Al Stayman.\n  I would also like to thank the committee's chief clerk, Mia Bennett; \nexecutive assistant Amanda Kelly; communications director Bill Wicker; \npress secretary David Marks; staff assistants Rosemarie Calabro, Rachel \nPasternack, and Gina Weinstock; and our Bevinetto fellow who works on \nour staff, Karl Cordova.\n  On the Republican side, let me acknowledge Senator Domenici's staff \ndirector, Frank Macchiarola, who did an excellent job here; his chief \ncounsel, Judy Pensabene; professional staff members Kathryn Clay, Frank \nGladics, Josh Johnson, and Tom Lilly; and executive assistant Kara \nWeishaar.\n  In addition, I am very grateful to the committee's nondesignated \nstaff: AnnaKristina Fox, Dawson Foard, Nancy Hall, Amber Passmore, \nMonica Chestnut, and Wanda Green.\n  Finally, let me acknowledge the great help in bringing the bill to \nthe floor we received from the majority leader and his staff: Neil \nKornze, Chris Miller, Randy DeValk, Gary Myrick, and, as always, the \nsecretary for the majority, Lula Davis.\n  All of these fine staff members had a hand in putting S. 2739 \ntogether and moving it through the legislative process. We would not \nhave been able to pass the bill without their hard work and their \nprofessionalism. I wish to thank each and every one of them for the \ngood work.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Colorado is here to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak with \nregard to S. 2739, the bill we approved earlier this afternoon.\n  First, I wish to acknowledge Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici \nfor their great work in this legislation.\n  As I worked over the last 2, 3 years on many of the bills that are \nincluded in this package of land bills we approved this afternoon, it \nwas gratifying to see the bipartisan nature of the Energy Committee \nworking on this legislation which is so important to our Nation.\n  I very much agree that the process that historically has been used in \nthe Senate where what we do is to bring these pieces of legislation \nwhich are important to our States, which are important to our Nation, \nthrough a unanimous consent procedure is the way we ought to go. \nUnfortunately, because of objections from a few Senators on the other \nside, we were not able to follow that procedure. But, at the end of the \nday, through the great leadership of both Senator Bingaman and Senator \nDomenici, we were able to get that legislation through. To both of them \nI say thank you very much for your leadership.\n  I also thank the staff of the Energy Committee. Bob Simon, David \nBrooks, all of the staff on both sides who labored very hard on the \nmore than 60 pieces of substantive legislation that we approved here \nthis afternoon that will now head to the President's desk for his \nsignature. So I thank them for their great efforts with respect to this \nlegislation.\n  I want to speak briefly about four of the bills that were included in \nthis legislation which are important to my State of Colorado and are \nimportant to the Nation.\n  The first of those pieces of legislation has to do with the South \nPlatte River and the North Platte River and a multistate compact that \ninvolves the State of Colorado and the State of Nebraska.\n  Over the years, we have had issues between our States, Nebraska and \nColorado, and the State of Wyoming as well, with respect to how we deal \nwith the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and how we \nrecover endangered species on the Platte River, mostly working in the \nState of Nebraska.\n  After many years of negotiation and involvement by the Fish and \nWildlife Service and the Department of the Interior, the States came \ntogether and developed a recovery implementation program. That is a \nprogram which is intended to restore the habitat for the whooping crane \nin the State of Nebraska, with the participatory effort and obligation \non the part of the State of Colorado and the State of Wyoming and the \nState of Nebraska to recover the whooping crane and to recover habitat \nand hopefully someday to be able to take that threatened and endangered \nspecies off of the list.\n  In order for us to make progress to get there, we needed to implement \nthis tristate agreement with the Federal Government. The legislation we \npassed today will help us get there, and I very much appreciate the \nparticipation of Senator Hagel and Senator Nelson from Nebraska, as \nwell as Senator Allard, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Enzi from Wyoming \non this bipartisan legislation, legislation that is very important to \nour States.\n  The second legislative item I want to refer to here briefly is S. \n1116, which is the Produced Water bill. This is legislation which was \nsponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Mark Udall. We \npushed it through our Energy Committee because we know this is \nhappening out there in many of our public and private lands across the \nWest; that is, as oil and gas is being developed, there is a huge \namount of water that is simply being wasted, that is being disposed of \nwithout any kind of beneficial use. For those of us who come from the \narid West, who know what it is like to live in places where you only \nget a few inches of rainfall a year, it is important that we not waste \nany water whatsoever. So what this legislation will do is it will help \nus figure out a strategy and a plan forward on how we develop a \nbeneficial use for the water that is being produced from oil and gas \nproduction.\n  The next bill that was included in this package which I wanted to \nspeak about briefly is the Latino Museum bill. That legislation had \nseveral dozen cosponsors here in the Senate, including Senator \nMenendez, Senator Martinez, and many others who worked on that \nlegislation over the last several years.\n  It is important that when we look at this legislative piece, we \nunderstand the contribution many Americans have made to this country \nover a long period of time. The Latino community has been here in the \nUnited States of America for a very long time. Indeed, as the case with \nmy family, my family helped found the city of Santa Fe, NM, in 1598, \nnow some 410 years ago. That was before Jamestown, before Plymouth \nRock. You find the stories of our history across the landscape of this \ncountry from Florida, throughout the Southwest of the United States of \nAmerica. And in my own native valley, you can look out from the 8,000-\nfoot elevation of the San Luis Valley to the mountains on the east side \nof the valley that are named the Sangre de Christo Mountains; that is, \nthe ``Blood of Christ Mountains.'' You can look to the west to another \nset of 14,000-foot peaks named after St. John the Baptist, the San Juan \nmountain range.\n  Throughout America, you see the history of the Latino community \netched into the landscape of our country. But it is more than that \nhistory that started out now more than four centuries ago here in the \nNation, it is also the contributions Hispanics have made to this \ncountry as we have evolved from one generation to the next.\n  It was a group of Hispanic solders who in many ways helped create \nthis Nation through their service in George Washington's Army. It was a \nhuge\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nnumber of American soldiers who have served in every single war since \nthe beginning of our Republic, including people like those in my family \nwho served, and some who died, in some of the wars we have fought in \nthis country.\n  In World War II, my father was a staff sergeant in the Army. My \nmother, at the age of 19, found her way across the country from a place \nwith no post office and no name in northern New Mexico to the War \nDepartment here in Washington, DC, where she spent 5 years contributing \nto that great cause of the last century which made America the power \nand the hope and beacon of opportunity for the entire world. There have \nbeen thousands and thousands of Americans like that who have made the \nultimate sacrifice. But my mother was actually here in Washington, DC \nduring World War II. She received a telegram that said her oldest \nbrother, my Uncle Leandro, had been killed in the war in Europe.\n  When we authorize a study of the Latino museum in Washington, we are \nsaying that part of our history is to recognize that diversity that \nmakes us a great Nation.\n  Oftentimes I reflect on the greatness we have here in America. It is \nimportant for us to reflect on the fact that that greatness has come \nabout through some pain but always with some promise of the future. \nYes, there have been painful chapters of our history, including the \nvery painful chapter where this country allowed for one group of people \nto own another group of people, simply based on the color of their \nskin. We lived through another 100 years after the Civil War until \nBrown v. Board of Education in 1954, when we allowed as a function of \ngovernment for there to be the separation of the races so that it was \nOK for there to be Black schools and Brown schools and White schools. \nIt took Justice Warren and a unanimous Supreme Court in 1954 to say \nthat under the 14th amendment, that kind of segregation had no room \nunder the equal protection clause of our Constitution.\n  When we push forward initiatives as we have today with the Latino \ninitiative, what we are saying to America is, we are a great nation, \nbecause we are a diverse people. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said it \nbest in a case she decided in the last few years involving diversity at \nthe University of Michigan. She said the national security of our \ncountry depended on the military forces having diversity. She said that \nin an opinion that had been filed as an amicus brief by former members \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff. She also said that the strength of the \nNation in terms of future participation of the United States in the \nglobal economy was very dependent on us being able to participate in \nthat global economy, that diversity was required for us to succeed. For \nthat proposition, she cited to a brief filed by some 50 of the Fortune \n500 companies that participated in that case. The Latino museum for us \nis another step in the celebration of our diversity.\n  As I look at the challenges we face ahead in this century, I think we \ncan embrace and celebrate the diversity of our country that will make \nus stronger. There will be those who will say we ought to take another \nroad and that that road ought to be the one where we allow differences \nto separate us, where they will agitate for using those differences \namong us to create discord and to bring about agents of division. I \nreject that view. The view I embrace is that the diversity of our \ncountry is what will make us strong, not only in the 21st century but \nbeyond. The Latino museum legislation we passed today is one step in \nmaking that statement.\n  I also finally want to comment on S. 327 which was also included in \nthis legislation. It requires a study on ways in which we can celebrate \nand commemorate the contributions that Cesar Chavez made to the United \nStates. Cesar Chavez was the leader of the United Farm Workers until \nhis death a few years ago, one of the most celebrated Americans we know \ntoday and one of the architects of our civil rights movement and \nsomeone who in many ways is typified with people who have been pioneers \nof civil rights such as Martin Luther King, Jr., and others who have \ndone so much to make sure we are an America in progress. It is fitting \nand proper that we, as a Congress, honor someone with the legacy of \nCesar Chavez. I was proud to have bipartisan sponsorship of that \nlegislation so that we can now move forward to figure out ways in which \nwe can celebrate the legacy of this great man.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2936-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

We salute them for their extraordinary \naccomplishment and difficult compromises they were able to achieve to \ncreate a greater and better future for the people of Northern Ireland. \nTheir success is an example to the world of what can be accomplished \nwith courage and commitment.\n  The benefits and advances have been extraordinary over the past \ndecade.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  Early in the morning of September 3, 2007, Andrew Geske and a friend \nwere walking home in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, WA, when a black \nBMW pulled up alongside of them. According to Geske, he and his friend \nstopped walking when the car slowed down, assuming it was an \nacquaintance of theirs. When the car came to a halt, the driver burst \nout of the car, hurling\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nanti-gay epithets at Geske and punching him in the face repeatedly. \nReeling from the attack, Geske's arm fell through the passenger side \nwindow, where another attacker grabbed onto it. The driver then got \nback in the car and sped off with Geske's arm still trapped. The victim \nwas dragged several blocks before he broke free, suffering scrapes and \nsprained fingers in the process. The attack is being investigated as a \nbias crime and the assailants are still at large.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2937-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TIBET\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr President, I rise today to speak about the recent \nviolence in Tibet.\n  I am deeply saddened and angered by the events which have unfolded \nthis past month between ethnic Tibetans and China. In March, China's \ndecades of repression of Tibet exploded into widespread riots, both in \nthe Tibetan autonomous region and ethnic Tibetan areas of China. The \nChinese Government responded by imposing a near-total media blackout, \nand by deploying an overwhelming number of police and military \npersonnel. Within that darkness, dozens of people were killed.\n  It is still unclear who did the killing, or who was killed. It is \nunclear what set off the violence. It is even unclear how many people \nwere killed. The Chinese Government claims 22 deaths; independent \nTibetan sources say between 79 and 140. There have been a similarly \ndisputed number of people arrested.\n  One of government's primary functions is to enforce law and order \nwithin its borders. But the unrest and violence in Tibet is the direct \nresult of over 50 years of Chinese oppression of Tibetan ethnic, \ncultural, and political rights. It is the result of China's repression \nof Tibetan Buddhism and a stream of personal insults against the Dalai \nLama. The Dalai Lama, whom I am greatly honored to have met, is honored \nfor his commitment to peace and reconciliation. I cannot think of a \ntime when such a message is more welcome than it is today.\n  China, on the other hand, offers no similar message of tolerance and \npeace. Just this morning, there was an article in the Washington Post, \nin which a human rights lawyer and convert to Christianity lives under \nconstant police surveillance. He is intermittently beaten and harassed \nby police, who sometimes prohibit him from attending church. For ethnic \nTibetans, Chinese human rights violations can be much worse. China's \nefforts over the past half century to repress Tibetan rights are \nunacceptable, outrageous and in violation of China's own laws.\n  I know that many of my fellow Americans stand with me in this belief. \nAs such, I was proud to introduce with my colleague from California a \nresolution calling on China to ensure the protection of Tibetan rights \nand culture. The resolution demands that China allow a full and \ntransparent accounting of the recent violence. China must cease the \npolitical reeducation of monks, and allow them to possess pictures of \nthe Dalai Lama. It must also release peaceful protestors, and allow \nindependent journalists free access throughout China. In addition, the \nresolution calls on the U.S. State Department to fully implement the \n2002 Tibet Policy Act, particularly the establishment of a U.S. \nconsulate in Lhasa.\n  I was exceptionally pleased to note that my resolution was \nunanimously agreed to last night. I believe these measures would go a \nlong way toward safeguarding Tibetan rights, easing the suffering of \nethnic Tibetans, and preventing the outbreak of any further violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2937-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2937-S2938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I talk about public health. As I \nhope many of my colleagues are aware, this week is National Public \nHealth Week, and this year's goal is to increase the Nation's awareness \nof the serious effects of global warming on the public's health.\n  When I say global warming, people think of many things. You might \nthink of polar bears, vanishing glaciers, or rising sea levels, but you \nare not likely to think of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. This is unfortunate because there is a direct connection \nbetween global warming and the health of our Nation.\n  A warming planet will affect food, water, shelter, and the spread of \ninfectious diseases. At the same time, we will face more extreme \nweather events. Storms, floods, droughts, and heat waves will have an \nacute impact, particularly on hundreds of millions of people in the \ndeveloping world.\n  Climate change is very much a public health issue.\n  The science behind global warming is no longer debatable. Scientists \nfrom around the globe have stated in the strongest possible terms that \nthe climate is changing, and human activity is to blame. These changes \nare already dramatically affecting human health around the world.\n  The World Health Organization reported that the climate change which \noccurred from 1961 to 1990 may already be causing over 150,000 deaths \nor the loss of over 5.5 million disability-adjusted life years annually \nstarting in 2000.\n  These numbers are staggering, but they should not be surprising: \nclimate change influences our living environment on the most \nfundamental level, which means it affects the basic biological \nfunctions critical to life.\n  It impacts the air we breathe and the food available for us to eat. \nIt impacts the availability of our drinking water and the spread of \ndiseases that can make us sick.\n  Last year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report \non climate change put to rest the arguments of many skeptics. But the \nfrequently cited report of Working Group One is just one of three \nseparate IPCC reports. Working Group Two simultaneously issued a \nsobering report on the impacts of climate change. They predicted that \nup to 250 million people across Africa could face water shortages by \n2020, and that agriculture fed by rainfall could drop by 50 percent. \nCrop yields in central and South Asia could drop by 30 percent. People \neverywhere who depend on glaciers or snow pack for their drinking water \nwill be forced to find new supplies.\n  This is not speculation. These effects are already measurable. The \nWorld Health Organization predicts that asthma deaths will rise by 20 \npercent over the next 10 years, and that climate change is causing \ngreater outbreaks of Rift Valley fever and the spread of malaria in \nhigher elevations in Africa, and more frequent cholera epidemics in \nBangladesh. The CDC is preparing for more heat-wave planning and \nforecasting.\n  The public health costs of global climate change are likely to be \ngreatest to the nations of the world who have contributed least to the \nproblem. As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, we have a \nmoral obligation to help these countries, which are also least likely \nto have the resources to prepare or respond themselves. Any strategies \nfor managing climate change impacts must address this unequal burden, \nand to take into account their unique challenges and needs.\n  These impacts are different in different parts of the world--and \nequally troubling, they are disproportionately burdensome for the \nworld's more vulnerable populations. Children, the elderly, the poor, \nand those with chronic and other health conditions are the most \nvulnerable to the negative health impacts of climate change.\n  There is growing recognition that we must act, and we must act now. \nFortunately, many of the choices individuals should make for the sake \nof their health--and the health of their communities--are the same \nchoices that benefit the health of the planet. Making the climate \nchange issue real means helping people understand how the way they live \naffects themselves and others, whether through their transportation \nchoices, their use of water and electricity or the types of goods they \npurchase and consume.\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n  What is good to reduce global warming is good for public health, and \nthe shift away from fossil fuels and a movement toward general \nenvironmental awareness aligns with existing public health goals.\n  Clean, renewable energy means less dependence on fossil fuels. The \ncombination of less coal and cleaner coal leads to a host of health \nbenefits. Fewer particulate emissions mean less asthma. Reduced mercury \nemissions could lead to fewer developmental disorders.\n  The transportation sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse \ngases. Encouraging and enabling people to walk, bicycle, or use public \ntransportation reduces vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and improves \nurban air quality. But it simultaneously improves an individual's \nhealth by increasing physical activity. Improving community design to \nreduce reliance on cars also means less obesity and diabetes. We should \nbe encouraging States to design and create healthy communities.\n  We cannot wait to act. We should all continue to work toward national \nand international policies which fight global warming. And we will make \nsure that we act justly and help the poorest countries, which are \nhardest hit by this problem.\n  And we can start now. Now is the time to prepare our water, \nagricultural, and disease prevention systems for a warmer planet. Now \nis also the time to invest in renewable energy and to build pedestrian \nand bicycle friendly cities. What is good for the planet is good for \npublic health, and I encourage everyone to remember that solutions to a \nglobal problem can have immediate, individual benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2938-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2938-S2939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SECOND CHANCE ACT\n\n   Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nPresidential signing of a bill that was two and a half Congresses in \nthe making, the Second Chance Act. This bill, which focuses on \nreinventing the way in which we create prison reentry programs, will \nhave a dramatic and positive effect on hundreds of thousands of lives--\nlives that will be changed for the better.\n  I am equally pleased that the President signaled his support for this \nmuch needed legislation by hosting a bill signing ceremony this morning \nat the White House. I was delighted to join my colleagues in both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives, as well as the organizations \nthat helped make this bill a reality--it was truly a magnificent event.\n  Over 650,000 individuals will be released from our Federal and State \nprisons, and 9 million are released from jails. Approximately two out \nof every three individuals released from prison or jail commit more \ncrimes and will be rearrested within 3 years of release, placing \nincreasing financial burdens on our States and decreasing public \nsafety.\n  Recidivism is costly, in both personal and financial terms. Consider: \nThe American taxpayers spent approximately $9 billion per year on \ncorrections in 1982 and in 2002--nearly two decades later--taxpayers \nspent $60 billion. This current criminal justice system is not working, \ndoes not make our cities and States safer and is unacceptable and must \nbe addressed.\n  The Second Chance Act will address these major issues in the area of \ncorrections. By providing grant money to States through the Department \nof Justice and the Department of Labor, the bill encourages the \ncreation of innovative programs geared toward improving public safety, \ndecreasing the financial burden on States and successfully \nreintegrating ex-offenders into society.\n  Additionally, this bill authorizes two grant programs designed to aid \nnonprofit organizations--faith-based and community-based \norganizations--that provide programs to those incarcerated. As you may \nknow, faith-based programs are very successful in reintegrating \noffenders into society. A 2002 study found that faith-based prison \nprograms result in a significantly lower rate of re-arrest than \nvocation-based programs--16 percent versus 36 percent.\n  I and my Senate and House colleagues have worked extremely hard over \nthe past 4 years on this measure that encompasses Federal, State, \nlocal, and nonprofit programs. I would especially like to thank Ranking \nMember Specter, Chairman Biden, and Chairman Leahy. Our partnership \nover the last years has been a true testament to bipartisanship. We \nwere able to put aside our policy differences for the good of those in \nneed and come together on a bill that will provide hope and aid to \nthose incarcerated. The bill will also provide assistance to those most \nvulnerable and often overlooked--the children of incarcerated parents. \nNearly half of all prisoners have children, and it is estimated that \none in five of those children will follow their parent into the prison \nsystem--this broken system must change, and the Second Chance Act will \nfacilitate such needed change.\n  Indeed this bill is much needed and will serve as a catalyst for \nsystemic change. This bill is supported by the hard work and \ndetermination of over 200 organizations, such as Prison Fellowship \nMinistries, Open Society, the Council of State Governments, and the \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, as well as many State and local \ngovernment correction officials and law enforcement officials--a truly \nbipartisan/bicameral coalition of partners committed to changing the \ncriminal justice system.\n  I commend the tremendous--truly tremendous work these organizations \ncompleted on behalf of this bill. Without their partnership, the bill \nmay not have become reality. Through their perseverance and help, much \nneeded reentry resources will be funded to help give those in our \nprison system a second chance at life. Through substance abuse \nprograms, education, and job training programs, those incarcerated will \nbe given a second chance to be productive citizens. Perhaps most \nimportantly, prisoners will be given a second chance to reconnect with \ntheir families through family-based treatment and mentoring programs.\n  This is a monumental bill that will change the lives of countless \nindividuals and will keep our communities safer by reducing recidivism \nrates drastically--the goal, 50 percent in 5 years--and it can be done.\n  Kansas has proven it. In slightly less time than it took us to enact \nthis bill--3 years--Kansas cut their monthly revocation rate by 44 \npercent . . . 44 percent. I understand that they can also track the \nrecidivism rate for ex-offenders in the 12-18 months of a parolee's \nrelease. Even more striking, the State has been able to reduce, by 41 \npercent, the number of criminal convictions over the last 3 years--\nproving that reentry programs work.\n  This is amazing, and I know that with the aid of the Second Chance \nAct other States are on their way to these successes as well.\n  I would like to also take a moment to recognize State Representative \nPat Colloton from Kansas who was also here today to share in this \ncelebration and is one of the leaders in Kansas on this issue.\n  Mr. President, this has been a great day for the supporters of the \nSecond Chance Act.

CARSON POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, Senator Lugar and I honor Congresswoman \nJulia Carson by urging the Senate to support the legislation, S. 2534, \nwhich will designate a U.S. Post Office in Indianapolis in her name.\n  The U.S. Postal Service recommended the Mapleton Station Post Office \nin Indianapolis be the location named in her honor. Congresswoman \nCarson was not only instrumental in the erection of the new Mapleton \nStation, which opened its doors at a new location on July 15, 2005, but \nshe also attended the dedication ceremony for the new building on \nAugust 11, 2005. This new, attractive building will be a terrific sign \nof respect for her.\n  Congresswoman Carson was born on July 8, 1938, in Louisville, KY. \nWhen she was only 1 year old, Julia and her family moved to \nIndianapolis. Carson graduated from Crispus Attucks High School in 1955 \nand attended Martin University in Indianapolis and Indiana University-\nPurdue University at Indianapolis.\n  Julia Carson's political career began when she was working in the \nIndianapolis office of former Congressman Andy Jacobs, who served 15 \nterms as the Congressman from Indianapolis, 10th District, Indiana. \nJacobs encouraged Carson to run for the Indiana House of \nRepresentatives. Elected in 1972, Carson served in the Indiana House of \nRepresentatives for 4 years. In 1976, after serving in the Indiana \nHouse, Julia Carson successfully ran for a seat in the Indiana Senate, \nwhere she continued to serve Hoosiers for 14 years. In that position, \nJulia Carson gave unfailing support to Indiana's successful \nratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and supported legislation to \nimprove women's economic status, such as the bill she advocated to \ninclude household workers in the minimum wage.\n  After serving in the Indiana Senate, Carson became a trustee for \nCenter Township of Marion County, an area comprised of downtown \nIndianapolis, where she instituted aggressive measures to help the \ncity's homeless and trimmed the inflated welfare rolls by imposing new \nrules that required able-bodied recipients to work or attend school as \na condition of receiving poor relief. In 1992, Julia Carson was \ndeclared Woman of the Year by the Indianapolis Star for her efforts to \nimprove welfare and create a fiscal surplus in Marion County. Her \ndedication to Indianapolis continued to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In 1996, Andy Jacobson retired from the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and Carson successfully won his seat, representing \nwhat was then Indiana's 10th Congressional District. Representative \nJulia Carson is only the third woman and second African American to be \nelected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Indiana.\n  As Congresswoman, Julia Carson is best remembered for her leadership \nawarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks for her \ninstrumental role in the civil rights movement. Carson worked closely \nwith Senator Evan Bayh on initiatives to establish a program that would \npromote more responsible fatherhood by creating educational, economic, \nand employment opportunities. She also worked with\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\nSenator Richard Lugar to improve children's health care.\n  While in Congress, Julia Carson served on the Committee of Financial \nServices, the Subcommittee of Financial Services and Consumer Credit, \nthe Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, the Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, the Subcommittee on Railroads, \nPipelines and Hazardous Material, and the Subcommittee on Highways and \nTransit. Carson was also a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. \nThroughout her 10 years in Congress, Julia Carson worked tirelessly for \nthe poor and forgotten.\n  Shortly after announcing her diagnosis with terminal lung cancer, \nJulia Carson died on December 15, 2007, at age 69. At her funeral \nservice, those who spoke all said Carson, the daughter of an unwed \nteenage mother who worked as a housekeeper, never forgot where she came \nfrom. Therefore, it is only fitting that the Congress designate a post \noffice in the name of Julia M. Carson in her hometown of Indianapolis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2940-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE GEORGIAN CLUB\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor in the Record the \n25th anniversary of the Georgian Club, the first suburban city club in \nmetropolitan Atlanta.\n  The citizens of Cobb County immediately embraced the Georgian Club \nwhen it first opened its doors on April 19, 1983. I was proud to be a \nfounding board member and I am proud to serve as chairman of the board \nof directors today.\n  With its breathtaking view of the Atlanta skyline, the Georgian Club \noffers unparalleled service, fine dining, and a relaxed atmosphere. Its \nconsistently high standards ensure an enjoyable experience every time.\n  Many great leaders of Georgia have graced the halls of the Georgian \nClub, including my predecessor here in the U.S. Senate, Zell Miller, my \ncolleague, Senator Saxby Chambliss, former Speaker of the House, Newt \nGingrich, and President Jimmy Carter.\n  The Georgian Club is the vision of Jim Rhoden who has contributed to \nCobb County and Georgia in countless civic and charitable ways.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize in the U.S. Senate the 25th anniversary of the Georgian Club. \nThe Georgian Club is a wonderful asset to our community and I \ncongratulate this fine establishment on its well-deserved \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2940-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DICK HALLIBURTON\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me \ntoday in honoring Dick Halliburton, an accomplished advocate at Legal \nAid of Western Missouri. He has fought tirelessly for 38 years for the \nrights of low-income Missourians, first as a Legal Aid of Western \nMissouri, LAWMO, attorney and for the last 20 years as LAWMO's \nexecutive director. During his time as executive director, LAWMO's \nstaff has represented clients in more than 250,000 cases--obtaining \nthousands of protective orders for victims of domestic violence, \npreventing thousands of unlawful evictions, obtaining safe and \naffordable public and federally subsidized housing for thousands of \nfamilies; and obtaining Medicaid, SSI and other public benefits for \nthousands of Missourians.\n  His work has empowered low-income people throughout western Missouri, \nby giving them the means to assert and protect their legal rights in \ncourt. Without his leadership, many low-income people throughout \nWestern Missouri would not have had meaningful access to the civil \njustice system.\n  Dick has worked for years as a governor of the Missouri bar to \nadvocate for the interest of low-income people. This work has \nencouraged the bar to provide direct funding for Missouri's legal \nservices programs and to advocate for State funding for legal services, \nwhich the programs now receive.\n  He has led LAWMO through many difficult challenges. Through it all, \nhe has maintained the integrity of the program and made sure that LAWMO \ncontinues to provide high quality legal services that meet its clients' \nneeds.\n  Dick has greatly increased private donations, grants and other non-\nLSC funding for the program. When he began as executive director, LSC \nfunding accounted for well over half of LAWMO's budget. Now it is \nbarely a quarter of the organization's budget.\n  Dick has trained and nurtured one of the most experienced and well-\nrespected groups of case handlers in any legal services program in the \ncountry, and those case handlers have achieved consistently high-\nquality results for their clients.\n  Dick's work takes into account the words and commitment to public \nservice of Reginald Heber Smith, who in his book, ``Justice and the \nPoor,'' stated:\n\n       Without equal access to the law, the system not only robs \n     the poor of their only protection, but it places it in the \n     hands of their oppressors the most powerful and ruthless \n     weapon ever created.\n\n  In short, Dick Halliburton has made Missouri's justice system more \naccessible for low-income people and, in doing so, he has improved the \nlives of all Missourians. We are sincerely grateful for his \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2940-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I honor the University of \nSouth Dakota Coyotes women's basketball team on their second place \nfinish in the 2008 NCAA Division II Tournament. This was USD's first \ntrip to the National Championship game.\n  The USD women's basketball team has a long history of success, \nincluding three NCC Conference Championships from 1982 to 1985, as well \nas eight appearances in the NCAA Division II National Tournament. South \nDakota, which concluded the season with a 33 and 2 overall record, won \nthe North Central Conference with a 12 and 0 record. This was USD's \nfinal season in Division II athletics and it was undoubtedly one of the \nbest in school history.\n  Certainly, this historic season would not have been possible without \nthe players themselves. The members of the 2007-2008 University of \nSouth Dakota women's basketball team are as follows: Natalie Carda, \nShannon Daly, Michelle Dirks, Anne Doshier, Kelli Fargen, Amber Hegge, \nJeana Hoffman, Jenna Hoffman, Kara Iverson, Jasmine Mosley, Amy \nRobinette, Ashley Robinette, Annie Roche, Kendra Schomer, Bridget \nYoerger, Maggie Youngberg.\n  Although this accomplishment was truly a team effort, I would like to \npay special recognition to their coach Chad Lavin, who will be retiring \nafter 14 years with the USD women's basketball team. Coach Lavin is \nUSD's career wins leader with 271. Lavin's coaching success has not \ngone unnoticed as he has been named the NCC Coach of the Year four \ndifferent times and has been selected as the Russell Athletic/WBCA \nNorth Central Regional Coach of the Year for the 2007-2008 season.\n  The coaches and student athletes of USD's women's basketball team \nshould be very proud of all of their remarkable achievements this \nseason. On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am pleased to say \ncongratulations to the Coyotes on this impressive season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2940-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2940-S2941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL'S BASKETBALL TEAMS\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk \nto the Senate and America about the great pride that I and other \nOregonians are feeling about the recent championships of Jefferson High \nSchool's girls' and boys' basketball teams, the Democrats. Both teams \nhave been crowned winners of the 2008 5A state championship, \nrespectively. Both the boys' and girls' basketball teams have had \namazing seasons. In fact, Jefferson is the first high school in 5A \nhistory to ever win dual championships in the same season. This is an \nextraordinary accomplishment for a school that has only 600 kids in \ntheir student body and competes with schools that are much larger in \nsize all the time.\n  The championships capped a regular season in which both teams turned \nin performances that were unprecedented in Oregon sports history. The \nJefferson girls went undefeated with a regular season record of 27-0 \nand won their championship against a very tough Hermiston team on March \n8, 2008. The\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nJefferson boys had a regular season record of 24-1. They duplicated the \ngirls' victory the following weekend on March 15, 2008 by winning their \nfirst state championship in the 5A Division against a very good \nCorvallis team.\n  Both teams showed an incredible amount of determination; they proved \ntheir great will to win and displayed a spirit that would not allow \nthem to give up. As a former basketball player myself, I know how hard \nit is to win and play at a high level for multiple games. I am \nespecially proud because Jefferson High School has a special place in \nmy heart. When I started my public career in Portland, I lived in the \nJefferson district, so I always feel like it is home.\n  I learned a long time ago that the Jefferson community is the heart \nand soul of Portland. That is why I want all of my colleagues in the \nSenate and people around the country to know about the Jefferson \nDemocrats' Herculean efforts and achievements. These two teams \nexemplify the character and true values of Oregonians by proving that \nhard work can lead to great success. They have shown that if you really \nwork at something and are persistent, you can get the job done on and \noff the hardwood.\n  I want to salute all the members of the girls' basketball team and \nacknowledge the exceptional play of their starting lineup Janita Badon, \nDequise Hammick, Nyesha Sims, Ariel Reynolds, and Tyrisha Blake who \nhave proven to be the best girls' starting lineup in Oregon. Without \nthe solid contributions from Jasmine Smith, Arquazia Jackson, Daniel \nDixon, Debbie Blackmon, Arqueisha Preston, Hollisha Watson, Denaya \nBrazzle and Adreya Hudson, the Democrats would not have won a state \nchampionship. They also had great leadership that took them all the way \nto the championship, starting with their head coach, Michael Bontempts, \nand his outstanding assistant coaching staff.\n  I also want to salute the members of the boys' basketball team who \ncarried on the tradition of winning that has been built by so many \nJefferson champions who came before them community and business leaders \nlike Tony Hopson, Ray Leary, Aaron Miles, and Michael Lee. Each of them \nbegan at Jefferson and went on to become winners in life after winning \nchampionships on the court. It will not surprise me when I read about \nthe huge individual successes that these stellar players from the 2008 \nchampionship teams will have in their future. Oregonians everywhere \nwill surely be watching as they go off to pursue great things.\n  So I applaud all the players on the boys' basketball team along with \ntheir head coach, Marshall Haskins, and his coaching staff. They put \ntogether a great starting line-up for the 2007-2008 season, including \nTerrance Jones, Terrance Ross, Tyrone White, Kalonji Paschel, Henry \nWilliams and Jordan Black who is known as the best sixth man in 5A \nbasketball. The Jefferson boys' roster was loaded with talent that gave \nthem an option of a second starting line up that often made it \ndifficult for teams to prepare for them when Darrel Nelson, Noah Kone, \nJonathan Hall, Marlon Miles, Alexander Johnson, Robert Price, and \nRashad Dent entered the game.\n  Jefferson keeps winning against all odds. They are true champions and \nan inspiration for all Americans both on and off the court. Their \ncommitment and dedication to hard work has given me a new reason to be \nproud that I am an Oregonian. I will savor this unique moment in our \nState's sports history along with my fellow 3 million Oregonians as I \ncongratulate both the girls' and boys' Democrats on a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2941-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2941-S2942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2419) to \nprovide for the continuation of agricultural programs through fiscal \nyear 2012, and for other purposes, and agrees to the conference asked \nby the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.\n  Ordered, that the following Members be the managers of the conference \non the part of the House:\n  From the Committee on Agriculture, for consideration of the House \nbill (except title XII) and the Senate amendment (except sections \n12001, 12201-12601, and 12701-12808), and modifications committed to \nconference: Messrs.

A bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and title 46, \nUnited States Code, to establish a marine emergency protocol and \nrequirements for double-hulling of vessel fuel tanks; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation. The Marine Emergency Protocol and Hull \nRequirement Act will take two major steps in preventing oilspills.\n  First, the bill directs the United States Coast Guard to control and \noversee a vessel's route and speed during dangerous conditions. This \noversight is critical to protect our ships during an attack or in \nconditions of low visibility.\n  Second, the bill will keep dangerous oil and fuel out of our \nwaterways by mandating that all large cargo ships reinforce their fuel \ntanks with double hulls. By doing so, many of the small mishaps that \noccur will not lead to major oilspills.\n  San Franciscans learned the hard way that further precautions and \nregulations are needed.\n  Last November, in my hometown, a large cargo ship carrying over \n100,000 gallons of fuel, ran into the San Francisco Bay Bridge. The \ndamaged ship poured 53,000 gallons of oil into the bay.\n  In the following hours and days there was confusion, it was difficult \nto obtain accurate information, and there was a general sense of \nfrustration felt by Bay Area residents.\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n  Here is what we knew:\n  On the foggy November morning, visibility was very low--less than a \nquarter of a mile--in the San Francisco Bay.\n  Under these low visibility conditions the Cosco Busan, a large 900-\nfoot-long cargo ship, decided to leave for its destination despite the \npoor conditions.\n  As the ship proceeded towards the Bay Bridge, the captain was advised \nby the Coast Guard that his vessel may be off course. However the Coast \nGuard did nothing to stop the ship, which they knew was heading \ndirectly towards a pillar of the bridge.\n  Despite the warnings and the poor visibility, the ship continued to \nspeed toward the bridge until it collided.\n  The fact is this: The Coast Guard's actions did not stop the ship \nfrom running into the pier.\n  It is the responsibility of the Coast Guard to make sure that \npreventable oilspills are prevented. Sector Commanders and Vessel \nTraffic Service officers track ships as they traverse harbors across \nthe country. In this case they could see that the ship was off course, \nyet they did nothing. This is unacceptable.\n  The Marine Emergency Protocol and Hull Requirement Act will mandate \nthat the Coast Guard act to stop a ship--such as the Cosco Busan--that \nis dangerously off course.\n  Yes, there was substantial human error that led to this oilspill. \nThat is unquestionable. But the fact remains that the Coast Guard had \nan opportunity to stop this ship, and it did not.\n  The bill directs the Sector Commander of the Coast Guard, that is the \ntop official within each of the Coast Guard's 35 regions, to assume \ndirect authority of all vessels during conditions of enhanced danger, \nsuch as low visibility or an attack.\n\n  By doing this, we will create a central system where all decisions \nare made. There will not be any confusion about who should do what, or \nwhen, or how. This way, during emergency conditions when confusion \nabounds, all orders are coming from one central source.\n  The Sector Commander will have the authority to stop ships, change \ntheir course, or return them to a safe harbor. They will have the \nauthority to alter the course of one ship, or of all ships. This \nauthority is necessary to ensure safe navigation of dangerous \nwaterways.\n  Yet even in a perfect world, the Coast Guard cannot stop all \noilspills. Sometimes the circumstances are out of their control.\n  That is why we need to make sure that the ships in our waterways take \nall reasonable precautions to protect against spilling oil.\n  The Marine Emergency Protocol and Hull Requirement Act also mandates \nthat all cargo vessels are built with, or install, double hull \ncontainment structures around their petroleum based fuel tanks. Doing \nso keeps small mishaps and collisions from turning into major \noilspills.\n  The extra layer of protection was required for oil tankers under the \nOil Pollution Act of 1990, OPA 90.\n  Following the 11-million gallon Exxon Valdez tragedy in 1989, new \nrestrictions on oil tankers were at the center of the debate on how to \nprevent another catastrophic oilspill. The result of the OPA 90 \nlegislation has been remarkable.\n  Compared to the 15 years before the enactment of the Oil Pollution \nAct, the following 15 years have seen a 90-percent drop in oilspills \nover 100,000 gallons.\n  In the same time period, there has been a 79-percent drop in spills \nless than 100,000 gallons.\n  By 2015 there will be no single-hull tank vessels operating in U.S. \nwaters. As of 2010, only 5 percent of domestic and only 4 percent of \nforeign tank vessels will still have a single hull. Nearly 90 percent \nhad single hulls in 1990.\n  These are incredible successes. Unfortunately one other statistic \nsticks out.\n  Since 1990, 90 percent of all oilspills have been from non-tank \nvessels.\n  Clearly, this illustrates the need for cargo ships, the main culprit \nof oilspills in recent years, to be subject to the Oil Pollution Act \nstandards.\n  In 1990, cargo ships were left out because relatively, they carried \nmuch less oil. However, newer, larger cargo ships carry hundreds of \nthousands of gallons of oil as fuel, and this oil still poses a grave \nenvironmental threat.\n  In the Cosco Busan incident, and dozens of other catastrophic \noilspills around the world, it was fuel oil that ended up in the water, \nnot cargo oil. Of course this oil is just as deadly, yet under current \nlaw it is treated differently.\n  It is time to close this loophole.\n  The Marine Emergency Protocol and Hull Requirement Act also provides \na reasonable timeframe for implementing these standards.\n  In the 1990 bill, Congress adopted a sliding scale for when vessels \nneeded to have applied the appropriate double hull protections. The \ntimetable was developed to allow shipping companies and ship owners to \nplan for the additional costs--and up to 15 years to implement them. \nUnder this bill, we will adopt the same time-tested schedule and apply \nit to the conversion of cargo vessels.\n  The Marine Emergency Protocol and Hull Requirement Act is a \ncommonsense bill that will unquestionably make our waters safer.\n  In an emergency situation, be it an attack or a condition of low \nvisibility, the Coast Guard must assume authority over a ship in \ndanger. It is their responsibility to guide the vessel to safety. This \nbill clarifies that they have the authority to do so, and it mandates \nthat they follow through.\n  Similarly, vessels carrying a large volume of oil--be it as cargo or \nas fuel--have the responsibility to take reasonable steps to prevent \nthat oil from spilling.\n  In the event of even a minor accident, a single hull breach is a very \nreal possibility. This is why we mandated that oil tankers implement a \ndouble containment system in 1990.\n  It has come time to close this loophole and call all oil, oil. Fuel \noil is just as detrimental and just as deadly as oil that is carried in \nthe cargo hold of a ship.

A bill to amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to allow \nFederal home loan banks to invest surplus funds in student loan \nsecurities and make advances for student loan financing, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, to many young people, from all walks of \nlife, are either struggling to pay for college or flat out can't afford \nit. Those who aren't able to incur the steep costs of a college \neducation are not only losing out on a degree, but setting themselves \nup to face a lifetime of lost opportunities, as study after study shows \ncollege graduates are the most attractive candidates for the fastest-\ngrowing and best-paying jobs of tomorrow. Greater college access, \ngained through financial assistance, is critical to making the American \ndream a reality for all.\n  Yet prospective student borrowers are about to encounter massive \nimpediments to acquiring quality, affordable private loans. The credit \ncrunch currently impacting the home mortgage sector is set to extend to \nthe student loan marketplace. Without sufficient liquidity in the \nmarket, student borrowers will find it harder and harder to find loans \nfor their costs of college next year. According to FinAid.org, student \nloan originators are increasingly choosing to exit or suspend their \nparticipation in all or part of the Federal Family Education Loan \nProgram, FFELP--45 since last August alone.\n  Unfortunately, however, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bemanke has \nindicated that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to take aggressive \naction at this time to help the student loan marketplace. Therefore, I \nam seeking to address this significant issue by introducing the \nEmergency Student Loan Market Liquidity Act.\n  This legislation will temporarily amend the Federal Home Loan Bank \nAct to allow the Federal Home Loan Banks to invest surplus funds not \nneeded for advances to its member banks for student loan-related \nsecurities. It would also allow the Federal Home Loan Banks to accept \nstudent loans and student loan-related securities as collateral. \nFinally, the bill authorizes each Federal Home loan Bank to provide \nsecured advances to its members\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nto originate student loans or finance student loan-related activities. \nThis will provide funds for banks to help provide critically-needed \nstudent loans during these difficult economic times.\n  The Federal Home Loan Banks are today an essential source of stable, \nlow-cost funds to financial institutions for home mortgage, small \nbusiness, and rural and agricultural loans. With their members, the \nFederal Home Loan Banks represent one of the largest sources of home \nmortgage and community credit. There are twelve Federal Home Loan \nBanks, including one in Boston, each located in different regions of \nthe country. Their cooperative structure is ideal for serving the \nsystem's 8,100 member lenders.\n  Today, the Federal Home Loan Banks provide billions of dollars of \nprimary liquidity to approximately 80 percent of the Nation's financial \ninstitutions. By providing this additional student loan authorization \nto its members, member institutions will be able to remain active in \nthe student loan marketplace and help students pay for their education.\n  This legislation is absolutely vital to securing the opportunity of \nhigher education for all who choose to pursue it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2950-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 510--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                    CYSTIC FIBROSIS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 510\n\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis is one of the most common life-\n     threatening genetic diseases in the United States and one for \n     which there is no known cure;\n       Whereas the average life expectancy of an individual with \n     cystic fibrosis is 37 years, an improvement from a life \n     expectancy in the 1960s where children did not live long \n     enough to attend elementary school, but still unacceptably \n     short;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States \n     have cystic fibrosis, more than half of them children;\n       Whereas 1 of every 3,500 babies born in the United States \n     is born with cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas more than 10,000,000 Americans are unknowing, \n     symptom-free carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     recommend that all States consider newborn screening for \n     cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation urges all States to \n     implement newborn screening for cystic fibrosis to facilitate \n     early diagnosis and treatment which improves health and life \n     expectancy;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     cystic fibrosis can extend the lives of people who have the \n     disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in cystic fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in gene, protein, and drug therapies \n     beneficial to people who have the disease;\n       Whereas innovative research is progressing faster and is \n     being conducted more aggressively than ever before, due, in \n     part, to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's establishment of a \n     model clinical trials network;\n       Whereas, although the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation continues \n     to fund a research pipeline for more than 30 potential \n     therapies and funds a nationwide network of care centers that \n     extend the length and quality of life for people with cystic \n     fibrosis, lives continue to be lost to this disease every \n     day;\n       Whereas education of the public about cystic fibrosis, \n     including the symptoms of the disease, increases knowledge \n     and understanding of cystic fibrosis and promotes early \n     diagnosis; and\n       Whereas the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will conduct \n     activities to honor National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month \n     in May 2008: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the goals and ideals of National Cystic Fibrosis \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the promotion of further public awareness and \n     understanding of cystic fibrosis;\n       (3) encourages early diagnosis and access to quality care \n     for people with cystic fibrosis to improve the quality of \n     their lives; and\n       (4) supports research to find a cure for cystic fibrosis by \n     fostering an enhanced research program through a strong \n     Federal commitment and expanded public-private partnerships.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2950-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2950-S2951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 511--RECOGNIZING THAT JOHN SIDNEY McCAIN III, IS A \n                          NATURAL BORN CITIZEN\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Obama, Mr. Coburn, Mrs. \nClinton, and Mr. Webb) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 511\n\n       Whereas the Constitution of the United States requires \n     that, to be eligible for the Office of the President, a \n     person must be a ``natural born Citizen'' of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the term ``natural born Citizen'', as that term \n     appears in Article II, Section 1, is not defined in the \n     Constitution of the United States;\n       Whereas there is no evidence of the intention of the \n     Framers or any Congress to limit the constitutional rights of \n     children born to Americans serving in the military nor to \n     prevent those children from serving as their country's \n     President;\n       Whereas such limitations would be inconsistent with the \n     purpose and intent of the ``natural born Citizen'' clause of \n     the Constitution of the United States, as evidenced by the \n     First Congress's own statute defining the term ``natural born \n     Citizen'';\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced by the men and women who are \n     assigned to serve our country outside of our national \n     borders;\n       Whereas previous presidential candidates, were born outside \n     of the United States of America and were understood to be \n     eligible to be President; and\n       Whereas John Sidney McCain, III, was born to American \n     citizens on an American military base in the Panama Canal \n     Zone in 1936: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That John Sidney McCain, III, is a ``natural born \n     Citizen'' under Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join Senator Claire McCaskill in \nintroducing a resolution to express the common sense of everyone here \nthat Senator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen,'' as the term is used \nin the Constitution of the United States. Our Constitution contains \nthree requirements for a person to be eligible to be President--the \nperson must have reached the age of 35; must have resided in America \nfor 14 years; and must be a ``natural born Citizen'' of the United \nStates. Certainly there is no doubt that Senator McCain is of \nsufficient years on this earth and in this country given that he has \nbeen serving in Washington for over 25 years. However, some pundits \nhave raised the question of whether he is a ``natural born Citizen'' \nbecause he was born outside of the official borders of the United \nStates.\n  John Sidney McCain, III, was born to American citizens on an American \nNaval base in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936. Numerous legal scholars \nhave looked into the purpose and intent of the ``natural born Citizen'' \nrequirement. As far as I am aware, no one has unearthed any reason to \nthink that the Framers would have wanted to limit the rights of \nchildren born to military families stationed abroad or that such a \nlimited view would serve any noble purpose enshrined in our founding \ndocument. Based on the understanding of the pertinent sources of \nconstitutional meaning, it is widely believed that if someone is born \nto American citizens anywhere in the world they are natural born \ncitizens.\n   It is interesting to note that another previous presidential \ncandidate, George Romney, was also born outside of the United States. \nHe was widely understood to be eligible to be President. Senator Barry \nGoldwater was born in a U.S. territory that later became the State of \nArizona so some even questioned his eligibility. Certainly the millions \nof Americans who voted for these two Republican candidates believed \nthat they were eligible to assume the office of the President. The same \nis true today.\n   Because he was born to American citizens, there is no doubt in my \nmind that Senator McCain is a natural born citizen. I recently asked \nSecretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, a former Federal \njudge, if he had any doubts in his mind. He did not.\n   I expect that this will be a unanimous resolution of the Senate and \nI thank the Senator from Missouri for working with me on this.\n   I ask unanimous consent that the relevant excerpt from the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing where Secretary Chertoff testified be made a part of \nthe Record.\n\n       Excerpt of Secretary Chertoff Testimony From April 2, 2008\n\n        Chairman LEAHY. We will come back to that. I would mention \n     one other thing, if I might, Senator Specter. Let me just ask \n     this: I believe--and we have had some question in this \n     Committee to have a special law\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\n     passed declaring that Senator McCain, who was born in the \n     Panama Canal, that he meets the constitutional requirement to \n     be President. I fully believe he does. I have never had any \n     question in my mind that he meets our constitutional \n     requirement. You are a former Federal judge. You are the head \n     of the agency that executes Federal immigration law. Do you \n     have any doubt in your mind--I mean, I have none in mine. Do \n     you have any doubt in your mind that he is constitutionally \n     eligible to become President?\n        Secretary CHERTOFF.

Res. 512\n\n       Whereas the United States has lost a great patriot with the \n     passing of Charlton Heston;\n       Whereas Charlton Heston first became beloved by the Nation \n     as a great actor and portrayed many heroic figures, including \n     Moses, Michelangelo, Andrew Jackson, John the Baptist, Mark \n     Antony, and El Cid in epic movies of the 1950s and 1960s, and \n     won the 1959 Best Actor Academy Award (Oscar) for playing the \n     title character in ``Ben-Hur'';\n       Whereas Charlton Heston was a leader in many areas of life \n     outside of acting, including serving as president of the \n     Screen Actors Guild, which he helped to integrate with Ronald \n     Reagan, and as chairman of the American Film Institute;\n       Whereas Charlton Heston was an active supporter of the \n     civil rights movement, including protesting the showing of \n     his film at a segregated movie theater in Oklahoma City and \n     participating in and leading the Arts Group in the 1963 civil \n     rights march on Washington;\n       Whereas, in the last major public role of his life, \n     Charlton Heston was president of the National Rifle \n     Association from June 1998 until April 2003;\n       Whereas, as president of the National Rifle Association, \n     Charlton Heston was a stalwart defender of the 2nd Amendment \n     right of citizens to keep and bear arms and was an active and \n     effective promoter of wildlife management through hunting;\n       Whereas in 2003 Charlton Heston was awarded the \n     Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian \n     honor;\n       Whereas Charlton Heston was born in Evanston, Illinois, on \n     October 4, 1923, and his parents moved to St. Helen, \n     Michigan, where he grew up;\n       Whereas in 1943 Charlton Heston enlisted in the Army Air \n     Forces and served as a radio-gunner in the Aleutian Islands \n     of Alaska, and in 1947 he was discharged from the Army;\n       Whereas in 1944 Charlton Heston married the love of his \n     life, Lydia Clarke, to whom he had been married 64 years at \n     his death;\n       Whereas Charlton and Lydia Heston are the parents of 2 \n     children, Fraser Heston and Holly Heston Rochell;\n       Whereas Charlton Heston passed away on April 5, 2008, and \n     the contributions he made to his family and his Nation will \n     not be forgotten: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, achievements, and contributions of \n     Charlton Heston; and\n       (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the family of \n     Charlton Heston for the loss of such a great and generous \n     man, husband, and father.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2951-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 75--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO APPOINT DOCTORS \n      OF CHIROPRACTIC AS COMMISSIONED OFFICERS IN THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Harkin) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 75\n\n       Whereas the Secretary of Defense has statutory authority \n     under section 3070 of title 10, United States Code, to \n     appoint doctors of chiropractic as commissioned officers in \n     the Armed Forces, but has not yet made such appointments;\n       Whereas the urgent needs of military personnel in the field \n     of operations include access to the widest possible range of \n     health care options, especially in the area of care of the \n     spine and related structures of the body;\n       Whereas providing military personnel in the field of \n     operations with access to chiropractic care will increase the \n     cost effectiveness of military health care expenditures by \n     taking advantage of the conservative, drugless, and non-\n     surgical care option offered by chiropractic care;\n       Whereas back injuries are the leading cause of lost service \n     time and disability in the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas military personnel in the field of operations or on \n     shipboard can access chiropractic care only through \n     commissioned chiropractic officers;\n       Whereas access to chiropractic care through commissioned \n     chiropractic officers will enhance the combat readiness of \n     military personnel by offering a non-pharmaceutical option \n     for the health care needs of such personnel; and\n       Whereas the appointment of doctors of chiropractic as \n     commissioned offices will make use of a highly skilled and \n     trained pool of health care professionals and help to meet \n     the growing demand for chiropractic care in the Armed Forces: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Secretary of Defense should take immediate steps to establish \n     a career path for doctors of chiropractic to be appointed as \n     commissioned officers in all branches of the Armed Forces for \n     purposes of providing chiropractic services to members of the \n     Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2951-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4523.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Congress took a major step toward \nmaking a remarkable difference in the lives of some of our Nation's \nmost deserving citizens: our soldiers and our children with brain \ninjuries.\n  I commend our colleagues, Congressmen Pascrell and Platts, as well as \nmy friend and cosponsor in the Senate, Senator Hatch, on all they have \ndone to achieve passage of this legislation. It is an important and \ntimely bill that helps an especially deserving group of people.\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\n  Traumatic brain injuries have become the signature wound of the war \nin Iraq. Up to two-thirds of our wounded soldiers may have suffered \nsuch injuries.\n  In the civilian population here at home, an unacceptably large number \nof children from birth to age 14 experience traumatic brain injuries \napproximately 475,000 a year and some of the most frequent of these \ninjuries are to children under the age of 5. In Massachusetts alone, \nmore than 40,000 individuals experience these injuries each year.\n  As a result of these injuries, over 5.3 million Americans are now \nliving with a permanent disability. Today, we have taken another step \ntoward ensuring that these citizens and their families will receive the \nbest services we can provide.\n  The legislation reauthorizes grants that assist States, territories, \nand the District of Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated \nsystems of community-based services and supports for persons with such \ninjuries.\n  The legislation also reauthorizes an important provision, the \nProtection and Advocacy for Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury \nProgram. This program, enacted by Congress in 2000, has become \nessential because persons with these injuries have an array of needs \nbeyond treatment and health care. Protection and advocacy services \ninclude assistance in returning to work, finding a place to live, \nobtaining supports and services such as attendant care and assistive \ntechnology, and obtaining appropriate mental health, substance abuse, \nand rehabilitation services.\n  Often these persons especially our returning veterans must remain in \nextremely expensive institutions far longer than necessary, because the \ncommunity-based supports and services they need are not available, even \nthough they can lead to reduced government expenditures, increased \nproductivity, greater independence and community involvement. Those who \nprovide such assistance must have special skills, and their work is \noften time-intensive.\n  The legislation also allocates funds for CDC programs that provide \nimportant information and data on injury prevention of these injuries. \nA recent Institute of Medicine report demonstrated that these programs \nwork. Their benefit is obvious, and we must do all we can to expand \nthis appropriation in the years ahead to meet the urgent and growing \nneed for this assistance.\n  A recent report by the Institute of Medicine calls the current TBI \nprograms an ``overall success.'' It states that ``there is considerable \nvalue in providing funding,'' and ``it is worrisome that the modestly \nbudgeted TBI Program continues to be vulnerable to budget cuts.''\n  Current estimates show that the Federal Government spends less than \n$3 per brain injury survivor on research and services. As the IOM study \nsuggests, this program must be able to expand, so that each State will \nhave the resources needed to maintain vital services and advocacy for \nthe large number of Americans who sustain such injuries each year.\n  Enactment of this bipartisan legislation will bring us a giant step \ncloser to strengthening these vital programs for these deserving \nindividuals and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/10/senate-section/article/S2954-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--H.R. 123\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.
