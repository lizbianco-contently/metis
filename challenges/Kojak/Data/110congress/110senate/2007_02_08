I have known Henry Holley for \n30 years, his beautiful wife Betty and his daughter Debbie, who are \nwith us today. I have known him in many ways. I would like the Senate \nto know, first of all, that this is a U.S. marine. For 22 years, he \nserved the United States of America in the Marine Corps and retired in \n1966, upon which time he joined the Billy Graham organization and for \nthe last 40 years has traveled 12 million miles to countries around the \nworld. He leads now the Graham evangelical organization throughout the \nPacific rim. His reach is so important that it is countless millions of \npeople. One evening in\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\n1990, in Hong Kong, Dr. Henry Holley and Dr. Graham preached the Gospel \nto more than 100,000 people in Asia.\n  But he has a special reach. He has a reach around the corner and \naround the world. Just about any Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday in \nMarietta, GA, at the Caribou Coffeehouse, which has been renamed the \nCaribou Cathedral, Henry holds court with countless individuals in our \ncommunity, celebrating the joy of our life and the belief of his faith. \nAnd this Friday or Saturday he takes off again on his third trip, third \ntrip to Korea and to China--this year. He will travel, before this year \nis out, probably a quarter of a million miles to countries around the \nworld. He probably knows more leaders of business and politics, of \nGovernment and of religion than any single individual in the United \nStates of America.\n\n  It is an honor and a privilege for me to introduce him to the Senate, \nbut it is a greater privilege to know him as a friend, a pastor, and a \nmentor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1732-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence, I wish to talk a bit this morning about the all-\nimportant war against terrorism and particularly the sources of funding \nthat allow the terrorists to obtain the resources with which they \nconduct this war.\n  It is impossible to talk about funding terrorism without mentioning \nSaudi Arabia. With its extraordinary oil wealth, the Saudis have a \ntremendous economy which is home to many strains of extremist Islamist \nthought. Over the years, the combination of wealth and extremism has \nproved to be a volatile combination.\n  A few years ago, a telethon in Saudi Arabia raised more than $100 \nmillion for the families of ``Palestinian martyrs,'' a group which \nreportedly included suicide bombers. According to public news reports, \nSaudi Arabia's ruler, King Fahd, ordered the fundraising drive as a way \nto channel public anger in the kingdom against the United States and \nIsrael.\n  Just because the Saudis are no longer holding telethons for \nterrorists does not mean that they aren't providing substantial funding \nfor terrorism in other ways.\n  A number of Government agencies have noted that Saudi Arabia is a \nsource of funding for hate-filled extremist ideologies, but Saudi-based \nsupport for terrorism does not stop there. In fact, it may be a part, a \nsmall part of what we face in this war against terrorism. According to \nthe State Department, Saudi donors and unregulated charities have been \na major source of funding and support, not just for groups that preach \nradical ideologies but for actual terrorist organizations.\n  I wish to cite now some specific examples. An examination of the \npublic record reveals clear connections with some of the world's most \ninfamous organizations, such as al-Qaida. The staff of the 9/11 \nCommission, for example, noted that the intelligence community \nidentified Saudi Arabia as the ``primary source of money for al-Qaida \nboth before and after the September 11th attacks.'' They went on to say \n``fundraisers and facilitators throughout Saudi Arabia and the Gulf \nraised money for al-Qaida from witting and unwitting donors and \ndivert[ed] funds from Islamic charities and mosques.''\n  The Iraq Study Group, to look at another effort to examine these \nissues, stated that ``Funding for the Sunni insurgency in Iraq comes \nfrom private donors in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states,'' and Iraqi \nofficials have reportedly asked the Saudi Government to do more to \nlimit the support that these donors provide to Iraqi insurgents.\n  The State Department has reported that private Saudi donors are a \nprimary source of funding for Hamas.\n  Early last year, Ambassador Crumpton, the State Department's \ncoordinator for counterterrorism, told a House subcommittee that the \nSaudi Government, ``had made a bit of progress in reducing the flow of \nfunds from Saudi Arabia to Hamas and other Palestinian rejection \ngroups, but conceded that the money funding these terrorists is still \ngoing on.''\n  Other governments have gone even further in their statements with \nrespect to the funding of terrorism. In the fall of 2005, Israeli \nofficials announced they arrested an individual, who they claimed was \nacting as a courier between Hamas members in the Palestinian \nterritories and Hamas members in Saudi Arabia. No other governments \nhave confirmed this, but if it is correct, it certainly raises a host \nof troubling questions. Clearly, one can see that the threat posed by \nthese donors goes beyond the spread of religious intolerance and \nextremely dogmatic forms of Islam. Rather, money is flowing from Saudi \nArabia to support insurgent groups in Iraq; money is flowing from Saudi \nArabia to Palestinian terrorist groups such as Hamas; money is flowing \nfrom Saudi Arabia to al-Qaida.\n  Under Secretary of the Treasury Stewart Levey summed up this \nsituation pretty clearly. He said:\n\n       Is money leaving Saudi Arabia to fund terrorism abroad? \n     Yes. Undoubtedly some of that money is going to Iraq, it's \n     going to Southeast Asia, and it's going to other places where \n     there are terrorists. There is money leaving Saudi Arabia.\n\n  I think it is also appropriate to put this in the context of what it \nmeans to folks this Pennsylvania and Oregon and everywhere else, and in \neffect what happens when you pull up at a gas station in Pennsylvania \nand Oregon is you are paying a terror tax. A portion of what you pay \nfor gasoline in Pennsylvania or Oregon or elsewhere, in effect, finds \nits way eventually to the Government of Saudi Arabia, and then we see \nthat the Saudis end up back-dooring it to various kinds of terrorist \norganizations.\n  The Government Accountability Office describes this problem very \nsuccinctly, stating it this way:\n\n       Saudi Arabia's multibillion-dollar petroleum industry, \n     although largely owned by the government, has fostered the \n     creation of large private fortunes, enabling many wealthy \n     Saudis to sponsor charities and educational foundations whose \n     operations extend to many countries. Government and other \n     expert reports have linked some Saudi donations to the global \n     propagation of religious intolerance, hatred of Western \n     values, and support to terrorist activities. So that is what \n     we are talking about when we talk about this terror tax \n     which literally is paid every time an American pulls up in \n     Pennsylvania, Oregon, or anywhere else and fills their \n     tank with gasoline.\n\n  The former Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsey, summed it \nup pretty well just recently. He said:\n\n       We live in a world where Saudi Arabia earns about $160 \n     billion from exporting oil and a big share of that, several \n     billion dollars, goes to the Wahabbi sect for their worldwide \n     work, which is to set up madrassas in Pakistan and other \n     places. And the ideology that is taught in those madrassas is \n     for all practical purposes the same as al-Qaida's.\n\n  As the GAO report notes, this problem appears to go beyond the \nfunding of an ``al-Qaida ideology''--it appears to be funding terrorist \nactivities.\n  So let me now turn for a few minutes to the question of the Saudi \nGovernment's role in all of this. When you look at all the evidence, it \nis pretty clear there is a serious problem, and the question is, What \nhas the Saudi Arabian Government been doing about all of this? Are they \npart of the problem? Are they doing anything to address it?\n  Let me review the history. First, there appears to be no question \nthat in the first couple of years after the 9/11 attacks, Saudi Arabia \nwas directly involved in supporting terrorism. The telethon that raised \nmoney for families of suicide bombers was sponsored by the Saudi King. \nIn many ways, the Saudis' position changed when terrorism hit home in \nthe aftermath of the horrible terrorist bombings that\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\nhit Riyadh in mid-2003. Since then, there seems to be broad agreement \nthroughout the U.S. Government that the Saudi Government's \ncounterterrorism efforts have improved.\n  It is not at all clear that the Saudi Government is going far enough \nto help in this fight against terrorism. Following the Riyadh bombings, \nthe Saudi Government instituted a number of new antiterrorism laws and \npolicies, but all the evidence indicates they have fallen short with \nrespect to implementation of those laws. Here is an example: The Saudi \nGovernment announced that all charitable donations distributed \ninternationally must flow through a new national commission that \npurportedly would ensure the money did not end up in the hands of \nterrorists. It has now been nearly 3 years since this announcement was \nmade, and the commission is still not yet up and running. Even worse, \nour Treasury officials reported last year that the Saudi Government's \nbrandnew, highly touted finance intelligence unit was not ``fully \nfunctioning.'' Similarly, while the Saudi Government has worked with \nthe United States to designate particular charities as terrorist \nfinanciers, it is not always possible for our Treasury officials to \nindependently verify that particular problem charities--the ones we are \nmost concerned about--have actually been shut down.\n  Certainly, there have been some individuals in the Saudi Government \nwho have attempted to address the terrorism question. At least since \n2003, Saudi leaders have made a number of public statements indicating \nthey wish to address the problem. But these examples make clear that \nthe reality of what is needed to win this war against terrorism still \nis not in line with some of the rhetoric.\n  With respect to implementing and enforcing antiterrorism policies, \nthe actions of the Saudi Arabian Government are questionable at best. \nThere are two problems. The first is, as I have indicated, not all of \nthe proposed new laws and policies have been implemented, and the \nsecond is that we have to get the Saudis to make a more aggressive \ncommitment to enforcement. So you have to get them implemented, and \nthen you have to get them enforced.\n  John Negroponte, of course, the Director of National Intelligence, \nhas been following this. At one of our open meetings of the \nIntelligence Committee, I asked him his assessment of the situation. \nDirector Negroponte indicated that, in his view, the situation had \nimproved a bit since 2003, but he made it clear, stating specifically \nthat more work needs to be done, especially in the area of private \nSaudi donors, and that more is needed to crack down on their \nactivities.\n  This sentiment was echoed by the Congressional Research Service, \nwhich reported that no high-profile donors--none--had been subject to \ncriminal punishment by the Saudi Government. The State Department has \nsaid publicly:\n\n       Saudi Arabia should demonstrate its willingness to hold \n     elites accountable.\n\n  But, unfortunately, in Saudi Arabia, the elites hold all the cards, \nand the Saudi Arabian Government, as indicated by the Congressional \nResearch Service, is not willing to go after those who are most \ninfluential--the elites--in their country.\n  Now, some have gone even further and suggested that the Saudi \nGovernment might actually be involved in the propagation and financing \nof terrorism. The evidence on this point is inconclusive, but this does \nnot rule out the possibility that lower level officials in the Saudi \nGovernment may, in fact, be involved in funding or facilitating \nterrorism. Given the high levels of corruption reported in Saudi \nArabia, this is certainly a possibility.\n  Moreover, as the General Accounting Office points out, the \ndistinction between the Government's support and funding versus that \nprovided by entities and individuals, especially in the case of Saudi \ncharities' alleged activities, is not always clear. The Saudi Royal \nFamily is an excellent example. The Royal Family contains several \nthousand family members who collect Government allowances of varying \namounts. If one of these royalties took a portion of their allowance \nmoney and funneled it to al-Qaida or Hamas, Saudi officials might claim \nthat this did not even constitute Government support for terrorism. \nCertainly, I and others would say that the Government still bears \nsignificant responsibility.\n  I would also argue that just because Saudi leaders are not personally \ninvolved in financing terrorism, this should not absolve them from \naccountability. Most of my constituents would contend that if terrorist \nactivities are being planned or financed inside Saudi Arabia, then the \nSaudi Arabian Government has a responsibility to get off the dime and \nstop it. As we say in our State, you are either part of the problem or \nyou are part of the solution.\n  The Congress has a responsibility now to investigate this issue, and \nthere are a number of key questions that ought to be answered.\n  First, how much money is flowing from Saudi Arabia to terrorist \ngroups? Which groups are the major beneficiaries and to what extent is \nofficial corruption a major factor?\n  Second, there needs to be an examination of how far the Saudi Arabian \nGovernment has gone in implementing its new antiterrorist laws. \nImplementation and enforcement have clearly fallen short, but where can \nwe see concrete examples of actual followup? What major gaps still \nremain?\n\n  Finally, there needs to be an examination of the internal situation \nin Saudi Arabia. Currently, the Saudi Government is run by a small \ngroup of men in their seventies and eighties. What is likely to happen \nwhen they are gone? How secure is the regime now? What sort of \ngovernment would be likely to emerge if the Royal Family lost their \npower?\n  It would be premature to try to offer answers to these and the other \nkey questions. What is clear is that our Government will need to put \nmore pressure on Saudi leaders than the current administration has \napplied thus far.\n  It also seems very likely the answers will have a dramatic effect for \nU.S. energy policy which currently perpetuates our dependence on \nforeign oil. My guess is that people in Pennsylvania, like Oregonians, \nthink that just about the most red, white, and blue thing we can do for \nour country is to get a new energy policy. Certainly, as we go forward \nto look into the activities of the Saudis, a bipartisan effort to get a \nnew energy policy is a key factor in ensuring our ability to protect \nour citizens at a dangerous time.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I plan to examine this issue as a \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have asked our chairman, \nour very able chairman, Senator Rockefeller, to hold a closed hearing \nspecifically dedicated to this topic, and one has been scheduled for \nthis afternoon. It is time to bring to light the way in which Saudi oil \nmoney is fueling the fires of terrorism so people can actually see who \nis getting burned and what is necessary to protect the security and the \nwell-being of Americans in a perilous world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will speak on the President's \ndecision to escalate by 21,000 troops into Iraq and whether it will be \neffective. If we determine the likelihood of success is not going to be \neffective, and we put 21,000 more troops in harm's way in the middle of \nsectarian violence, then it doesn't seem to me to be a wise policy if \nit is not going to be effective. It is naturally legitimate to debate \nwhether it is effective.\n  The President's plan specifically is among the 21,500 to take about \n17,500 to put into Baghdad and another 4,000 into the western part of \nIraq, Anbar Province. I happen to agree with the latter part because I \nwas convinced by the Marine generals that an increase of our forces \nwould help them augment the success they have had, since all of that \narea is almost entirely Sunni and the problem there has been al-Qaida \nand\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\nthe al-Qaida insurgents. I agree with that part of the President's \nstrategy.\n  However, most of the troops--some 17,500--are scheduled to go into \nBaghdad, in the midst of the sectarian violence, and that is where I \ndisagree. I point out to the Senate, the President's strategy is \npredicated on the fact of the Iraqi Army being reliable. Now, will it \nbe reliable? If the President's strategy is predicated on that fact of \nthe Iraqi Army being reliable, one would think the administration has \ncome to the conclusion the Iraqi Army will be reliable. The fact is, \nthey haven't.\n  In testimony after testimony by administration witnesses, not one \nwitness in any of the hearings that have been held in the committees \nupon which I have the privilege of serving--the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee--not one witness has been able to state that the \nIraqi Army will be reliable. To the contrary.\n  The Secretary of Defense, the new commander of American forces in \nIraq, the new combatant commander for the United States Central \nCommand--every one of them has been unable to answer in the affirmative \nthat the Iraqi forces are going to be reliable. As a matter of fact, a \nfew days ago the Secretary of Defense said to the Senate Committee on \nArmed Services that we will have to wait and see if they are reliable. \nThe very underpinning of the President's strategy for success is an \nunknown.\n  I bring to the Senate's attention what has been released 2 days ago. \nThis is the unclassified version of the National Intelligence Estimate. \nThis is the best estimate by our intelligence community. Listen to what \nthey have to say on exactly this subject. I am reading from the \nunclassified version.\n\n       Despite real improvements, the Iraqi security forces, \n     particularly the Iraqi police, will be hard pressed in the \n     next 12 to 18 months to execute significantly increased \n     security responsibilities, and particularly to operate \n     independently against the Shia militias with success. \n     Sectarian divisions erode the dependability of many units. \n     Many are hampered by personnel and equipment shortfalls and a \n     number of Iraqi units have refused to serve outside of areas \n     where they have been recruited.\n\n  That is word for word the National Intelligence Estimate, \nunclassified version, that says the same thing as Secretary Gates, \nGeneral Petraeus, Admiral Fallon, and the soon-to-be new Army Chief of \nStaff, General Casey, who served for the last 2\\1/2\\ years in Iraq.\n  I come back to the question I continue to ask. If the President's \nplan for success by an escalation of troops in Baghdad is predicated on \nthe Iraqi Army, the Iraqi security forces being reliable--since they \nare to take the burden of the clearing and then the holding of an \narea--and if no one can state they are reliable, why are we pursuing \nthis plan of an escalation of forces into Baghdad?\n  We hope they are going to be reliable. We hope for the success of our \nforces. The stakes are high, unquestionably, of stabilizing Iraq. But \nis this the wisest course, putting 17,500 more American forces in \nBaghdad at high risk? In this Senator's opinion, the very underpinning, \nthe foundation of the President's plan, is undermined by virtue of the \nfact that none of the administration principals can answer the question \nthat they are reliable. They can't answer that question. Therefore, I \ndo not think it is in the best interests of our country or of our \ntroops to escalate these forces into Baghdad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1734-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1734-S1737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I spend a few minutes talking about the \nsupposed continuing resolution we are going to have that is really an \nomnibus. Every time we have an omnibus, the American people get hurt. \nThe reason is we play games.\n  We came off an election in November of 2006 where we had the claim \nmade that the party in power had used earmarks irresponsibly, had \nplayed the budget gimmicks, had done all these things. We had a claim \nwe would work toward bipartisanship, be honest and open in what we do. \nI come to challenge that in terms of what I would call an ``omni \nterrible'' bill.\n  First, under the rules of the Senate, although we are going to be \nshut out on amendments, it is harmful for the American public that \nthere are no amendments to this. It is harmful because, first, it \ndestroys comity in this Senate. It creates hard feelings. I would be \nthe first to admit that the procedure that is being used on this was \nfirst used by a Republican. It is wrong.\n  The second thing that is important is there are all sorts of budget \ngimmicks with it. The quote is we stay within the budget. That is a lie \nbecause what they do is they steal money from our grandchildren which \nthey will get back on the next supplemental, but that won't have to be \nwithin the budget limitations. So we are playing games. Nothing has \nchanged about the Senate and the wink and the nod to the American \npublic about what is happening to our future financial conditions. Mr. \nPresident, $3.1 billion out of this will be transferred to the next \nsupplemental to pay for things that absolutely have to happen with our \ntroops in terms of transferring them from Germany and the BRAC \nrelocation process. That has all been stolen so we can do other things. \nThey may be a priority, but maybe something else should be eliminated \nrather than to break the budget and charge more to our grandkids. So \nthat is not true.\n\n  The third thing that is extremely wrong with this is the claim that \nthis has no earmarks. In 2006 appropriations bills, 96 percent of all \nearmarks were in report language. That means there is a bill that is a \nlaw and then there is language that accompanies the bill that is not \nlaw. That is where we find most of the shenanigans going on in \nCongress. And it is equal among Democrats and Republicans as far as the \nearmarks.\n  To make the claim that there are no earmarks in this bill is an \noutright falsehood that the American people should not accept. The \nreason it is false is there is a little statement in this bill that \nthese earmarks don't carry the force of law. It doesn't say they \neliminated them. But you know what. They don't carry the force of law \nnow. They haven't for the last 10 or 12 years. They haven't ever \ncarried the force of law, but they carry the force of coercion because \nthe agencies know if this is written into the report language and they \ndon't do it, there is retribution they will face when it comes to the \nCongress and the appropriations process.\n  Ninety-four percent of all the earmarks that were in 2006 in these \nbills are in this bill. To claim otherwise is inaccurate and it should \nmake the people of America reject with disdain how this Senate \noperates.\n  I remind this Senate that it wasn't but 2 or 3 weeks ago that Senator \nDeMint put in transparency of earmarks, much like Congresswoman Pelosi \nhad asked. That was voted against by the majority of the Democrats \nuntil they found out they were going to lose. Then we modified it so \nthey could vote ``yes'' after they had voted ``no.'' That is okay if \nyou don't want them, but be honest about it. The fact is, there is no \ntransparency with these earmarks. Most Americans will never know how \nthey got there. The lobbyists will know; the Members will know; the \ncampaign checks that come from them will know. But the regular \n``American Joe'' won't know.\n  So the claim that we are operating under a new standard, the claim \nthat we are going to have bipartisanship, the claim that we are not \ngoing to use budget gimmicks is all a farce. It is a farce. Let's \nchange that. Let's give the American people something to be proud of. \nLet's have the hard debates on the questionable areas on this bill.\n  I will spend a minute and talk about one area of this bill. The one \narea where we have been very successful in eliminating HIV infections \nhas been women who are pregnant and are having babies who are HIV \ninfected. In 1996, New York passed a law saying all babies whose \nmothers' status with HIV wasn't known would be tested, and if they \ncarried the antibodies for the mother, they would be treated. New York, \nsince that time, has gone from at least 500 babies a year getting \ninfected with HIV to less than 7.\n  Connecticut passed a law in 1998. They have gone from whatever their \nlevel was to zero since 2001. It is an area of hope where we have made \ntremendous progress in terms of preventing transmission to young \nbabies,\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\nidentifying pregnant women so they can be under treatment earlier so \nthey don't go to full-blown AIDS, and preventing infection of other \npeople by identifying people who are infected.\n  It is all based on an option of being able to opt out. If you do not \nwant to be tested, you do not have to. This bill precludes any moneys \nto be spent on that. How dare we. How dare we stop the area where we \nare most effective in the country at preventing HIV infection.\n  Let me detail that a minute. For a newborn baby--we don't know the \nmother's status--it only costs us $10 to identify whether that baby is \ncarrying the antibodies from a woman who is infected with HIV. The \ntreatment, which is 99 percent curative, costs $75.\n  Now, to abandon all this, the treatment to treat a baby infected with \nHIV--which will result in this--costs a quarter of a million dollars \nfor the first 10 years--$25,000 a year. So it is not only that we are \nnot preventing an infection, we are not preventing an infection after \nthat through breast-feeding, we are wasting money that could go to buy \ndrugs for those people who cannot afford drugs today who have HIV.\n  The HIV epidemic is totally controllable. To block the funding, \nespecially for African-American women who carry the burden of this \ndisease in pregnancy, is unconscionable. There is not a good answer for \nwhy this prohibition was put into this. And whoever did it--whoever did \nit--does not care a whit about the innocent children who are going to \nget the HIV infection, does not care about the African-American woman \nwho is carrying it but does not know she has it, who could be treated \nand never progress to AIDS. What they care about is politics and \npolitical correctness.\n  Former President Clinton recently announced he thinks we need to \nreassess, we need to be testing. That is a 180-degree turn from where \nhe was. Why? Because he looks at this country and says: Why aren't we \ncontrolling this epidemic? It is because we are not testing, we are \nmaking it too hard to be tested. We have had great advances in drugs. \nWe have great ways to prevent transmission. But if we do not know who \nis carrying it--and one out of every three people in this country who \nhave HIV does not know they are infected. So what we should be about is \nmaking testing easier--easier to do, more available, more accessible--\nand in a way that will make a major impact on people's lives.\n  I am sorry the majority leader has decided to run this bill this way \nbecause I think it portends lots of things for the future of this body \nthat are not going to be good. Nobody can accuse me of being partisan \non earmarks. I went after my own party harder than I went after anybody \nelse. I did not see anybody last year from the other side come down \nhere and challenge an earmark. I saw nobody in the last 2 years from \nthe other side come down here and challenge an earmark. And then to \nclaim there are no earmarks in this bill, and to try to do a wink and a \nnod to the American public that oh, yeah, we are fixing it, when in \nfact 95 percent of them are there, it gives us cause to pause: Has \nanything changed? It has not. It is still the game, American public. \nThe only way you are going to have this place cleaned up is \ntransparency in everything we do.\n  I hope the majority leader will reconsider his position on not \nallowing amendments to this bill. If he does not, one, he hurts the \nnext year and a half in this body in terms of relationship and \nfairness; but, No. 2, he hurts the American public worse than that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nbeginning to talk about this Omnibus appropriations bill that is coming \nto the floor in the form of a continuing resolution.\n  At this point, we are told the amendment tree will be immediately \nfilled and there will be no amendments allowed to this over $400 \nbillion Omnibus appropriations bill. It is not too late for the \ndistinguished leader of the Democrats, the majority leader, to allow \nsome amendments. He said on the floor yesterday he was open to \ndiscussions and thought that probably maybe some amendments on the \nDemocratic side and the Republican side would be in order.\n  When you take something that is this big--$400 billion--this number \nof appropriations bills, and you see the incredible changes that have \nbeen made in these bills, without any hearings, without sufficient time \nto even digest everything that is in these bills, I think a few \namendments are warranted.\n  I think Senator Coburn pointed out something that surely no one \nintended--surely no one intended--to stop babies from being able to \nhave the HIV/AIDS test that would give them a chance at a quality of \nlife which they will not be able to get if they do not have this test \nand catch potential AIDS in their bodies right at birth.\n  I am going to talk about one I know a lot about, and that is the \nmilitary construction and BRAC. Military construction is completely \ndropped in this bill, completely dropped from last year's military \nconstruction bill. We passed this bill in the Senate. We tried to go to \nconference. The Senate sent it to conference. But we were not able to \nget the House to agree; therefore, the bill died last year.\n  I will say that it is not the Democrats' fault that bill died last \nyear. But, nevertheless, the Democrats now are in charge, and I would \nask the distinguished leader to acknowledge we have bills that have not \nbeen fully passed, conferenced, and sent to the President, but a \ncontinuing resolution that is unamendable is not the right approach, \nparticularly if we take to heart what the distinguished leader said was \ngoing to be different about the Senate under his leadership.\n  In fact, there is precedent. In 2003, the Republicans took over the \nSenate after the Democrats had been in control. There were 11 \nappropriations bills undone. Those 11 bills were put together in an \nOmnibus appropriations by the Republicans. There were 6 days of debate. \nThere were 100 amendments offered. The majority of the amendments that \nwere added to the bill were Democratic amendments.\n  So I think that is the precedent we should follow in the Senate. This \nis a body that is supposed to allow for discussion, debate, \ntransparency, and minority rights. We are in the minority. We know \nthat. But we have never been denied on such a continuing basis the \nability to even affect legislation or amend legislation. That seems to \nbe a pattern in the first 5 weeks of this session. I do not think it is \nwhat was intended by the majority when they took control of the Senate, \nand I think there is a chance to come together and maybe go a different \nway; that is, to allow amendments on major bills.\n\n  We now have a bill that is called a continuing resolution, and it \nstrips BRAC, it strips the base closing construction that will keep the \nBase Closing Commission results that were adopted by Congress that are \nthe law of this country from going forward with the 6-year timetable \nthat was set out by Congress.\n  We have 6 years to do the construction that will prepare bases that \nare going to receive troops and to close bases in an expeditious manner \nso the cities that have these large amounts of land will be able to \ntake over those bases and do something productive for their respective \ncities with those bases.\n  What we have now is a delay that will last 1 year. It is going to \ncause a backup in the system of adhering to the congressional \nresponsibility for BRAC. It is going to begin to handicap the ability \nto move troops from overseas that are scheduled as early as this year \nto move.\n  Mr. President, 12,000 troops will begin to move that are part of the \nrebasing operation from foreign bases to American bases. Twelve \nthousand will not be able to move with all of the amenities we require.\n  Let me read excerpts from a few of the military leaders of our \ncountry, letters that were sent on behalf of the military of our \ncountry, asking that Congress act on both the military construction \nbills that were passed by both Houses of Congress but not conferenced \nlast year and the $3 billion that was taken out of the budget and \nspread throughout the other bills that are in this omnibus continuing \nresolution.\n  The Democrats have taken $3 billion out of military construction to \neffect our mandate of a 6-year period in which the military has to make \nthe\n\n[[Page S1736]]\n\ntransfers we adopted in BRAC. It takes $3 billion out of this year's \nbudget and transfers it to other priorities that have never had 1 day \nof hearing and never had even a discussion in the committees.\n  This is a letter from Robert Gates, the Secretary of Defense:\n\n       As you prepare to complete the Joint Continuing Resolution, \n     we urge you to include provisions to permit the execution of \n     the Fiscal Year 2007 President's Budget request [as it \n     relates to the Department of Defense].\n       Funding programs at FY 2006 levels under a year-long \n     Continuing Resolution--\n\n  Which is what is in this bill--\n\n     would negatively impact critical priorities and missions \n     within the Department. If the [continuing resolution] levels \n     are set at [these] enacted levels, the Department will face \n     shortfalls of over $1 billion in the Defense Health Program--\n\n  Part of that is accommodated in this bill--\n\n     $0.5 billion in Basic Allowance for Housing, and $4 billion \n     in the Base Realignment and Closure programs.\n\n  Now, this was sent before this omnibus continuing resolution came \nover. Part of those are funded but not the Base Realignment and Closure \nprograms. Mr. President, $3 billion of the $4 billion requested was \ntaken out.\n  Secretary Gates goes on to say:\n\n       Delays in completing BRAC could result in postponing \n     scheduled redeployments from overseas stations to the United \n     States. Deferring BRAC implementation would also impede \n     community efforts to quickly transition the affected bases to \n     civilian use, so that the impact of BRAC on local economies \n     can be reduced. Furthermore, congressionally approved BRAC \n     recommendations were developed to provide cost savings \n     benefits; any delays will jeopardize those benefits.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I have just \nread, addressed to Senator Byrd, with a copy to Senator Cochran, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you prepare to complete the Joint \n     Continuing Resolution, we urge you to include provisions to \n     permit the execution of the Fiscal Year 2007 President's \n     Budget request.\n       Funding programs at FY 2006 levels under a year-long \n     Continuing Resolution (CR) would negatively impact critical \n     priorities and missions within the Department. If the CR \n     levels are set at FY 2006 enacted levels, the Department will \n     face shortfalls of over $1 billion in the Defense Health \n     Program (DHP), $0.5 billion in Basic Allowance for Housing \n     (BAH), and $4 billion in the Base Realignment and Closure \n     (BRAC) programs. Funding for the DHP is needed to avoid \n     reductions in health care benefits for members, retirees, and \n     their families; funding for BAH is needed to ensure that \n     members receive timely housing payments.\n       Delays in completing BRAC could result in postponing \n     scheduled redeployments from overseas stations to the United \n     States. Deferring BRAC implementation would also impede \n     community efforts to quickly transition the affected bases to \n     civilian use, so that the impact of BRAC on local economies \n     can be reduced. Furthermore, congressionally approved BRAC \n     recommendations were developed to provide cost savings \n     benefits; any delays will jeopardize those benefits.\n       Thank you for your help on this important matter. Our \n     warfighters will be the direct beneficiaries of your \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the $3 billion that has been cut out \nis going to affect many important bases in our country. One of the \nbases is in Texas. Fort Bliss is in great need of military construction \nbecause it is designated by the Department of Defense to receive 30,000 \ntroops, and there is much that needs to be done to prepare the base for \nthose overseas redeployments.\n  I happen to know that one the best, of course. But let's talk about \nFort Riley, KS, where a good number of the redeployed troops are also \ngoing to be stationed. They are very concerned in Kansas. I know \nSenator Roberts and Senator Brownback plan to speak this afternoon. But \nI am speaking now because I am hoping the majority leader will decide \nthat maybe we do need some amendments to this bill, that maybe we can \nwork together in a bipartisan way and work these out.\n  These BRAC budget provisions have been adopted by the Senate. The \nmilitary construction appropriations bill was a quite bipartisan bill \nthat was adopted last year by the Senate as well.\n  When you look at Fort Riley in Kansas, which is one of the major-need \nareas for BRAC funding that we are going to talk about--I know Senators \nRoberts and Brownback will expand on it--you have a Battle Command \nTraining Center. This is for troops coming from Europe to Fort Riley \nfor training. The major part of the military construction for Fort \nRiley is a training center. You have runway improvements, a child \ndevelopment center for quality of life for our troops--all of this is \nat Fort Riley, KS--a soldier-family medical clinic at Fort Riley, a \ndivision headquarters. All of that is Fort Riley, KS, which is one of \nthe major areas that would be hit by this delay in taking out the $3 \nbillion from BRAC.\n  I have been talking to Senators Chambliss and Isakson of Georgia. \nThey will have a huge hit as well in Fort Benning. Fort Benning is \nanother of those that is in need of great enhancement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to extend my time for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will not object, but may I inquire how \nmuch time remains to the minority under morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I did not realize that. I ask the Senator from Texas \nhow much time he would like to have.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was hoping to have at least 5 minutes, \nbut I see that time is running short.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will give him 5 minutes. Just let me \nhave the rest of that time and notify me when there is 5 minutes \nremaining then I will yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 1 minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In Georgia, Fort Benning is going to be a major loser \nbecause of the delay. You have two major training barracks and training \nbrigade complex units that will not be able to be started, a fire and \nmovement range, a modified record fire range, brigade headquarters, \ntraining barracks complex No. 2, and the stationary gunnery range.\n  Again, we are trying to enhance training for our troops. Many of \nthose being brought home, the 70,000 troops being brought home in the \nDepartment of Defense plan, are being brought home to increase their \ntraining capability.\n  I encourage and ask Senator Reid to reconsider. Let's have some \nagreement on equal numbers of Republican and Democratic amendments. \nLet's have some say in this Omnibus appropriations bill. I cannot \nimagine we would pass a bill such as this with no amendment whatsoever \nin either House of Congress. I don't think that is what the American \npeople hoped for when they voted last November.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for the \nremainder of the time, 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the courtesy of the senior Senator from \nTexas in giving me a few minutes to speak on this continuing \nresolution.\n  This is, to say the least, disappointing. We have a bill that \naddresses more than $400 billion worth of spending but cuts $3.1 \nbillion from our men and women in uniform for the Department of Defense \nat a time when we hope to be able to build facilities in the United \nStates to accommodate them and their families as we bring them back \nfrom places such as Europe and Korea and elsewhere. We know that we \nhave an all-voluntary military. As a member of a military family \nmyself--my father was in the Air Force for 31 years--it is more than \njust the individual servicemember who serves; it is a family \nproposition.\n  I urge the majority leader and the majority to reconsider this cut of \n$3.1 billion in the very meat and bone of what it takes to recruit and \nretain a volunteer military. As the saying goes, you recruit an \nindividual servicemember but you retain a family. These kinds of cuts, \n$750 million of which will\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\ncome out of the money that is allocated for the State of Texas, are \njust extraordinarily unwise.\n  I have heard rumors to the effect that the majority is going to try \nto add this money back in the supplemental appropriations bill we will \nbe taking up, I guess sometime in March. Of course, that would be a \nbudgetary trick which would exacerbate the budget deficit and be in \nstark conflict with the kind of rhetoric we have heard from our \ncolleagues on the majority side who have said that we need a pay-as-\nyou-go budget. In other words, if there is going to be spending, there \nhas to be commensurate offsets.\n  Cutting out of this so-called continuing resolution or Omnibus \nappropriations this $3.1 billion for our military families and then \ncoming back and adding it in as emergency spending in a supplemental \navoids the budgetary requirement of an offset and, thus, will add to \nadditional deficits which are irresponsible and certainly in conflict \nwith the statements our colleagues have made on the other side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I certainly will.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I was just listening to his statement and agree that \nthere is going to be a budget gimmick if this comes up in a \nsupplemental. But is the Senator from Texas a part of an amendment we \nwould like to proffer which would restore $39.1 billion but cut .73 \npercent across the board in all of the other accounts in this bill \nexcept for defense, veterans, and homeland security, so that we could \npay for it, be fiscally responsible, and yet do what we need to do for \nthe Active-Duty military, not to drain their operations to fund \nmilitary construction projects that should be funded in this bill? Is \nthe Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am proud to be a cosponsor, along with the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Texas, of an amendment which would \naccomplish that goal. This is the way to handle our budgetary \nresponsibilities appropriately. I implore the majority leader to allow \nus an opportunity to have amendments and to have a full and fair debate \non this continuing resolution. We started this Congress in a spirit of \ncompromise, but certainly if the amendment tree is filled and we are \ndenied an opportunity to have debate and consideration of an amendment \nsuch as that, it would be extraordinarily disappointing and in conflict \nwith some of the early rhetoric and hopes we all had for bipartisan \ncooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1737-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  I ask the clerk to tell me when I have consumed 8 minutes.\n  I come again this morning to the not particularly pleasant task of \nopposing the nomination of General Casey to be Chief of Staff of the \nU.S. Army. I preface my remarks, again, with my appreciation for \nhonorable service to the country, his family, and the sacrifices they \nhave made for many years. This isn't a question of character because \nhis character is outstanding; it is a question of judgment.\n  I will try to put this in context, why I am in opposition. For \nseveral years, I and a number of others have bemoaned and complained \nand criticized and been saddened as we have watched this train wreck in \nIraq. Not long after the initial invasion, I came back from a visit to \nIraq and visited with the then-Secretary of Defense, who bears great \nresponsibility for this debacle, and history will judge him very badly \nfor his performance as Secretary of Defense. I told him how it was that \nwe were not going to win, we were not going to succeed, that we didn't \nhave enough troops over there, that Anbar Province was going to erupt--\nbasically all the things many of us saw were going to transpire. \nGeneral Casey, for 2\\1/2\\ years up until recently, would come back to \nthe Congress and say that things were going well. I quoted many quotes \nyesterday, from time to time, including in 2005, saying we could start \nwithdrawing by 2006 and on and on and on, completely divorced from \nreality on the ground, as was the Secretary of Defense.\n\n  I will state at the beginning that Presidents are responsible, but \nPresidents also rely on the advice and counsel of their military \nleaders. That is a normal thing and has happened in every conflict.\n  President Bush said time and time again: I have said to the American \npeople, as Iraqis stand up, we will stand down. But I have also said \nour commanders on the ground will make that decision. We will talk to \nGeneral Casey. On and on. The Army is getting on its feet. We have \nturned over a lot of territory to the Army. They are good fighters. I \nhave spent a great deal of time with General Abizaid and General Casey. \nThey are in Washington. They are generals who will be happy to tell me \nthe way it is, not the way they think I would like to it be.\n  Time after time, it has been clear that the President of the United \nStates, as appropriate, has been relying on the advice and counsel of \ncommanders in the field who did not give him appropriate information or \nrecommendations. We are all responsible. In the military, you are \nresponsible for the decisions you make on the battlefield, particularly \nwhen they cost our most valuable and important asset--American blood.\n  In his opening statement at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing \non September 29, General Casey said: ``The capacity of Iraqi security \nforces has increased quantitatively and qualitatively over the past \nyear'' and ``we have also developed with the Iraqis a readiness \nreporting system, not unlike the one we have in place for our own \nforces. So over the past 18 months we have built enough Iraqi capacity \nwhere we can begin talking seriously about transitioning this \ncounterinsurgency mission to them.''\n  Did he realize at the time that statement was wrong? And when did he \ntell someone?\n  At the same hearing, General Casey said:\n\n       More coalition is not necessarily better. More and more \n     capable Iraqi security forces are better. Increased coalition \n     presence speeds the notion of occupation. It contributes to \n     the dependency of Iraqi security forces on the coalition. It \n     extends the amount of time it will take for Iraqi security \n     forces to become self-reliant and exposes more coalition \n     forces to attacks at a time when Iraqi security forces are \n     increasingly available and increasingly capable.\n\n  There has been no sign of that. Why did it take 15 months for General \nCasey to change that assessment and then not even agree with the new \nstrategy of five additional brigades, which most of us pray is enough \nand most of us believe is a direct contravention to the Powell \ndoctrine, which is, use overwhelming force in order to gain military \nvictory?\n  President Bush said General Casey will make decisions as to how many \ntroops we have there. Why did it take 2\\1/2\\ years? Why did it have to \ntake 2\\1/2\\ years of steady degradation for General Casey to figure out \nwe didn't have enough troops there, and the situation is worsening in \nIraq.\n  The NIE that came out yesterday should frighten anyone, any American,\n\n[[Page S1738]]\n\nbecause of the stark depiction in the NIE--the public document--that \nstates that the situation is grave and deteriorating in Iraq, which is \nalso the conclusion of the Iraq Study Group, whether you happen to \nagree with their recommendations or not.\n  Mr. President, responsibility is one of the first things that is \ntaught at our service academies. We are responsible for our decisions. \nWhen the Missouri runs aground, we relieve the captain. When four \nsailors are washed overboard, we relieve the captain. Now we are \nrewarding failure as we did during the Vietnam war when we named \nGeneral Westmoreland as Chief of Staff of the Army after a failed \nsearch and destroy. There are eerie parallels here. General \nWestmoreland employed the search and destroy strategy which is counter \nto any counterinsurgency strategy. That kind of strategy is clear, \nhold, and build. That is what General Petraeus is trying to do now. \nThat is not what has been done in the past under General Casey.\n  So what are we doing? We are promoting a general who has pursued a \nfailed policy, advocated it to the President, whom he is responsible to \nadvise, and he is advocating it to the Congress of the United States \ndespite the overwhelming view by many of us that it was not a \nsuccessful strategy. Still, today, where he will be in place if he is \nconfirmed by the Senate, he will be responsible for the operation, \ntraining, and doctrine that will be employed in Iraq, and he still, to \nthis day, as far as I know, from the hearing of a short time ago, \nbelieves--and I could give the quote--that we are not failing but we \nare succeeding. I don't know of anyone who believes that who is in a \nresponsible position in Government.\n  Mr. President, it is with a bit of regret that I do this. Again, I \nrepeat what I said yesterday. Senator Levin asked him:\n\n       I am wondering whether you would agree that what we are \n     doing in Iraq was maybe a slow failure.\n\n  General Casey said:\n\n       I don't actually see it as a slow failure. I actually see \n     it as slow progress.\n\n  How could you depict the situation in Baghdad today, with six \nhelicopters being shot down in the last few weeks, with a spike in \ncasualties that has taken place, and the continued level of sectarian \nviolence, as a slow progress?\n  So I want to tell my friends that people in the military, \nparticularly our young officers, are watching what we do here. We teach \nthem in our service schools, and we teach our noncommissioned officers \nand junior officers: You are responsible for success or failure. That \nis why we appoint you as leaders. In this case, this leader, despite \nhis honorable character and dedication to this country, has not led, \nand his responsibility has not been carried out.\n  So I hope my colleagues will turn down this nomination and that we \nwill appoint one of the many highly qualified senior military officers \nwe have to fulfill this position.\n  May I finally say that I am very nervous about this new strategy. I \nam very doubtful that we have enough troops. I don't know if the Maliki \ngovernment will be strong enough. But if General Casey is appointed to \nthis position, my confidence will be lowered because it is not \nappropriate to put someone who does not support wholeheartedly the new \nstrategy in a position where he will be responsible for a great deal of \nit. To this day, he doesn't admit that this present strategy has \nfailed.\n  Do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, again, it is extraordinarily ironic that my \ngood friend from Arizona says there is no one in a high position in \nthis Government who thinks we are succeeding, when the President, just \n2 or 3 months ago, said we are absolutely winning in Iraq. That is the \nCommander in Chief--a pretty high position of responsibility. The Vice \nPresident, just last year, said that the insurgency is in its last \nthroes, when it was not. So it was clear to everybody, and apparently \nto my good friend from Arizona because he says he had seen this for \nyears--failure after failure in Iraq--identified by the highest levels \nand the highest level of this administration as being a success.\n  Year after year, we were told this is a successful strategy. Now all \nof a sudden, a general who was assigned to carry out that strategy and \ndid the best he could, acknowledging some mistakes in implementation, \nis going to be held accountable by some who will vote against his \nnomination for the massive failures at the highest levels of civilian \nauthority. The strategy was wrong going into Iraq; it was poorly \nimplemented. The Iraqi Army was disbanded. That was not General Casey; \nthat was before he came.\n  The people who made those decisions were given awards and medals by \nthe administration. George Tenet was given a medal for his work. He \nsaid the intelligence was a slam-dunk, that there were weapons of mass \ndestruction. Medal after medal was given to the civilian leaders. A \nMedal of Freedom was awarded to George Tenet. Ambassador Bremer was \ngiven a medal. He just disbanded the Iraqi Army and had a \ndebaathification program, which was a complete failure because of its \nexcess. He was given a Medal of Freedom.\n\n  William Haynes, General Counsel of the Department of Defense--his \ndubious legal judgment contributed to the interrogation abuses of \ndetainees that led to the horrors of Abu Ghraib. He was given the \nDepartment of Defense medal for distinguished public service.\n  Under Secretary of Defense Doug Feith, who hyped false intelligence \nused to justify the war in Iraq, was given a medal.\n  Now you have a general who was given a strategy and was told to \nimplement the strategy. Yes, he was optimistic that it could work. He \nis in charge of the morale of his troops. Now, suddenly, some say he \nshould be, in effect, punished. He should carry the burdens that \nproperly should be carried by the top civilian leaders of this Nation. \nIt is not appropriate.\n  It is not fair that General Casey be held responsible for massive \nfailures that were caused by the wrong policies, the deceptions, the \nignorance, the arrogance, and the cockiness of civilian leaders in this \nadministration. It is just plain wrong that this all be heaped onto his \nback.\n  What do we know about General Casey? By the way, we know he is \nforthright and acknowledges his mistakes. There is not a commander I \nknow of who does not acknowledge his mistakes. Every commander worth \nhis or her salt acknowledges mistakes, and General Casey has done that. \nIn fact, he has given us a list of mistakes. We asked him what went \nwrong that you contributed to, and he gave us a list very openly. But \nyou cannot lay the chaos and the violence in Iraq on General Casey's \ndoorstep. This belongs on the doorstep of the top civilian leaders of \nthis country who went into Iraq the way they did, who didn't plan for \nan aftermath, who disbanded the Iraqi army, and who perpetrated some of \nthe other mistakes that have put us in some of the positions that we \nare in, in Iraq.\n  General Casey is a long and distinguished servant in the military, \nincluding the position of Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. This was \npreceded by assignments on the joint staff and a career commanding \nInfantry units at all levels, up to and including Division Command. He \nknows Iraq, he knows the challenges the Army faces in Iraq, he knows \nthe Pentagon, and he knows the challenges he will be facing in the \nPentagon if we confirm him. He has the knowledge and skills to carry \nout his primary responsibility as Chief of Staff, which is the training \nand equipping of soldiers, caring for them and their families.\n  I want to discuss two issues that have been raised. One is the \ngeneral's decision to support an increase in U.S. forces in Iraq after \npreviously opposing such an increase, and also the proposition that \nGeneral Casey somehow or other should be denied this position because \nof mistakes that he may have made in Iraq.\n  First, the issue of additional troops. I pressed General Casey about \nthis issue at his nomination hearing before the Armed Services \nCommittee. He said his general view was that he agreed with General \nAbizaid's view that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing \nmore, from taking more responsibility for their own future. That is \nsomething, it seems to me, that is key to those of us who oppose this \nsurge. That goes to the heart of our argument--the fact that General \nCasey\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\nbelieved more American forces prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from \ntaking more responsibility for their own future.\n  So how is it that now General Casey supports the surge? That is the \nquestion I asked him:\n\n       Senator Levin: We asked General Abizaid back in November \n     when he appeared before this committee whether we needed more \n     troops or he supported more troops going to Iraq. And this is \n     just last November. And this is what he said. He said that he \n     met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     commander, General Dempsey. ``We all talked together, and I \n     said, `In your professional opinion, if you were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq?' And they all said no. \n     And the reason is because we want Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.''\n\n  I asked General Casey:\n\n       Now, General Abizaid said that he spoke to you and that his \n     opinion reflected your opinion and all the other commanders. \n     Was that true when he said that?\n       General Casey: I'm not exactly sure when in November it \n     was, but it was.\n       Senator Levin: So you've changed your view since November?\n       General Casey: As I described in my opening testimony, \n     Senator, in mid-November was when the reevaluation of the \n     plan was taking place. So I suspect John and I talked before \n     that. And that does reflect my general view on additional \n     U.S. forces in Iraq.\n       Senator Levin: It reflects a general view, but then there \n     was some kind of reevaluation which took place in mid-\n     November.\n       General Casey: That's right, Senator. We're constantly \n     reevaluating how we're doing and what we need.\n       Senator Levin: But that position that General Abizaid \n     stated was your position when you spoke to him in early \n     November presumably still remains your general view.\n       General Casey: That's correct.\n       Senator Levin: Well, if that's your general view, what is \n     the change? Why are you modifying your general view for this \n     surge?\n       General Casey: What has changed, Senator, are several \n     things. One, the development of a plan, a new plan that was \n     conceived by the Iraqis and worked in concert with us; so \n     there is a plan that laid out requirements for those forces. \n     So just to say do you need more forces is one thing; to say \n     do you need more forces to execute this plan is quite \n     another. And we do need an additional two brigades to \n     implement that plan.\n\n  Now, there is a new plan, a plan that I very strongly disagree with, \nthe surge plan of the President. It is a new plan given to the \ncommanders, and they are now told, with this new plan, to insert troops \ninto neighborhoods of Iraq, hold that territory, and have more American \ntroops--many more--embedded with Iraqi forces. That is the plan. That \nis the Commander in Chief's decision.\n  Will that require more troops? And now General Casey gives his honest \nanswer that it will require, in his judgment, two additional brigades.\n  General Abizaid says it will require more brigades, but General Casey \nsaid two. I give him credit for giving his honest opinion.\n  So what has changed? He still believes in general that putting more \ntroops in there takes the Iraqis off the hook, but if you change your \nplan, you change your mission and you say, as the Commander in Chief \nhas, that is now our mission, that is what we are going to do, it is \nobviously up to the commanders to say how many additional troops it \nwould take to carry out that mission.\n  That is an honest response, and that is the response we expect of our \nleaders. But his general view has been correct, and so has General \nAbizaid's. More American troops is a mistake. It takes the Iraqis off \nthe hook. It lessens the responsibility on them to do what only they \ncan do with their military and with their political leaders.\n  People who have visited General Casey in Iraq--colleagues--have \nalways found him to be honest about the situation in Iraq and true to \nthe pledge that he would give Congress his personal views, even if \nthose views differ from the administration in power. And he did this \nagain at his nomination hearing when he disagreed with the Commander in \nChief's sudden epiphany that things are not going well in Iraq.\n  All of a sudden, now the Commander in Chief says we are on the road \nto slow failure. That is a new revelation. Until a few months ago, the \nCommander in Chief was telling the American people we are absolutely \nwinning in Iraq. So now I pressed General Casey about that:\n\n       Do you agree with the President that now the situation in \n     Iraq is maybe a slow failure?\n\n  He said:\n\n       I actually don't see it as a slow failure. I actually see \n     it as slow progress.\n\n  Do I agree with his assessment? I do not. I have seen chaos in Iraq--\nconsistent chaos, growing chaos. But do I admire an honest answer even \nwhen it disagrees with the Commander in Chief? I do. Even though I \ndisagree with that answer, I think it was an honest answer that he gave \nto the committee.\n  What about denying him confirmation as Chief of Staff because of the \nmistakes he may have made? Again, I think this is an ironic argument \ngiven the fact that the architects of these policies, the architects of \nthe major failures which led to the mess General Casey was assigned to \nclean up, are given medals--Medals of Freedom, medals by the Defense \nDepartment. They are given the medals, and now some will want to lay on \nGeneral Casey's doorstep the mess that was not created by his policies \nbut by the policies of others.\n  I want to read for the Record a statement of Senator Jim Webb on the \nCasey nomination. He is tied up in a hearing, and so I will read this \nvery brief statement into the Record for Senator Webb:\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of GEN \n     George Casey, Jr.'s, nomination as the Chief of Staff of the \n     U.S. Army. General Casey's service to the Nation during a \n     long career and his experiences in Iraq qualify him well to \n     address the formidable challenges facing the U.S. Army today.\n       Questions have been raised regarding General Casey's tenure \n     as commander of the Multinational Force-Iraq. The national \n     strategy in Iraq was flawed even before the invasion, and \n     attacks on General Casey's performance only divert attention \n     from the true architects of that strategy.\n       The situation faced by General Casey in Iraq represents the \n     classic conundrum of military service at the highest level of \n     command. In this administration, it has not been unheard of \n     for some officers who spoke too loudly, very often, to have \n     lost their jobs. At the same time, to speak too softly often \n     causes the military leader, rather than the civilian boss, to \n     be blamed when things go wrong. While I believe strongly that \n     military leaders should be held accountable, General Casey \n     performed as well as one could expect given the strategy for \n     the war's direction that he inherited when he reported to \n     Baghdad.\n\n  I wonder, Mr. President, if there is any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 25 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  This is the conclusion of Senator Webb's statement:\n\n       The consequences of a failed U.S. national strategy should \n     be raised at a far higher level than General Casey's in Iraq.\n       Mr. President, I urge my esteemed colleagues to support \n     General Casey's nomination to be the next Chief of Staff of \n     the U.S. Army.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the two managers, is it possible \nthat the Senator from Virginia could get 2, 3 minutes at most to speak?\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia be allowed 3 minutes to speak on this issue, not to be \ntaken from the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I obviously will not \nobject, I apologize to the Senator from Virginia. I didn't realize he \nwas here to speak on the nomination. If he is speaking in favor, I \nwould have reserved some time for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, would it be acceptable that I be given 2 \nminutes to speak after Senator Warner?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask further unanimous consent--and I \ntell my colleagues that I will not seek further unanimous consent after \nthis; I will object to a further unanimous consent request--that an \nadditional 2 minutes be given to the Senator from Alabama to speak on \nthis issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request is 3 minutes for \nthe Senator from Virginia and\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\n2 minutes for the Senator from Alabama. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank the two managers \nof this very important nomination.\n  Mr. President, I have the deepest respect for my colleague, Senator \nMcCain. We have an association that goes back some 30 years. It is not \noften we are on different sides of an issue. I wish to respect Senator \nMcCain's evaluation of a military officer. I think probably he is as \nwell qualified as anyone in this Chamber to speak to those critical \nissues.\n  I bring a different perspective to this nomination. There is going to \nbe, clearly, a division of thought as to General Casey and his role as \nthe senior officer in charge of our combat missions in Iraq. But I wish \nto clearly say that throughout the history of the United States, the \ndoctrine is civilian control over the military.\n  True, we hold accountable, as best we can, those who we feel have not \ncarried out their responsibilities in the best interests of the \ncountry. I believe the accountability of General Casey has been spoken \nto by the general himself. He recognizes mistakes were made, and I \nthink he accepted that level of accountability he, as a military \nofficer, had. But, indeed, it is the civilians above him, if there is \ngreater wrong, who should be held accountable.\n  Second, I think of the institution of the U.S. Army. The Chief of \nStaff is the very pinnacle of the military service, and those \nnominations are exceedingly carefully thought out from the President on \ndown through the Department of Defense before a nomination goes \nforward.\n  I was privileged for some many years to serve as the Navy Secretary \nand witness the careful process that went through selecting a chief of \nservice. I was personally involved in two of those processes for the \nU.S. Navy. So I say to my colleagues, do take into consideration the \ndiffering views of Senator McCain and others eminently qualified to \nassess this nomination, but I believe this nomination was carefully \nthought through at all levels. It represents the institution of the \nU.S. Army, and they have to take pride in their senior Chief of Staff.\n  I believe that General Casey, when one looks at the entirety of the \nrecord, is deserving of the support of colleagues in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \ngranting me this extra time. He is not required to do so.\n  I think we have had a problem and a difference of opinion for some \ntime. Senator McCain has been quite open that he is concerned about the \ntroop levels in Iraq not being sufficient. History may well record he \nis right on that regard, but our policy was different.\n  General Abizaid, the commander for that region, the Central Command, \nstudied the area throughout his career. He was concerned about too many \ntroops in Iraq from the beginning. General Casey came on after General \nAbizaid was CENTCOM commander and became the commander in Iraq. He was \nVice Chief of Staff of the Army at that time, he was to be gone for 18 \nmonths. He ended up being away from his family for 30 months, 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, and he executed the policy as best he could.\n  He testified that in his view, he didn't want to ask for a single \nsoldier more than he needed to do the job. I don't know what the \ntension is, but there was a constant tension between the need to have \nmore soldiers and to not take over the entire effort in Iraq.\n  General Abizaid and General Casey made their recommendations. We \nfollowed them. That experience in Iraq, in my view, can only make him \nbetter as Chief of Staff.\n  He was Vice Chief of Staff, lead our forces for 30 months in Iraq, \nand now he will be Chief of Staff. He was born in an Army hospital. His \nfather was killed in Vietnam. He served 37 years in the Army. His son \nis a member of the Army.\n  He should not bear the brunt of a difference of opinion about how we \nshould have conducted the effort in Iraq. He gave his absolute best \neffort to it. He could not help but have learned a lot in the process. \nHe will be a fine Chief of Staff.\n  Mr. President, my time is up. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted for GEN George W. Casey, Jr., to \nbe U.S. Army Chief of Staff. While questions have been raised about \nGeneral Casey's performance as U.S. commander in Iraq, I do not believe \nthe general can be held responsible for the failures of a policy \ndevised at the highest levels of this administration.\n  But my vote to confirm General Casey does not change my opposition to \nthe President's policies in Iraq. The President has made the wrong \njudgment about Iraq time and again, first by taking us into war on a \nfraudulent basis, then by keeping our brave troops in Iraq, and now by \nsending 21,500 more American troops into harm's way.\n  The indefinite presence of U.S. military personnel in Iraq will not \nfix that country's political problems. And as we have seen over the \nlast few years, sending more troops will not provide the stability in \nIraq that can only come from a political agreement. Congress must \ndevelop the courage to confront this President on what has become one \nof the greatest foreign policy mistakes in our history.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the service of \nGeneral Casey and speak in support of his confirmation as Chief of \nStaff of the Army.\n  General Casey has had a long and distinguished career. After his \ngraduation from Georgetown University in 1970, he received his \ncommission and served in the mechanized infantry. During his career, he \nhas commanded the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division and acted as \nthe assistant division commander of the 1st Armored Division. In 1999, \nGeneral Casey assumed command of the 1st Armored Division. \nAdditionally, General Casey has served as Director of Strategic Plans \nand Policy at the Pentagon and as Director of the Joint Staff.\n  As we all know, General Casey has most recently served as the \ncommander of Multi-National Forces--Iraq. As commander of our forces in \nIraq, General Casey faced extremely difficult issues everyday.\n  I believe General Casey to be a good man, and I would like to again \ncongratulate him on his promotion and thank him for his continued \nservice to our country. I look forward to working with him while he \nserves as Chief of Staff of the Army.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconfirmation of General George Casey to become the next Chief of Staff \nof the U.S. Army.\n  Let us be clear. Our soldiers are fighting a grueling and dangerous \nwar. They need to know that their leaders will have no higher priority \nthan their safety and well-being. I believe that General Casey will do \njust that.\n  He has been on the frontlines of the war in Iraq. As commander of \nU.S. forces there, he has overseen operations on the ground; he \nunderstands our soldiers' basic needs and will take action to keep them \nfighting safely and effectively.\n  I believe that in this new position, like GEN Peter Schoomaker before \nhim, he will work hard to ensure that our soldiers have the equipment \nand support they need to get the job done.\n  Regrettably, I am concerned that some in this administration and in \nthis Congress have decided to blame General Casey for the worsening \nsituation on the ground. To them I would say that it is simply wrong, \nand frankly un-American, to hold one soldier responsible for the \nadministration's policy failures in Iraq.\n  In his book, ``Deriliction of Duty,'' H.R. McMasters put the blame \nfor Vietnam on our military leaders. To McMasters, it was our generals \nwho were at fault for not speaking out when they disagreed with the \ncivilians at the Pentagon and White House.\n  As a result of their silence, America became further entrenched in \nVietnam. Nine years ago, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN \nHugh Shelton took this message to heart; requiring all 17 four-star \ngeneral commanders to read Major McMasters' book. The book had an \nimpact. As the situation in Iraq has deteriorated, we have seen our \ngenerals stand up to civilian leaders--putting their country before \ntheir careers--and courageously advocating for alternative, more \nsensible policies.\n\n[[Page S1741]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the same arrogance and incompetence that has blinded \nU.S. foreign policy for the past 6 years has also allowed the dire \nwarnings from these generals to fall on deaf ears. The candor from the \nlikes of Generals Shinseki and Riggs, and now Abizaid, Casey, and \nSchoomaker, has been rewarded with dismissal, transfer or demotion.\n  In my private meeting with General Casey in Iraq 2 months ago, he \nexplained his concern over proposals to ``surge'' additional troops \ninto Iraq if Iraqis are unable to meet their own responsibilities to \nunite politically and contribute more meaningfully to their own \nsecurity.\n  He echoed these objections along with then-Central Command's top \ngeneral, GEN John Abizaid, in a Washington Post report on December 21, \n2006.\n  Obviously, General Casey is uniquely qualified to make these \nstatements. He has been thoroughly immersed in our Iraq operations. And \nit is for this reason that he is uniquely prepared to assume the Army \nChief of Staff post.\n  But there is another quality of his that I believe will also serve \nour Nation and our Army well during his tenure as Chief of Staff. It \nhis is loyalty to our soldiers--from the newly enlisted private to the \ncareer officer.\n  I observed this quality firsthand 3 years ago on a visit to Walter \nReed Medical Center. I met with soldiers recuperating from injuries \nthey had suffered in Iraq and Afghanistan, and expressed my gratitude \nfor their brave service.\n  General Casey happened to be at Walter Reed that day as well. I knew \nhe was there for the same reason I was: to thank these soldiers for \ntheir service and to assure them that their sacrifices will never be \nforgotten.\n  The Chief of Staff must constantly exhibit such loyalty to his \ntroops. He must be their strongest advocate and continue to address \ntheir needs, even when doing so is in direct conflict with the orders \nbeing handed down from civilian leadership. General Schoomaker, the \noutgoing Chief of Staff, has been faced with this situation time and \nagain as the administration proposed inadequate budgets to carry out \ntheir deeply flawed Iraq strategy. And he has performed superbly.\n  As Chief of Staff for the last few years, General Schoomaker, has \nlong voiced concern that the administration failed to budget for the \nreplacement and repair of thousands of war-battered trucks, aircraft, \nand vehicles. In fact, it was General Schoomaker's testimony last year \nthat compelled me to offer an amendment to fund these priorities and \nhelp begin restoring Army readiness. I regret that the White House \ndecided to reward General Schoomaker's candor by replacing him at the \nPentagon.\n  At his recent confirmation hearing the other day, I was pleased to \nhear that General Casey will resume General Schoomaker's mission to \nensure that our forces are outfitted with the equipment they need to \nget the job done.\n  Mr. President, there are no easy answers in Iraq. But, when it comes \nto discerning tactics on the ground, our civilian leaders must defer to \nour generals. In this case, it is my sincere hope that the President \ntakes heed of the advice of his newly installed Army Chief of Staff, to \nmake the safety and well-being of our soldiers a top priority and not \nan afterthought. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nnominee for confirmation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the nomination of General George \nCasey to be Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army and disavow attempts to \nblame him for the failures in Iraq.\n  The blame for the disastrous and reckless war in Iraq lies with the \nPresident, Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense \nDonald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The blame \nstarts at the top. It is they who must be held accountable.\n  General Casey did not author the misguided doctrine of preemptive \nwar. General Casey did not manipulate and politicize intelligence to \nsell the Iraq war to the American people. And General Casey did not \nfail to provide a political solution to end the sectarian violence that \nis now engulfing Iraq. It is the civilian leadership of the Bush \nadministration that continues to fail us in Iraq.\n  When I traveled to Iraq and met with General Casey, he told me the \ntruth. He said that the U.S. presence was fueling the insurgency. I \nappreciated his candor. He fully understood the dangers and challenges \nin Iraq. Unlike so many in the Bush administration, his view of the \nsituation in Iraq was not distorted by rose-colored classes.\n  General Casey did not lead us down this dangerous path in Iraq. \nTherefore I cast a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me make it clear, I don't support \nmedals for failure. I don't support promotion to a higher position for \nfailure. I believe that the awards and accolades Senator Levin alluded \nto that have been provided to those who have committed egregious \nfailures was not only inappropriate, it was absolutely insulting.\n  I also, though, point out that history will judge many of these \npeople who have been given medals of various types, and already that \njudgment has been harsh. All of us are more concerned about our place \nin history than we are medals. History and the American people are \nalready judging the failures and the misleading statements, such as \n``stuff happens'' and ``mission accomplished'' and a few ``dead-\nenders'' and ``last throes'' and all of those statements which have \nbeen made over the past 3\\1/2\\ years which led the American people to \nbelieve we were succeeding in Iraq when many of us knew we weren't \nbecause we violated a fundamental principle called the Powell doctrine: \nIf you want to win, you go in with overwhelming force.\n  The reason I am very concerned today, even though we have a very \noutstanding general in Petraeus, is that I am not sure we have enough \ntroops still.\n  Throughout our history, military commanders have been held \nresponsible. Abraham Lincoln held General McClellan responsible and \nfired him. In World War II, those who were in command who were \nresponsible for December 7, 1941, were held responsible. In the Korean \nwar, General MacArthur was held responsible. The fact is that military \nleaders are held responsible as well as civilian leaders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nnumber of times President Bush said that he relied on the judgment of \nthe military commanders. Those military commanders did not exercise \ngood judgment and therefore are responsible for the rosy scenario and \nthe inaccurate depiction of facts on the ground in Iraq as they came \nbefore our committee, the Armed Services Committee, and spoke to the \nPresident of the United States and the American people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      President George W. Bush on Support for Commanders/Generals\n\n       President Bush: ``One of the things that's important is \n     for--and one of the reasons why you trust the commanders on \n     the ground is because there needs to be flexibility. And I \n     explained to the Prime Minister that I'll be making my \n     decisions based upon the recommendations of General Casey.'' \n     (President George W. Bush, Press Conference, 7/31/06)\n       President Bush: ``I have said to the American people, as \n     the Iraqis stand up, we'll stand down. But I've also said \n     that our commanders on the ground will make that decision. \n     And I have--we'll talk to General Casey once he is--conferred \n     with the new Government of Iraq.'' (President George W. Bush, \n     Press Conference, 5/29/06)\n       President Bush: ``And so the army is getting on its feet. \n     We've turned over a lot of territory to the army. And they're \n     good fighters; they really are. I spent a great deal of time \n     with General Abizaid and General Casey--they were in \n     Washington this past week--these are generals, you'd be happy \n     to hear, who tell me the way it is, not the way they think I \n     would like it to be.'' (President George W. Bush, Remarks On \n     The War On Terror And A Question-And-Answer Session, \n     Louisville, KY, 1/16/06)\n       President Bush: ``The best people to give any politician \n     advice about whether or not we're achieving a military \n     objective is the people you put out there on the ground. I \n     told you I've got good confidence in these generals and the \n     people who report to them. These are honest, honorable, \n     decent, very capable, smart people, and they'll decide the \n     troop levels.'' (President George W. Bush, Remarks On The War \n     On Terror And A Question-And-Answer Session, Louisville, KY, \n     1/16/06)\n\n[[Page S1742]]\n\n       ``President Bush said he relies on military advisors and \n     other officials on the ground in Iraq to keep him abreast of \n     the situation in the country, and they're telling him civil \n     war is not imminent. `This notion that we're in civil war is \n     just not true according to them,' he told Wolf Blitzer in an \n     interview taped earlier this week that aired today. \n     (``President Bush: Iraq Not On Brink Of Civil War,'' \n     Congressional Quarterly, 9/24/06)\n       ``Bush also has said he would rely on the opinions of U.S. \n     military commanders in the two countries for determining how \n     soon troops would be withdrawn. `As we see more of these \n     Iraqi forces in the lead, we'll be able to continue with our \n     desire, our stated strategy that says as Iraqis stand up, \n     we'll stand down,' the president said. ``In 2006, we expect \n     Iraqis will take more and more control of the battle space, \n     and as they do so, we will need fewer U.S. troops to conduct \n     combat operations around that country.'' (``Bush Says U.S. \n     Forces Will Be Reduced In Iraq, Afghanistan,'' State News \n     Service, 1/4/06)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in 2004, General Casey said:\n\n       My view of winning is that we are broadly on track to \n     accomplishing our objectives . . . with Iraqi security forces \n     that are capable of maintaining domestic order and denying \n     Iraq as a safe haven for terror, and I believe we are on \n     track to get there by December of 2005.\n\n  In September of 2005, General Casey said:\n\n       We have a strategy and a plan for success in Iraq, and we \n     are broadly on track in achieving our goals.\n\n  Time after time, the American people were told that things were going \nfine, and they were not.\n  I wish to emphasize again that I believe General Casey has served \nthis Nation honorably. I think he and his family have made great \nsacrifices for this country. I have nothing but respect. But to reward \nfailure is going to send a message all around the military that I don't \nthink is a healthy one. I don't support promotion and I don't support \nmedals for failure. I support people being held responsible, and I \nregret that those who are responsible on the civilian side have not \nbeen held more responsible, although, as we speak today, the American \npeople, by their opinions as reflected in the polls, are certainly \nreflecting their judgment about the performance and responsibility of \nour civilian leaders.\n  I hope we can move forward and obtain successes in Iraq under this \nnew strategy. I am not sure right now that General Casey completely \nsupports it, and I don't think that it enhances our chance for \nsucceeding in Iraq. I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nnomination and select a leader, of which there are many, who is far \nmore capable, in my view, of carrying out the new strategy in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, as I see the \nmajority leader here on the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I will be the \nlast speaker. The distinguished minority leader is not going to speak \nat this time. So after I speak, we will vote. Is that the understanding \nof the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has not been made clear at this time.\n  Mr. REID. That is what I have been told. But if the minority leader \ncomes to the floor to speak, he can, and I will make my statement now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when Harry Truman was President, he put a \nsign on his desk. It said: The buck stops here. He chose this message \nbecause it conveyed to the American public that, as President, Truman \nwas responsible for everything in his administration. Everything.\n  The buck stops here. It is a phrase we should keep in mind as we vote \non GEN George Casey's nomination to be Army Chief of Staff.\n  Despite his service to our country, I know many Senators would like \nto vote no on General Casey's nomination because he has been associated \nwith a broken Iraq policy. I understand others would like to vote no in \nan attempt to make the general a scapegoat for a war that has gone \nhorribly wrong. I believe there are still others who are using this \nnomination as a way to express opposition to the President's escalation \nproposal, a plan General Casey once opposed but now supports. While I \nunderstand these reasons for voting no, I am reminded of that sign on \nPresident Truman's desk. In Iraq, the buck stops with President Bush. \nThe Commander in Chief, not General Casey, is responsible for the \nfailed policy in Iraq.\n  Four years and running, the cost of the war has been staggering. We \nhave lost, as of this morning, 3,111 of our soldiers and seen tens of \nthousands more wounded. The war has stretched our military and their \nfamilies to the breaking point, depleted our Treasury of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, detracted our attention from al-Qaida and the real \nwar on terror, and hurt our image in the Arab community and around the \nworld. Yet despite all this sacrifice and all these costs and because \nof numerous errors by the Commander in Chief, America is less safe. We \nmust change course.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush's answer to this growing chaos and \nsectarian violence in Iraq is not a new direction but more of the same. \nHe wants to send 48,000 more troops to Baghdad and give them mission \nimpossible--policing an Iraqi civil war.\n  This so-called surge policy has many critics, and one of them used to \nbe General Casey. On January 2 of this year, the general is quoted as \nsaying in the New York Times:\n\n       It's always been my view that a heavy and sustained \n     American military presence was not going to solve the \n     problems in Iraq over the long term.\n\n  In other words, escalation is not the answer. But just a month later, \nin his Senate confirmation hearing, he reversed course, saying:\n\n       The increase in the U.S. forces is a key piece of our new \n     strategy to secure Baghdad.\n\n  One day, escalation was not going to solve the problem; the next day, \nescalation was a key piece of our strategy. There is a troubling \ndisconnect between General Casey's two statements. I understand he has \nsince attempted to explain his change of heart by noting, in the time \nbetween his two comments, that a new strategy, the so-called surge, had \nbeen propounded by the White House and more troops were needed to \ninstitute the President's new policy. But does General Casey really \nbelieve this? Do we believe a general on the battlefield or in his \nplush Pentagon office? I will take General Casey at his word. After \nall, the buck stops with the President, not with General Casey.\n  Even though I have grave concerns about the direction of the war and \nGeneral Casey, I will vote for his confirmation to be Army Chief of \nStaff. I do, however, pray that General Casey has the courage to speak \nhis convictions in his new post. The last thing our Nation and our \ntroops need is a ``yes'' man with access to the Oval Office--someone \nwho tells the President what he wants to hear and not what he needs to \nhear. ``Yes'' men, such as Vice President Cheney and former Secretary \nof Defense Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, led us into this Iraq quagmire. To \nend the war, the President is going to have to start listening to and \nheeding the advice of those who disagree with him in order to get us \nout.\n  In the Senate this week, we attempted to give the President another \nchance to listen. We tried to give the bipartisan majority of Senators \nwho oppose escalation the chance to send a clear message to President \nBush. Unfortunately, our majority was silenced by a minority of \nRepublicans who decided protecting the President was more important \nthan sending him a message: Do not surge. Do not escalate.\n  It is time the White House and its champions in Congress stopped \nplaying politics in the war. We have had enough politics and far too \nlittle diplomacy. What we need is a strategy that will succeed in Iraq. \nI hope General Casey will play such a role in bringing such a strategy \nabout and, thus, I will vote for his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all the time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof General George W. Casey, Jr., to be Chief of Staff, United States \nArmy?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Florida (Mr. Martinez) and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, I rise on behalf of a colleague and \nfriend, Senator Thad Cochran. Last Tuesday, Thad cast his 10,000th vote \nhere in the Senate, and in typical fashion, we didn't hear a whole lot \nabout it. As Thad once told a reporter:\n\n       That is just the way I was brought up. I believe you don't \n     have to toot your own horn too much.\n\n  Always humble, Thad is the perfect embodiment of the southern \ngentleman, and the Senate is a better and more civil place because of \nhim.\n  Thad's political career got off to an early start. As a teenager, he \npassed out campaign literature with his mom in Utica, MS. He helped his \ndad with voter registration drives, and a few decades later, he would \nmake Bill and Emma Cochran proud by becoming the first Mississippi \nRepublican in more than a century to win a statewide office--no small \nfeat for a guy whose first job was working as a carhop at Gunn's Dairy \nBar.\n  Thad was always a standout. An Eagle Scout, he earned varsity letters \nin football, basketball, baseball, and tennis and was valedictorian of \nhis high school class. He served with distinction in a 2-year tour with \nthe Navy. He excelled in law school and became a partner in one of \nMississippi's top law firms in just 2\\1/2\\ years. And he served the \npeople of the Magnolia State with distinction and grace in the U.S. \nCongress for 35 years.\n  Thad's colleagues in the Senate have seen his humility up close. The \npeople at the Neshoba County Fair got to see it for themselves a few \nyears back. As Thad's car pulled up, a big crowd gathered around to \nshake his hand. So when the passenger side door opened, they all rushed \nin and got a good close look at Thad's personal assistant, Fred Pagen. \nThey didn't expect to see Thad behind the wheel, nor do a lot of other \nfolks who have picked him up at events in DC and back home.\n  Thad gets a lot of special treatment. The Ten Thousandth Vote Club is \nsort of like the Five Hundredth Home Run Club in baseball. As you might \nexpect, Senator Byrd is the Hank Aaron of the Senate, but Thad might \nget there yet, and those of us who have had the good pleasure of \nworking with him hope that he does.\n  Winston Churchill once said of an enemy:\n\n       He has all the virtues I dislike and all the vices I \n     admire.\n\n  Mr. President, I feel the opposite about my friend, Thad Cochran. He \nhas all the virtues I admire and none of the vices I dislike.\n  So I congratulate him on his many years of dedicated service and \nthank him for his friendship and, above all, his extraordinary example.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there were ever a time during my career \nhere in the Senate where I say I associate myself with those remarks, I \ndo now. Thad Cochran is a wonderful man. As the distinguished \nRepublican leader said, he is strong. He doesn't talk very much. He is \nsilent most of the time. He loves the Senate. He is one of the people I \nlook to for maintaining the dignity of the Senate.\n  On the Appropriations Committee, which I have had the pleasure of \nserving with him since I came to the Senate, he is as dignified as he \nis in the Senate and as he is everyplace else. He believes in following \nregular order. He believes in working through the tedious process the \nSenate requires. I look forward to working with him this year.\n  Senator McConnell and I have made a commitment, and Senator Cochran \nknows this, to do our appropriations bills this year. We are going to \nwork together on a bipartisan basis to get those bills completed and \nSenator Cochran will be an integral part of our being able to do this.\n  We all have fond memories of Thad Cochran. My personal feeling of \nwarmth relates to a trip we took. I took my wife Landra and he took his \nlovely wife Rose and we had a wonderful time. Senator Glenn was there \nleading the delegation. I will always remember that. I will always \nremember the relationship of the two of you.\n  So as we proceed through the difficult days ahead of us in the \nSenate, everyone within the sound of my voice should understand that \none reason we will be able to make it through the troubled waters of \nthe Senate is because of Thad Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, for allowing me to go next in line so I can speak \nbriefly about my colleague from the State of Mississippi. I thank \nSenator McConnell for his remarks, and Senator Reid. They did a \nmagnificent job summing up the character of this great Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Senator Cochran and I have been in the Congress together now for--\nthis is our 35th year. We came together in the House of Representatives \nin 1973. He moved over to the Senate in 1978. He was elected, and came \nhere in 1979, and eventually I tagged along with him again.\n  Senator Cochran and I go back to the 1960s. We were both students at \nthe same university, the University of Mississippi. His wife Rose and I \nwere in the same class, and we worked together in student activities. I \nalways felt I had a special friendship with Senator Cochran because of \nmy friendship also with his wife Rose.\n  Our parents were schoolteachers--both his mother and father and my \nmother. We both started out as Baptists, and I think we still are, in a \nway. Just right down the line, we have a lot in common. In fact, some \npeople wonder how I get as many votes as I do in Mississippi. It is \nbecause I think some people get confused between Thad and Trent, and I \nam known in some areas as Thad Lott, but it seems to work. I benefit by \nstanding in the reflection of his great stature in our State of \nMississippi.\n  I am very proud of my colleague from our State. We have had some \ngreat Senators from our State, but Senator Cochran is rising to the \nlevel of the stature of the best of those. So I am very proud of the \nrecord he has achieved here, the number of votes he has cast, and I am \nhoping that he will cast 10,000 more before he decides to leave this \ngreat institution.\n\n  But I must say on a very personal note, I have never been more proud \nof my colleague from Mississippi than I was in the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina in 2005 and 2006. His quiet, steady, methodical, \nrational effort to help us get what we needed to recover from that \nmajor disaster was an incredible thing to watch. The respect he has in \nthis institution on both sides of the aisle helped him to lead the way \nin getting the help we needed for our State. I was belated in doing it, \nbut I will never quit doing it, when last fall\n\n[[Page S1744]]\n\nI thanked the Senate--the Congress--for what they did do for us after \nthat hurricane. Everything Senator Cochran and I and others from our \nState asked the Congress to do, they did it, and we will always be in \ndebt.\n  On the 1-year anniversary of that cataclysmic event in our State, he \nand I were sitting on the same platform as the Sun came up in Biloxi, \nMS, on August 29, 2006--a hot morning. A year earlier, the water had \nbeen about--probably 25 feet from where we were sitting. The surge was \nthat high, or more. There were many of us on that platform: mayors, \nsupervisors, Congressmen, the Governor. We were all taking deep bows \nfor all the money we had brought to the people of this devastated area.\n  Finally, I had about all I could stand, including taking my own bows, \nand I finally rose and said: It is fine to share the credit, and there \nare many of us here who have done our best. But most of us could not be \ntaking credit for what has happened if it were not for the man sitting \nright behind me on this platform, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi.\n  It is an incredible thing we have experienced in terms of pain and \nsuffering but also in honor and in glory and in appreciation for what \nhas happened since then. So I hope there are many other high-water \nmarks in his great career, but none will ever be appreciated so much as \nthe service he gave to our State and to our country in the aftermath of \nthat hurricane.\n  Thank you, my colleague. It is a pleasure serving with you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Vermont has to go \nto a meeting quickly. How much time do you need?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Less than a minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator for that purpose.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, the most senior person here and, of course, the one who \nserves the closest with Senator Cochran on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I could not help but think, listening to the wonderful \nthings my distinguished other friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, \nwas saying about Senator Thad Cochran, about a recent trip overseas we \ntook together, and I heard him saying many of those same things out of \nthe hearing of Senator Cochran, praising Senator Cochran very much on \nthat trip with myself and other Senators. I mention that because \nsometimes praising you outside your presence means more than doing it \ninside your presence.\n  Thad Cochran is as close a friend as I have ever had in the Senate. \nWe have traveled together overseas. I have traveled to Mississippi with \nhim. He explained to me I had to slow down my speech a little bit. He \nhas come to Vermont with me. My late parents used to tell me what a \nnice young man he is. I know how much my mother and father enjoyed \nmeeting him not only in Vermont but in subsequent visits to Washington.\n  I recall what Senator Stennis once said of Senator Cochran: He is a \nSenator, all in capital letters. You could hear John Stennis's voice \nboom over here: He is a Senator's Senator. He is a Senator. Most \nimportantly to me, he is my good friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senators know of my good nature, and so some \nof them want me to yield, which I will do. I am the President pro \ntempore. I wouldn't ask another President pro tempore to do that. But \nmay I yield to my seatmate, Mr. Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my seatmate and colleague from West \nVirginia. I just want to add my voice to those who have spoken and \nthose who are about to speak in saying that--just to repeat what \nSenator Leahy said well--we use the words ``Senator's Senator'' with \nsome frequency here, but if I were to ask the question of which \nSenators reflected that expression more so than anyone else, it would \nhave to be my colleague from West Virginia and my colleague from \nMississippi. It is a pleasure to serve with him. I admire him \nimmensely. He is exactly what a Senator ought to be: a good legislator \nand a good person who cares about his country, and I am proud to serve \nwith him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from West Virginia \nwants to make his comments. I wonder if I could just have one moment as \nwell.\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course. I yield to my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had the good fortune of meeting Thad \nCochran before he was even a Senator. This was when he was wearing the \nuniform of the U.S. Navy and he was stationed up in the New England \narea in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I didn't know at that time, \nwhen I was about to become a freshman Senator and he was in the service \nof our military, that our paths would cross again in this wonderful \nChamber, or that he would go on to have the kind of career he has had \nin the Senate. But it was evident then, so many years ago, that this \nimpressive young naval officer possessed the same qualities we all see \ntoday. Then as now, Thad Cochran possessed a deep sense of fairness and \ncompassion, a great commitment to this country we all love, and, above \nall, good judgment and good humor.\n  Thad and I don't always agree on policy matters--and more often than \nnot we find ourselves on the opposite side of the issues--but those \ndisagreements never diminish my respect for his thoughtfulness, and nor \ndo they diminish the friendship I feel toward him.\n  So I, too, want to join my colleagues in paying tribute to an \nextraordinary Senator and a great patriot as he marks this wonderful \nmilestone. The people of Mississippi are fortunate indeed to have him \nfighting for them every day in the U.S. Senate, and all of us are lucky \nas well to call Thad Cochran our colleague and friend. He is a Senator \nof great integrity, and we congratulate you Thad on this extraordinary \nday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week my friend--my friend--Senator Thad \nCochran, the very distinguished member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, achieved a milestone in his career of public service to the \npeople of Mississippi and the United States. Senator Cochran cast his \n10,000th vote, his 10,000th rollcall vote, a record only 27 other \nSenators have achieved since the founding of this great Republic.\n\n  A Senator's vote is so much more than a number on the final tally. \nEach and every vote represents an investment of time, research, and \nanalysis on the part of himself and, in many cases, on the part of the \nstaff, also on a given issue. Each vote is an evaluation of what best \nserves one's constituents, one's State, and one's country.\n  Over these many years, I have personally noted that Senator Cochran \napproaches his responsibility with diligence. I have many reasons to \nknow that. He approaches his votes with diligence, with a fine and keen \nintelligence, with sterling courage--he is from Mississippi--with \ncourage and compassion.\n  This son of public-spirited and politically aware schoolteachers \ndemonstrated all these qualities at an early age as an Eagle Scout--I \nwas never an Eagle Scout; I was a Tenderfoot--as a valedictorian--I \nknow what that means--class valedictorian, as a varsity athlete--I \ndon't know what that means--as a varsity athlete in four sports. Man, \nthat is something, a varsity athlete in four sports. He is a hard \nworker--I know what that means--at whatever task to which he applies \nhimself. I can't say much more than that.\n  Senator Cochran achieved a scintillating academic record at the \nUniversity of Mississippi School of Law and went on to serve as a naval \nofficer in the Armed Forces of the United States. The discipline and \nthe critical thinking he learned in those venues has served him well \nduring his tenure in the Congress.\n  The senior Senator from Mississippi has been a Member of the Senate \nsince 1978, and 1978 was when I was serving as the Senate majority \nleader. He served three terms in the House of Representatives prior to \nthat--and so did I, three terms in the House of Representatives.\n  Throughout this time, Senator Cochran has paid particularly close \nattention to the needs of his constituents in Mississippi. That was his \nduty. Most\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\nrecently, after his home State was hit by the worst natural disaster in \nthe history of the United States, the distinguished Senator--a \ncolleague of his has already spoken of that but I mention it here--\nSenator Cochran used his role as the chairman of the Senate Committee \non Appropriations to advance legislation that provided over $87 \nbillion--that is ``billion;'' a billion is one dollar for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born--Mr. Cochran provided over $87 billion in \nsupplemental Federal assistance to the States affected by Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.\n  A country western artist once asked in song ``where would we be \nwithout the love of a woman?'' ``Where would we be without the love of \na woman?'' Undoubtedly, the love and the support of his wife of over 42 \nyears, Rose--I remember Rose--helped Senator Cochran achieve this great \nmilestone. As I have risen to recognize the Senator, I also wish to \nsalute Rose. She was a beautiful lady, very warm smile, Rose.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague whose record in this Senate has \nbeen that of a true Christian gentleman and a man of genuine political \nhumility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my many colleagues today in \nrecognizing this remarkable achievement of my longtime friend, Thad \nCochran, who has crossed the threshold of casting 10,000 rollcall votes \nin the U.S. Senate. In the over 200-year history of the Senate, only 28 \nSenators have reached this historic milestone. Thad and I both are \nprivileged to be 2 of the 28.\n  Thad and I were first elected to the Senate in 1978, and we are the \nonly remaining Republican Senators of the class. He was sworn in 4 days \nprior to my taking the oath of office; and, consequently, he is senior \nto me. I have always dutifully acknowledged that seniority.\n  Colleagues have extolled his extraordinary record, and I shall not \nadd further to his wonderful chapter of public service to Mississippi \nand our Nation.\n  I have, however, a most unique, unlike any other Senator, reason to \nhave the highest regard for this wonderful man. For an extensive period \nin my life, over 20 years, I was a bachelor. There was a tragic loss of \na life in our community--Belle Haven--of a man greatly admired and \nrespected by all. I was privileged to have a friendship with this man. \nThad helped his family and widow in the wake of that tragedy.\n  There came a time in the years that followed that loss when I said to \nThad, you know, this widow is someone I admire greatly, could I be of \nhelp, for I am making little or no progress whatsoever in gaining her \nattention. Being very protective, he allowed he would--in his own good \ntime--try to draw his friend's attention to me. And I am so grateful \ntoday to have my extraordinary wife, Jeanne, who as you well know, \nloves you dearly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear, hear.\n  Mr. WARNER. I don't know that I would be standing here today, given \nmy wayward ways in life, had it not been for Thad Cochran and this \nwonderful lady who cares for me now. So, Thad, I wish you well. What \nthe future holds for both of us remains to be seen. But I am proud to \nbe counted among your most devoted friends.\n  As one describes you, I would say you reflect all the qualities a \nSenator should have--but foremost among them, is always your calm \ndignity. I yield the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask to be able to address the Senate as \nif in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. At the outset, let me say as a rookie in the Senate, I \nadd and echo everything that was said about Senator Cochran. He is \ntruly one to whom all of us who are new to this body should subscribe \nand hope in time we could equal his accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1745-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRAYERS FOR CONGRESSMAN NORWOOD\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I rise for a moment to ask all Members of the Senate to \njoin me in expressing their concern, their hopes, and their prayers for \nCongressman Charlie Norwood. Congressman Norwood, of Georgia, yesterday \nnotified the House and the Senate that he would be returning to his \nhome in Augusta.\n  A little over 2 years ago, Charlie had a lung transplant to try to \ncorrect a degenerative disease which he had had with him throughout his \nlife. That transplant was successful and he returned to the House of \nRepresentatives and, as he always did, he represented the State of \nGeorgia with courage, with dignity, and with tenacity.\n  Unfortunately, last year, cancer occurred in the lung and \nsuccessfully was removed by surgery. But it has reappeared now in his \nliver. Charlie is fighting for his life.\n  His lovely wife Gloria is in Augusta with him, and his countless \nthousands of friends are there. But in this business that we go through \nin this Senate, there is always a time that all of us should reflect on \nthe blessings we have, and that is the blessing of life. I pray now \nthat the good Lord will look after Charlie and give him as much of that \nlife as He possibly can.\n  I think it is also appropriate that we reflect a minute on how \nimportant his service in the Congress has been. We all know that \ndomestically health care, affordability of health insurance, doctor-\npatient relationship is probably the singular thing the American people \nlook to us to help solve. Charlie Norwood and his cosponsorship of \nNorwood-Dingell laid a platform for which one day many of those \nproblems will be solved. He has fought tenaciously for better health \ncare, for better patient-doctor relationships, and a better \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the providers of \nlifesaving health care around the country.\n  At this moment, while a champion of health care is in dire straits \nhimself, I hope all Members will join me and pray that his recovery \nwill be fast and swift and that God puts His blessed hand on his \nshoulder.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

When I came to you asking for appropriate \nhelp, you were there. And then, lo and behold, the next year is when \nyou had your set of hurricanes, and it was my privilege to try to help \nreturn the favor.\n  You are a real gentleman, and passing the 10,000 vote mark is quite \nan achievement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I wish to take this opportunity to also commend my \ncolleague, Senator Cochran.\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\n  It is truly amazing when someone has been here long enough to cast \n10,000 votes.

Dorgan, Ben Nelson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I have had many \ndiscussions about possible amendments to this important funding bill. \nThe distinguished Republican leader has told me on several occasions it \nis very important that we arrange that there be amendments to this \nbill. I am doing my very best to try to work something out in that \nregard. I do not know how to say this again. He does not need to tell \nme again because he has told me so many times how important it is.\n  This bill was put together with bipartisan cooperation. The chairmen, \ntheir staffs, and the subcommittees have worked very hard on getting us \nto where we are now. We are in an unusual situation because this \nlegislation, which is truly bipartisan--as was the minimum wage bill, \nas was the ethics and lobbying reform bill--is many degrees--many \ndegrees--more important than that because this legislation funds almost \nevery element of our Federal Government for the remainder of the fiscal \nyear. It has to be signed into law by Wednesday, a week from today. It \nhas to be. This bill allows us to complete last Congress's work and \npermit the new leadership on both sides of the aisle to begin to \naddress the tasks involved in putting together the fiscal year 2008 \nappropriations bills.\n  We are in the position we are in because we are in this position. It \nis not the first time. But I am confident, in my experience here, we \nhave never had such bipartisan cooperation trying to work our way out \nof a difficult situation. It has not been easy. But we are where we \nare. I express my appreciation to Senator Byrd, his staff, Senator \nCochran and his staff, and all their counterparts--the chairmen and \nranking members--for helping us get to the point where we are. It is so \nimportant we do this so we can get on with the fiscal year 2008 \nappropriations bills.\n  As I said earlier today in congratulating Senator Cochran on his \n10,000th vote, we need to pass appropriations bills, not for the \nRepublicans, not for the Democrats, not for the Senate, but for our \ncountry. We are going to do everything we can to do that. And I will \ncontinue to work with the distinguished Republican leader. I am sure I \nwill hear from him in the next few days more than I want to on this \nsubject. I am trying to work something out on the amendments, and I \nwill do my best to try to work something out.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the opening \nstatements of Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran, we go into morning \nbusiness. Of course, that would also be after any remarks the \ndistinguished Republican leader wants to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the majority \nleader, for his observations about our discussions over the last few \ndays about the possibility of consideration of some amendments on this \nside of the aisle. I have been presenting those amendments to the \nmajority as we have collected them. There are a number of concerns \nMembers on this side of the aisle have that they would prefer to see \naddressed through the amendment process, particularly given the \nmagnitude of this bill. I appreciate the majority leader considering \nthose requests and will continue to funnel those amendments over as we \nget them.\n  Let me just say, by way of comparison, we have been here before. Four \nyears ago last month, the Senate had just changed hands from the \nDemocrats to the Republicans. Our good friends on the other side of the \naisle, at that point, had also not passed 11 of the 13 appropriations \nbills. What the new Senate majority did in January of 2003 was to take \nup a collection of bills, typically referred to around here as Omnibus \nappropriations. Over 100 amendments were offered during the process of \nconsideration of that collection of appropriations bills, after which \nthey were passed. I had hoped that would have been the way we would \nhave proceeded this year. There was precedent for it 4 years ago.\n  Nevertheless, I understand the concern the majority leader has about \ncompleting this work before midnight a week from now, and I understand \nthe other complications presented by trying to do a measure of this \nmagnitude in such a short period of time. Nevertheless, we will be \ncontinuing our discussion, the majority leader and myself, about the \npossibility of offering amendments that Senators on our side of the \naisle believe are important and would improve this massive bill, which \nwould fund the Government from now until September 30 of this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could make one final statement--I see \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas on the floor--I have not only \nheard from her staff but a number of her colleagues. This is one of the \namendments my staff is working on now to see if there is some way we \ncan maybe allow the Senator to move forward. But I say to the Senator, \nI want you to know we are looking at it. I have had personal \nconversations with my office staff based on being directed that way by \nthe Republican leader. So we are taking a look at this. I want you to \nknow that. There are other people who have concerns, not just you, \nabout base realignment closings. What is it called? BRAC, base \nrealignment. OK.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader if \nI could respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I so appreciate what you have just \nsaid. I do hope the door is still open. Originally, I had hoped we \ncould do the military construction as well as the base-closing \ncommission funding because the delays are going to have impacts \nthroughout the military services. But the amendment I am hoping to \noffer, that I am told now you are considering--the Hutchison-Inhofe \namendment--only does the BRAC funding. It only restores the funding for \nBRAC so that the 6-year time allotment this Congress itself has \nmandated for BRAC to be completed can, in fact, be done. If we delay \nthe BRAC, it will have severe consequences on 12,000 troops coming home \nhopefully this year. And there are so many other things. I know some of \nthe Members on your side of the aisle have talked to you about \nenvironmental remediation that will not be able to be done, and other \nthings. So I so hope we can work this out so the House could approve it \nand we would not have to have a conference.\n  I hope the majority leader will also consider, when we do go into the \nsupplemental, looking at some of the MILCON that must be done before \nthe 2008 budget starts for that year of funding. There are some \nprerequisites that are necessary. But I have set that aside in \ndeference to the wishes of the majority to try to move a bill forward. \nBut I do think the BRAC has been the single area where we have not been \nable to accommodate what needs to be done to move forward. And delays \nare very costly.\n  I do thank you for making it a point to say that to me, and I think \nwe certainly would have time. I would work with anyone on the \nDemocratic side or House side to work out differences, if there are \ndifferences. All of these projects in the $3.1 billion we would like to \nput back in have been approved by Congress, approved by the Senate, and \nasked for by the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. REID. I will be brief because I know the two managers of the bill \nneed to speak. As the distinguished Senator from Texas knows, I have \nrecognized the good work she and Senator Feinstein have done on the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. It has been exemplary. It speaks \nvolumes about how the Senate has changed, that we had two women taking \ncare of the billions of dollars needed every year for military \nconstruction. I know you know this issue.\n  On the BRAC issue, I have spoken to Senator Byrd and his staff. That \nwas one of the big issues that was in the beginning of trying to get \nthis CR to the point where it is. I personally have spoken to Chairman \nObey about this issue. This is a problem. It is a problem that has been \nraised by Members of the House of Representatives and Senators. You \nhave my assurance that we will continue to look at this amendment. I \nspoke to Chairman Obey, because he is getting a lot of talk on the \nother side. He said: If you don't work something out on this, you have \nmy commitment that we will take care of this in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. We are weighing all the considerations we have in \nthe most important phase of keeping our military safe, not only keeping \nthem safe but doing what we promised them to do, not only them but \ntheir community which is depending on what we do here to make up for \nthe bases we are closing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to assure all Senators that the \nAppropriations Committee intends to address the $3.1 billion increase \nproposed in the Senator's amendment when the Senate takes up the $100 \nbillion supplemental that the President sent to the Congress this week. \nI have every expectation that the supplemental will be before the \nSenate next month.\n  Today marks the 131st day of fiscal year 2007. We are debating H.J. \nRes. 20, a joint funding resolution for the nine remaining \nappropriations bills that were not completed during the 109th Congress. \nThe Republican leadership, during the 109th Congress, left us with a \ngreat deal of unfinished business in the appropriations process. Only 2 \nof the 11 appropriations bills were enacted into law. Thirteen of the \nfifteen Federal departments--all but Defense and Homeland Security--are \nlimping along through February 15 under a very restrictive continuing \nresolution.\n  This is not the fault of the Appropriations Committee. Under the very \nable leadership of Chairman Thad Cochran, all of the fiscal year 2007 \nappropriations bills were reported from the committee by July 20. All \nof the bills were bipartisan bills, with all but one of the bills \napproved, 28 to nothing, in committee. Unfortunately, the Republican \nleadership chose not to bring domestic appropriations bills to the \nfloor before the election and then chose not to finish those bills \nafter the election. Instead, Congress passed three very restrictive \ncontinuing resolutions.\n  These resolutions, if simply extended, would leave huge problems for \nveterans and military medical care, education programs, law enforcement \nprograms, funding for global AIDS, for energy independence, and for \nagencies that provide key services to the elderly, such as the Social \nSecurity Administration and the 1-800-MEDICARE call centers.\n  In December, I sat down with my friend, Senator Reid, and the new \nHouse Appropriations chairman, Dave Obey, to plot a course for dealing \nwith this problem. We charted a course for developing a bipartisan and \nbicameral funding resolution that the House and Senate could pass \nquickly. During January, there were intense negotiations, which \nincluded the majority and the minority in the House and Senate. I \nconsulted with Senator Thad Cochran several times during that process, \nand his ranking members and their staffs were included throughout the \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\nThe resolution that passed the House last week and is now before the \nSenate is the product of those efforts.\n  The resolution, which totals $463.5 billion and provides funding for \nthe nine appropriations bills that were not completed during the 109th \nCongress, meets several goals. Namely, first, funding stays within the \n$872.8 billion statutory cap on spending, the cap which was set during \nthe 109th Congress and which equals the President's request. Second, \nthe legislation does not include earmarks--hear me--the legislation \ndoes not include earmarks. The Appropriations Committee took the lead \nin confronting the earmarks issue. We eliminated over 9,300 earmarks. \nWe will have a temporary moratorium on earmarks until Congress passes \nthe ethics reform bill. Hopefully, that bill will establish greater \ntransparency and accountability in the earmarking process. Once the \nethics reform bill is in place with its added transparency, we will \nestablish a more open, more disciplined, and more accountable process \nfor congressional directives in the fiscal year 2008 bills.\n  Third, there is no emergency spending in this resolution.\n  Fourth, for most agencies, funding is set at the fiscal year 2006 \nlevel. This formula replaces the current restrictive formula which was \nbased on the lower of the fiscal year 2006 or the unsustainable House-\npassed level.\n  Finally, the essential national priorities receive a boost in the \nlegislation. To help pay for these essential national priorities, we \ncut over $11 billion from 125 different accounts and we froze spending \nat the 2006 level for 450 accounts.\n  While we decided to include a continuing resolution formula for \nfunding most agencies, it was essential that we, on a bipartisan basis, \nmake choices to deal with the many problems that would result from \nsimply extending the current continuing resolution.\n  As noted in the White House Statement of Administration Policy, many \nof these increases also reflect administration priorities. For example, \nfor veterans medical care, we included $32.3 billion, an increase of \n$3.6 billion over the fiscal year 2006 level, so that the VA can \ncontinue to meet the growing demand for health care for our veterans. \nFor defense health initiatives, we included $21.2 billion, an increase \nof $1.2 billion over fiscal year 2006, to provide care for military \nmembers and their families, including treating servicemembers wounded \nin action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Consistent with the fiscal year 2007 \nDefense Authorization Act, the President's proposal to charge members \nof the military $735 million for their health care is rejected.\n  For the Labor, HHS, and Education bill, funding is increased by $2.3 \nbillion, $7 billion above the President's request. Title I grants for \nour schools are funded at $12.8 billion, an increase of $125 million \nover fiscal year 2006, which will provide approximately 38,000 \nadditional low-income children with intensive reading and math \ninstruction. In addition, the legislation funds the title I school \nimprovement fund at $125 million to target assistance to the 6,700 \nschools that failed to meet the No Child Left Behind requirements in \nthe 2005-2006 school year.\n  For the first time in 4 years, Pell grants will expand thanks to the \n$13.6 billion included in this legislation, an increase of $615.4 \nmillion over fiscal year 2006 that will increase the maximum Pell grant \nby $260 to $4,310.\n  The National Institutes of Health are funded at $28.9 billion, an \nincrease of $620 million over fiscal year 2006, for research to cure \ndebilitating and often deadly diseases. Community health centers would \nreceive $1.9 billion, an increase of $207 million, to finance more than \n300 new or expanded health centers.\n  Three hundred million is included for the Federal Mine Safety and \nHealth Administration, MSHA, an increase of $23 million over fiscal \nyear 2006 and $13 million more than the request, to allow the agency to \ncontinue its national efforts to hire and train new mine safety \ninspectors for safety in the Nation's 2,000 coal mines.\n  The legislation increases funding for Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement by $1.6 billion. According to the FBI, last year violent \ncrime rose in America for the first time in 15 years. In response, this \nlegislation directs $6 billion to the FBI, an increase of $200 million \nover fiscal year 2006, to ensure that the FBI not only retains all of \nits special agents but also completes the effort to double the number \nof intelligence analysts hired since September 11, 2001. Other law \nenforcement programs receiving support include State and local law \nenforcement grants, the Judiciary, Treasury antiterrorism efforts, and \nother crime prevention programs.\n  Under the continuing resolution now in law, highway funding is frozen \nat the 2006 level. Under this joint funding resolution, the Federal aid \nhighway program is fully funded at the level guaranteed in the 2005 \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act by \nproviding an obligation limitation of $39.1 billion for fiscal year \n2007, $3.5 billion over the fiscal year 2006 enacted level.\n  The joint resolution includes $4.8 billion for Global AIDS and \nMalaria programs, an increase of $1.4 billion over fiscal year 2006.\n  The Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and Inspection \nService receive increases of $220 million over fiscal year 2006 in \norder to improve food and drug safety and to combat the threat of \npandemic flu.\n  We also include funds for technology and innovation. The Department \nof Energy, Office of Science receives an increase of $200 million over \nfiscal year 2006; the National Science Foundation receives an increase \nof $335 million, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nreceives an increase of $50 million.\n  In an effort to promote energy independence, Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy programs will receive an increase of $300 million over \nfiscal year 2006.\n  Finally, we also include $785 million to provide agencies with 50 \npercent of the cost of the January 2007 pay raise in order to avoid \nRIFS and furloughs. The resolution will avoid the service delays for \nSocial Security and the 1-800-Medicare call centers that would result \nfrom extending the current continuing resolution.\n  This is not a perfect resolution--we don't claim that--but it is a \nthoughtful resolution. By complying with the statutory cap on spending, \nit is a fiscally disciplined resolution. By eliminating earmarks, it \nprovides Congress with time to pass ethics reform legislation to \nincrease transparency and accountability. By targeting resources toward \nnational priorities, such as veterans and military medical care, we \nsolve the most distressing of the problems created by the existing \ncontinuing resolution.\n  On February 2, 2007--that was Groundhog Day, wasn't it--I received a \nletter from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS, urging quick \npassage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, adoption of this joint resolution will \nensure that we answer some of our Nation's most pressing needs and \navoid a totally unnecessary Government shutdown. The last time each of \nthe appropriations bills was signed into law by October 1, the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, was 1994. I was the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee that year. I am committed to working with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Thad Cochran, to bring 12 individual, \nbipartisan, and fiscally disciplined fiscal year 2008 appropriations \nbills to the floor this year.\n  I urge swift adoption of the resolution. I thank all Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         The Independent Budget\n\n\n                   a budget for veterans by veterans\n\n                                                 February 2, 2007.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: On behalf of the co-authors of The \n     Independent Budget--AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars--\n     we urge you to quickly pass H.J. Res. 20, a bill making \n     continuing appropriations for FY 2007 for the federal \n     government, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. \n     Currently, the VA is operating at FY 2006 funding levels.\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\n       The stop-gap budget bill, or continuing resolution, funding \n     much of the federal government for the current fiscal year, \n     includes a $3.6 billion increase for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs while spending for many other agencies was \n     held at the 2006 level. Approving funding for the VA at \n     levels included in H.J. Res. 20 would show that the Senate \n     believes veterans are a national priority.\n       Any attempt to retreat from the levels established in this \n     legislation will have a drastic impact on veterans' health \n     care and benefits services provided to the men and women who \n     have served and sacrificed so much for this country. Without \n     this critically needed funding, the VA will be forced to \n     place further freezes on hiring of critical staff. It will \n     also lead to additional canceled appointments and longer \n     waiting times. The VA will also be unable to address the \n     rapidly growing claims backlog.\n       We hope that the Senate will show its support for the men \n     and women who have in the past and continue to place \n     themselves in harm's way. With these troops still in the \n     field, now is not the time to allow politics to get in the \n     way of doing what is right.\n           Sincerely,\n     David G. Greineder,\n       National Legislative Director, AMVETS.\n     Carl Blake,\n       Acting National Legislative Director, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America.\n     Joseph A. Violante,\n       National Legislative Director, Disabled American Veterans.\n     Dennis Cullinan,\n       National Legislative Director, Veterans of Foreign Wars of \n     the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, first, I want to express my deepest \nappreciation for the compliments and recognition given to me for \nreaching the milestone of casting 10,000 votes in the Senate. I \nsincerely thank all of those who said such generous things about me and \nmy service in this body.\n  It is with decidedly mixed feelings that I join my distinguished \nfriend from West Virginia, the chairman of our Committee on \nAppropriations, in calling up and discussing H.J. Res. 20, the \ncontinuing resolution. This is the fourth continuing resolution we will \nhave considered in this fiscal cycle, but without question it is the \nmost critical. It is critical because it provides more than $463 \nbillion to fund, for the remainder of this fiscal year, virtually all \nof the agencies and activities of the Federal Government outside the \nDepartments of Defense and Homeland Security, as well as certain \ncritical problems within the Department of Defense itself. It is a very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Yet the way the legislation is constructed concerns me greatly. It is \nan odd hybrid between a continuing resolution and an Omnibus \nappropriations bill. Continuing resolutions are not a desirable means \nof funding the operations of Government over the long term or in the \nroutine way of providing funding. They are useful in buying time until \nCongress can complete its work on individual appropriations bills, but \nthey are blunt, formula-driven instruments.\n  Omnibus appropriations bills, though certainly not without precedent, \nare far from an ideal means of funding our Government. Omnibus bills \ncombine funding for too many programs into a single bill, and they are \nnot conducive to careful deliberation. Combining these two structures--\na continuing resolution and an omnibus bill--is not the way the \nAmerican people deserve Members of Congress to fulfill our \nconstitutional obligations.\n  We have a responsibility to fully debate and pass the individual \nspending bills, funding each department of Government as we have \nstructured them, with close supervision of subcommittees who have \nbecome aware of individual needs and opportunities in each of these \nbills for the hearings process, and that is not the way this continuing \nresolution has been constructed. The Appropriations Committee has had \nhearings, we have had markups, we have listened to outside witnesses, \nand we have taken into consideration recommendations from the President \nand department officials about what should and should not be funded, \nand at what levels the funding should be. This is an open process--and \nthis has been an open process--where anybody can observe and review any \nprovision that is part of any bill. It is truly a public process.\n  The process has helped us make good decisions historically about \nprograms that deserve funding--careful decisions, identifying programs \nthat are of lower priorities within the constraints of the budget \nresolution, decisions about which programs should be terminated and \nhave served their usefulness.\n  The Congress should consider these individual appropriations bills on \ntheir individual merits in both the House and the Senate and on the \nfloor of each body. Then conferences occur and we iron out differences \nbetween the House and Senate-passed bills in the regular order. That \ngives all Members--not just those on the committee--the opportunity to \noffer amendments, to reduce or increase spending funded in the bills. \nMembers have the opportunity to offer amendments to remove, or add, or \nrevise language that shapes agency policies. We should not shy away \nfrom these debates and these amendments.\n  I am concerned that the continuing resolution before us is deficient \nbecause we did not follow that process. The continuing resolution \nrequired a great number of difficult decisions, including the \nelimination of some important projects and programs. Programs that \nprovide flood control and natural resources conservation, grants to \nschools and health clinics and fire departments have been eliminated. \nThe funding levels for various Federal scientific research institutions \nand programs are below levels proposed by the President. The funding \nlevels for programs, such as defense base closure and realignment, \nwhich has been pointed out, may compel us to consider future \nsupplemental funding requests. In some cases, reductions proposed by \nthe President, or by the House or Senate, have not been adopted.\n  I understand the circumstances that led us to this point. The House \nof Representatives last year passed all but one of the appropriations \nbills before the end of June. In the Senate, the Committee on \nAppropriations completed action and reported all of the appropriations \nbills before the end of July. Those bills were available to be called \nup and considered by the Senate in the regular order at that time. It \nwould have been the earliest that had occurred in a very long time. But \nafter that, the process broke down. Most of the bills were not called \nup for consideration in the Senate. We did pass the bill for the \nDepartments of Defense and Homeland Security, and Military Construction \nand the Veterans Affairs appropriations bill was approved in November. \nBut for reasons that have not been explained to this date, that bill \ndid not proceed to conference with the House. Congress eventually \nadjourned and the new leadership in the 110th Congress was created with \na range of unattractive options.\n  My preference would still have been to consider individual \nappropriations bills and send them to conference, but that was not my \ndecision to make. I hope to work with the majority to make sure we \ndon't face this situation again.\n  The chairman, Mr. Byrd, my dear friend, is correct when he says there \nwere extensive bipartisan consultations in the drafting of this \nlegislation. That was important. I appreciate his efforts to seek our \ninput, all members of the committee; but no Senator--certainly not this \nSenator--can speak for the entire Senate. There is little doubt in my \nmind that if individual appropriations bills had been considered by the \nSenate and sent to conference in either this Congress or the last, many \nof the individual decisions would be different from those provided in \nthis continuing resolution.\n  Having said that, this resolution does conform to the discretionary \nallocation of $873 billion approved by the previous Congress. It funds \nmany important programs and department activities at the fiscal year \n2006 levels, and it increases other priority programs beyond fiscal \nyear 2006 funding levels. Judged by any reasonable standard, it is \ndevoid of earmarks, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out.\n  I wish the Congress had completed floor action on the individual \nbills, but we did not. This continuing resolution appears to me to be \nthe best option to meet our obligation to fund Government programs and \nservices. It is a 137-page piece of legislation that Senators should be \nable to amend. This is not the same as a conference report. It is the \nfirst time these bills have come before the Senate. So I urge the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\nto restore regular order to the fiscal year 2008 budget process so we \ncan avoid this type of situation in the future. I know that is the goal \nof my friend from West Virginia, and I pledge to him my best effort to \nhelp accomplish this goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his views. I am \nabsolutely committed to bringing 12 individual bipartisan and fiscally \nresponsible fiscal year 2008 bills to the floor this year. However, for \nthe nine remaining 2007 bills that we must have, we are now 131 days \ninto the fiscal year. Over one-third of the fiscal year is gone, it is \nover, it is past.\n  I very much appreciate the Senator and his colleagues for joining me \nin the bipartisan development of this bill, and I believe we must move \nforward.\n  Again, I thank the Senator very much for his cooperation.\n  I was about to suggest the absence of a quorum, but I yield the \nfloor. I see the distinguished Senator seeking recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1750-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have heard the remarks of the \ndistinguished majority leader, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and the distinguished ranking member. All I \nhave now is hope because the distinguished majority leader has said he \nwill still work to get the BRAC amendment, which I am going to offer, \nor attempt to offer, this afternoon. I know there will be an objection. \nBut I want it to be on the record what we are trying to do, with the \nhope, as the leader said, that perhaps we can adopt this amendment and \nstill make the deadline.\n  The deadline is actually over a week away, and I think if all of us \nwant to fully fund our Base Closure Commission projects, we can do \nthat.\n  I also will say I am very hopeful from the chairman's remarks that we \nwill have bipartisan bills. As has been noted on this floor already \ntoday, I have been chairman and ranking member of the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Subcommittee for \nsome 6 years. I have never noticed a difference when I was chairman and \nwhen I was ranking member because Senator Feinstein and I were working \ntogether, trying to accommodate the needs of every State in our \ncountry. We worked so well together that when she was chairman, it \nwasn't any different from when I was chairman.\n  I want that to be the case for our appropriations bills again. But I \nhave to say, in all honesty, I don't feel I have had any input into \nthis particular bill. I don't see the bipartisanship. I don't see the \ncooperation. We could have done what the Senate normally does, and that \nis allow some number of amendments--not a filibuster amendment tree, \nnot an unreasonable number. But I think some of the issues that have \nbeen brought forward today and in recent days, since the H.J. Res. 20 \nwas made known, are legitimate. I believe we would agree on a \nbipartisan basis, if we had the ability to offer amendments and debate \nthem, that we should be funding the Base Closure Commission \nrecommendations that were ours, with a deadline that is ours so that we \ncan meet our own standard.\n  I believe we could work that out. We have already passed the exact \nsame $3.1 billion--actually $5 billion--appropriation in this body, so \nI know we can do it. We have a week. I suggest it would be a wonderful \ngesture on the part of the majority to allow that to happen.\n  In addition, what Senator Coburn talked about earlier today, the HIV/\nAIDS testing of babies, I know there is not one Member on that side who \nwouldn't make it a priority to give babies a test that would allow them \nto be inoculated immediately and give those children a chance to have a \nlife. But the funding for the Ryan White Act was cut back, so that is \nnot going to be allowed to go forward.\n  I don't think that is the intention. I ask, if that is not the \nintention, can we not sit down as responsible Members of the Senate and \nwork out these few items, work with the House and do a preconference? \nNobody wants to delay this legislation, but we would like to have a \nsay.\n  Where I have talked bipartisanship, that is what we do in the Senate. \nThat is the way we act, in a bipartisan way, which, in the past, the \nAppropriations Committee has certainly done.\n  I am disappointed in this resolution. I am disappointed especially in \nthe process that does not allow for an amendment.\n  Mr. President, is it in order to call up amendment No. 242, the \nHutchison-Inhofe amendment to H.J. Res. 20?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is not in order then, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, it would not be in \norder to call up the amendment at this point.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Hutchison-Inhofe amendment is \ncosponsored by 27 Members of our Senate. The cosponsors, besides myself \nand Senator Inhofe, are Senators Allard, Baucus, Bennett, Brownback, \nBunning, Burr, Chambliss, Coburn, Cornyn, Crapo, DeMint, Dole, Enzi, \nGraham, Kyl, Lott, Martinez, McCain, Roberts, Sessions, Stevens, \nThomas, Vitter, Voinovich, and Warner. That is a good number. That is \nalmost a third of the Senate, and there are many who said they would \nlike to cosponsor the amendment, but they were concerned about stopping \nthe bill or going against the leadership on the Democratic side.\n  It is clear we can work this out, that people want to have this \namendment. The amendment is very simple. It restores $3.136 billion \nthat was taken out of the Department of Defense base closure account, \nand it is paid for so that we keep the fiscal responsibility with a \nrescission of .73 percent--that is three-quarters of 1 percent--across \nthe board of all of the accounts, except for defense, homeland \nsecurity, and veterans.\n  With a .73-cut, which I think any agency or program could take \nwithout any disruption whatsoever, I believe we could fully fund our \nmilitary and the important operations they are doing, and that is what \nI think is essential.\n\n  I have a much longer set of remarks, but at this point, I will yield \nfor a question from the Senator from Alabama, who I know is on a \ntimetable.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hutchison so much for \nher leadership on this important matter. While she is here, I wish to \nask the Senator a few questions about the situation in which we find \nourselves.\n  I believe it was the year before last that we voted, after much \nanguish and concern and fear by local communities, to go forward with \nthe BRAC, which is the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Nobody \nwas sure how that would come out and whether some of our bases would be \nclosed. When the dust settled and the long process concluded, a number \nof bases were closed. At the same time, we are also closing facilities \naround the world and bringing back more of our troops that are deployed \naround the world. Isn't it true that the continuing resolution that is \nproposed would take 55 percent, or $3.1 billion, out of a little over \n$5 billion that was set aside to carry this forward? Isn't that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nis right. Actually, he may be a little under because the original need \nwas $5.6 billion, and we are cutting it by $3.1 billion. We are cutting \nit by $3.1 billion. I think that it is a huge cut. It is going to \naffect the whole synchronization.\n  We gave the Defense Department 6 years in which to accomplish what \nthe Base Closure Commission recommended, passed and then was adopted by \nCongress and signed by the President. We have given them a deadline, \nand yet as the Senator points out, of the $5.6 billion that was in the \nbudget that has been approved by the Senate before, we only have $2.5 \nbillion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. In other words, the only way to have a savings under \nthe BRAC is to consolidate facilities and avoid waste. To go halfway \nwith this\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\nproject seems to me, clearly, will cause all kinds of backlogs and make \nit very difficult for our military people to plan. It could actually \ndrive up costs significantly, could it not?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, and I point out the cost savings projection is \n$20 billion over the period we would be closing and then gearing up the \nbases that are being consolidated.\n  In addition to that, it has been said the majority intends to bring \nthis $3.1 billion back in the supplemental, but the supplemental is \noutside the budget process; therefore, it is going to be $3.1 billion \nadded to the deficit, which will have to be subtracted from the $20 \nbillion savings we were envisioning from the BRAC.\n  I have to say to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, I didn't \nlike some of the recommendations of BRAC, but we passed it, the \nPresident signed it, and Congress has mandated the Department of \nDefense to go through with it. We certainly cannot do it halfway if we \nare going to be responsible stewards of the security of our country, as \nwell as its tax dollars.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. I don't think there is anyone here who is more \ncommitted to frugality and trying to manage our dollars well in this \nSenate. I certainly believe in that strongly. We knew upfront we were \ngoing to have to have some initial moneys to make these moves and \nconsolidations to save money for years and years to come.\n  This has the potential to eliminate the whole process, to eviscerate \nthe process and actually run our costs up over the long run; wouldn't \nthe Senator agree?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am very concerned about it. I think we are going to \ncut back on the savings. We are thwarting the mandate we set down by \nnot going forward.\n  We should have governed last October 1. We should have gone forward \nin November and December, but for a variety of reasons, including some \non our own side, we didn't do that. Now we have an opportunity to do \nit, and do it right. I am just hoping, and I haven't given up hope, \nthat we will do this the right way; that we will pay for it so that we \nachieve the objective of staying within that budget because we can do \nthat. It has been planned for, it has been in the budget, and we \nshouldn't have to add it to a supplemental and increase the deficit for \nthese particular projects.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the excellent Senator from Texas \nfor her work, and I believe she is doing it the right way. She is doing \nit by staying within our budget.\n  This funding of BRAC was put in at $5.5 or $6 billion. It was within \nthe budget. What has happened is that money was spent on other \nprograms, and now it looks as though if we are to fund it, we are going \nto have to add it to the supplemental, which is extra spending and \nextra debt, more than we should have.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison for her leadership.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentlewoman yields to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I still control the floor. I am \nyielding for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielding for a question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I also rise to express my complete dismay \nat the events that have unfolded on the floor of the Senate this week \nconcerning not only debate on Iraq but the BRAC itself. I hope the \nAmerican people are watching this debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the very distinguished Senator just \nallow me 1 minute to make a response to the discussions that have been \ngoing on here? Just for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from West Virginia for a response for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator.\n  I want to assure all Senators that this resolution does not reduce \nfunding for AIDS. In fact, it has significant increases with regard to \nfunding for base closures. This resolution has a $1 billion increase \nabove the levels available under the current continuing resolution. The \nremaining $3.1 billion that the Senator from Texas is seeking can be \naddressed--and I assure her can be addressed--in the war supplemental \nthat the Senate will consider next month. There is no need to cut \nfunding for the FBI, the NIH, for NASA, or for our Nation's highways.\n  I thank the Senator, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kentucky \nfor a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1751-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1751-S1753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOING THE SENATE'S BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. First of all, I hope the American people are watching \nthe debate and paying close attention to it. This debate is not just an \nimportant lesson in civics and civility, it is a debate that goes back \nto the days of our Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers created the \nSenate to be a body of unlimited debate. This institution was created \nto be a deliberative body. It was not created for speed or for quick \naction.\n  I would like to remind my friend, the majority leader, whom I wish \nwere on the floor, that the Senate is not the House of Representatives. \nThe majority leader and I both served in the House of Representatives. \nUnlike the House, however, we do not have a rules committee in the \nSenate that sets the rules for floor debate. Any Senator can come to \nthe floor seeking recognition to speak and offer amendments. In the \nHouse, the majority can roll the minority through the Rules Committee. \nThis cannot be done in the Senate. The minority party cannot be \nignored. Yet our friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to \ndictate the terms not only of the debate on Iraq and the resolutions \nconcerning them, they are telling 49 Republicans in the Senate how \nbusiness will be conducted in the Senate.\n  I want to be very clear that I would vote in opposition to the Warner \nresolution. Nonbinding resolutions that question military decisions \nmade by our Commander in Chief and top military generals are not in the \nbest interests of our Nation. But I do support the right of Senator \nWarner to get an up-or-down vote on his resolution, even though I would \noppose it.\n  Earlier this week, we had a vote to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed with the Warner resolution. Forty-seven Republicans voted \nagainst the motion because we believe we should have more debate, not \nless, and the ability to offer other resolutions. Yet many of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle accuse my Republican colleagues \nof not wanting to debate this issue and not wanting to vote on the \nWarner resolution. And, not surprisingly, the media is regurgitating \nthe talking points from the other side of the aisle. But nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  Senator Warner, the author of the resolution favored overwhelmingly \nby the Democrats, voted against invoking cloture on his own resolution \nbecause he believes in Republicans keeping their rights as Senators. We \nwant a fair debate, not a one-sided conversation. We are asking for \nmore debate, not less, like many on the other side of the aisle \nsuggest.\n  Our request is a simple one. If we are going to vote on the Warner \nresolution, those of us who oppose this resolution should at least be \nallowed to offer our own resolution, and the senior Senator from New \nHampshire offered his resolution concerning funding for the war in \nIraq. Some have said his resolution is incorporated in the Warner \nresolution, but they are missing two key points. The Gregg resolution \nexpresses our full support of our troops and not support that is just \ncloaked behind other language that criticizes their mission.\n  My friend, my good friend, General Petraeus, whom the Senate \nunanimously confirmed, said in his confirmation hearing that a \nresolution condemning the President's new Iraq strategy would have a \ndetrimental effect on troop morale. It must be our top priority to \nassure American troops that we will not cut off their funding \nmidmission. We already are cutting some of their funds, as seen in this \nyear's continuing resolution.\n\n  I find it ironic that some of the same Senators who have been on the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\nfloor assuring their full support for the troops are the same \nindividuals who are cutting their funding behind closed doors. I am \ntalking about the funding for the Base Realignment and Construction \nProgram. This is a program that, by law, we have to complete in 6 \nyears. Yet my friends across the aisle have decided not to fund this \nprogram because it is not a priority.\n  Well, it is a priority for me. By doing this, they will cause a delay \nfor up to 1 year for military base construction. Because of this, and I \nask my good friend, the Senator from Texas, what happens to the 12,000 \ntroops that will not be able to be redeployed back home from Iraq or \nfrom Germany or from around the world?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky \nasking the question, and I will read a letter signed by all four of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, dated last November, where they are asking that \nwe pass a short-term CR rather than a complete year's CR because they \nare so concerned about that very issue. They say in their letter:\n\n       As required by law, we are executing thousands of \n     interrelated moves to implement all the base realignment and \n     closure projects by September 2011 and to reposition our \n     forces under the Global Defense Posture review. Disruptions \n     in resources will cause delays and desynchronize these moves. \n     This, in turn, can disrupt our force generation and \n     deployment schedules, which ultimately degrades readiness \n     while increasing the burden on servicemembers and their \n     families.\n\n  So we know now from their own reports, I would say to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, that 12,000 of those who are scheduled to be coming home \njust this year are going to be delayed, which is going to cause a \ndomino effect all the way down the line. It is incomprehensible that we \nhave this opportunity, but we are not able to go forward.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for asking the question.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, to say that I find this disappointing is \nquite an understatement.\n  I ask the majority leader to allow us to have a full and fair debate \non the CR and allow us to offer amendments. We should be able to debate \nand vote on the Gregg resolution. This is a resolution that does not \nplay into our enemies' hands. General Petraeus commented that a \ncommander needs to show the enemy that there is no hope of victory. The \nGregg resolution does this. It expresses our absolute support for our \nCommander in Chief and our men and women in Iraq, instead of showing \nthat the will of the American people has been stripped by opportunistic \nterrorists.\n  Mr. President, for Republicans, this is not about a Senate procedural \nprocess but about the priorities of the American people. Our Republican \nleader, my colleague from Kentucky, has tried all week to negotiate to \nget a vote on the Gregg resolution, in conjunction with the other \nresolution, the Warner resolution. I appreciate Senator McConnell's \nefforts, but the majority leader, and many on both sides of the aisle, \ndo not want the vote on the Gregg resolution. Instead, they claim that \nRepublicans do not want to debate the war in Iraq. This is completely \nfalse. The American people need to know that, and the media needs to \nreport the truth.\n  No one Republican, not one to whom I have spoken, is running from \nthis debate. We want to debate the war in Iraq. Many of us oppose the \nWarner resolution. It is nonbinding. It sends the wrong message to our \nenemies and our allies. It will not end the war in Iraq, and it will \nnot bring peace to the Middle East. But we should vote on it, and we \nshould vote on the Gregg resolution because even though the Gregg \nresolution is nonbinding, it actually relates to the proper role of the \nCongress with respect to war.\n  Essentially, the Gregg resolution says that Congress will not vote to \ndefund the war when we have troops in harm's way. This is the proper \nrole of Congress. It does not deter from the Commander in Chief. We \ndon't dictate military strategy, but we do have the power of the purse. \nWe can either fund the war or not fund the war. I am not a lawyer, \nthank God, but I have spent over two decades in Congress, in both the \nHouse and the Senate. And I know the proper role of the legislative \nbranch. I know the rules of the House, and I know the rules of the \nSenate. I also know the importance of not sending the wrong message to \nour troops in the field.\n  Mr. President, I have voted to send my own son into war. That was the \ngulf war. I know the stakes are very high. I know this is an issue that \nis on every American's mind. But I resent my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle saying that Republicans are running from this debate. \nWe are not. I hope today that we can remind my colleagues that this is \nthe U.S. Senate, and the minority has its say. We should vote both on \nthe Warner resolution and the Gregg resolution and we should also vote \nto have amendments to the CR and be able to address the BRAC problem \nthat we face and what will happen if they reduce this by $3.2 billion.\n  I have an editorial of the New York Times I will submit for the \nRecord at this time. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord, and I yield to my good friend from Texas.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 7, 2007]\n\n                         It's the War, Senators\n\n       It is not an inspiring sight to watch the United States \n     Senate turn the most important issue facing America into a \n     political football, and then fumble it. Yet that is what now \n     seems to have come from a once-promising bipartisan effort to \n     finally have the debate about the Iraq war that Americans \n     have been denied for four years.\n       The Democrats' ultimate goal was to express the Senate's \n     opposition to President Bush's latest escalation. But the \n     Democrats' leaders have made that more difficult--allowing \n     the Republicans to maneuver them into the embarrassing \n     position of blocking a vote on a counterproposal that they \n     feared too many Democrats might vote for.\n       We oppose that resolution, which is essentially a promise \n     never to cut off funds for this or any future military \n     operation Mr. Bush might undertake in Iraq. But the right way \n     for the Senate to debate Iraq is to debate Iraq, not to bar \n     proposals from the floor because they might be passed. The \n     majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, needs to call a \n     timeout and regroup. By changing the issue from Iraq to \n     partisan parliamentary tactics, his leadership team threatens \n     to muddy the message of any anti-escalation resolution the \n     Senate may eventually pass.\n       As it happens, the blocked Republican alternative, propose \n     by Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, itself represents an end run \n     around the Senate's constitutional responsibilities. The \n     rational way to oppose cuts in funds is to vote against them, \n     if and when any ever come before the Senate. Mr. Reid should \n     not be shy about urging fellow Democrats to vote against this \n     hollow gimmick, which tries to make it look as if the \n     senators support Mr. Bush's failed Iraq policies by playing \n     on their fears of being accused of not supporting the troops.\n       America went to war without nearly enough public \n     discussion, and it needs more Senate debate about Iraq this \n     time around, not less. The voters who overturned Republican \n     majorities in both houses last November expect, among other \n     things, to see energized Congressional scrutiny of the entire \n     war--not just of the plan for an additional 21,500 troops but \n     also of the future of the 130,000 plus who are already there.\n       Another Republican resolution, proposed by Sen. John \n     McCain, gives the appearance of moving in that more promising \n     direction by ticking off a series of policy benchmarks and \n     then urging the Iraqi government to meet them. But listing \n     benchmarks is one thing. It is another to spell out real \n     consequences for not meeting them, like the withdrawal of \n     American military support. Instead of doing that, the McCain \n     resolution hands an unwarranted blank check to Mr. Bush's new \n     Iraq commander, Lt. Gen. David Petraeus. It breathtakingly \n     declares that he ``should receive from Congress the full \n     support necessary'' to carry out America's mission.\n       Frustrated by the Senate's fumbles, the House plans to move \n     ahead next week with its own resolution on Mr. Bush's troop \n     plan. When the Senate is ready to turn its attention back to \n     substance again, it should go further.\n       Senators need to acknowledge the reality of four years of \n     failed presidential leadership on Iraq and enact a set of \n     binding benchmarks. These should require the hard steps \n     toward national reconciliation that the Iraqi prime minister, \n     Nuri Kamal al-Maliki continues to evade and that the White \n     House refuses to insist on.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will yield up to 15 minutes to \nSenator Roberts, after which I will yield up to 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss.\n  I am going to send my remarks to the desk and ask unanimous consent \nthey be printed in the Record after Senator Chambliss has spoken. I \nwill need to follow him in that order. I ask unanimous consent my \nremarks be printed in the Record after Senator Chambliss.\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the sequence of \nspeakers?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object. I ask to amend the \nrequest of the Senator to limit each Senator to 15 minutes apiece, \nunder her order. But I also request Senator Kennedy be inserted after \nyour first two speakers, so the order I believe--your first two \nspeakers were?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Senator Roberts and Senator Chambliss.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent Senator Kennedy be allowed 15 \nminutes after Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe has been here for \nseveral hours as well. He has been waiting patiently, as has Senator \nShelby. I ask if it would be possible to allow the people who are on \nthe floor to be put in an order. If Senator Kennedy would be able to \nthen come after Senator Roberts, Senator Chambliss, Senator Shelby, and \nSenator Inhofe?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, what \nwe do on the floor is allow Senators to go back and forth. Senator \nKennedy has also been waiting. He is not on the floor, but he has been \nwaiting his turn.\n  I again ask if the Senator will allow us to go ahead and let your two \nRepublican Senators speak, then allow Senator Kennedy to speak, and \nthen go back to your side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, at this point I think I will keep the \nfloor and yield to Senator Roberts for 15 minutes and let me talk to \nSenator Murray. I wish to try to accommodate Senator Murray, but I will \nnot do that at this time.\n  I yield up to 15 minutes to Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Parliamentary inquiry: I assume the Senator from Texas \ncan only yield for a question at this time; is that not correct?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas withhold for a \nsecond. It takes unanimous consent to yield for more than a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Washington \nasked for me to yield to her for a question, and I will yield to her \nfor a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at this time I will object. I will \nsuggest the absence of a quorum--\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from \nKansas for a question at this time. For a question only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I do have a question, and it involves \nwhat I believe to be an utter failing by Congress on behalf of our \nNation's military men and women. My question to my colleague from Texas \nis this. I know in Kansas we are at risk of losing $365 million in \nregard to BRAC construction. My question would be to the Senator \nwhether the same thing is true in Texas.\n  I think, probably to put it in perspective, I need to get a little \nbackground information so the Senator could reply. That brings \nattention to why I am bringing a question to the distinguished Senator \nand why I wished to take the floor for 15 minutes. I hope we don't get \ninto an objection. I certainly have no problem with Senator Kennedy \nspeaking on any subject. I think he does that very well--and often.\n  Basically, let me say, with apologies to the Lizzie Borden family, \nthat:\n\n       The Democrat House took a continuing resolution axe,\n       and gave the military 40 whacks,\n       and when they saw what they had done,\n       then they gave Kansas 41.\n\n  I don't think that is right. I am not here to speak about our \nmilitary presence in Iraq. We have moved away from the debate on our \npresence in Iraq. We must now address the issue of support for our \ntroops at home, and that is why I am going to ask the Senator a \nquestion, as soon as I give the background in regard to the question I \nhave.\n\n  As we have heard some of my colleagues already state today, we are in \ndanger of underfunding military construction associated with BRAC by \nover $3 billion--actually it is $3.1 billion. Should the Senate let \nthis occur, we will have failed our Nation's soldiers and their \nfamilies.\n  Why did this occur? Because there was $6 billion within the military \nbudget, within the Department of Defense, who wanted $6 billion for \nBRAC construction. Is that not correct, I ask my distinguished friend?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The distinguished Senator from Kansas is exactly \nright. You know, it was pointed out earlier that we had $1.5 billion in \nfiscal year 2006, with the implication that we were increasing from \nthat amount in this budget because it has $2.5 billion. The problem is, \nin 2006, the money was planning money, now we are trying to actually \nbuild the project and we are missing $3.1 billion. Now we are in the \nbuilding stage.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Basically, if I understand the Senator, we are down to \n$2.88 billion, which means if we had a whole pie and there were six \nslices, now we are down to less than three. And somehow or other the \nDepartment of Defense has to spread that money for BRAC construction to \nthese other projects? That is going to be extremely difficult.\n  I am trying to figure out why on Earth the House acted in such a \nfashion. I think it is, if I read the press about this--and I ask the \nSenator if she would agree--it is that under the banner of ``earmark \nreform,'' there was at least a theory, by some, that all of the money \nin the $6 billion was somehow earmarks.\n  I ask another question. The $3.1 billion is the first time in my \nmemory where we have had a breach in the agreement to say we are not \ngoing to fund nondefense programs--which are very meritorious and \nshould stand on their own right, and I support many of them--out of the \nmilitary budget. I can't remember when we have done that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator is correct. I have no memory of ever \ndoing that. Of course, there are no earmarks in the BRAC funding. The \nfunding, the $3.1 billion that was set out was all Department of \nDefense. They are doing the planning for BRAC, not Congress. There are \nno earmarks.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I could ask my distinguished colleague one more \nquestion? I am going to own up. The $365 million for Kansas in BRAC \nconstruction funding, there were no earmarks to that, no earmarks. That \nwas requested by the Department of Defense and put in the President's \nbudget for projects that are essential for our men and women in uniform \nwhen they come back from Iraq.\n  There were three earmarks in there. They are gone and I understand \nthat. I had one for a childcare center, Todd Tiahrt had one for \nlighting a ramp on a runway--I don't know what you are going to do if \nyou don't have any lights on a runway when you land--and then there was \nanother vehicle maintenance center at Fort Riley to take all the \nhumvees and vehicles back from the desert and get them fixed up and \nreplenished. They are gone. The rest of it, the $365 million that is at \nrisk in Kansas, goes for projects in regard to BRAC construction.\n  I don't know if this happened because of somebody who didn't know \nwhat was going on--sheer incompetence or ignorance--or this was \npolitical, under the banner that we are going to stop all the earmarks. \nThis is not an earmark.\n  As a matter of fact, let me ask the Senator from Texas a question. Is \nnot the breach of taking $3.1 billion from military spending and \nputting it over into non-Federal spending--isn't that an earmark, a \n$3.1 billion earmark by itself?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It would appear the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me go on with a little background about this because \nI want the Senator to understand how\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nserious the situation is in Kansas. Should this $3.1 billion deficit be \nallowed to move forward and become law, soldiers in Kansas and many \nother States will suffer greatly. As I said before, $375 billion--I \nhave been saying $365 billion. I am $10 billion short--$375 million \nworth of Kansas BRAC-related projects will be put at risk, and there \nare even more projects at risk in future years if the operational tempo \nof the Army is disrupted.\n  I wish to be sure all of our colleagues understand exactly what this \nshortfall could mean--as it would be in Texas or Oklahoma or any \nState--what this would mean to our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies based in our respective States.\n  The Combat Aviation Brigade, which is coming to Fort Riley, KS, as a \nresult of the BRAC process, is in danger of losing $152 million for a \ncomplex that will house their barracks, their office space, their \nhangars, their fueling aprons, and their crash rescue fire station.\n  This unit, this aviation brigade, is going to deploy to Iraq soon, \nand they need these facilities when they return. The commanding general \nat Fort Riley, General Carter Hamm, told me yesterday that if the \naviation brigade comes home in 2008 to find these projects incomplete, \nthey will have to live in dated facilities.\n  What do I mean by dated facilities? We call them the white elephant \nbarracks. They have holes in the walls. There are even rumors they have \nsnakes underneath these barracks.\n  The general said they will have to live in dated facilities that will \nprovide worse living conditions than the brigade will find in Iraq.\n  Let me repeat that statement to the Senator from Texas. I don't know \nif she has a dire situation like this. I will ask her to respond, for \nour colleagues.\n  If this construction fails to move forward, members of the air \nbrigade will return to housing at Fort Riley that will be below \nanything they have experienced in Iraq. Is this the way the Senate \nwants to treat these soldiers? Does the Senator from Texas have a \nsimilar situation, where men and women in uniform coming back will find \ntheir housing less than what it was in Iraq? I am incredulous.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Absolutely incredible. As a matter of fact, 30,000 \ntroops are going to be moving into Fort Bliss. There have been many \naccommodations begun. But now it is going to stop in its tracks and we \nare going to have the same situation. We could be having either \nsubstandard barracks or worse, it could be tents or mobile homes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me ask the Senator another question and give a \nlittle background. Not only is the air brigade in danger of losing all \nof their support facilities--they need a new runway, specifically they \nneed a $17 million runway. That is in danger of being cut from this \n$3.1 billion earmark. That is what I call it--a cut in an earmark going \nto nondefense programs. I find it unacceptable to move these people and \nthen inadequately support them when they return home. Fort Riley is \nalso in danger of losing an $87 million division headquarters, a \nsustainment brigade headquarters, to support another group of soldiers \nwho will be returning from their current deployment in Iraq. If these \nfacilities are not done by the time they return, they will be required \nto live in trailers, modular buildings. That is not acceptable. These \nsoldiers are already sacrificing for the Nation. I refuse to ask them \nto also sacrifice when they return home from a deployment.\n  Let me mention something else to the Senator. As a result of the BRAC \nprocess, nearly 11,000 soldiers and their families have already begun \nmoving back to Fort Riley. This is unprecedented growth. I know at Fort \nBliss the situation is somewhat similar. But Fort Riley does not have \nthe support facilities to ensure these soldiers and families have full \naccess to health, dental, and childcare.\n\n  Let me ask the Senator from Texas another question, if I could have \nher attention. At Fort Riley we do not have the facilities to ensure \nthese 11,000 soldiers and their families full access to health, dental, \nand childcare. Is there a similar situation in Texas?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Absolutely. Absolutely. We are talking about all the \nfacilities that would accommodate the move of soldiers and their \nfamilies. So you have childcare facilities--the Senator from Georgia is \non the floor and he has essential not only childcare facilities and \nhousing and barracks but training facilities. The reason we are \nbringing the troops home from Germany is for better training \nfacilities, and at Fort Benning, part of this BRAC funding is for the \ntraining facilities that are the upgrades the Department of Defense is \ntrying to give to our men and women for their readiness for their \nmissions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I truly appreciate the response of the \nSenator from Texas. The reason I ask that is we are losing a $17.5 \nmillion health and dental clinic and a $5.7 million child development \ncenter, which will make an enormous difference in the quality of life \nin regards to the soldiers coming back.\n  There is another project I want to mention, and the Senator has \nbrought it up. We need a $27 million battle command training center. \nWhat is that all about? That is 4,000 people going through that center \nwhich is going to be improved, who are going immediately to Iraq to \nserve under General Petraeus to see if that mission can work, and they \nare following the doctrine General Petraeus laid down at Fort \nLeavenworth, KS, which is the intellectual center of the Army. This \ncenter is necessary for training command, control, and communications \nfunctions that are critical to the training of the brigade and division \nstaff. If you don't want to have them go to Iraq, rest assured they \nneed the training to basically have them prepared for any kind of \nnational security threat in the future.\n  Another Kansas project in jeopardy of losing funding that is of deep \nconcern to me and should be of deep concern to the Army is the joint \nregional correctional facility at Fort Leavenworth. This is a little \ndifferent. I don't know if the Senator has something like this, but I \nwould ask the Senator a question. We need to build a joint regional \ncorrectional facility to house prisoners from around the Nation who are \nmoved to Kansas. Currently, the Army is stretched to its limit. It \nneeds these new beds for prisoners, and as the general told me, there \nis no place to put them.\n  The Acting Commanding General at Fort Leavenworth, BG Mark O'Neill, \ntold me yesterday, add to the equation that the facility is underfunded \nat $68 million--they need $95 million at a bare minimum. What do we do \nwith the prisoners? That is $27 million more than was even budgeted.\n  So the House is saying they will receive zip, nada, zero. Now, that \nis a correctional facility. I know it doesn't compare to the readiness \nproblem, but with more prisoners and no place to put them, what are we \ngoing to do? That is a real problem.\n  I want to give you some good news, and I am going to ask the Senator \nif she has a similar situation in Texas. Kansas leaders share my \nconcern. Last night, our Governor Sebelius's Military Council passed a \nunanimous resolution supporting our efforts to bring this amendment \nbefore the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter of support be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Governor's Military Council,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                     Topeka, KS, February 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roberts: Today, the Governor's Military \n     Council (GMC) passed unanimously a resolution in support of \n     your amendment to H.J. Res. 20 which would fully restore \n     funding for implementation of the 2005 Base Realignment and \n     Closure (BRAC) round to the level requested by the \n     Administration.\n       Full funding of the BRAC budget request is critical to \n     military readiness, quality of life, as well as Department of \n     Defense's transformation efforts. Furthermore, failure to \n     fully fund the budget for BRAC will delay implementation of \n     base closure and realignment actions, postponing indefinitely \n     the realization of budget savings resulting from the BRAC \n     round and the completion of BRAC movements for all affected \n     military installations.\n       The GMC was originally constituted through an Executive \n     Order signed by Governor Kathleen Sebelius as the Governor's \n     Strategic Military Planning Commission (The Commission) in \n     January of 2004 to represent the State of Kansas during the \n     2005 BRAC process.\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\n       In January of 2006, the Commission stood down and the GMC \n     was created by another Executive Order to support the \n     military in the State of Kansas. The GMC's membership \n     consists of 25 individuals from the communities in which the \n     state's four major installations are located, state \n     legislators, the Adjutant General and representatives of the \n     Kansas Congressional Delegation.\n       We thank you for your leadership on the issue of critical \n     importance to our nation's military and the military \n     installations in the State of Kansas.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John E. Moore,\n                               Chair, Governor's Military Council.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This bipartisan support shows how important these funds \nare to our military. So underfunding BRAC MILCON by $3 billion, or even \n$1, sends a terrible message to our troops. It tears to shreds the \nbipartisan support involved with the BRAC process.\n  Isn't it ironic, I would say to the Senator from Texas, and to you, \nMr. President, and to my colleagues, that at a time when many of our \ncolleagues in the House and Senate are saying, bring the troops home \nnow, and everybody wishes we could, these same colleagues in the \nHouse--again, either through ignorance or incompetence or politics--\napparently do not think it is necessary to provide the facilities that \nwill support these troops and their families.\n  There is no other option, I say to the Senator from Texas and to my \ncolleagues. I urge the majority leader to support our troops and their \nfamilies by allowing a vote on this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding me this time for these \nmany questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for \npointing out some of the real problems delaying this BRAC funding are \ngoing to bring. I hope the distinguished majority leader and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee will find a way \nwe can move the BRAC military construction forward. It is essential \nthat we do this, and we can do it. We have a week in which we can work \nout any details that need to be worked out. I think it is very \nimportant that we do what is right for our country. We have time to do \nit. There is no reason not to do it, and we can do it in a fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  What has been suggested by the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is that we will handle this in a supplemental, \nthat we will put $3 billion into the supplemental. But, of course, that \nmeans we will be spending $3 billion outside of the budget and added to \nthe deficit, which is not necessary. We can fix this with a very small \ncut across the board of all of the projects in the bill, except for \nDefense, Homeland Security, Veterans. I think anyone can put together a \nprogram that has less than a 1-percent cut, and I think most people \nwould say our priorities should be the active-duty military, that we \nshould have the ability to put the housing and the childcare centers \nand the training facilities in place that would accommodate the needs \nof the military. My goodness, look what our military people are doing \nfor us and for our country.\n  The idea that we wouldn't give them what they need to do the job, and \nwhen they come home, to have a place to stay and live and do their \ntraining so they can be the very best, would be unthinkable. It would \nbe unthinkable. So I do hope we can go forward. I don't remember ever \ntaking up an Omnibus appropriations bill with no amendments in order. I \nhope it will be possible that we will be able to take it up in the \nnormal process--or maybe not even the normal process. We would settle \nfor not normal, but for some number of amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1755-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is, as \nI am sure the Senator from Texas knows, somewhat unusual, and not the \nway this is normally done. Normally we would alternate from side to \nside. I have actually discussed this with some of the Senators on her \nside. However, in the interests of at least having some idea of where \nwe are going to go so we won't have to do the procedural fix of having \nSenators stand up and propound speeches that are put in the form of a \nquestion as we have been seeing here for some time, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nunanimous consent request is granted.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my remarks will not last 10 minutes, \nand I hope the Senator from Georgia will be able to have his time in \nturn, because he has been waiting for quite a long time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1755-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1755-S1758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ACCOMMODATING THE NEEDS OF THE MILITARY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what we are asking with the amendment \nI have tried to put forward but which was ruled out of order is to \nsimply restore the $3.1 billion that was cut from the Base Closing \nCommission military construction. We cut--not we, but the bill that is \non the floor that we are not able to amend--$3.1 billion out of the \nBase Closing Commission military construction funding. Our amendment, \nthe Hutchison-Inhofe amendment, has 27 cosponsors. That is almost one-\nthird of the Senate, and there are many who said they would like to \nsponsor the amendment but in deference to their leadership did not feel \nthey could, because so many States have major projects in this BRAC \nmilitary construction funding.\n  These are not projects that any Member of Congress put in this bill \nor in the bill that passed the House and Senate. These are the \nDepartment of Defense projects, for them to be able to meet the \ncongressionally mandated deadline of 2011 for finishing the BRAC \nprocess. So they are projects that were selected in order of priority \nby the Department of Defense. There is not one earmark, not one \ncongressional add in the military construction budget that we are \ntrying to restore. We are trying to restore the budget we have already \npassed so the Department of Defense can meet the deadline we have set.\n  I think this amendment should be in order. It is my great hope that \nthe distinguished leader and the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee will allow it to go forward with no further \ndelay, because there is going to be a delay if we wait until the \nsupplemental. Not only will the $3 billion be outside of the scope of \nthe budget and add $3 billion more to the deficit, but it will, in \nfact, delay the building projects for yet another 2 months, which will \nbe a whole half year that the Department of Defense will be strapped \nfor the funds to do what it needs to do to have its synchronized \nmovement of troops be able to accomplish what they are trying to \naccomplish.\n  I hope we will have a reconsideration. I hope the House will work \nwith us. We have a whole week to do it. We have done things in 24 hours \nthat were harder than this, and I believe that delaying the return of \n12,000 troops to facilities they deserve to have is not a good bargain. \nSo I am very hopeful we will eventually have true bipartisanship in the \nSenate, true bipartisanship in the Appropriations Committee, which has \nbeen the tradition in the Senate for all these years. I ask that the \nmajority in leadership help work with us to accommodate the needs of \nthe military.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me inquire as to how much time is left \nopen from the 10 minutes of the Senator of Texas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those 5 \nminutes be divided between myself and Senator Chambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. And that at the conclusion of the unanimous consent \nrequest wherein the last speaker, it is my understanding, is the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, that the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Specter, be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been watching this debate as it has \ntaken place. I am disappointed that procedurally we dropped the ball. \nWe were hoping to be able to speak all afternoon on probably the most \nimmediate crisis we are facing in terms of the budget; that is, the \nBRAC process.\n  Let me share a couple of ideas as to what this is all about. A lot of \npeople are not all that familiar with the process we are talking about. \nThe BRAC process is the Base Closure Realignment Commission. It was \nbrought to our attention and first voted on by a Congressman from \nTexas, Dick Armey. Prior to that time, it appeared that all of our \nmilitary establishments that were in the United States had been looked \nat as economic bases. Consequently, it is very difficult to close down \nsome that are either not efficient or not needed for defending the \ncountry.\n  It was the idea of Congressman Armey to put together a system to take \npolitics out of the base-closure system and to allow some criteria to \nbe put forth and have a base-closure commission make recommendations \nand then take those recommendations and put them into effect. The \nbottom line would be they may find, in my State of Oklahoma, that one \nof our installations should be closed or should be realigned and part \nof it moved somewhere else. If that is the case, we would have to vote \non the overall picture. You could not pick or choose. That way, as \nnearly as you can take politics out of a procedure on this Senate \nfloor, I believe they successfully did that.\n  We had the first BRAC round back in 1988. We have had four since \nthen. The last one is the one we are talking about now.\n  I have to say that when we came to this fifth BRAC closure vote as to \nwhether we are going to allow the Commission to reconvene and make \ndeterminations as to priorities, I voted against it. I led the \nopposition. In fact, we only lost it by two votes. We have had a BRAC \nround, after all.\n  I made a statement from this Senate floor, from this podium, that \nwhatever recommendations they came up with on this independent, \nnonpartisan BRAC Commission, I would not object to, and that is exactly \nwhat has happened.\n  The problem we are facing--and I can remember so well saying in the \nSenate before this last round was decided upon, I said it may be that \nwe will save $20 billion over a period of time with another BRAC round. \nWe don't know that for sure, but there is one thing we do know; that \nis, it is going to cost us a lot of money in the next 3 or 4 years, \nright when we are going to need the funding for our military.\n  We went through the 1990s downgrading and downsizing the military. I \nremember this euphoric attitude that many people had--the Cold War is \nover, and we no longer need a military. Consequently, the attention was \nnot given to the military.\n  I have a chart I have not used for quite a while. This is during the \nClinton administration, from fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 2001. \nIf we take the black line, that shows that if we merely kept the budget \nwe had for the military from fiscal year 1993 and added nothing but \ninflation, the black line would represent the amount of the budget and \nwhat it would have been at the end of that period of time. The red line \nrepresents what the President's budget--it was President Clinton at \nthat time and what he was requesting. You can see the huge difference \nin there, about a $412 billion difference.\n  Congress, in its wisdom, increased the President's budget insofar as \nmilitary spending is concerned to this line right here. Nonetheless, \nover that period of time, while we did bring it up a little bit, it \nstill was $313 billion below what a static budget would have been from \nthat year, in bringing that year forward.\n  That is the problem we are facing in the 1990s, the late 1990s. I \nremember so many times coming to the Senate and saying that we will rue \nthe day we downgraded the military. And we did. We went down to about \n60 percent of the force strength, did away with and slowed down a lot \nof our military modernization programs.\n  I remember watching other countries producing better equipment, so \nwhen we send our young people out to do battle, they don't have the \nkind of equipment someone else might have. A good example would be our \nnon-line-of-sight cannon, artillery piece. The best piece we have today \nis the Paladin. That is World War II technology where you have to swab \nthe breach after every shot--something that is totally unacceptable. \nThere are five countries, including South Africa, that make a better \ncannon than we have. We are going to remedy that now, and we have \nfuture combat systems where we will start modernizing.\n  We also slipped behind in the Air Force. I remember when General \nJumper at that time came to the Senate, in 1998, and he said that now \nthe Russians are making the Su series, and he referred to the Su-35 and \nhe said it was better than any strike vehicle we have, our F-15s and F-\n16s. Now we have an F-22 that will do a better job. This is what \nhappened to us in the 1990s.\n  Now we come to the BRAC process. We had an opportunity to save $20 \nbillion. But to do that, we have to build installations in different \nareas, divest ourselves of other installations. That is where we are \ntoday.\n  As has been said by several speakers in the Senate, we are in a \nposition now going into a continuing resolution, that it would tie us \nto the 2006 budget. If this happens, the BRAC funding that is necessary \nto implement the changes to accommodate our fighting troops over there, \nin their rotations coming back home--all of these things that are \ntaking place are things that can't be taking place now because we are \n$3 billion short.\n  My next chart shows we are scraping just to fund the BRAC process. \nThe money the military needs to pursue the BRAC round in fiscal year \n2007 is $5.6 billion. You can see that on the chart. That is the amount \nthe President requested. That is also the amount in our authorization \nbill, the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act. Those on the \nSenate Committee on Armed Services authorized this $5.6 billion. The \nSenate appropriators thought they could shave a little bit off, so they \ncut from that $.4 billion. That brings it down to $5.2 billion.\n  Because there is no appropriated amount, the BRAC was funded at the \nfiscal year 2006 level, which is $1.6 billion--far lower than what is \nrequired to even start the process of this latest BRAC round. Under the \ncontinuing resolution now being considered, the funding was increased \nby $1 billion, which puts us at a total of $2.5 billion less what the \nmilitary is going to have to have. That means it is a $3.1 billion \nshortfall. I know it is confusing, so we put it on a chart so we can \nclearly understand it. That is what is necessary to carry out those \nrequirements we had in the BRAC round.\n\n  We did get $1 billion. Let me tell Members where that came from. The \nDemocrats scraped and squeezed all the unfunded amounts that were \nneeded to be funded by the CR. They were able to get an extra $13 \nbillion to fund their own priorities. We talked about those priorities, \nmany of them social programs, many of them programs I would support, \nsome programs I would oppose. To me, they were not in the league of \nnecessity that we have in our military construction in carrying out and \nimplementing BRAC.\n  The chart shows the amount of money, the $13 billion, and where this \nmoney went. If you go around the chart, you see Veterans' \nAdministration, $4.5 billion--we supported that; defense health, $1.4 \nbillion; State and Foreign Ops--this is HIV/AIDS, which has been talked \nabout in the Senate--that is $1.25 billion; law enforcement, $1.35 \nbillion--quite frankly, I am not sure what that is referring to; pay \nraise for Federal workers, $1 billion; Labor-HHS, Head Start, AIDS, \nSocial Security, and so forth, Pell grants, that is $2.3 billion; \nInterior Department, $200 million. Finally, after everyone else is \ntaken care of, everyone else has been funded, there is $1 billion left \nover to put toward BRAC. The need was $4.1 billion. It brings it down \nto the $3.1 billion. So the need is still there. That is how we got \nwhere we are today.\n  What this Senate needs to do is to evaluate and establish priorities \nas to\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\nwhat is really significant. What do we need to add? We are at war. It \nis inconceivable to me, when we come along with a BRAC process that \napplies housing and other needs for our troops who are rotating back \nand forth, that we are not able to do that.\n  One of the concerns I have that I have not talked about in the Senate \nis the problems we have in the communities. One of the reasons my State \nof Oklahoma has always, throughout all BRAC processes, all five of \nthem, benefited--and I am bragging a little bit here, and I know other \nStates do a good job--Oklahoma has always done an excellent job on \ncommunity support. In our five major military installations, we have \nthe communities building hospitals, doing child health care, helping \nwith roads, donating land. For that reason, we have always done a very \ngood job of that in my State. A lot of people were concerned when the \nBRAC processes took place; that is something which has actually been a \nbenefit to my State. However, in this case, there isn't a State that \nisn't involved either in pluses or minuses, but overall it is a way to \ntake care of those kids when they come back, when they rotate through.\n  We have two things that are happening right now. We are trying to \nrotate our troops who were in battle, and the second thing is, we are \ntrying to establish a program where, instead of sending some of our \npeople overseas for 3 and 4 years with their families, to bring them \nback and let them rotate.\n  With that, I am going to yield the floor. It is my intention to come \nback. I have quite a few more things to talk about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Oklahoma, \nas well as to my colleague from Texas, we appreciate their leadership \non this issue, restoring this funding for the transition as required \nunder BRAC. The Senator from Oklahoma and I both went through some very \ndifficult times under BRAC. Now, to not be able to carry out the \ndirection of the Commissioners with the difficult decisions that were \nmade is simply not right. Without his leadership, we would not be where \nwe are today.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The point I was trying to make in terms of community \nsupport, many communities in Georgia and Oklahoma have made commitments \npredicated on this next BRAC round coming forward. I ask the question, \nAren't you a little concerned how to face the communities if we renege \non what the Government's portion is?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator is exactly right. I will address that in \nmy comments in a few minutes. It is not fair to the taxpayers in \ngeneral but specifically those communities that are affected, as \ncommunities in Oklahoma and Georgia are, that we now come back and say: \nI know you have made these plans and you were preparing to receive \nadditional infrastructure, but now it will not happen because the folks \nin the Senate have decided they want to spend that money on social \nprograms as opposed to spending it on our military.\n  I do rise today to support my colleagues in restoring funds for the \nDepartment of Defense fiscal year 2007 BRAC requirements in the \ncontinuing resolution. The fiscal year 2007 President's budget \nrequested $16.7 billion for MILCON, which included $5.7 for fiscal year \n2005 base realignment and closure actions required to meet a statutory \ndeadline of September 15, 2011, to complete all realignments and \nclosures.\n  The fiscal year 2007 Defense authorization bill authorized MILCON \nappropriations of $17.4 billion after accounting for $278 million in \nprior year rescissions proposed by appropriators in both Chambers. The \nfinal authorized amount was $17.1 billion--$400 million above the \nPresident's budget for fiscal year 2007.\n  The Senate passed a fiscal year 2007 MILCON appropriations bill at \n$434 million below the fiscal year 2007 President's budget by cutting \nthe BRAC request and accounting for additional rescissions. The House \nversion of the fiscal year 2007 MILCON appropriations bill is $803 \nmillion below the President's budget, and it cut BRAC and $500 million \nin projects requested in the President's budget. No conference \nallocation was provided and a conference agreement was never reached.\n\n  A continuing resolution was enacted through February 15, 2007, at \nlevels equaling the fiscal year 2006 appropriations, but currently does \nnot allow for military construction new starts in fiscal year 2007. In \naddition, the fiscal year 2006 BRAC appropriation is $4 billion below \nthe request for fiscal year 2007. Therefore, over 90 percent of the \nauthorized fiscal year 2007 MILCON projects will not be able to be \nconstructed.\n  The new CR language proposed by House and Senate appropriators on \nJanuary 30 would provide fiscal year 2007 MILCON funds at levels \nrequested in the fiscal year 2007 President's budget, but would \nunderfund BRAC in fiscal year 2007 by $3 billion, seriously \njeopardizing the ability of the Department of Defense to carry out all \nBRAC actions by 2011.\n  Senator Inhofe offered a bill in early January that I cosponsored \nalong with several other Members of the Senate that would appropriate \nfunds for all MILCON projects authorized in the fiscal year 2007 \nDefense authorization bill.\n  The administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy on \nJanuary 30, strongly opposing the reductions that are in the continuing \nresolution we are considering. The Secretary of Defense and the service \nchiefs and Secretaries have met with many of us to provide an \nassessment of the impact on military programs as well as military \nreadiness. By cutting $3.1 billion in the fiscal year 2007 BRAC \nrequest, the proposed continuing resolution does not allow the \nDepartment to carry out the investments and the timing required to \ncomplete all BRAC initiatives by 2011. That is a statutory requirement \nestablished to assist communities affected by BRAC by mandating an \naccelerated transition to aid in economic recovery.\n  Deferring funds will result in higher contract costs as construction \nwill be delayed and ultimately compressed in a tighter execution \ntimeframe, forcing a greater demand for limited resources. Resolving \nthis issue has the support of key members of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, as well as many military and local community advocacy \ngroups.\n  I understand the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nintends to attempt to restore BRAC funding in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. But what kind of solution is this? Supplemental \nfunds have been requested by the President for military operations in \nIraq as well as Afghanistan. The funds requested in the supplemental \nare critically needed to purchase equipment for force protection and \nIED defeat initiatives. These funds would be used to train and equip \nIraqi security forces. The funds will be used for military \nintelligence, coalition support, and other regional operations in the \nglobal war on terror.\n  Since when do base realignments and closures qualify as an emergency \ndirectly supporting the global war on terror? How do we explain to the \nAmerican taxpayer that BRAC should be considered along with body armor, \nadditional military end strength, and vehicles being used in Iraq and \nAfghanistan?\n  Furthermore, we are having this discussion because my colleagues who \ndeveloped the resolution share with all of us the common goal to reduce \noverall Government expenditures. In that spirit, what critical \nwarfighting requirement do we cut in the supplemental to pay for the \nBRAC increase that is proposed? What do we deny to our frontline \nfighting troops? While I heard the idea of funding BRAC in the \nsupplemental, I have not heard one idea on how we pay for it.\n  Do they instead advocate for an increase in the supplemental? Why not \njust add funds to the resolution we have in front of us, as this is \nproper? Could it be they want to hide the additional funds they have \ninserted for domestic programs by pushing BRAC to an inappropriate \nmethod of funding? Is this how we propose to manage military \nappropriations for the future? By using budget gimmicks and shell games \nwhich will have devastating results for the military and for local \ncommunities? We must address full fiscal year 2007 funding for BRAC in \nthis continuing resolution.\n\n[[Page S1758]]\n\n  Including funds for BRAC in the CR is critical to modernizing and \nincreasing the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  The current CR provides $2.7 billion for Base Realignment and Closure \nprograms, which is $3.1 billion below the President's request, as I \npreviously stated. These reductions are inconsistent with congressional \nemphasis on force and readiness. Such a severe reduction to BRAC \nfunding will force the Department to rephase BRAC implementation plans. \nThis will have a negative ripple effect on the movement of troops and \nmissions throughout our global defense posture restructuring.\n  This planned approach could delay force rotations to Iraq and \nAfghanistan, as well as the Army's overall readiness posture, which \nrelies on completing the Modular Force conversions on time. This move \nwill impact readiness. And soldiers at Fort Campbell, Fort Drum, and \nFort Stewart will not have adequate places to train, work, or sleep.\n  This move will devastate the Department's ability to complete BRAC \nactions within statutory deadlines. It will stymie efforts to construct \nfacilities and move equipment and people to receiver locations, thereby \nimpeding our ability to realize savings and organizational \nefficiencies. Over 82 percent of the fiscal year 2007 BRAC request is \nfor construction that is required before these moves can occur. The \ncurrent continuing resolution cuts funding for family housing by $300 \nmillion below the President's request. This will directly and adversely \naffect the quality of life of our servicemembers by perpetuating the \ncontinued use of inadequate facilities where they work, train, and \nlive.\n  Regarding my home State of Georgia, the following projects will be in \njeopardy--and these are going to have very serious consequences to the \nability to train and give quality of life to the soldiers, which they \ndeserve--a child development center at Fort Benning; two trainee \nbarracks complexes at Fort Benning; training brigade complex at Fort \nBenning; fire and movement range at Fort Benning; modified record fire \nrange at Fort Benning; brigade headquarters building at Fort Benning; \nstationary gunnery range at Fort Benning; Marine Corps Reserve center \nat Robins Air Force base; Marine Corps Reserve center in Rome, GA; \nthree facilities to prepare Moody Air Force Base to receive A-10 \naircraft; and relocation of a vehicle maintenance complex at Robins Air \nForce Base.\n\n  None of these improvements can be made for our fighting men and women \nwithout this funding. It is imperative we do so in this CR.\n  Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, in that remaining minute 55 seconds, I \nwill very quickly say a word of commendation about a good friend of \nmine, a good friend of all Members of Congress, who is now serving in \nthe other body, Congressman Charlie Norwood.\n  Congressman Norwood has been in a severe battle for his life for the \nlast 3 years, and he is having a tough time. He has made a decision to \nnow go back to Augusta, GA, and spend the rest of his time with his \nfamily.\n  And, boy, what a great warrior Charlie Norwood has been. It was my \nprivilege to be elected to Congress with Congressman Norwood in 1994. \nHe is an avowed conservative. He does not back away from any of his \npositions in supporting conservative values. He is a strong supporter \nof our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States. He is a \nVietnam veteran. He is a very professional dentist. And he is one of \nthe greatest guys I have ever had the privilege of being associated \nwith.\n  As Charlie and his wife Gloria return to Augusta to spend the rest of \nhis time there, I want to say it has been a privilege to know him. It \nhas been a privilege to serve with him. I hope to have the opportunity \nto spend some more time with him in the next several weeks, months, \nwhatever it may be.\n  But he is a great trooper. He is a great American. And I hope all \nMembers of this body, as well as all Americans, will keep Congressman \nNorwood and his wife Gloria in their thoughts and prayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1758-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1758-S1759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one thing that should be noted, and has \nbeen noted on this floor today, is that the former chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and its members got all the \nappropriations bills passed out of Committee early on last year. Had \nthey been brought up by the then-leadership in the House and the Senate \nwe would not even be talking about a CR because, of course, they would \nhave been passed and signed into law.\n  But 2 weeks ago, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees \nfinished drafting H.J. Res. 20, the joint spending resolution. The \nHouse passed the joint resolution on January 31 by a bipartisan vote of \n286 to 140. The current continuing resolution left to us by the last \nCongress expires on February 15. So we have to act.\n  Total funding in the joint resolution is within the ceiling imposed \nby President Bush and the Republican Congress last year for fiscal year \n2007. There are, however, some adjustments from the fiscal year 2006 \nfunding levels in the continuing resolution that the Republican \nCongress agreed to.\n  During the past month, we worked together on a bipartisan basis to \nmake these adjustments so there would not be severe hardships to the \nmost vulnerable people or layoffs of Federal employees.\n  As chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee I am \ngratified by the additional funding that was included to meet urgent \nhumanitarian needs that do not reflect any partisan interest. These are \nmoral needs.\n  I thank Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for their help and \nalso the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg of New \nHampshire, and also his able staff for their support and cooperation \nduring this process, and Tim Rieser and Kate Eltrich of my staff for \nwhat they have done.\n  The adjustments include additional funding to combat HIV and AIDS. \nUnder the continuing resolution we enacted last year funding within \nState and Foreign Operations to combat HIV and AIDS totaled $2.57 \nbillion, including $445 million for the Global Fund that fights also \ntuberculosis and malaria.\n  Under H.J. Res. 20, those amounts will go to $3.84 billion and $625 \nmillion, respectively, again, with bipartisan support. I thank Senators \nDurbin and Brownback and the others who supported me in this effort.\n  Currently, only 20 percent of the people needing AIDS drugs in poor \ncountries get them, and only 10 percent of the people at risk of \ninfection are receiving the services to help them protect themselves.\n  If we had continued funding at last year's level, we would not have \nbeen able to provide lifesaving antiretroviral drugs to an estimated \n350,000 HIV-infected people.\n  According to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, 110,000 to \n175,000 people would die of HIV-related causes if the fiscal year 2006 \nfunding levels had not been increased in the joint resolution. Funding \nto combat malaria would have been frozen at the fiscal year 2006 level \nunder the continuing resolution passed last year.\n  Of course, malaria is something we do not have to worry about in this \ncountry. It is both preventable and treatable. Yet it kills more than a \nmillion people each year. Most of those who die are African children. \nAn expansion of programs to combat malaria would have been stalled \nunder the continuing resolution and the eight additional countries \ntargeted for the next round of malaria prevention and treatment would \nhave been placed on hold.\n  The additional funding will enable us to meet our commitment to cut \nmalaria-related deaths by 50 percent in 15 of the hardest hit countries \nin Africa. These funds will go to support the purchase of lifesaving \ndrugs, the distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, and the \ntreatment of pregnant women at risk for malaria.\n\n[[Page S1759]]\n\n  What we do here will help people none of us here will ever meet. Yet \nthink of nearly a million children in Africa who would die if we do not \nact. So it becomes a moral issue. America, again, helping people we \nwill never know or see, but we do it because it is the moral thing to \ndo and we have the wealth and technology to do it.\n\n  Under H.J. Res. 20, funding for international peacekeeping operations \nwill receive an additional $113 million above the amount in the \ncontinuing resolution enacted last year. This will ensure that our \nassessed dues to the U.N. are paid and we do not fall further behind in \nour support for troops in 13 countries, including Lebanon, Sudan, \nHaiti, and the Congo where, again, it is in our best interests to \nsupport these peacekeeping missions.\n  We provide $50 million to support the African Union troops in Darfur \nand southern Sudan. These funds had been omitted last year, but they \nare needed for the 7,000 troops at 34 camps throughout Sudan. When we \nread about the genocide in Sudan, about the children who have been \nmurdered, women who have been raped, people who have been killed as \nthey flee the ashes of their homes, how can we, as Americans say we \ncan't do something to stop it?\n  There is $20 million here to support Iraqi refugees. That is an \namount which, unfortunately, will only begin to address the catastrophe \nthat is unfolding. In fact, additional aid, as we know, will be needed \nfor Iraqi refugees in the fiscal year 2007 supplemental. The number of \nrefugees is going up every day. The ability to care for them is \ninsufficient.\n  So the clock is ticking. The urgency with which the Senate must act \nto pass the joint funding resolution should be measured not in time but \nin human lives. As Members of the Senate and the American people can \nreadily see, this legislation involves issues of life and death.\n  The additional funds were designated by the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to support \nthe priorities of both Democratic and Republican Senators, without \nexceeding the total funding ceiling set by the President.\n  I have said so many times on the floor of the Senate, on questions of \ndiseases that could be prevented, if Members of the Senate have young \nchildren or grandchildren or their friends do, we know that at certain \ntimes as they are growing up they go to the pediatrician, they get \nvaccinated against measles and other diseases. And they are protected. \nWe take it as a matter of course. We get the bill and we pay it, but \nthat bill is close to the amount many people in Africa would earn in a \nyear. They also know that their children may not get those \nvaccinations. They will not go to the pediatrician when they are 5 \nyears old because many of them die before they are 5 years old.\n  Oftentimes the mothers are not there to care for them either because \nof hundreds of thousands of women die needlessly in childbirth.\n  We can make a dramatic change. I agree with the President, I agree \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle, and I commend those who have \nsupported this. But also to those people around the world who have \nurged America, the most powerful Nation on Earth, to stand up and do \nthese humanitarian things, this is a small down payment on what the \nwealthiest, most powerful Nation on Earth can do. It is something that \nspeaks to the moral character of America and makes us a better nation \nand makes the lives of people we will never see better.\n  I am reminded of my dear friend Bono, who is known all over the world \nfor doing this, and who I commended for helping people throughout the \nworld who would never hear his music, who do not recognize him, who \nwill never buy a ticket to one of his concerts but whose lives are \nmeasurably better because of him. We have it in our power to do the \nsame thing.\n  Madam President, while I have been here the occupant of the Chair \nchanged from the time I started my comments to now. I hope it will show \non the Record and will be corrected to say ``Madam President.'' One of \nthe problems when you have been here as long as I have is you get used \nto saying ``Mr. President.'' And, of course, the Chair is now occupied \nby the Senator from Minnesota, one of the welcome new faces in the \nSenate, somebody who has improved the Senate just by being here.\n  I was reminded of some who came here at a time when this was an all-\nmale Senate, and it has improved substantially by the fact that it is \nno longer nor ever will be, I believe, in our lifetimes, an all-male \nbody.\n  I apologize to the Presiding Officer who came to the Chair following \nthe distinguished Senator from Nebraska. Of course, I refer to her with \npride, I might say, and with gratitude, as Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, I rise today to discuss U.S. military \noperations in Iraq.\n  Four years ago, we invaded Iraq to disarm an oppressor's regime and \nrestore control of that country to its own people. In the early hours \nof March 20, 2003, the United States, joined by our coalition partners, \nbegan a military campaign against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Code \nnamed ``shock and awe,'' the first 24 hours of combat operations filled \nthe country with punishing air attacks. As the massive firestorm of \nbombs and missiles targeted Iraqi leadership, ground forces rolled \ntowards Iraq's capital.\n  Without question, our military operations were swift and decisive. \nApproximately 120,000 U.S. troops, as well as a number of forces from \nour coalition partners, led the invasion into Iraq. Ground forces moved \ninto Baghdad, formally occupied the city, and the Hussein government \ncollapsed approximately 3 weeks after military operations began. Saddam \nHussein and his top leadership were captured, killed, or forced into \nhiding by coalition forces.\n  With Saddam on the run many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of the \noppressive regime.\n  While some fighting in Iraq continued, the major battles appeared \nover just one month after the start of the military campaign. And 43 \ndays after announcing the beginning of the war, President Bush declared \nthat, ``Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of \nIraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.''\n  Undoubtedly, the President was wrong. After remarkable success during \nthe initial combat operations, it appears that the Bush administration \ndid not sufficiently prepare for the consequences of their military \nvictory. The Bush administration could not have known everything about \nwhat it would find in Iraq.\n  But it could have, and should have, done far more than it did.\n  As George Washington once said, ``There is nothing so likely to \nproduce\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\npeace as to be well prepared to meet the enemy.'' In the aftermath of \nthe overthrow of Saddam Hussein and the Baathist regime, the U.S. \nproved it was ill-equipped for the post combat environment it would \nface. As a result, the Bush administration made grave and glaring \npolitical, military, and intelligence miscalculations.\n  As it turned out, the defeat of the Iraqi army was just the beginning \nof the war. Prewar plans drastically underestimated the number of \ntroops necessary in a post-Saddam Iraq.\n  The troop level of the invasion force proved inadequate to hold the \ncountry together after Saddam's regime was removed. The Bush \nadministration failed to heed the warnings of experienced, senior \nmilitary officers who stressed the need for a large force structure in \ncountry to provide security.\n  In particular, on the eve of the invasion, then Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General Eric Shinseki, predicted ``something on the order of \nseveral hundred thousand solders'' would be required to keep peace in a \npostwar Iraq.\n  While it is evident that General Shinseki was on the mark with his \nforce calculations, the general's comments were quickly dismissed by \nthe Department of Defense as ``wildly off the mark.'' Consequently, the \nU.S. invaded with what proved to be an insufficient number of troops to \nsecure a postwar Iraq.\n  Immediately after the invasion, it was readily apparent that serious \nmiscalculations, poor prewar planning, misguided assumptions, and \nwildly optimistic administration reporting was the order of the day. \nWhen the Iraqi Government collapsed, there was no framework in place \ncapable of filling the military, political, and economic void.\n  U.S. combat units were assigned to patrol large urban areas with no \nsense of their mission and no standard set of operating procedures. \nLooting and other criminal activities were rampant. The U.S. forces \nwere vastly inadequate to control the mounting violence, since the Bush \nadministration had mistakenly believed that U.S. forces would be \ngreeted as liberators rather than as occupiers. The reality was \nwidespread lawlessness throughout the country.\n  To make matters worse, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld denounced \nthe extent of the chaos as simply an expression of pent-up hostility \ntowards the old regime.\n  ``It's untidy.'' Rumsfeld said. ``And freedom's untidy. And free \npeople are free to make mistakes and commit crimes.''\n  We clearly underestimated the disorder and chaos the toppling of the \nregime would cause. Then we failed to effectively respond to it once it \ndid. The Bush administration simply did not believe that a major \nreconstruction effort would be required and they were unprepared when \nthe Iraqi infrastructure collapsed. As a result, interagency rivalry \nand turf wars between the Departments of Defense and State plagued the \nimmediate restoration of security and basic services.\n  Amid the escalating violence and civil disorder, the Department of \nDefense deployed a small reconstruction effort, led by retired \nLieutenant General Jay Garner. Garner became the Bush administration's \nfall guy for the problems and chaos in Iraq. He was blamed for not \nimplementing key services or restoring order fast enough. Yet, he was \nprevented from cooperating with planners in the Central Command and \ndenied key personnel increases. He was replaced less than one month \nafter reconstruction efforts began.\n  At this critical juncture, perhaps the single most important event in \nthe destabilization of Iraq after the cessation of large scale military \noperations occurred--Garner's replacement, Ambassador Paul Bremer, \ndemobilized the Iraqi Army.\n  The abrupt decision in May 2003 to disband the entire force, \nincluding apolitical conscripts, may have been one of the most grievous \nmistakes made by our occupying force. The decision allowed enemies of a \ndemocratic Iraq the time necessary to regroup and infiltrate the under-\nsecured nation.\n  We disbanded an organization that would have been vital for providing \nsecurity and assisting in the rebuilding. The 300,000 strong force \nalmost immediately morphed from soldiers to bitter, unemployed, armed \nterrorists who became prime recruits for the insurgency efforts. The \nresult of this one decision, gave an enormous boost to the forces of \ninstability in Iraq.\n  In the fall of 2003, the administration faced the dilemma of securing \na nation with a limited occupation force and no Iraqi security \nstructures in place.\n  While the Bush administration could have opted to deploy additional \nforces from the United States, the Department of Defense chose to speed \nup the Iraqi Army training program. The effect, inevitably, produced \nIraqi soldiers who were neither properly trained nor fully committed to \nthe mission.\n  This problem became even more severe with the creation of the Iraqi \nCivil Defense Corps. The Corps' purpose was to provide local militia \nforces as adjuncts to the Iraqi army. However, the Bush administration \nwas impatient to create more Iraqi troops to illustrate that additional \nU.S. forces were unnecessary.\n  They once again increased the training pace which restricted the \nvetting process of the Iraqi troops. The result was an Iraqi Civil \nDefense Corps limited in its combat capability, thoroughly infiltrated \nby insurgents, who predictably collapsed whenever committed to combat.\n  With nothing to fill the power void left by the regime's fall, the \nU.S. ended up creating a failed state that allowed the insurgency to \ndevelop.\n  The United States did not anticipate the deeply divided Iraqi \nsociety--one with the Sunnis resentful over the loss of their dominant \nposition and the Shiites seeking power commensurate with their majority \nstatus--would devolve the country into sectarian violence.\n  The Bush administration was clearly unprepared for the likelihood \nthat these ethnic differences and the dramatic shift in the power \ndynamics would cause the sects to engage in violent conflict. Perhaps \neven more importantly, the administration did not foresee that the U.S. \nmilitary, as an occupying force, would itself be the target of \nresentment and armed attacks.\n  Since the invasion, lingering Shiite resentment and Sunni fears \nassociated with the shift in power have helped transform local and \nindividual political or economic disputes into broader religious \nconfrontations. Moreover, the Bush administration insisted that all of \nthe problems of the country were caused by the insurgency, rather than \nthat all of the problems of the country were helping to fuel the \ninsurgency. Security was not established after the fall of the \nBa'athist government and still remains beyond our grasp.\n  As a result, the hardening of sectarian and ethnic identities in a \npostwar Iraq has created significant anxiety among Iraq's neighbors, \nmany of whom also have religiously and ethnically diverse populations. \nToppling the regime and dismantling the Iraqi armed forces removed a \npotential military threat to the Middle East region. Yet, it also \neliminated the area's principal strategic counterbalance to Iran. The \ninstability and violence in Iraq, coupled with Iraq's neighbors' fears \nof an emboldened and potentially hostile Iran, has created new concerns \namong Middle Eastern nations and sparked increased interest in the \nfuture of Iraq.\n  In particular, Gulf governments worry that escalating sectarian \nviolence in Iraq could spread to Iraq's mainly Sunni neighbors and \nforce them into conflict with Shiite-controlled Iran. Gulf governments \nalso believe that regions in Iraq could become safe havens for \nterrorist organizations if the Iraqi government collapses or the U.S. \nwithdraws troops precipitously.\n  As we debate a strategy for Iraq, we need to make certain we paint \nthe big picture and understand what is at stake. If we precipitously \nwithdraw our troops, we will open the door for the Iranians to exert \neven more influence in both Iraq and the Middle East.\n  Iran clearly has regional aspirations that will significantly \nincrease without a counterbalance in the Persian Gulf.\n  However, more than just the strategic balance of the region is at \nstake. The oil reserves in Iraq are vast--believed to be only second in \nsize in the Middle East to those of Saudi Arabia. Imagine over half the \nworld's oil in the hands of the mullahs in Tehran. Picture the world \nwith another nuclear power that hates the United States and all it \nstands for. The President is correct when he states that those who say\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nthe future of Iraq is not a direct threat to our national security are \ndeluding themselves.\n  Madam President, we are now living with the consequences of \nsuccessive policy failures. The blunders, miscalculations, and failed \nleadership made by the Bush administration continue to this day.\n  As I stand here today, one thing is clear--we are at a crossroads.\n  One month ago, President Bush addressed the Nation and outlined a new \nstrategy in Iraq. Since that time, the merit and purpose of escalating \nU.S. troops has been debated around the country. This week, the Senate \nbrought forth several resolutions expressing various viewpoints on the \nsubject.\n  One resolution, introduced by Senators Warner and Levin, disagrees \nwith the troop escalation strategy, but like all the resolutions on \nIraq, it is not binding. It cannot deter the President from sending \nmore troops. It cannot withdraw the troops currently in Iraq. And it \ndoes not limit the President's power as Commander-in-Chief. That is set \nin the Constitution.\n  However, what this resolution does is state that we, the United \nStates Senate, the same body that 4 years prior authorized the use of \nforce in Iraq, no longer has confidence in the U.S. strategy in Iraq.\n  Far more significantly, it sends the message to our brave fighting \nmen and women that although the Senate will not stop you from deploying \nand engaging the enemy, we do not think you can succeed in your \nmission. That is a message I refuse to send.\n  Therefore, I do not support the Warner-Levin resolution. Our service \nmembers need clear direction--not mixed messages from the United States \nSenate. The Armed Forces need support, both materially and morally, \nfrom the policymakers who sent them into combat. Ambiguity has no place \nin our strategy or operations in Iraq.\n  My opposition to this resolution, however, should not be confused \nwith blind support of the President's policy. I have grave concerns and \nserious doubts about the future of Iraq and what role the United States \nwill play there. As we scrutinize the new strategy put forth by the \nPresident, numerous and troubling questions arise about the future of \nU.S. involvement.\n  Should we put more of our servicemembers in harm's way?\n  Is the number of troops in the surge enough? Or do we need more?\n  Is it too late to recover and should we just cut our losses and begin \nto withdraw our troops?\n  If we did withdraw, what would be the cost?\n  American prestige?\n  An unleashing of transnational terrorism?\n  The establishment of Iran as the dominant force in the Middle East?\n  Will the Iraqi government step up to help secure the country? Or will \nsending more troops only delay Iraq's government from taking more \nresponsibility?\n  The questions could go on and on. In the words of Winston Churchill \nwho once said, ``You ask, what is our policy? You ask, what is our \naim?'' I believe there are three fundamental questions that must be \nanswered before moving forward:\n  What is our goal in Iraq? How do we measure success? Just stating \nthat success is the establishment of a democratic and secure government \nin Iraq is too broad a definition. It represents an endless engagement \nfor the U.S. We need more definable, measurable objectives. That is a \nbasic principle of war.\n  How do we achieve it? What is our strategy? Not just our military \nstrategy, but our overall strategy involving military, political, \neconomic, and social components.\n  And is this new plan set forth by the President a viable option? Is \nit a rational strategy that will lead to achieving our objectives, \nwhich will in turn lead to success in Iraq?\n  When combat operations began, our goal was straightforward--to enable \nIraq to be stable, unified, and democratic, able to provide for its own \nsecurity, a partner in the global war on terror, and a model for reform \nIn the Middle East.\n  Four years later, the country has descended into chaos. While the \nformal political framework for a democratic government has advanced, \ninsurgent and sectarian violence has increased and become more \nwidespread. Is it still plausible to believe that the U. S. can unify \nthis country so that it will be able to sustain a viable democratic \ngovernment?\n  We are fighting an insurgency in Iraq. American forces and the Iraqi \npeople have the same enemies--the Shiite, Sunni, and al-Qaida \nterrorists, illegal militias, Iranian agents, and Saddam loyalists who \nstand between the Iraqi people and their future as a free nation.\n  Only through a combination of military force, political dialogue, \neconomic development and reform, and increased security for the \npopulation will we be able to restore peace. Therefore, we are now \nconfronted with this question: How . will the United States reverse \nIraq's steady decline into sectarian and radical religious chaos and \nbring stability to violence-torn parts of the country?\n  In the announcement of an imminent deployment of 21,500 additional \nU.S. servicemembers to Iraq, the Bush administration radically shifted \nits Iraq policy.\n  By increasing the amount of ``boots on the ground,'' many of the \nbasic tenets of the President's Iraq strategy thus far have been \nrepudiated--in particular, that political progress would eventually \nsuppress the violence. The question now becomes, will the increase in \nour armed forces in Baghdad help stabilize the country and stop the \nspiral into a civil war, or is it too late?\n  We have entered into a quagmire, and there is no easy exit. This is \nnot a war that will be won overnight and it is dangerous to believe \nthat if we set an artificial time line to withdraw troops that the \nterrorist violence would not follow us home.\n  The consequence of failure in Iraq is the strengthening and growth of \nradical extremists who will use the country as a safe haven for their \nterrorist organizations to threaten the safety and security of the \nUnited States and the entire free world.\n  No one appears to have the answer to the calamity that is the current \nstate of affairs in Iraq.\n  Even those outspoken detractors of the Bush plan do not offer \npractical alternatives. Cutting and running is not an option, not for \nthe United States. Even the appearance of doing so under another name \nis unacceptable, I believe, at any level. It is clear, though, that \nthings cannot continue forward on this path. The administration and the \nCongress must find a viable strategy for U.S. involvement in Iraq.\n  I will not stand before you, Madam President, and assert that the \nBush plan is not without flaws, nor will I state I am completely \nconfident an additional 21,500 troops will turn the war around, will \nstabilize Baghdad. We will know that answer soon enough, all of us. But \nwhat I do know is this: When you vote to send troops into combat, it \nbecomes your responsibility to ensure their mission is clearly defined, \nthey have realistic military objectives, and they have the best \nequipment to achieve these goals.\n  As Congress debates the President's plan--and we will--as new ideas \nand strategies, perhaps new resolutions are brought forward, one thing, \nI submit, must remain constant: the support we give our soldiers, our \nservice members around the world in harm's way.\n  I acknowledge there are different views within Congress about the way \nforward in Iraq, but Congress, in my judgment, should never let \npolitical infighting lead to bartering for bullets. Cutting off funding \nfor our troops or even under any kind of name or guise should never be \nan option. The members of the U.S. Armed Forces willingly face grave \ndangers for each and every one of us. They have bravely faced sometimes \nan unknown enemy and have done everything that has been asked of them. \nAbandoning our servicemembers, our soldiers, hampering their ability to \nfight or cutting off funds for necessary military equipment or supplies \ncannot be an alternative, in my judgment. We should never take any \naction that will endanger our Armed Forces fighting in combat.\n  No one, I believe, wants to bring our troops safely home more than I \ndo or you do, Madam President. Yet while many oppose sending more \ntroops, no one in Congress has yet proposed an alternative that allows \nIraq to stabilize. Therefore, the last question I pose to the Senate \nis: Why is no one looking\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\nfor a way to win as opposed to simply a way out? This should be part of \nthe debate in the few weeks ahead.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I may inquire about the situation, are \nwe now considering the continuing resolution, the appropriations bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will take advantage of the 10 minutes, \nthen, to talk about the pending continuing resolution or, as others \nrefer to it, the Omnibus appropriations bill. I have watched bills of \nthis nature come and go over the years. Obviously, it is not the best \nway to do the job.\n  On occasion--I remember back in 1996 and two or three times since I \nhave been in the Senate--we actually completed all of our \nappropriations by the end of the fiscal year, and that is the way it \nought to be done. In order to get that done, we have to start working \non it in May, not June, not July, and not in the fall. Regular order is \nthe way it should be done, and I am pleased to hear our two leaders say \nthat is the way they intend to proceed this year.\n  But for a variety of reasons, sometimes in spite of our best efforts, \nwe don't often complete our work by the end of the fiscal year because \nit is quite difficult to get agreement as to what the figures will be \nin providing funds for the people's business in the Federal Government.\n  And so we pass these continuing resolutions. They always bother me \nbecause they pull in a huge number of agencies, bureaus, departments, \nand money into one big pile, and it is very hard to know all that is \ngoing to go on as a result of that kind of procedure. That is where we \nfind ourselves.\n  This is a $463 billion bill, as I am sure others have pointed out, \nand it funds most all of the discretionary programs of the Federal \nGovernment, from transportation and education to housing. The only \nthing it doesn't include is defense and homeland security. And so here \nwe are trying to finish up that process for this year's funds, this \nfiscal year.\n\n  We can certainly exchange criticisms of how we got here, and I think \nthere is some legitimate criticism that is due. But the way we handled \nthings the last time we had a similar situation, in 2003, we did go \nthrough an amendment process. According to Senator McConnell, I think \nwe had close to probably 100 amendments. We voted about 30 times, but \nwe got through it in a reasonable period of time, and we can do that \nhere, too.\n  I understand the leadership would like to go ahead and move through \nthis as quickly as possible and get on to the regular business in the \ncalendar year, so I can't be too critical about that. But I am very \nconcerned about how we deal with some of the substantive issues in this \nlegislation.\n  I have no doubt Democrats and Republicans have issues they think \nshould have been funded that are not going to be funded by this bill, \nand others believe some of the things that are funded shouldn't be. One \nshould never believe that there are not earmarks on an appropriations \nbill. I have tried to deal with earmarks. I have tried to out-wrestle \nappropriators ever since I have been in Congress, going back to when I \nwas in the House. You always lose because they know where all the \nnumbers are buried. So don't be fooled. There are some earmarks in \nhere. Maybe they are justified. There are what we call anomalies, which \nare those situations where if we do not increase the funding it will \ncreate some problems.\n  The perfect example is the Federal Aviation Administration. We don't \nwant the FAA furloughing air traffic controllers, so we have to add \nenough funds to make sure they have their straight-line funding or \nwhatever is necessary to make sure they can continue their operations.\n  There are, however, two or three areas that specifically bother me. I \nam not a fan of the base closure procedure. I have voted against it \nevery time it has come up while I have been in Congress. I did it in \nthe House, and I have done so in the Senate. I have always opposed \nBRAC. I think it is an abrogation of responsibility of those serving in \nthe Congress. We shouldn't hand off to some commission the decision as \nto whether we leave a base open or close it, or what troops are moved \nin and moved out.\n  Rightly or wrongly, we did it. As part of that package, we told our \ndifferent communities that we were going to clean up the base \nfacilities that were going to be closed and that we were going to have \nremediation so that when the community got it back they had something \nthat was usable and not environmentally dangerous. We told communities \nin Kansas and in Georgia that we were going to move huge new numbers \ninto their bases to take the place of bases that we were closing in \nEurope and other bases around the country.\n  We said we were going to provide additional funds to provide training \nfacilities and living facilities to improve the quality of life for our \ntroops and their families, so that when they do come back by the \nthousands--and 12,000 are being added to at least one of the bases in \nthe country--we will have the facilities to provide for proper housing \nand training.\n  This bill, however, cuts out $3.1 billion that was to go for that \npurpose, and it redistributes that money around social welfare \nspending. We can debate the value of those other programs, but my \nquestion is: Is that a wise thing to do right now when we are trying to \nbring some of our troops home from Europe? Who are they defending the \nEuropeans against? The Soviet Union? It is gone. Eastern Europe is part \nof Europe now. So I really am concerned.\n  I do think we should have it paid for, and a .8-percent, across-the-\nboard cut will take care of the funds so that it is revenue neutral. I \njust think it sends a terrible message, once again, to our troops, \ntroops whom we have been fighting to bring home from these remote \nassignments, that when they get here there is going to be a problem. \nThey are going to be living in World War II barracks in Fort \nLeavenworth, KS. I am sure Senator Roberts talked about that. And that \nis an issue we need to address.\n  Some people have said we will add the $3.1 billion back with the \nappropriations supplemental bill, but that means it will be added to \nthe deficit. I think we should provide the funds and make sure they are \npaid for.\n  There are a number of other areas to which others have referred. \nEducation is one area. We can argue over our priorities, but I have \nevery reason to believe that there are some areas in education where we \nneed to be able to adjust the numbers a little bit.\n  So I wanted to talk about the substance, first of all. I think \nRepublicans and Democrats should be able to have a reasonable number of \namendments. I am not for an unlimited number. I don't think we should \nuse it to be dilatory. But there has never been a bill written that was \nperfect, and neither is this one. We need to have a few opportunities \nfor Democrats and Republicans to offer some relevant amendments.\n  I don't think we ought to get off and relitigate budget issues or \nbudget process issues or issues with regard to Iraq but not directly \nrelated here, but I do think we should allow a few amendments. I would \nurge our leaders to come to that agreement. I would urge Senator Reid \nto be amenable to that. The majority is never going to be able to force \ntheir way in the Senate. It doesn't make a difference how big the \nmajority is or how much power they have. It doesn't work that way. How \ndo I know? I found out the hard way, more than once.\n  I don't think we should have a permission slip in the Senate. We \ncan't have a deal where in order to offer an amendment we have to have \npermission. No. This is the Senate. Senators are going to offer their \namendments. Sooner or later, they are going to do it.\n  I even filled up the tree. I am tied for the record of filling up the \ntree. Senator George Mitchell and I are the\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\nchamps. I filled up the tree nine times, and I blocked amendments. What \nhappened? They were all back on the next bill. If I out-maneuvered them \nand pushed them off from that bill, they were back on the next bill.\n  In fact, it seemed as though the same 100 amendments appeared on \nevery bill. Sooner or later in the Senate the majority has to ante up \nand kick in. We have to just let out a little steam, just a little \npressure, turn the spigot a tad. If you don't, it is going to blow up \nin your face.\n  We are all adjusting to our new roles. We are learning how, once \nagain, to be in the minority. It is not the preferred role, but it is \none where we can have an effect, and it can be fun. There is a new \nmajority in town. Lots of power. They are going to run this thing.\n\n  No. This is a consensus body. We will adjust. We will learn our new \nrole, the loyal opposition within the Senate, as will the majority.\n  The one thing I like about our leaders now in the Senate, these are \nexperienced hands. These are not new kids on the block. They know what \nthey are doing. They are naturally going to have to test each other out \na bit, but I believe with time we are going to see the Senate make a \nlittle more progress.\n  I wish we could begin that on this bill. We are not going to agree to \na deal where the majority leader says: OK, I give you a permission slip \nto offer an amendment, and by the way, I am also going to tell you what \nthat amendment is. No. No. That is not going to happen. It might happen \nhere, or it might happen there, but the majority cannot ultimately \ndictate things like this, especially when we are talking about things \nsuch as abandoning assistance for AIDS babies.\n  There are some things we can do with babies who have AIDS. There are \ndrugs that can keep them from being born with AIDS, or to address their \nproblems and they live a happy, normal life. So we don't want to \neliminate that funding. That is just one example of where we need to \nhave an amendment in order, and I hope that we will find a way to do \nthat.\n  Madam President, $460 billion is a lot of money, and most of it is \nfor very good purposes, but this is the Senate, and I hope we can find \norder and a way to do this. We could probably get three or four \namendments on each side, have some debate on those amendments, and be \nout of here by next Wednesday and feel as though we did the best we \ncould. I think that would be a good idea. I think it would be good for \nthe country.\n  I am committed to being here and helping in any way I can. There is \nnobody here who has ever been in leadership who has clean hands, but I \nthink we ought to learn from the past, learn from the recent past and \nfind a better way to get the job done.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WHITE, JR.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, when most Americans were celebrating \nannual religious holidays and the beginning of a new year, my family \nwas mourning the loss of one of our favorite and most outstanding \nrelatives, Louis H. White, Jr. Louis White was the husband of my \nfather's sister, Dale White. Their children, Charlotte and Curtis, in \naddition to being my first cousins, were good friends as well.\n  Louis White was a member of the fabled ``greatest generation,'' made \nup of those who left homes and families and volunteered to serve in the \narmed services during World War II. He left college at Mississippi \nState University and became an officer in the Army Air Corps. He was \nqualified soon as a pilot of a B-17 and flying combat missions over \nGermany. He and his crew were shot down eventually, and he spent \nseveral months in a prisoner of war camp before being liberated by the \nRussians as they moved into Germany from the east.\n  After the war, after completing his engineering studies, graduating \nfrom college, he became an outstanding engineer, enjoying a career of \ngreat success as a paper company executive, where he designed and \nmanaged the operation of several large paper mills in Florida, Alabama, \nand Texas.\n  My parents, my brother, and I often enjoyed visits with him and his \nfamily during holidays, particularly when they were living on Santa \nRosa Island, near Pensacola, FL.\n  When Louis retired, he was a senior staff project engineer with BE, \nan engineering firm in Birmingham, AL, where he was involved for 11\\1/\n2\\ years at high levels of management in the paper industry. At his \nretirement celebration, it was said he should qualify for the \n``Guinness Book of World Records'' because of 52 years of never missing \na day of work because of illness or the weather.\n  His first job, incidentally, was at age 14, when he was a dairy \ndelivery boy. He always was dutiful and dependable. In the German \nprison camp, for instance, he developed an exercise routine that helped \nsave his life and the lives of those who decided to exercise with him \nevery day. He once told me about a Red Cross package that would come \nwith an assortment of things that would help the prisoners survive, \nthat they included things such as vitamin pills, cigarettes, and other \nthings. He would trade the cigarettes for vitamin pills, for those who \nwanted to swap.\n  His example of generosity with his voluntary contributions in the \ncommunities where he lived to the schools his children and \ngrandchildren would attend, helping install, personally, the \ninfrastructure of cables and wiring necessary for all the classrooms to \nhave computers, for example, were marks of his contribution to his \ncommunity.\n  The quality of his life, the patriotism he displayed, his courage in \nbattle, his survivability under the most difficult and challenging \ncircumstances in the prisoner of war camps, his loyalty to his family \nand the level of excellence of his career as an engineer in business \nand industry are worthy of emulation and high praise.\n  I extend my heartfelt compassion and love to his wife and family \nmembers who miss him greatly. We wish them well and thank them for the \nsupport they gave him throughout his life and his career.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1763-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING SENATOR THAD COCHRAN ON HIS 10,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I sought recognition for a number of \npurposes. But first, let me congratulate my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi, for casting his 10,000th vote \ntoday. Senator Cochran came to the Senate after the 1978 election, \nhaving served previously in the House of Representatives for 6 years, \nand has had an illustrious career. He served on the Judiciary Committee \nfor 2 years and demonstrated, at an early point in his Senate career, \nhis wisdom by leaving the Judiciary Committee after only 2 years. All \nthose hot-button issues--school prayer, abortion, flag burning, et \ncetera--were not for Senator Cochran. He was on the big issues of the \nday and specialized in appropriations.\n  He has been the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee and has an outstanding record. I challenge anybody to search \nthe record, 10,000 votes, and find any mistakes by Senator Cochran. It \nhas been, truly, an outstanding career.\n  Beyond his extraordinary capability as a Senator, he is always of \ngood cheer, always personable, always upbeat. He has made a great \ncontribution to the Senate and to the House before that. He will have \nmany more years of very distinguished service for the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1763-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1763-S1766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE RULES CHANGE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I turn to the subject of submitting a \nresolution which I spoke about yesterday, and I do formally submit the \nresolution at this time. This resolution will eliminate the practice of \nfilling the tree, which means there is a procedure to eliminate the \nopportunity of a Senator to offer an amendment.\n  This is a particularly problemsome week for the Senate. We are on \nThursday, and twice this week action has\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nbeen taken in the Senate, on two separate matters, to foreclose \nSenators from offering amendments. I spoke on Monday and again \nyesterday on the subject of U.S. policy in Iraq, and we have a bill \nwhich has been offered by Senator Levin, and the majority leader was \nexpected to fill the tree, if given an opportunity to do so. No denial \nhas been made of that practice, which was anticipated by the majority \nleader.\n  A motion to proceed is a debatable motion under Senate rules. When \nyou have a matter as important as the Iraq war, there ought to be very \ncareful consideration given by the Senate--reputed to be the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. Immediately upon taking up the bill, the \nmajority leader filed a cloture motion. It was kind of odd, even for \npeople not versed in Senate procedure, to bring up a bill which is \ndebatable and immediately to file a motion to cut off debate, but that \nwas what was done.\n  On the Republican side, there was an interest in having alternative \nresolutions, ideas considered--by Senator McCain, to support the surge \nwith benchmarks; by Senator Warner, to express opposition to a surge of \n21,500; and by Senator Gregg, to have a resolution which would deal \nwith the prohibition against funding for the troops--which obviously \nnobody wants to do. The troops are in harm's way. We are not going to \ncut off funding.\n  But behind the scenes what was happening was negotiations between \nSenator Reid and Senator McConnell--the agreement could not be reached \ngiving the Republicans a fair opportunity to offer alternative \nresolutions, so almost all Republicans joined together to reject the \ncloture motion and keep the debate going.\n  It is not understood in America what is happening because it is \narcane, it is esoteric, it is unintelligible--they can't figure it out. \nBut the popular view, the public perception was the Republicans were \ntrying to protect the President, to cut off debate on the Iraq policy \nand not to have a vote. That, simply stated, was not true.\n  I have been on the record for some time, expressing my skepticism \nabout the surge position. There is no doubt that Senator Warner opposes \nthe President's position because he is the author of the resolution to \nexpress disapproval on the surge position. He voted against cloture. No \ndoubt, Senator Hagel was against the President's proposal. He has been \nthe most severe critic of the President's proposal. Senator Hagel also \nvoted against cloture, as did almost all Republicans. But the \nperception was the Republicans were trying to block debate in the \nconsideration of the resolution of disapproval.\n  After I announced my intention to introduce this rule change, I went \nto the third floor, to the press gallery, to sit down with the \nreporters to explain and to answer questions, to try to get a public \ndiscussion on what was happening. One of the reporters from the wire \nservices commented that no story was written about it because it \ncouldn't be explained to anybody beyond the beltway. It could not be \nexplained.\n  Two of the newspapers on Capitol Hill carried brief stories about it, \nbut the matter has been dropped. Republicans have lost the public \nrelations battle. The issue will be taken up in the House. Maybe it \nwill be reconsidered in the Senate. But this procedure of allowing the \nmajority leader to stop alternative considerations is inappropriate and \nunfair.\n  There are some pretty good authorities for the proposition that this \nprocedure is inappropriate. I wish to cite three very distinguished \nSenators: Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader; Senator Richard \nDurbin, the assistant majority leader; and Senator Chris Dodd, Democrat \nfrom Connecticut. As I said yesterday, this business about filling the \ntree has been practiced by both parties. The Congressional Research \nService did a study that showed that going back to Senator Dole in the \n1985-1986 Congress, every majority leader has used this procedure--\nSenator Dole, Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Frist, and now Senator Reid, twice in 1 week. In the \nfifth week of the new session, it is twice already being used. So that \nDemocrats and Republicans are equally at fault. If people want to know \nwhom to blame in Washington, it is a pretty good conclusion it is \nequally divided, that the bickering is the responsibility of both \nparties--a plague on both houses.\n  But when we Republicans controlled the Senate and we had the PATRIOT \nAct, Senator Reid had this to say on February 28 of last year. He was \nspeaking in defense of a fellow Democrat's ability to offer amendments \nto the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. This is what Senator Reid said:\n\n       Of course, even a good bill can be improved. That is why we \n     have an amendment process in the Senate . . . I am \n     disappointed that he has been denied that opportunity by a \n     procedural maneuver known as ``filling the amendment tree.''\n       This is a very bad practice. It runs against the basic \n     nature of the Senate. The hallmark of the Senate is free \n     speech and open debate. Rule XXII establishes a process for \n     cutting off debate and amendments, but Rule XXII should \n     rarely be invoked before any amendments have been offered.\n\n  That is what Senator Reid said less than a year ago. I couldn't say \nit better. In fact, I couldn't say it as well.\n  Then, a few days later on March 2, Senator Reid said this:\n\n       Don't fill the tree. This is a bad way, in my opinion, to \n     run the Senate.\n\n  Then Senator Durbin spoke on May 11 of 2006 on the tax increase \nprevention and reconciliation act. Speaking about that conference \nreport, this is what Senator Durbin had to say:\n\n       The Republican majority brings a bill to the Senate, fills \n     the tree so no amendments can be offered, and then files \n     cloture, which stops debate. So we cannot have this \n     conversation. We cannot offer amendments.\n\n  Well, that is exactly the plan for the Iraq issue, and that is what \nis being done now on the continuing resolution which has been filed.\n  Senator Dole had this to say, speaking about health care legislation:\n\n       I want to point out to our colleagues why I am terribly \n     disappointed with the procedures we have been confronted with \n     this evening dealing with this legislation . . . This is the \n     Senate. This Chamber historically is the place where debate \n     occurs. To have a process here this evening . . . to \n     basically lock out any amendments that might be offered to \n     this proposal runs contrary to the very essence of this body \n     . . . If you believe the Senate ought to be heard on a \n     variety of issues relating to the subject matter--when the \n     amendment tree has been entirely filled, then obviously we \n     are dealing with a process that ought not to be . . . the \n     Senate ought to be a place where we can offer amendments, \n     have healthy debate over a reasonable time, and then come to \n     closure on the subject matter.\n\n  Well, Arlen Specter doesn't have to say anything more on the subject \nbecause Senator Reid, Senator Durbin, and Senator Dodd are much more \neloquent than I. So I offer this resolution to correct this problem for \nthe future. It is very hard to change a Senate rule, but nobody has \nproposed it in the past, to my knowledge, and today we will start on \nit.\n  Beyond the procedure used by the majority leader, the leader of the \nDemocrats, to shut off debate and consideration of alternative \nproposals on the Iraq policy, the majority leader has utilized the \nprocedure again on the continuing resolution.\n  Now the continuing resolution characteristically is a brief document, \nusually about a page, which says the Government will continue to \noperate under existing appropriations, since there has not been time to \nconsider a new appropriations package. But what we have in H.J. Res. 20 \nis an omnibus bill running 137 pages. I want to have an opportunity to \namend it. Other Senators want to have an opportunity to amend it. Some \nhave spoken on the floor of the Senate here today. But we are \nforeclosed from doing so.\n  When the announcement was made that we were going to go to this kind \nof a procedure, in my capacity as chairman last year, now ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, I wrote a letter to Senator Reid asking that \nwe follow regular order and consider the appropriation bills \nsequentially. I sent identical letters to Speaker Pelosi, the \nRepublican leader, Boehner, in the House, Senator McConnell, Senator \nByrd, Representative Obey, Representative Lewis, and Senator Cochran, \nthe leaders of both bodies and the chairmen and ranking members of both \nAppropriations Committees. Because if we had the will; we had the time; \nwe had the way, to get it all done. But the leadership has chosen not \nto follow that path, and now we have a continuing resolution which does \nnot allow for any amendments. That is not in the public interest.\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\n  After having been in the Senate for 26 years and being on the \nAppropriations Committee for 26 years, I have turned into a \nrubberstamp. That is what the Senators are here, those who did not have \na say in the preparation of this continuing resolution. We are all \nrubberstamps: Take it or leave it. Now we would employ the procedure \nused on the Iraqi issue to avoid cutting off debate, but the Treasury \nwill run out of money at midnight on February 15--that is Thursday \nnight--so we have the option of closing down the Government if we don't \napprove this rubberstamp procedure, and we are not going to do that. We \nhad experience with the closing down of the Government back in December \nof 1995, and it was a very bitter experience; great political peril in \nclosing down the Government.\n  Here we have a very important measure. For a few minutes I want to \npoint out what has happened to the subcommittee which funds health \ncare, which is our No. 1 capital asset; you can't do anything if you \ndon't have good health, and I can testify to that personally from my \nown experience in the last 2 years. Secondly, education. If you are not \ntrained, you can't do anything, even with good health. The Department \nof Labor on job training and worker safety. The level of the budget for \nfiscal year 2005 was $143.4 billion. The President has proposed a \nbudget for fiscal year 2008 of $141.5 billion. If you take a look at \nthe cuts in the budget for Health, Education and Labor and you add in \nthe inflationary factors, the committee is being asked to operate at a \nlevel of $14.7 billion less than the fiscal year 2005 budget. That \nsimply is inadequate to take care of the National Institutes of Health, \noffering the greatest chance through medical research to find cures for \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer and heart disease; funding for \nHead Start, funding for Title I, funding for education programs, \nfunding for job training. It simply is totally insufficient.\n  Those are the kinds of matters we ought to address on this continuing \nresolution. That is what we ought to be talking about, instead of \nhaving our last vote before noon on a Thursday as part of our 5-day \nworkweek. We have yet to see that; we have yet to take the time we need \nto consider these matters. Had we taken up these appropriations bills \nin regular order, as I asked the leadership back on January 10, we \nwould have had adequate time to do so.\n  It is my hope that one day, and hopefully sooner rather than later, \nthe Senate will change its rules so the majority leader will not be \nable to create a procedural morass to stop Senators from introducing \namendments. It is my hope Senator Reid's admonitions when the shoe was \non the other foot back last year, that filling the tree is a bad \npractice, it runs against the basic nature of the Senate, the hallmark \nof the Senate is free speech and open debate, and similar comments by \nSenator Durbin and Senator Dodd, that we will be able to have a process \nso when an issue such as Iraq comes before the Senate, we can function \nas a deliberative body and we can have debate; we can consider \nalternative matters, and we can decide what U.S. policy should be. \nBecause the President is not the sole decider. It is a shared \nresponsibility; that when we have a budget and a resolution to fund the \nU.S. Government, we are not shut out from offering amendments.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. ___\n\n       Resolved,  That (a) rule XV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``6. Notwithstanding action on a first degree amendment, it \n     shall not be in order for a Senator to offer a second degree \n     amendment to his or her own first degree amendment.''.\n        (b) The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect \n     at the beginning of the 111th Congress.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsummary of the statements of Senators Reid, Durbin, and Dodd be printed \nin the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sen. Reid (NV)--talking to a new Senator in the chair, \n     ``she should have seen when the Republicans were in the \n     majority. We didn't have amendments. They filled every \n     tree.'' 2/6/07 (Tues.) Iraq debate\n       Sen. Reid (NV)--Speaking in defense of a fellow Democrat's \n     ability to offer amendments to the Patriot Act \n     reauthorization: ``Of course even a good bill can be \n     improved. That is why we have an amendment process in the \n     Senate . . . I am disappointed that he has been denied that \n     opportunity by a procedural maneuver known as `filling the \n     amendment tree.' This is a very bad practice. It runs against \n     the basic nature of the Senate. The hallmark of the Senate is \n     free speech and open debate. Rule [twenty-two] XXII \n     establishes a process for cutting off debate and amendments, \n     but Rule XXII should rarely be invoked before any amendments \n     have been offered . . . I will vote against cloture to \n     register my objection to this flawed process.'' 2/28/06 \n     Patriot Act Reauthorization\n       Sen. Reid (NV)--``Don't fill the tree . . . That is a bad \n     way, in my opinion, to run this Senate.'' 3/2/06 Patriot Act\n       Sen. Durbin--Speaking about the 2005 Tax Reconciliation \n     conference report: ``The Republican majority brings a bill to \n     the Senate, fills the tree so no amendments can be offered, \n     and then files cloture, which stops debate. So we cannot have \n     this conversation. We cannot offer other amendments.'' 5/11/\n     06 Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 \n     Conf. Rept.\n       Sen. Dodd--Speaking about healthcare legislation: ``I want \n     to point out to our colleagues why I am terribly disappointed \n     with the procedures we have been confronted with this evening \n     dealing with this legislation . . .

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy letter of January 10 to Senator Reid, which notes identical records \nto the other leaders in the House and Senate, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Harry: In light of the significant problems caused to \n     so many entities funded by the federal government to operate \n     under a continuing resolution, I urge the leaders of both \n     Houses and the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the \n     Appropriations Committees of both Houses to bring the \n     unfinished Appropriation bills for fiscal year 2007 to the \n     floors of the House and Senate as early this year as \n     possible.\n       The extraordinary problems caused for so many entities are \n     typified by a letter which I received yesterday from Chief \n     Judge Paul Michel of the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Federal Circuit. With this letter, I am enclosing a copy \n     of Judge Michel's letter. I am also enclosing a copy of a \n     memorandum prepared by my Staff Director on Appropriations, \n     Bettilou Taylor, itemizing some of the major problems faced \n     by federally-funded entities.\n       Last year, I tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to have my \n     Subcommittee's bill on Labor, Health & Human Services and \n     Education brought to the Senate floor for action. My House \n     counterpart, Chairman Ralph Regula, and I were prepared to \n     conclude our bill and wrap it up in a conference report. We \n     could still do so on short order. As an alternative to \n     considering the bills individually, there could obviously be \n     an omnibus bill excluding earmarks which could be taken up in \n     relatively short order.\n       I know there is other pressing business to be taken up by \n     both Houses on many matters, but we could find time to \n     complete action on key items from last year's appropriation \n     process if we have a sense of urgency to do so.\n       I appreciate your consideration of this request.\n       I am sending identical letters to Speaker Pelosi, \n     Representative Boehner, Senator McConnell, Chairman Byrd, \n     Chairman Obey, Representative Lewis and Senator Cochran.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom Judge Paul Michel to me, dated December 18, about the problems \ncaused to the Federal judiciary to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit, which was referenced in my letter to Senator Reid and \nothers, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\n\n                                             U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n\n                                      for the Federal Circuit,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Arlen: With the new Congressional leadership \n     suggesting a Continuing Resolution at the 2006 appropriated \n     level, the Judiciary is threatened with degradation of \n     essential functions because of increased costs mandated by \n     law. Thus, the funding level of 2006 applied in 2007 has the \n     effect of nearly a ten percent reduction.\n       Although the Judiciary can and should improve efficiency \n     and do its share of belt-tightening, the funding reduction \n     suggested would impede critical operations to a material \n     degree.\n       As your own proposals on habeas corpus, NSA wire taps, \n     immigration and other priorities illustrate, federal courts \n     are becoming not less but more important to the welfare of \n     the country and to its security.\n       I imagine the new leaders are so focused on eliminating \n     earmarks that they are unaware of the operational impact of \n     the cuts being discussed. In addition to the Appropriations \n     Committee and subcommittees, surely the Judiciary Committee \n     has a crucial role here. As a member of the Executive \n     Committee of the Judicial Conference, I would welcome the \n     opportunity to brief you and Senator Leahy on this urgent \n     subject.\n           Best,\n                                                   Paul R. Michel,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Preliminary draft, subject to additional review and revision.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I know my \ncolleagues are waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1766-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1766-S1771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I want to speak very briefly about the \nresolution pending, H.J. Res. 20, the resolution that is funding the \nGovernment for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n  I particularly want to talk about the veterans health care issues in \nthis continuing resolution. This is not a perfect solution to the \nproblem of funding our Government going forward. Nevertheless, it is, I \nbelieve, an equitable and fiscally responsible approach, particularly \nsince we are trying to address the failure of the leadership in the \nlast Congress to pass all the appropriations bills.\n  We are in a very difficult position where this continuing resolution \nwill get us through this fiscal year and allow us to begin to work on \nthe following year 2008 fiscal year appropriations bills and budget so \nwe can take all of those in regular order and hopefully pass them all \nby the end of this fiscal year, which would be September 30. The \ncontinuing resolution we are discussing today freezes the level of \nspending at most agencies at fiscal year 2006 levels, while at the same \ntime increasing funding for priorities such as caring for our Nation's \nveterans. This is one of the key priorities Senator Byrd and others \ninsisted upon. Frankly, I want to commend Senator Byrd for his \nleadership, as well as other members of the Appropriations Committee, \nfor bringing this continuing resolution to the floor.\n  The resolution before the Senate would make veterans funding a \npriority by adding $3.6 billion above the fiscal year 2006 appropriated \nlevels for the VA health care system. This is one of the few areas \nwhere there is a substantial growth in spending, and it is appropriate. \nIf we do not take care of our veterans, then we are breaking a trust \nthat they established by serving valiantly in the uniform of the United \nStates, and we are sending a very bad signal to those young men and \nwomen who serve today. We honor their sacrifice by taking care of \ntoday's veterans, and certainly giving them the confidence that they \nwill be taken care of in the future.\n  The VA estimates it will treat 219,000 more patients in fiscal year \n2007 than it did in fiscal year 2006. So obviously they need the \nincreased resources. The VA estimates it will have 4.2 million more \noutpatient visits this year than it did in fiscal year 2006, and the \nVeterans' Administration estimates it will treat almost 26,000 more \npatients on an inpatient basis this year than it did last year. For \nmedical services and administration not provided, this increase would \nmean that the VA would be short more than $250 million a month--not \ntotal but $250 million a month--in funding for critical medical \nservices, leaving the VA with little\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nchoice but to push out waiting times, defer maintenance, and put off \npurchasing new equipment.\n\n  Included in this $3.6 billion increase is an additional $271 million \nfor medical facilities. First-rate medical facilities are essential to \ndeliver first-rate health care services to our veterans. The additional \nfunding will ensure that leaky roofs and broken pipes will be fixed in \na timely fashion. It also means there will be no disruption in food and \ndietetic services for veterans seeking inpatient care at any of our VA \nmedical centers throughout the Nation.\n  These are not designed to scare veterans or the American people, that \nthe VA was close to facing some of these maintenance problems and some \nof these basic problems of feeding veterans at hospitals. That is the \nreality unless we act today. That is why it is so essential that we not \nonly increase this funding for the Veterans' Administration but we also \npass this continuing resolution in a timely fashion.\n  We don't need to look too far back in history to see what \nshortchanges at the VA would mean. This Senate stood united on both \nsides of the aisle a year and a half ago when the administration's poor \nactuarial modeling and budget created a shortfall of almost $3 billion. \nIt was the Congress that responded. If we do not pass this resolution, \nwhich includes the needed additional funding for the Veterans' \nAdministration health care system, we will have no one to blame but \nourselves for this shortfall.\n  I don't think we can face veterans and active soldiers and say we did \nnot pass this budget, this continuing resolution. That is why the \nresolution made veterans the No. 1 priority. They have defended this \ncountry bravely, honorably, and at a minimum we owe them this increase.\n  I thank Chairman Byrd for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to \nswiftly pass this measure so we can continue to serve those veterans \nwho have served this country so well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I applaud the Senator from Rhode Island, \nmy colleague, someone committed to standing up for what our veterans \nneed. My hope is that we are not only fixing roofs in the future but we \nare actually updating facilities that need to be updated to be able to \nhandle the increasing veterans population. Many of those facilities are \nin my State of North Carolina.\n  I take somewhat of an objection to something he stated--that we are \nhere today because of our lack of moving these bills in the last \nCongress. This Senate requires tremendous bipartisan support. Without \nthat bipartisan support, things come to a screeching halt. That is what \nhappened last year. It was described as an election. There were some \nwho did not want to see an appropriations process happen.\n  As a matter of fact, it happened some time ago in this Senate, when \nthe majority and the minority were in different positions, when the \nmajority came in and was handed the appropriations bills. We were in \nthe majority. I wasn't here, but my understanding is that they went \nthrough days, if not weeks, of amendments. They came up with an omnibus \nbill. That is not what we did here.\n  We are headed into 2007, the 110th Congress, but what was the action? \nThe action today was that the majority leader came to the Senate and \noffered the resolution, filled the amendment tree, filed cloture, and \nwent off the bill. We are debating this in morning business. We are not \ndebating it as part of the resolution.\n  Now, I correct my dear friend, Senator Specter, from Pennsylvania. He \nsaid no amendments would be offered. In fact, there were two amendments \noffered. They were offered by the majority leader. The first one was at \nthe end of the resolution, this multipage document, add the following:\n\n       This division shall take effect two days after the \n     enactment.\n\n  And then he filed a second-degree amendment that said: In the \namendment strike 2 and insert 1.\n  Not a lot of substance to that amendment. Not much at all. As a \nmatter of fact, it is hard to find someone here who can actually state \nwhat it means. And grammatically, what he has done is he has now \nchanged the amendment to say: This division will take effect ``one \ndays'' after date of enactment. That is how much attention the majority \nleader spent on his own amendments.\n  Now, the fact that he did this, what does it do to the rest of us? It \nmeans we cannot offer amendments. It means that for those who are \nconcerned with the BRAC process--which is a transformation of our \nmilitary in the United States; it is a consolidation of our base \nstructure; it is putting the right people at the right place, training \nfor the right thing, so that America can be safer based upon new \nthreats--what does it do? It doesn't fund any of it.\n  Here is a process that is supposed to be complete by 2011, and in \n2007 we are going to fund none of what BRAC called for in the \nlegislation passed by this body. In North Carolina, that is $300 \nmillion to Fort Bragg alone. That money was to build barracks, a \nvehicle maintenance shop for the 4th Brigade Combat Team, and a \nmultipurpose training range. Without these funds, none of that will be \ncompleted.\n  As a matter of fact, I can say, just like my colleagues who came to \nthe Senate floor, that our military bases are everyone's; they do not \nbelong just to the States in which they are located. Our military \nleadership, our soldiers, our military families have begun this \nmultiyear process to meet the requirements that Congress has given to \nthem in the legislation we passed, and now we have done it without the \nfunding. We risk not only placing communities and bases in disarray, \nbut we will delay vitally needed transformation in our military.\n\n  I don't understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncan look the American people in the eye, tell them they support our \nsons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters overseas, \nand simultaneously refuse to add the critical funds needed to take care \nof those very same troops--their families, their children, their \nhusbands, their wives, their children--here at home. But the actions of \nthe majority leader have, in fact, accomplished just that because there \nis not an opportunity for me, or for Senator Hutchison, who is the \nranking member on the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on \nMilitary Construction, to offer an amendment--one that would be \noverwhelmingly accepted. But if you allow one, potentially you have to \nallow another.\n  Fort Bliss, TX, which is scheduled to absorb 17,000 soldiers and \n10,000 family members under BRAC, is losing $463 million because \nCongress did not fund it in this continuing resolution. Fort Benning, \nGA--$300 million that was going for barracks for the troops and a \nbrigade training complex.\n  What does this mean? It means that as we try to bring troops back in \nfrom Germany and other bases around the world--we have made a \ndetermination we do not need to forward-deploy like that--we can bring \nthem back on our soil. They can be with their families in neighborhoods \nwhere they can feel like a part of the community instead of on foreign \nland where only the base is considered United States territory. It \nmeans we are going to have to keep them there, or we will have to bring \nthem back here but not have the housing for them. I have gone through \nthat in Fort Bragg. I have had 18- and 19-year-old soldiers living in \n1950s era barracks, and the Congress, in their infinite wisdom, was \nable to fund the type of housing that was needed at Fort Bragg and many \nother installations.\n  Now, at a time when we have already planned for these families and \nthese troops to come back, what does Congress say? I am sorry, we will \nnot fund it in this bill? We are going to wait until 2008, and then it \nmay or may not be funded? Maybe that is an objective on someone's part \nto try to knock BRAC off and to not have this consolidation. If it is, \nthey have to question the decisions made by our military leaders and \nagreed to by Congress that said this is in our long-term best interest. \nIt doesn't end with the discussion on BRAC, as sorry as I am to see a \nprocess that excludes our ability to effect the funding that is needed \nfor military construction and for the base realignment and closure \nprocess.\n  Late last year, in the last week this Congress was in session in the \n109th Congress, we passed what I thought was one of the most important \npieces of legislation the 109th Congress dealt\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nwith. It dealt with the threat we are faced with from chemical, \nbiological, radiological and nuclear threats, naturally produced, \nintentional, or accidental. It dealt with things such as anthrax and \nsmallpox, Ebola and Marburg. We were challenged to try to revamp our \nentire structure of countermeasure research and development in this \ncountry, and I daresay by unanimous consent in the Senate and in the \nHouse of Representatives we passed that important bill, one that \nidentified the problems we had in America but, more importantly, the \nproblems we had with our ability to take basic research, in many cases \nfunded by companies or by the National Institutes of Health, and to \nconvert that basic research into a countermeasure, a vaccine, an \nantiviral that would give us the security of being able to look at the \nAmerican people and say: If terrorists get ahold of anthrax, don't \nworry, we have something to protect you. We have a vaccine we can give \nyou. If, by chance, Marburg, a disease, gets out of Africa, we have a \ncountermeasure we can give to you if, in fact, you are infected.\n  We were able to create this new entity which actually put the Federal \nGovernment in a position where we have facilitated the \ncommercialization of that basic research, where we did not rely on only \n1 company out of 100 to succeed because somehow they were able to go \ninto the private marketplace and find enough money to make it through \nthis challenging drug and vaccine development and approval process \ndesigned in America. We created the Biomedical Advanced Research and \nDevelopment Authority, referred to as BARDA. BARDA was the structure at \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. It was a structure that \nwas under development for 2 years in Congress--enough time that \nsunlight was brought to every piece of it. I daresay it was one of the \nmost open processes this Senate has seen in some time. Members had the \nopportunity to address every word of every sentence of every paragraph \nof the bill. At the end of the day, they were convinced it was the \nright piece of legislation, and it was passed into law.\n  There is only one problem. We have it in place now, and the \ncontinuing resolution doesn't fund it. Yes, $160 million was intended \nto be in the appropriations bills to kick start BARDA, to allow this \nstructure to be set up under a new Assistant Secretary for Preparedness \nand Response and to begin to sort through the research being done at \nacademic institutions across the country, small pharmaceutical \ncompanies, biotechnology companies, big PhRMA and to get them all to \nparticipate because for the first time they knew what the rules were.\n  We added a number of biological agents to our threat list. That is a \nfunction the Secretary of Homeland Security does on a regular basis as \nwe see new threats arise. When we increase the size of that threat \nlist, that means somebody has the responsibility in the Federal \nGovernment to begin an intense research and development process to try \nto create a countermeasure for it. One would think at a time when we \njust doubled the size of that potential list of threats that it would \nbe high on the priority list of the Congress of the United States to \nfund the only mechanism we have to actually create the countermeasures. \nBut, no, in this particular continuing resolution, it is minus the $160 \nmillion to fund BARDA.\n  Even worse than that, there is no opportunity in this process to \noffer an amendment to a bill that 100 percent of the Senators present \nthat day voted for, that the House voted unanimously for and the \nPresident signed into law just last December.\n\n  On one side, we put our soldiers and their families on hold. To some \ndegree, we put on hold the plans of our military leaders. On the other \nside, we recognize the threats we face from people who want to do bad \nthings and from Mother Nature. We understand the responsibilities we \nhave to prepare these countermeasures, these vaccines, these antivirals \nfor the entire population, and we still cannot fund it. I guess we are \nnot having the debate because we know it would become law, it would be \nfunded. And if it was funded, then we would break the caps, so we would \nhave to find somewhere else to get the money.\n  I was willing to come to the floor and propose some ways to get the \nmoney or to propose to my colleagues that I thought it was important \nenough that we break the cap by $160 million, which I seldom do on this \nfloor. This is in the face of not only the threats we know about, but \nit is also the threat of pandemic flu. It is those natural things such \nas pandemic flu that we cannot look down the road and know what is \naround the corner. But if we have the right mechanism in place and if \nit works and if it is tested, we can respond in an expeditious way and \nbegin to have those things we think are so important for the American \npeople.\n  BRAC will not be settled in this continuing resolution. We will put \nour military on hold. We will put the changes on hold. If that has an \neffect on our tempo--even at a time we are at war--I guess some have \nmade a decision that is the way it is. As it relates to bioterrorism, \nchemical, biologic, radiological, even pandemic flu, we put that on \nhold, too, because we are not going to fund the creation of the \nproject.\n  We did all that because of two amendments--two amendments--that were \noffered by the majority leader: ``At the end of the resolution add the \nfollowing; this division shall take effect 2 days after date of \nenactment,'' and followed up by a secondary amendment that says, ``In \nthe amendment strike 2 and insert 1.'' Now we have an amendment that \nsays--or a law that says--this division shall take effect ``1 days'' \nafter enactment--clearly, no thought. It is a nice way of shutting us \nout from offering amendments.\n  I do not think the plan for this bill was to set a host of unlimited \namendments. As a matter of fact, I hope and I believe we will finish \nthe continuing resolution before the 15th, which is the date the \nFederal Government's money runs out. There is no scare or threat the \nFederal Government is going to run out of money and shut down. I think \nevery Member is committed to do that. I am, too.\n  But I think it is important that we come down and talk about the \nthings we left out but, more importantly, that we point out to \neverybody the fact that we were not even given the opportunity to put \nthem back in, that when we denied the ability of Members of the Senate \nto consider changes to a bill--much less not have a vote--we have cut \nthe American people out of the process, we have cut out the people who \nsend us here to represent them. Sometimes they like it, sometimes they \ndo not, but they expect us to take a position.\n  Well, that is what could have happened with two very valuable \namendments, two that I believe would have overwhelmingly been accepted. \nWould it cause a little difficulty on our part trying to figure out \nwhere to take the money from? Probably so. But right now, in the scope \nof everything we are faced with, I cannot think of two more important \nthings for us to have in this continuing resolution than to fund the \ntroops, their families, their housing, their daycare, their schools, \nand to allow this transition in our military to take place as it \nrelates to the consolidation of our bases around the world.\n  I certainly cannot think of anything that gets very much higher on \nthe priority list than to make sure we have the vaccines, the \ncountermeasures, the antivirals one might need if, Heaven forbid, we \nwere ever attacked using chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear \nweapons or, in fact, Mother Nature is just so mean to us. In fact, the \nthreat is so extensive to our country, we need to be prepared.\n  We could be there. We will not be there, but we could. And it is all \nbecause of the choices that were used to move this bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her indulgence, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, when we convened here in January, we had an \nunprecedented meeting of the new Members of the U.S. Senate, both \nRepublican and Democratic, in the Old Supreme Court Chamber where the \nSenate used to meet. There were a lot of very nice speeches by the new \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, and by the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, about efforts at bipartisan cooperation. I think those were \nwelcomed by all of us and I think welcomed by the American people as \nwell because, frankly, I think\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nthey believe--and I think they are right--sometimes there is too much \nemphasis put on party and not enough emphasis put on the well-being and \nthe welfare of the American people at large.\n  Well, we had a good start. We started out on ethics and lobbying \nreform. As you will recall, we initially had a vote to close off \ndebate, and we got over that minor hurdle after that cloture motion \nlost and we were able to shape a bill that got the support of an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of the Senate on lobbying and ethics \nreform. So that was a good start.\n  Then we moved on to the minimum wage and small business tax and \nregulatory relief. And we had, I guess, another period of testing \nthere, people trying to figure out what all this new majority and new \nminority meant and how we might work together. Lo and behold, we got \nthrough that in a bipartisan way, and we passed a minimum wage bill, \nwith small business tax and regulatory relief that, again, I think we \ncould all look at and say: I don't agree with 100 percent of it, but on \nbalance this is a good bill. This is the kind of thing we ought to be \ndoing together.\n\n  Well, I would say that notwithstanding that good start--and I think \nit was a good start--we have stumbled a little bit in recent days. We \nsee a resolution on the Iraq war where we have requested the \nopportunity to present alternatives that reflect the diversity of views \nin the Senate. Yet the majority leader, in his wisdom, decided we were \nnot going to have an opportunity to vote on those different views, some \nof which are espoused by his own caucus. So we are not able to get to a \nvote on any of those resolutions--yet. I predict they will come back. \nWe will be back on those issues. The issue itself is not going to go \naway. We are going to have plenty of opportunities to vote on whether \nwe are going to support our troops and the mission we have called upon \nthem to do.\n  But, here again, we have stumbled again on this continuing \nresolution. It is not, as we all know, technically speaking, a \ncontinuing resolution, which would be to continue the spending at \nlevels of 2006 into the 2007 year. This is really what would probably \nmore properly be called an Omnibus appropriations bill. Rather than \nbreaking things down into their constituent parts and passing, let's \nsay, a Department of Defense bill, a Labor, Health and Human Services \nbill, and different appropriations bills, this is one big, huge, \nappropriations bill and I think most appropriately called Omnibus \nappropriations.\n  Although I will correct myself. I think this is really--if I had to \ngive it a name, I would call it an ``Ominous'' appropriations bill. The \nreason I say that is for the reason that has been pointed out by a \nnumber of our colleagues today. What it does is it demonstrates an \nunwillingness to provide the financial resources necessary for our \nmilitary during a time of war. And I think that is ominous. I hope it \ndoes not give us a foretaste of the future, when we have seen our \nmilitary underfunded at times and resulting in a later effort to try to \ncatch up.\n  I remember the Secretary of the Department of Defense, Secretary \nGates, just a couple days ago, in the Armed Services Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, said: Do you know what. We would accept a lower \nlevel of funding if it was kept relatively constant so we could \nactually plan rather than have the spikes and the valleys, the changes \nfrom year to year, from appropriations bill to appropriations bill.\n  But my point is, this bill, by cutting $3.1 billion from our military \nduring a time of war, is simply penny-wise and pound-foolish. I may be \ntoo generous when I say it is penny-wise because the money that is \nactually cut from the military is then distributed through a variety of \nother programs, which means in the end, when we pay the bill, which we \nultimately will have to pay, we are going to add to the debt rather \nthan--and we have seen $3.1 billion in new spending that could not \notherwise be done without cutting the military--but causing us problems \nby exacerbating a deficit that none of us would like to see compounded.\n  But I want to mention--because I just met with MG Robert Lennox, who \nis the commanding general at Fort Bliss in El Paso, TX--El Paso will, \nas a result of this last Base Realignment and Closure Commission, \nreceive an additional 20,000 new uniformed servicemembers and about \n25,000 in addition to that, for a total of 45,000 people, including the \nfamily members who will move there. The $3.1 billion that was cut from \nthis bill will have a direct impact on General Lennox's ability to \nbuild the infrastructure necessary to accommodate those 45,000 \nservicemembers and their families in El Paso, TX.\n  It also will have an impact on places around Texas such as Camp \nBullis where an Armed Forces Reserve Center is in jeopardy; places at \nFort Sam Houston, which is a principal location for Army medicine; \nplaces such as Grand Prairie; Seagoville; Fort Worth Joint Reserve \nBase; Carswell Air Base; Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, my \nhometown; Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, TX; and Randolph Air \nForce Base, also in San Antonio, TX.\n  All of those various programs to try to build the infrastructure and \naccommodate this Base Realignment and Closure Commission are in some \njeopardy, and it is because our colleagues, the leadership on the other \nside, has determined that, without an opportunity for amendment, \nwithout an opportunity to vote on alternatives, we are going to take \n$3.1 billion from the military and give it to other programs and \nprojects.\n  The problem we have in an All-Volunteer military is that we depend \nnot only on our ability to recruit service members but also to retain \nthose service members in our All-Volunteer military. And, of course, \nquality of life issues are very important--housing, various facilities. \nOf course, I mentioned this earlier today, but the saying goes: You \nrecruit a servicemember, you recruit an individual, but you retain a \nfamily because it is important we provide the services to sort of \ncushion the sacrifices that so many family members make when their \nloved one is serving in our Armed Forces.\n  I am disappointed to see what started out as laudable efforts at \nbipartisan cooperation in the way we craft legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate sort of degenerate into partisan railroading of important \nlegislation. I fear what will happen is, when we come back to the \nsupplemental appropriations bills that will be necessary to fund our \nmilitary, we will then, out of these emergency supplemental \nappropriations, try to make up for this $3.1 billion.\n  The only difference is that it will result in $3.1 billion in new \nspending rather than the required offsets that would be necessary to \nmaintain fiscal responsibility. An amendment that the senior Senator \nfrom Texas and I have cosponsored, along with others, would provide \nsuch an offset. And if allowed to have a vote on that amendment, for \nless than a three-quarters of 1 percent, across-the-board cut in this \nOmnibus appropriations bill, exclusive of defense spending, we could \nrestore the complete $3.1 billion that this current Omnibus \nappropriations bill cuts. We could tell our men and women in the \nmilitary that we not only appreciate and support them but actually back \nthat up with real action and a real financial commitment to make sure \nthey have what they need.\n  I am disappointed that after we got off to such a good start in terms \nof bipartisan cooperation, we find ourselves now where the majority \nparty is attempting to dictate the terms of this Omnibus appropriations \nbill, without any input, without any opportunity for votes on any \namendments that some of us believe are in the best interests of the \nmilitary and in the best interests of the country. It represents an \nunfortunate and unwelcome development.\n  In the end, I predict the new majority will learn what the old \nmajority learned, that no single party gets to dictate how things \nhappen around here because of the 60-vote requirement to close off \ndebate. The magic number, of course, for the majority is 60. The magic \nnumber for the minority is 41. That gives us the power we need to get a \nseat at the table. But it is clear that the majority leader has made a \ncalculation that he can pass this legislation without any contribution, \nany amendments, any opportunity to vote on important amendments. \nUnfortunately, not only is the kind of bipartisan cooperation we \nstarted off with during the first month we have been here in January \nthe loser, I am afraid as a result of this ill-advised cut in our \nmilitary that our military is the loser as well.\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to address my serious concern \nabout our consideration of H.J. Res. 20, an Omnibus appropriations \nmeasure, rather than completing our work on the remaining 2007 \nappropriations bills. As my colleagues are well aware, fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations expired on September 30, 2006. And with the exception of \nthe Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, the Federal \nGovernment is currently operating on its third temporary continuing \nresolution set to expire next week. We are now considering a fourth \ncontinuing resolution, H.J. Res. 20, to fund the Government through the \nend of the fiscal year.\n  Passage of a continuing appropriations resolution, as some have \nincorrectly labeled it, is not the solution to our outstanding \nappropriations obligations. This de facto Omnibus appropriations bill \ncovers almost 50 percent of the Federal discretionary budget at a cost \nof $463.5 billion. Repeatedly managing by continuing resolution, as we \nhave done for nearly half a year, is inherently wasteful and \ninefficient. It results in wasteful spending, disruption and chaos in \nthe operations of Federal programs, and dramatic productivity \nslowdowns. So many of our agencies have been in limbo during the last \nseveral months.\n  In recent years, many Federal departments have taken positive steps \ntoward streamlining their budgets and tightening the reins of their \ndaily operations, conduct that ought to be rewarded. Instead, when \nCongress failed to complete its appropriations work on time, these \ndepartments were forced to put critical projects on hold.\n  Such a funding shortfall has particularly adverse effects on human-\ncapital-intensive agencies, such as the Government Accountability \nOffice where attracting and retaining good employees is critical to \nrunning a competitive and productive organization. Agencies such as the \nGAO have made it clear that without budget certainty, they risk losing \ntop-quality personnel. They are unable to properly recognize and reward \nindividuals for good service which often pushes employees to look for \nother nongovernment opportunities.\n  For too long we have allowed a negative perception of Government \nworkers to dominate our thinking, and we have not committed the \nnecessary resources to funding and keeping capable, hard-working civil \nservants. This human capital problem contributes to a negative \nperception of the Federal Government, and it prevents important \ndepartments and agencies from providing their customers, our \nconstituents, with the necessary goods and services they deserve.\n  Just think of somebody who is thinking about coming to work for the \nFederal Government and they have heard that we haven't been able to \npass a budget or appropriations around here for 5 months. What kind of \nan organization do they think we are?\n  This added pressure on human capital is not limited to the GAO. In \nfact, there are lots of similar agencies, such as the SEC, the FBI, and \nthe IRS, which experienced the same problem over these past 5 months. \nThere are going to be horror stories all through this year as a result \nof the fact that we are going to pass a continuing resolution or an \nomnibus resolution.\n  Additionally, long-term budget uncertainty caused many companies with \nGovernment contracts to lay off people. Our inability to complete the \nappropriations work prevented agencies and departments from adequately \nplanning programs and ultimately interfered with the timely award of \ncontracts. So for the past 5 months, contractors have been uncertain \nwhether work would be available and were forced to put a freeze on \nhiring. I understand that.\n\n  Two years ago, I had a nephew working for a company that had a \ncontract with NASA. They said: They haven't passed the budget. They \nlaid everybody off. And it wasn't until several months later that \nfinally they could bring people back on. By that time, they had lost \nhalf their people.\n  Sometimes programs are ineffective, and their budgets should be \nreduced or eliminated. For example, under the normal appropriations \nprocess, the House would have terminated 53 programs, for a savings of \n$4 billion. Well, an omnibus can reduce the budget, but it goes about \nit in entirely the wrong fashion. Instead of undergoing negotiations \nand discussions over the individual merit of specific programs, the \nomnibus indiscriminately cuts and appropriates funds. This is neither a \nthoughtful nor responsible approach to managing our budget.\n  On the flip side, there are many programs and agencies in which we \nought to be investing more resources. By failing to pass the \noutstanding appropriations bills and by passing an omnibus bill \ninstead, we are ignoring America's infrastructure which is the \nfoundation of our economy. Our physical infrastructure is a critical \ncomponent of making America more competitive and maintaining our \nquality of life for future generations. But if we keep up this attitude \ntoward our fiscal obligations, if we continue ignoring the upkeep of \nour infrastructure, we risk tremendous disruptions to our commerce and \ndecrease protection against natural disasters. Hurricane Katrina was a \nwake-up call for all of us and makes the point. Had we completed our \nappropriations work on time and adequately funded the Army Corps of \nEngineers, we would have been attending to the needs of the country. \nFor nearly half a year, we could have brought in more civil engineers, \nincreased construction, designed stronger levees, and made real \nprogress on improving water infrastructure. Instead, we are 5 months \nbehind in the construction of our infrastructure and even further \nbehind keeping our Nation competitive and safe.\n  What about our dependence on foreign sources of energy. I still \nbelieve one of this Nation's most pressing challenges is reforming our \nnational energy policy. Finding a way to harmonize our energy, \neconomic, and environmental concerns is critical to keeping our Nation \nstrong. I know my colleagues here today agree with me that we need a \nsecond declaration of independence and that we must invest in new, \nalternative forms of energy. This body failed to complete its \nappropriations work on time, and now we have uncertainty at a critical \nmoment when we are trying to free ourselves from entanglements in the \nMiddle East and increase our competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  If we had funded the appropriations in the routine manner 5 months \nago, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could have been preparing for \nthe estimated eight applications it expects to receive this year from \nthe nuclear energy industry for the construction of new nuclear \nreactors. Let me add the NRC anticipates receiving an additional 22 \napplications next year. They have been furiously working to prepare for \nthis tidal wave of construction which requires hiring an additional 300 \nor more people. They haven't been able to do it because the budget \nhasn't been there because we have been fiddle-faddling around over \nhere.\n  Yet our failure to act has delayed this process. It has introduced \nuncertainty for both the NRC and the nuclear energy industry at a time \nwhen we cannot afford to be dependent on foreign sources of oil. Our \ninability to fulfill our fiscal responsibilities has put the NRC 5 \nmonths behind in preparation, and it has put the country behind on the \nroad to energy independence.\n  It is not just the Federal Government that suffers. States, counties, \ncities all depend on funding from Washington. I was a county \ncommissioner. A part of our budget was the Federal budget. I was mayor \nof Cleveland. Part of our budget was Federal money coming into the \ncity. All of these local governments, State governments right now have \nbeen in limbo trying to figure out when we are going to do our job.\n  Maintaining and improving America's transportation system is also \nvital to our economy, the environment, and the welfare of the American \npeople. The Interstate Highway System is one of the country's greatest \npublic works projects but requires a Federal investment. States plan \ntheir highway construction programs for the coming year based on their \nanticipated Federal funding set by SAFETEA-LU. By failing to pass the \n2007 Transportation appropriations bill, States could not plan for the \nfuture and were forced to delay construction projects for the upcoming \nyear.\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\n  I will get a report on that from around the country on all the \nprojects that are going to be delayed because we didn't do our work or \nthat are not going to move forward.\n  In my State of Ohio, for instance, construction costs and increased \ninflation forced our Department of Transportation to cancel and \npostpone nearly $450 million in highway projects. They didn't know what \nthey were going to get.\n  Democrats have a right to point fingers at Republicans for failing to \ncomplete their work on the outstanding appropriations before December. \nBut let's be clear, Democrats behaved equally poorly when they lost the \nmajority in 2002. At that time, Majority Leader Daschle was unable to \npass a budget for 2003. Subsequently, Democrats did not complete their \nwork on appropriations before going home for the winter recess. When we \ncame back in January 2003, we took up the issue of appropriations \nwithin 3 days. We passed three continuing resolutions through February \n20, at which point the Senate voted on an omnibus bill, much the same \nas we are doing today.\n  The fact is, we both have dirty hands. This is not just a Democratic \nor Republican issue. Both parties have acted irresponsibly. Congress \nhas the power of the purse, but we are not the best steward of the \ntaxpayers' money if time and time again we blindly pass omnibus bills \nand fund programs without accounting for how those programs are \nperforming.\n  These are not isolated instances. Let me point out--and the public \nshould know--in 25 of the past 30 years, Congress has failed to enact \nall the appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year. In fact, \nthe last time Congress enacted appropriations bills by the September 30 \ndeadline was 1997. And for 17 of the past 30 years, Congress has had to \ncombine two or more appropriations bills together in omnibus and \nminibus legislation. When are we planning to get it done on time? By \nfailing to do our job, we are starving the executive branch of \nGovernment and preventing it from doing its job. This is irresponsible.\n  One way around this annual appropriations problem is to convert the \nannual budget cycle into a biennial or 2-year cycle. This would save \nCongress valuable time eaten up every year debating appropriations \nmatters. We spend most of our time on agency appropriations, on the \nbudget, and no time on oversight. Under biennial budgeting, we would \nconvert the annual budget, appropriations, and authorizing processes \ninto a 2-year cycle. The first year would be reserved for the budget \nand appropriations process. The second year would be to conduct \noversight and pass authorizing legislation. This would leave Congress \nmore time to examine programs to determine which are wasteful, which \nshould receive more funding and which should be terminated altogether. \nCongress would have more time to finish its business by the deadline \nthe law imposes.\n  A 2-year budget proposal is long overdue. We have been talking about \nthis since I came to the Senate in 1999, Senator Domenici and I and \nmany others. We ought to reintroduce that bill. In fact, I intend to \nreintroduce that bill with several of my colleagues to see if we can't \ngo to a 2-year budget cycle.\n  Operating without a budget impacts our effectiveness in fighting the \nwar on terror. It affects our ability to maintain and improve our \ntransportation infrastructure and enhance our education system. You \nwill be hearing more about that from Senator Alexander. It further \ncontributes to the public perception that Congress has no appreciation \nof the importance of management and the impact of our irresponsible \nconduct on the delivery of services to the people in the States--our \nconstituents. It is incredible to me, as someone who has been a mayor \nand Governor, that the Senate has not completed its appropriations \nwork.\n  In Ohio, the law mandated that we complete our appropriations \nresponsibilities by the end of the year. And it was the same way when I \nwas mayor of the city of Cleveland. The city charter mandated that we \ndo our work. If we had not completed our budget and appropriations \nwork, we would have been reprimanded by the media roundly and recalled \nby the voters. Of course, we were also bound to balance our budget, \nwhich this body has been unable to do since 2000.\n\n  We have been on the path of fiscal irresponsibility for too long. \nGiven the facts, it is an indication to the American people that we are \nnot doing our job, our work. Congress may hold the power of the purse, \nbut we undermine our credibility by starving good managers and agencies \nof necessary resources and by turning a blind eye to failing programs. \nThis is about more than allocating funds, it is about good management \nand good public policy.\n  All of us, on a bipartisan basis, should pledge that we will not \nshirk our responsibilities by passing a de facto omnibus piece of \nlegislation. As important, at this stage of the game, we should vow, \nall of us--the majority leader and our minority leader should come \ntogether on the floor of the Senate and pledge to the American people \nthat we are going to pass our budget, and we are going to get our \nappropriations done by the deadline we are supposed to have it be done \nby, so next year we are not repeating the same thing we have this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. We are now in \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1771-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1771-S1772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, no Member of the Senate has more \nexperience in various levels of government than the Senator from Ohio, \nSenator Voinovich, who just spoke. He was a commissioner, a mayor, a \nlieutenant Governor, a Governor, and a Senator. Since he has come here, \nno Senator has spent more time on the drudgery--some Senators would \nsay--of understanding the operations of government, how the budget \ndecisions we make affect different parts of the Federal Government, \ndifferent parts of society, the State and local governments, and how \nthe civil service system works, how employees are fairly treated. I \nsalute the Senator for his work.\n  I think we ought to hear him carefully when he reminds us of one of \nthe most obvious solutions to that problem, the 2-year budget. That \nidea has broad support in this Chamber, and it is a very simple idea. \nIt says we will make our budget every 2 years. If we have to make \nadjustments in the odd year, we can do that. We already do that from \ntime to time, but then in the intervening year, we would have plenty of \ntime to look over our programs, make sure they work, and perhaps repeal \nsome of them and add some better ones and check the stacks of \nregulations. If you look at all of the regulations that small colleges \nin Ohio and Tennessee have to wade through every year, that stack is \nvery high. I brought them down on the floor one time. Surely, we can \nget rid of those. On both sides of the aisle we would like to do that. \nOur process doesn't appear that way. As our Republican whip sometimes \nsays, process is often substance in the Senate, and a 2-year budget \nwould be a force for orderliness, a force for review of programs; it \nwould cause us to repeal and change and revise laws.\n  We have plenty of forces for adding laws or spending more money. We \nneed forces for review and repeal. The people around America who elect \nus and depend upon us to provide the funds we provide in an orderly \nflow could then make their plans and spend the money more wisely. The \nexample the Senator from Ohio gave is a good one, about the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. On this floor, what do we hear more often than \nanything else now? We hear let's stop the dependence upon foreign oil \nor at least let's reduce it, and let's deal with global warming.\n  How do we do that? There are lots of different ways to try to do \nthat, but in a country such as ours that produces and uses 25 percent \nof all of the energy in the world, we don't have many ways to produce \nlarge amounts of carbon-free energy; 70 percent of our carbon-free \nenergy comes from nuclear power in the United States. So when we slow \ndown the processing applications for new nuclear power plants--a \nprocess we invented, which our Navy used without incident since the \n1950s, a process\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nwhich France uses to produce 80 percent of its power--so when we slow \nourselves down, we are delaying urgent action on global warming and on \ndealing with our dependence upon foreign oil.\n  That was a very good example the Senator used. I salute his interest \nand his call for a biennial budget, a 2-year budget, and his focus on \nthe practical problems our failure to deal with appropriations bills on \ntime cause, and it can be shared all around the room.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1772-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1772-S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEACHER INCENTIVE FUND\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a casualty of the \nbudget process. It is a very disheartening development, and I hope it \nis an oversight, not the first symbol of the new Democratic Congress's \neducation agenda because I don't think it should be, and I cannot \nbelieve that it would be. I don't believe that the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Rhode Island, \nand others who care about education would agree that killing the \nTeacher Incentive Fund should be held up and said here is the way the \nDemocrats plan to approach education. But, in fact, that is what came \nover from the House of Representatives. What they did was kill a \nFederal program, passed in a bipartisan way in No Child Left Behind \ncalled the Teacher Incentive Fund. They reduced the Teacher Incentive \nFund from $100 million a year to $200,000 in this current year. What \ndoes the program do? It helps reward outstanding teachers and \nprincipals of children who attend low-income, poor-performing schools. \nThat is what it does. This cut threatens a crucial effort to improve \nthe Memphis schools and also other schools all across our country in 16 \nmajor cities and States.\n\n  It is a disheartening development and one I hope will change. The \nloudest criticism I hear of the No Child Left Behind bill is it is not \nproperly funded. What kind of response is it to say we are going to \nknock $100 million out of the most important program that helps to \ntrain teachers and principals to help low-income children in poor-\nperforming schools succeed? That doesn't make much sense to me.\n  So I have submitted an amendment--it is on file--which would increase \nthe teacher incentive fund from $200,000 this year to $99 million, \nwhich is the level that was approved in the appropriations bill. It is \nalso the level President Bush requested for the current year. The \nfunding comes out of funds available under the education title of the \nLabor, HHS, Education section of the joint funding resolution. Unlike a \ntraditional appropriations bill, the resolution doesn't fully allocate \nall of the dollars under the education title. So as a result, I have \nbeen advised by the Legislative Counsel's Office that our amendment \ndoesn't need an offset.\n  I will add that President Bush, in the budget we received this week, \nhas asked for $200 million for next year. So this would permit us to do \nwhat was intended to be done by the No Child Left Behind bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, let me mention a few of the details of \nthe Teacher Incentive Fund, so that we can understand what happened in \nthe House of Representatives. The Democratic majority in the House \nreduced the teacher incentive fund from $99 million to $200,000. The \nproposed cut jeopardizes 5-year grants that were made to 16 grantees, \nlargely serving big-city schools and low-income students with low \nacademic achievement. The cut will take away funds from Chicago, \nDenver, Memphis, Houston, Dallas, and Philadelphia. The proposed cut \nwill take away funds from State programs in New Mexico and South \nCarolina. Many of these programs were developed in full consultation \nwith teachers and principals and with their unions. As an example, \nPhiladelphia's grant application was written and endorsed by the local \nteachers union. So I am trying to figure out who is against this? It \nwould not be the teachers, principals, or the districts. Neither \nDemocrats nor Republicans. So how did it get cut from $100 million to \n$200,000?\n  One of the most critical problems we have to solve today is how to \nretain outstanding teachers and principals. The more we understand \nabout low-performing schools, the more we understand that, except for \nthe parent, the most important people in that child's ability to \nsucceed are the teacher and the principal. The quality of the teacher \nand the quality of the school leaders are the most important factors. \nThe elimination of funding, as has been done by the joint funding \nresolution, could have a significant impact upon the Teacher Incentive \nFund. As a result, for example, of the joint funding resolution, the \nDepartment of Education has already decided that they will have to \ndelay the national evaluation of the Teacher Incentive Fund until 2008. \nSo we have delayed, for a year, helping these children be exposed to \nteachers and principals who have more capacity, and we won't learn \nanything from that evaluation for another extra year.\n  The proposed cut in funding in the current year will undermine the \ncurrent grant competition that is going on. Applications are due on \nFebruary 12, 2007. So say you are sitting in Providence, Knoxville or \nSan Francisco, and you are in the midst of an application to bring in \nNew Leaders for New Schools or some other group, they say to the school \ndistrict: OK, we will train all your teachers, send them to the Wharton \nSchool in the summer and work with them for a year, and on a continuing \nbasis we will help these principals and teachers; we will help the \nprincipals become better school leaders. But then the New Leaders for \nNew Schools will say you have to give the principal some autonomy, let \nthem hire and fire the best teachers, let them make decisions. So there \nis this alliance. In many cases, the teachers union is involved, as in \nthe Philadelphia case. They make concessions. So everybody is working \ntogether to try to say: What can we do to help these low-performing \nschools succeed?\n  Today, in a roundtable we had about No Child Left Behind, I suggested \nwe are not talking about No Child Left Behind in the correct way. We \nare catching people doing things wrong instead of catching people doing \nthings right. The truth of the matter is that across our country we \nhave about 100,000 schools, more or less, and in about 75 percent of \nthose schools, they are succeeding in what we call adequate yearly \nprogress. Those schools are succeeding in adequate yearly progress. \nNow, those schools, I would say, are high-achieving schools. What we \nfind is most of the schools I would call achieving schools. Any school \nthat has succeeded in No Child Left Behind for a couple of years I \nwould call a highest achieving school. One which has succeeded for 1 \nyear would be a high-achieving school. One with only one subgroup of \nchildren who don't quite make the standards, I would call that an \nachieving school. So we have mainly 15, 20 percent of our schools where \nwe need to go to work and do things differently.\n  These children can succeed. Memphis has a large number of low-\nperforming schools, as we call them, but it is not because the children \ncannot learn. I was there during spring break last year at one of the \nnew public charter schools in Memphis. They go to school early in the \nmorning and leave at 5 in the afternoon. They were in AP biology \ncourses in the 10th grade. They can all learn. They needed extra help \nin a different way, and the difference it has made there starts with a \ngood school leader and an excellent teacher. Memphis plans to take this \nmoney from the Teacher Incentive Fund and take every single one of its \nprincipals through this year-long training, the summer programs, the \ncontinuing education, and then Memphis decided to give those teachers \nautonomy.\n  So that is what we are killing when we kill this program, not just in \nMemphis, but in many other school districts. The northern New Mexico \nnetwork, the DC public schools, the Chicago public schools, Denver, \nMare Island Technology Academy in California, Houston, Guilford County, \nNC, Alaska, the whole State of South Carolina, a couple of districts in \nTexas--they are all in the middle of this. They are making applications \nfor more. They expect these to be 5-year grants. They are doing what we \nasked them to do, and then we come along and kill the program right in \nthe middle of the year.\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print after my remarks a list of the \ncurrent grantees and programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, following that, I ask unanimous consent \nto print in the Record a letter from Secretary Margaret Spellings of \nthe Department of Education pointing out what difficulty this decision \nby the House of Representatives will cause to the teacher incentive \nfund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, finally, let me make this observation. \nI was visited today by representatives of the Tennessee Education \nAssociation. I have not always gotten along well with the Tennessee \nEducation Association because of the subject we are discussing today. \nIn 1983, I proposed the first master teacher program in the country, \nthe first attempt by a State to pay teachers more for teaching well and \nto reward principals in the same way. The National Education \nAssociation went apoplectic for over a year. We had a brawl for a year \nand a half. We finally passed a program and our Career Ladder Program \nlasted for several years, until I got out of office is really what \nhappened, and then it gradually went away. Mr. President, 10,000 \nteachers were rewarded, paid more, their retirement pay was more, and \nwe talked about that today. I appreciated very much their visit because \nthis includes some teachers who were part of that Career Ladder \nProgram. They are the leadership of the teachers' union, the teachers' \nassociation in Tennessee. They came to see me about it, and they were \nvery honest.\n  They said any program that picks one teacher out and rewards \noutstanding teaching or rewards an outstanding principal is difficult \nto do because it is hard to make it fair. But we must do it. Almost \neveryone agrees that if we make any progress in education, especially \nwith low-income children in poor performing schools, we have to find a \nway to pay good teachers more and good principals more and keep them in \nthose schools. We have to do it.\n  So this teacher incentive fund is a real casualty here, and I hope \nthe majority whip, the assistant Democratic leader--he is here--I know \nhe cares deeply about education, about the program in Chicago which is \npart of this.\n  Maybe it is an oversight. Maybe it is a casualty that both \nRepublicans and Democrats have had to deal with over the past 2 months. \nWhat I hope is, if there are any amendments allowed to this joint \nfunding resolution, this amendment will be one of them. If it is not, I \nhope we can work together in the Senate, as well as in the House, and \ndo what President Bush has asked us to do, not only put $200 million in \nfor next year, but send a signal to the big city school districts \nacross America: Don't give up, we want to help you train and hire \noutstanding teachers and outstanding principals.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funds for the Teacher Incentive Fund)\n\n       On page 72, line 20, strike ``of which not to exceed \n     $200,000'' and insert ``of which $99,000,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                            Current Grantees\n\n\n                Northern New Mexico Network (New Mexico)\n\n       The Northern New Mexico Network for Rural Education, a Non-\n     Profit Organization, is partnering with four New Mexico \n     school districts: Espanola Schools, Springer Schools, \n     Cimarron Schools and Des Moines Schools. They seek funding \n     for the Teacher Incentive Fund to implement a performance-\n     based compensation program to serve a region of the state \n     where high levels of poverty, high concentrations of Native \n     American and Hispanic students, and extreme rural conditions \n     pose unique challenges to public education systems. Three of \n     the school districts--Cimarron, Des Moines and Springer--are \n     small (less than 500 students), and serve a large \n     geographical area--all over 1,000 square miles. The fourth \n     district, Espanola, serves almost 5,000 students\n\n\n                New Leaders, Inc. (D.C. Public Schools)\n\n       This project includes a coalition among D.C. Public \n     Schools, New Leaders for New Schools, Mathematica, \n     Teachscape, and Standard & Poors to provide direct \n     compensation to teachers and principals who have demonstrated \n     their ability to move student achievement. D.C. Public \n     Schools' currently works with the Center for Performance \n     Assessment to ``incentivize'' the creation of more standards \n     and data-driven classrooms and schools. The project plans to \n     complement this current effort in the District of Columbia \n     where the achievement gap is particularly troubling due to \n     the over 90 percent of public school students coming from \n     poverty stricken families.\n\n\n                   Chicago Public Schools (Illinois)\n\n       The Chicago Public Schools, in collaboration with the \n     National Institute for Excellence in Teaching (NIET), \n     proposes the Recognizing Excellence in Academic Leadership \n     (REAL) program. At the center of REAL is the NIET Teacher \n     Advancement Program (TAP). The TAP performance-based \n     compensation system--including multiple evaluations and \n     opportunities for new roles and responsibilities--will drive \n     recruitment, development, and retention of quality staff in \n     40 high need schools that serve approximately 24,000 students \n     in the Chicago public school system.\n\n\n   School District No. 1 for the City and County of Denver (Colorado)\n\n       The Denver Public Schools proposes a twofold district-wide \n     expansion of its Professional Compensation System for \n     Teachers (ProComp). First, Denver PS will develop, implement, \n     and evaluate a performance-based compensation system for \n     principals through a national strategic partnership with New \n     Leaders for New Schools. Second, Denver PS will strengthen \n     its professional development, information and technology, and \n     student assessment systems to ensure ProComp is consistently \n     and rigorously implemented district-wide.\n\n\n                New Leaders, Inc.

The project will \n     likely span 17 schools that directly affect 10,000 students \n     in Memphis City Schools--the largest school district in the \n     state of Tennessee and the 21st largest in the nation.\n\n\n              Mare Island Technology Academy (California)\n\n       Mare Island Technical Academy, an LEA, proposes to expand a \n     current project to award incentives to teachers and \n     principals instrumental in increasing student achievement. It \n     will also award incentives to those taking the lead in \n     implementing Strategic Plan and Professional Learning \n     Communities initiatives in 2 independent middle and high \n     school charter schools serving a total of 780 students \n     with 32 teachers and 2.5 principals/administrators, in \n     Vallejo, CA. Mare Island attracts a percentage of \n     neighborhood students from 2 elementary schools within a \n     block of Mare Island: Loma Vista with a 61.4% and \n     Wiedenmann with a 67.0% free or reducedprice lunch rate.\n\n\n              houston independent school district (texas)\n\n       The Houston Independent School District is the largest \n     public school district in Texas and the seventh largest in \n     the United States. Houston ISD proposes Project S.M.A.R.T. \n     (Strategies for Motivating and Rewarding Teachers), an \n     incentive plan for teachers that focuses on teacher \n     effectiveness and growth in student learning. The proposed \n     performance-pay program will provide incentives to 109 \n     teachers and principals at Houston ISD campuses. A total of \n     27 schools have been targeted for inclusion of the S.M.A.R.T. \n     program using TIP funds.\n\n\n                guilford county schools (north carolina)\n\n       Guilford County Schools has proposed a financial \n     recruitment/retention project for the 2006-2007 school year \n     called Mission Possible and plans to expand the program to an \n     additional seven schools using TIF funds. The seven schools \n     proposed for expansion include: Bessemer Elementary, Cone \n     Elementary, Falkener Elementary, Union Hill Elementary, Allen \n     Middle, Aycock Middle, and Penn Griffin Middle.\n\n\n         new leaders, inc.

By the fifth year of the \n     project, SC TIF has the potential to affect more than 60,000 \n     children and 5,000 teachers and principals. These \n     modifications include higher and varied teacher bonuses, the \n     introduction of principal and assistant principal bonuses, \n     more competitive Master and Mentor Teacher addendums, a new \n     focus on marketing and recruiting, raising the value-added \n     percentage in the performance pay from 50% to 60%, using MAP \n     tests to give K-3 teachers an individual value-added score, \n     and inclusion of related arts in the individual value-added \n     gains calculations.\n\n\n               dallas independent school district (texas)\n\n       For the past decade, the Dallas ISD has provided incentives \n     to teachers, principals, and other campus staff based on the \n     value-added performance of their students under the \n     Outstanding School Performance Award program. This project \n     builds on this history and existing apparatus to identify and \n     reward effective principals based on a combination of direct \n     and value-added measures of student achievement and reward \n     effective teachers based on value-added measures of their \n     students' achievement. In addition, the project includes \n     refinement of the Dallas database for tracking student-\n     teacher assignments; incentives for principals and \n     teachers to participate in substantive, high-standards \n     professional development; incentives for highly effective \n     teachers to move to and stay in high needs campuses; and \n     procedures for insuring the integrity of test results.\n\n\n             school district of philadelphia (pennsylvania)\n\n       The overall purpose of Philadelphia's initiative is to \n     pilot a performance-based staff development and compensation \n     system that provides teachers and principals with clear \n     incentives that are directly tied to student achievement \n     growth and classroom observations conducted according to an \n     objective, standards-based rubric at multiple points during \n     each school year. Twenty high-need urban elementary schools \n     (grades 3-8) that have demonstrated high degrees of faculty \n     buy-in will participate in the pilot. Leaders from the School \n     District of Philadelphia's administration and from the two \n     unions representing all Philadelphia teachers and principals \n     have designed the pilot and will oversee its implementation.\n\n\n                  ohio department of education (ohio)\n\n       Key strategies of the Ohio Teacher Incentive Fund (OTIF) \n     include implementing the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) in \n     the Cincinnati and Columbus City Schools, expanding the \n     Toledo Review and Alternative Compensation System (TRACS) in \n     the Toledo City Schools, and developing and implementing the \n     Cleveland Teacher Incentive System, a program modeled on \n     TRACS, in the Cleveland City Schools. OTIP is a cooperative \n     venture of the Ohio Department of Education; Columbus, \n     Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Toledo City Schools; and the \n     National Institute for Excellence in Teaching.\n\n\n                eagle county school district (colorado)\n\n       In the past five years, Eagle County School District has \n     invested over $4.5 million (not including performance awards) \n     to implement a performance-based compensation system for \n     teachers and principals based on the Teacher Advancement \n     Program (TAP). This project is an expansion of the program \n     and will utilize TIP grant funding to improve the quality of \n     Master and Mentor teachers through increased salary \n     augmentations and increased training. It will cover 13 high-\n     need schools.\n\n\n                 weld county school district (colorado)\n\n       This project will be implemented in the 4 high-need schools \n     in the Weld County School District. The district currently \n     ranks last in teacher compensation compared to neighboring \n     districts. The project objectives state that by year 2, a \n     comprehensive principal and teacher differentiated \n     compensation system based on student achievement gains and \n     classroom evaluations will be fully operational.

Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Alexander: Thank you for your efforts to amend \n     the Joint Funding Resolution, H.R. 20, to provide level \n     funding ($99 million) for the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF).\n       As you may know, the lack of a fiscal year 2007 \n     appropriation for TIF would have a significant impact on the \n     program. The Department (ED) remains concerned that a lack of \n     funding for TIF in fiscal year 2007 would jeopardize our \n     ability to make timely continuation funding available for \n     current grant recipients. While ED has reserved $8.8 million \n     from fiscal year 2006 funds to cover the increased costs \n     proposed for the second year of operation for the 16 current \n     TIF grantees, this amount will not cover all continuation \n     costs for grantees.\n       A lack of fiscal year 2007 funding for TIF would also \n     significantly limit our ability to support technical \n     assistance to TIF grantees and ensure that information on \n     teacher and principal compensation reform is available not \n     only to TIF grantees, but also to the general public.\n       Finally, a lack of fiscal year 2007 funding would impact \n     our ability to begin a national evaluation of the TIF \n     program, which Congress called for when appropriating funds \n     for this program. Our planned evaluation will be delayed \n     until fiscal year 2008 unless funds are appropriated.\n       It should also be noted that a lack of funding in fiscal \n     year 2007 may undermine the current TIF grant competition \n     that is underway (with applications due on February 12, \n     2007). Potential grantees may be dissuaded from applying for \n     TIF grants or spending time and resources developing high-\n     quality applications if they believe the program's funding is \n     in jeopardy.\n       Again, I thank you for your leadership on this important \n     issue. Please do not hesitate to call if I can answer any \n     additional questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Margaret Spellings.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. The Senator \nfrom Illinois may speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Tennessee, \nwhose interest in education is well recognized, I couldn't agree with \nhim more. Not only is this program important, it is important to me. \nWhen the superintendent of the Chicago Public School System, Arnie \nDuncan, called me yesterday and said we need this money, I said to him: \nI know you do. It breaks my heart that we cannot give it to you at this \nmoment.\n  I can go through the sordid history that brought us to this \ncontinuing resolution--our failure to pass the appropriations bills in \nthe normal fashion last year, extending the Government on a piecemeal \nbasis with a CR, as we call them, for a few months, and now facing the \nawesome task of funding the rest of the year with certainly limitations \nin funding that have caused a great deal of deprivation. This is a \nclear illustration and example of a program that is worth funding and \nthat should be funded.\n  I say to my friend from Tennessee, if we cannot resolve it in this \nparticular bill--and I doubt that we can because of the extraordinary \ncircumstances--please let me join him and let's have others join in \nmaking sure this program is solid and funded for the next fiscal year. \nIt is a good program, an excellent program. I want to see it move \nforward.\n  The quality of teachers may be the single greatest determinant in the \nsuccess of education. I certainly want to join the Senator from \nTennessee in making that happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1774-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1774-S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to move to another topic and say \nfor anyone who has followed the debate this week on Iraq, it has been a \nfrustration. We came to the Senate with the clear direction of the \nAmerican people to change course in Iraq. Unfortunately, the minority--\nthe Republican minority--decided it was more important to change the \nsubject than to change course. So they defeated our efforts to bring \nthis issue of our policy in Iraq to a debate on Monday.\n  In the Senate, it takes 60 votes to do anything that is important or \ncontroversial. And so we needed help from the Republican side of the \naisle because we only have 51 when we are at full complement, and with \nSenator Johnson recuperating, we only had 50. We needed 10 of their \nstalwarts to join us, to move forward and say: Let's have this debate \non Iraq.\n  I was hopeful we would have that many. At least seven or eight \nRepublican Senators said they disapprove of President Bush's plan to \nescalate this war. I thought that was a good starting point, and maybe \nothers will join in to make sure there is a real debate.\n  Come time for the vote on Monday, we fell short. The Democrats came \nand voted, with all but one exception, to move forward on the debate, \nbut our Republican friends would not join us. So the debate on Iraq \nstopped in its tracks. Efforts were made over the next day or two, with \nno success whatever, to try to revive this debate on Iraq. Now we find \nourselves in a position where we moved to the next stage.\n  That debate was about the Warner resolution, a Republican from \nVirginia, with bipartisan sponsorship that we agreed on the Democratic \nside would be the vote. I don't know how more accommodating the \nmajority could be to\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\nsay to the minority, in this case the Republicans: We will let one of \nyour own write the resolution that we will debate. That is what we said \non the Warner resolution. We went further and said to the Republican \nminority: And then the countervailing resolution, the one in opposition \nto Warner, write that as well. And they did. That was the resolution of \nSenator John McCain of Arizona. So we had two competing Republican \nresolutions in a Senate with a Democratic majority.\n  To argue we are playing politics with this issue, I think, fails on \nits face. I don't know how we could be more accommodating, but \nobviously we didn't reach enough on the other side to get the debate \nstarted.\n  Interestingly enough, I happened to turn on the television last night \nin my office and here Senator John Warner came to the floor to try to \nexplain what happened when seven or eight Republican Senators who said \nthey opposed the President's plan, some who openly supported Senator \nWarner's resolution and Senator Warner himself, all voted not to debate \nhis resolution. It is hard to explain to most people who try to follow \nthe arcane procedures of the Senate.\n  Having said that, the debate is not over. The debate will continue, \nmaybe not on the Senate floor for the next few days. But all across \nAmerica, in grocery stores, in offices, in churches, all across \nAmerica, people are talking about this war. When I am contacted by \npeople back in my hometown of Springfield, IL, or Chicago, people are \nsaying this has to change. I understand what they are thinking about in \nterms of their own children, in terms of the brave soldiers who are \nthere, and in terms of the families who are waiting patiently for their \nloved ones to return.\n  We will return to this debate, but the next stage is not going to be \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The next stage is going to be much \nmore serious. As I said on the floor before, the Warner resolution was \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which is merely an expression of \nsentiment. Important as it is, it is still very thin soup compared to \nan actual amendment or bill which could make some change in the way we \nwage this war. That is the next stage. The House may take it up before \nus because we have to pass the spending bill, and then we are going to \nreturn to it.\n\n  Senator Reid, our majority leader, has made it clear. The Republicans \nwill not prevail when it comes to stopping this debate on Iraq. We \nbelieve the last election was very clear. The American people want us \nto change the policy in Iraq. We change it by deliberating and debating \nand reaching the best consensus we can, and that is what we will try to \ndo.\n  I hope enough Republicans will join us in this debate. This is \ncritically important. If they are loyal to the President and loyal to \nhis policies, then so be it; stand on the floor and defend them. If \nthey agree with us that there has to be a change, that this escalation \nof the war moves us in the wrong direction, they will also have a \nchance to have their voice on the floor. But to try to shut down the \ndebate time and again will not ultimately work. The American people \nwant us to face this issue and face the reality of this war and what it \nmeans to us.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate, just recently released, paints a \nvery bleak picture in Iraq about a civil war that is complicated by an \ninsurgency that is being fought by both Iraqis and foreign al-Qaida \nfighters, along with widespread violent crime. There have been 2 \nmillion refugees in Iraq so far, by the estimate of major international \nagencies. Some 34,000 Iraqi civilians were killed last year. Another \n1,000 died last week alone--Iraqi civilians. These are not the \ninsurgents and terrorists. Many of these are innocent people--men, \nwomen, and children--who happened to go to the market or school on the \nday a bomb was detonated.\n  We have lost more than 3,100 soldiers as of today. In this month of \nFebruary, 8 days into this month, we have lost 26 American soldiers, \nmore than 3 a day. As we postpone this debate for days and weeks, \nAmerican soldiers continue to die and continue to be injured. That is \nthe reality. We have to understand the urgency of this debate and the \nurgency to get it right.\n  The President says he needs 21,500 troops more in Baghdad and Iraq. \nCertainly now the CBO tells us the real number could be 35,000 or \n48,000 because those 21,500 are ground troops, combat troops. They need \nsupport troops as well, and many of them will be in harm's way.\n  When asked how much this new escalation of the war will cost, the \nPresident estimates $5.6 billion over 8 months. The Congressional \nBudget Office takes a look and says: No, you are wrong; $27 billion \nover 12 months.\n  Some of us remember a man named Lawrence Lindsey, head of the White \nHouse's National Economic Council, who made the fatal political error \nin 2002 of saying that he thought the war in Iraq could cost us between \n$100 billion and $200 billion. For his estimate, for his candor, Mr. \nLindsey was canned. He was fired. Secretary Rumsfeld got on television \nand said: I think the war might cost us $50 billion. That is on the \nrecord. The record shows us he was wrong.\n  To date, the American taxpayers have paid over $350 billion for this \nwar. With the new request, it will go to over $500 billion.\n  Imagine the debate we just had between Senator Alexander and myself \nabout $200 million to improve teachers and schools across America that \nwe cannot afford because we are spending $2.5 billion a week on this \nwar in Iraq. We cannot afford to improve the quality of our teachers in \nAmerica's schools because of the money we have committed to a war in \nIraq, a war which, sadly, has no end in sight and a war which is being \nescalated by this President.\n  Some argue--I heard it on the floor repeatedly--that any debate about \nthe President's policy is going to hurt the morale of the troops.\n  This is a copy of The Washington Times, a newspaper which I don't \nfrequently read, but this morning's newspaper says: ``War foes will not \nhurt morale,'' contradicting the statement made by some that if we \nexpress opposition to the President's war policy, we are going to hurt \nmorale. Who was it who said that war foes--those who question the \nPresident's policy--will not hurt morale? It turns out to be none other \nthan GEN Peter Pace of the U.S. Marine Corps, who is, of course, \nChairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said it. I want to quote it. \nI thought this was excellent:\n\n       From the standpoint of the troops, I believe that they \n     understand how our legislature works and that they understand \n     that there's going to be this kind of debate. They understand \ndemocracy. They understand you can disagree with the President without \nbeing disloyal to the men and women in uniform. They understand you can \nquestion whether we have enough troops, whether they are adequately \narmored, whether they are adequately trained, and question those \npolicies of the President without in any way reflecting on our \nadmiration for the troops and their service to our country.\n\n  We are fighting for a democracy in Iraq. That is what we say. A \ndemocracy has open debate and disagreement with leadership. If we can't \nhave the same open debate and disagreement with the leadership in \nAmerica, then we are not exercising the powers of our own democracy.\n  Finally, I would say, Mr. President, that a friend of mine and \ncolleague in the Senate, Senator Ensign of Nevada, came to the floor \nyesterday and quoted me. Unfortunately, Senator Ensign's statement was \nnot accurate. He quoted me as saying recently that:\n\n       If we need initially some troops in Baghdad, for example, \n     to quiet the situation, make it more peaceful so that our \n     soldiers start coming home, then I--myself--would accept it.\n\n  Well, he used this as evidence that many Democrats, including myself, \nhad said, well, they are for increasing the number of troops. Here is \nwhat I was saying. If we need some additional troops to quiet the \nsituation in Baghdad, then I would be open to it. If there was truly a \nplan to exit this untenable situation, where a short-term shift in \ntroops to Baghdad could make a difference, I would happily entertain \nit.\n  But the fact is that this is not a short-term proposal, it is not \npart of a plan that clearly brings our troops home, and putting more \ntroops in the heart of a civil war does not quiet the situation. Our \ntroops have achieved what is achievable in Iraq. As the new\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nNIE states, Iraq is now in a civil war and worse. That is not a battle \nthat U.S. troops can win. Only the Iraqis can. The President's plan \nclearly is not designed to bring our troops home. Nor is he being \nhonest about its costs or the numbers of men and women who will be sent \nto Iraq in this escalation.\n  My respect for Senator Ensign is not diminished by this \nmisunderstanding.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am very concerned that the continuing \nresolution does not adequately support our Armed Forces at this \ncritical time. Our military commanders tell me that the resolution \npassed by the House of Representatives could deprive our bases of $3.1 \nbillion of crucial Federal funding. I am particularly concerned about \nthe nearly $375 million of BRAC funding that is supposed to go to Fort \nLeavenworth and Fort Riley. As a member of the Military Construction \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I support the Hutchinson-Inhofe amendment \nto reinstate the $3.1 billion for BRAC that will be lost in the current \nversion of the continuing resolution.\n  Several of Fort Riley and Fort Leavenworth's projects are in jeopardy \nunless full funding is restored, including: the Regional Correctional \nFacility at Fort Leavenworth, the Battle Command Training Center at \nFort Riley, the Child Development Center at Fort Riley, Fort Riley's \nConsolidated Soldier and Family Medical Clinic, Fort Riley runway \nimprovements, phase I of the Combat Aviation Brigade complex, and the \nincrement 2 of the First Division headquarters construction.\n  Unless we correct this problem in the continuing resolution, it will \nhave a domino effect on future BRAC funding, which will be detrimental \nto our operations around the world. Fort Riley is a good example. First \nDivision soldiers from Fort Riley continue to deploy in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Fort Riley trains the soldiers who will embed \nwith both Afghan and Iraqi forces. Right now, Fort Riley has enough \nsoldiers deployed overseas that it can manage base operations. But as \none Fort Riley official put it a few weeks ago, world peace is Fort \nRiley's worst nightmare: if all the soldiers come home, there is no \nplace to house them all. We need to fund BRAC priorities to stay on \nschedule and make sure the appropriations process in the Senate does \nnot adversely affect the ability of our Armed Forces to execute their \nmissions.\n  We cannot afford to play games with military construction funds. We \nworked hard last year to write good legislation that funded key \npriorities. That funding should be restored. All of us come to the \nfloor pledging to support the men and women of our Armed Forces. Our \npromises of support will ring hollow if we fail to turn our words into \naction. We need to restore full funding to military construction in \nthis continuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I earlier came to the floor and spoke of a \nstatement made on the Senate floor by Senator Ensign. I misread my \nnotes for that statement. I want to clarify that Senator Ensign did, in \nfact, quote me accurately when he said that I had made a statement:\n\n       If we need initially some troops in Baghdad, for example, \n     to quiet the situation, make it more peaceful so that our \n     soldiers start coming home, then I would accept it.\n\n  That, in fact, was a statement that I had made. The point I would \nlike to make at this moment is, that was part of a longer interview. In \nthe longer interview I raised questions about whether this would be \npart of a strategy to bring our troops home. That has been my position \nconsistently.\n  My feeling was, if, as we move troops--we recently moved troops--into \nBaghdad to protect that city, trying to bring peace to it so our troops \ncould come home, I could understand that. But I believe today, as I \nbelieved when I made that statement, that whatever movement of troops \nwe would make would have to be with the clear understanding that our \ntroops were coming home.\n  I apologize if my earlier statement suggested that Senator Ensign had \nsaid something different. He did accurately quote me, but the quote \nthat he used did not accurately reflect my feeling on the entire \nsituation.\n  I want to make that clear to Senator Ensign. As I said when I \nfinished my remarks, my feelings for him are not diminished and my \nfeelings that this war should end and our troops should come home soon \nare not diminished either.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

He was 20 years old.\n  Sergeant Matheny was part of a close-knit family in McCook, NE.

Mr. President, on January 23, over 50 members of Mayors \nAgainst Illegal Guns met in Washington, DC, for the coalition's 2007 \nNational Summit. Mayors from 27 States and the District of Columbia \nshared practices and strategies, discussed the importance of forging \nalliances with gun owners, and united in opposition to laws that \nrestrict cities' access to, and use of, gun trace data. They also heard \nthe results of a bipartisan national poll which shows strong support \nfor tougher enforcement of existing gun laws and common sense \nprovisions to prevent and solve crimes.\n  The original group of 15 mayors first met in April 2006 in New York \nCity, where they pledged to seek the involvement of up to 50 mayors \nfrom around the country. By early June 2006, 52 mayors had joined the \ncoalition. Within a few days following the conclusion of the 2007 \nsummit, 31 additional mayors from across the Nation joined the \ncoalition. The coalition currently includes 154 mayors from 44 States \nand the District of Columbia.\n  As cochair of the coalition, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \ndescribed this growth by saying:\n\n       Our coalition is growing because--as the national summit \n     showed--mayors of both parties are committed to doing more to \n     keep illegal guns off the street, which threaten the safety \n     of our citizens, especially our police officers. The 31 new \n     mayors joining the ranks of our coalition demonstrate that \n     momentum is building for our effort to crack\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\n     down on illegal guns and convince state legislatures and \n     Congress to take ideology out of law enforcement.\n\n  The coalition's basic principle is that keeping illegal guns off the \nstreet is not an issue of ideology but of law enforcement. It, \ntherefore, is united in taking a commonsense approach to fighting \nillegal guns at the local, State and Federal levels. The vast majority \nof guns used in crimes are purchased and possessed illegally. Most gun \ndealers, however, are honest business people that carefully follow the \nlaw. According to gun crime trace data, 85 percent of dealers do not \nsell any guns used in crimes. It is only a small number of \nirresponsible dealers that cause the vast majority of problems. In \nfact, it is only about 1 percent of gun sellers who account for 60 \npercent of all guns used in crimes.\n  According to a national survey conducted by Greenberg Quinian Rosner \nResearch and the Terrance Group on behalf of Mayors Against Illegal \nGuns, 84 percent of Americans say they are concerned about gun \nviolence. This concern crosses partisan lines, and spans big cities and \nsmall rural areas alike. Eighty-two percent of Americans favor either \ntougher enforcement of existing laws or tough new laws. This strong \npublic support for common-sense measures serves to reinforce what we \nshould already know. I would like to urge this Congress to follow the \nexample of these mayors and work in a bipartisan manner to promote and \npass sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1777-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING INDIANAPOLIS COLTS\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the Super Bowl \nChampions from my home State of Indiana, the Indianapolis Colts. The \nColts' 29-17 historic win over the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI was \nthe first professional football championship for the State of Indiana \nand a proud moment for our State and country.\n  As Tony Dungy hoisted the Lombardi Trophy high into the rainy Miami \nnight, the first African American coach to do so, I was reminded of \nwhat people used to say about the great Joe Louis: ``He is a testament \nto his race, the human race.'' This was a great moment for African \nAmericans but one that we all should take pride in. Tony Dungy, Peyton \nManning, Jim Irsay, and the entire Colts team and organization are a \ntestament to what professional athletes should be, and they should be \ncommended for winning with class, courage, and character.\n  It is rare in today's sports world that an organization carries \nitself with such character and class, on and off the field. Throughout \nthe year, the Colts battled week after week, fighting uphill, and never \nbuckling under the pressure.\n  Once the playoffs started, the Colts' true character shined even \nbrighter. They never lost faith in themselves and prevailed as a team. \nTheir conduct this season should be an example for all other teams, not \nan exception.\n  I will never forget sitting with my two young boys cheering as our \nteam won the Super Bowl, but it was just as important that they got to \nsee professional athletes carry themselves with such integrity. I \ncongratulate the Indianapolis Colts on their Super Bowl victory and for \nthe example they set for my children and the millions of others who I \nhope are inspired by their example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1777-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DOMESTIC PET TURTLE MARKET ACCESS ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as a cosponsor \nof the Domestic Pet Turtle Market Access Act of 2007. If enacted, this \nbill would re-open the U.S. market to allow the sale of baby turtles as \npets. In Louisiana, we have 72 licensed turtle farmers who produce over \n13 million turtles year with a farm value of $9 million. Unless \nCongress enacts this bill, this industry will die and Louisiana will \nbear the brunt of the loss.\n  Since 1975, the FDA has banned the sale of turtles sold as pets due \nto health concerns regarding salmonella poisoning. The FDA, through its \nCenter for Veterinary Medicine, banned the sale of baby turtles in the \nU.S. due to salmonella poisoning occurring in children in households \nwith pet turtles.\n  The industry has survived by taking their market abroad to Asia. Asia \nhas developed their own turtle market and is no longer in need of U.S. \nturtles. As a result, U.S. turtle farmers have nowhere to sell their \nproduct, and they are barely getting by.\n  Three decades have now passed and our knowledge of the salmonella \nbacteria and the technology for treating this bacterium has greatly \nadvanced. Scientists at Louisiana State University have developed \nsalmonella treatments for pet turtles. Thanks to these methods, pet \nturtles can be treated for salmonella before they are shipped for sale. \nThis treatment, combined with a much higher awareness of how serious \nsalmonella poisoning is and how one prevents transmission of the \nbacteria, is more than enough to protect individuals who seek to own \npet turtles--in fact, it will be more protection than any other \namphibian or reptile seller currently provides.\n  Other similar amphibians and reptiles are not banned for sale in the \nUnited States and they also carry salmonella and are a potential health \nthreat. There is no requirement that these pets be treated for \nsalmonella before sale. As a result, the FDA has singled out one \nindustry primarily located in Louisiana.\n  This bill will require the turtle industry to submit a plan to the \nFDA for approval. Turtle farmers will be required to demonstrate how \nthey will treat turtles and ensure compliance with this act. The FDA \nmust approve the plan if an acceptable treatment is chosen by the \nturtle farmer and it exceeds current similar methods being used by \nother amphibian and reptile pet sellers.\n  The Louisiana turtle industry will become a dead industry this year \nunless Congress enacts this bill and allows the U.S. market to re-open. \nIn 30 years, our understanding of salmonella prevention and the \ntechnology and science has advanced tremendously. This bill keeps \nintact important safety provisions to protect individuals and at the \nsame time allows the re-opening of a market to stop an important \nindustry in Louisiana from dying. I support this bill, and I hope the \nrest of the Senate will join me in supporting this commonsense bill \nthat will protect consumers, protect farmers, and bring the joy of \ncaring for pet turtles to millions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1777-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1777-S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JACOB N. PERKINS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today with a deep sense of sadness, I wish \nto speak in honor of a wonderful man, Jacob N. Perkins--a former staff \nassistant in my office, who passed away on February 5, 2007. Although \n``Jake'' worked for me some time ago--in 1990 and 1991--he remained a \nkey part of what I like to call the extended Warner staff family.\n  Jake first came to my office as a summer intern from Virginia Tech \nUniversity. From day one, he impressed all of us with his profound work \nethic, his absolute dedication and loyalty, his keen interest in \ngovernment and politics, and his generosity of spirit. In fact, Jake \nwas such an impressive young man that, after his internship, he was \nhired on as a member of my permanent staff to serve as my chief mail \nclerk. He always carried out his responsibilities in an exemplary \nfashion, giving 150 percent of effort each and every day.\n  Upon leaving my office, Jake returned to Virginia Tech to finish his \nundergraduate work. In 1994, he received his bachelor's degree in \npolitical science, compiling nearly a 4.0 average his final 2 years of \nschool. After graduating at Virginia Tech, Jake attended law school at \nthe University of Maryland in Baltimore.\n  Through all the time that has passed, Jake has remained a steadfast \nfriend of my office, supporting my campaigns and projects whenever \npossible and maintaining warm and important friendships with current \nand former staff members. Indeed, only this past Christmas, he was the \nprincipal organizer of our annual staff alumni luncheon.\n  In recent years, Jake began to have significant health problems. His \npassing away this past Monday at the early age of 37, reportedly due to \nkidney transplant complications, is a tragedy.\n  Jake was a remarkable man in so many ways. For one, you would never \nhave known he was ill, not even for a day. He was the type of man who \nnever\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\ncomplained, who was always upbeat, and who continuously looked out for \nhis friends and family.\n  He was an avid Virginia Tech sports fan, an unfailing fan of the New \nYork Yankees, and always eager to enjoy a game of golf with his \nfriends.\n  Jake had a tremendous community presence in his home of Poolesville, \nMD. From his leadership role in the local Chamber of Commerce, to \norganizing and serving as chair of ``Poolesville Day'' in honor of his \nbeloved community, to helping coach youth basketball teams, to serving \nas an announcer at local school sporting events, Jake's dedication to \ncommunity service exemplified the motto of his alma-mater, Virginia \nTech: Ut Prosim--that I may serve.\n  Jake Perkins was a big man with a big presence. The biggest thing \nabout him, however, was his heart. He will be greatly missed by this \nSenator and many Warner staff members past and present.\n  My sincere condolences go out to his dear mother, Mrs. Ellen Perkins \nof Poolesville, MD, and his brother and sister-in-law, Michael and \nShoshana Perkins. We thank you for the gift of Jake's friendship in our \nlives. We will miss him, but we are forever grateful for the time we \nhad with him. Jake Perkins will always be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1778-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING BILL O'NEIL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today it is my honor to salute a longtime \nVermont athletic coach, Bill O'Neil, of Essex High School. Bill has \nbeen named the 2006 Hockey Coach of the Year by the National Federation \nof State High School Associations. While he has amassed an impressive \nrecord in his 35 years of coaching hockey, softball and girls soccer, \nwinning over 900 games and 16 State championships, Bill has always \ninstilled in his players the simple attitude that the game is more than \njust the win. Learning to play the game, positive sportsmanship, \ncommunity involvement and academics are even more important to Coach \nO'Neil. To his players, Bill is a coach, mentor, teacher and lifelong \nfriend.\n  I am delighted that a Vermonter has been recognized with such a \nprestigious honor. The Burlington Free Press recent published an \narticle about Coach O'Neil's recognition.

How can you describe how you \n     feel?''\n       He said he was staggered at thinking of the many coaches \n     for such hockey beds as Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts, \n     Colorado, ``even California'' who were deserving of such an \n     honor, awarded by the National Federation of State High \n     School Associations.\n       O'Neil had been named the Section 1 boys hockey coach for \n     2006, making him eligible for the national award. Two other \n     Vermont coaches, Northfield High School baseball coach Frank \n     Pecora and Woodstock Union High School football coach Jim \n     McLaughlin, were also Section 1 winners.\n       ``Bill is extraordinarily dedicated and hard-working,'' \n     said Essex athletic director Ed Hockenbury. ``He loves \n     spending his time with kids. Win or lose, he is a role model \n     who exemplifies class and dignity in the coaching profession. \n     He is very deserving of this award.''\n       O'Neil will be honored by the Vermont Principals \n     Association at its annual VPA Hall of Fame dinner in May.\n       O'Neil's boys' hockey teams have reached the finals 15 \n     times, winning the title 11 times. His 2005-06 team went 19-4 \n     and defeated BFA-St. Albans in the championship game.\n       Whatever the sport, O'Neil said, he has been fortunate to \n     work for athletic directors--Paul Henry, Bruce Wheeler, Melba \n     Masse and Hockenbury--who ``emphasize the importance of \n     involvement with kids, that it's more than winning.''\n       ``They've never been just about winning. When I'd go in and \n     say we're down, they'd say, `You're doing a good job with the \n     kids. They've learned the game, they're coming along and \n     they're doing stuff in the community.' ''\n       ``All of these mentors of mine have made these programs, \n     not just my programs but all in Essex athletics. All the \n     coaches here are esteemed,'' O'Neil said. ``You don't see \n     anybody that only wants to win and that's what matters.''\n       O'Neil acknowledged that he is not often on the same page \n     as the youth hockey coaches, but said, ``They do a huge job \n     of teaching kids the game, getting them involved and making \n     them have some pride in the game and, I'd like to think, \n     respect for the game and all that goes with it.''\n       However, he said, he is concerned that the heavy game \n     schedules for youth teams tend to take something away from \n     appreciation for the sport.\n       At 35 years of coaching and counting, O'Neil said he can no \n     longer demonstrate everything on the ice or field, but he's \n     still invigorated by young assistants.\n       ``I think more and more about that time being over,'' said \n     O'Neil of his coaching tenure. ``That bothers me. Sometimes \n     I'm so old-school about stuff . . . but I like what I'm doing \n     and I enjoy the kids.''\n       With his children growing and leaving home, O'Neil said, \n     ``The coaching thing is my reward at the end of the day.''\n       ``As much as I like teaching, I love coaching,'' said the \n     English teacher.\n       And as long as he feels that way, Bill O'Neil will continue \n     adding to one of the most impressive coaching careers in \n     Vermont high school history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1778-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1778-S1779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       HONORING THE LIFE OF THE LATE LORNE ``GUMP'' JOHN WORSLEY\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a hockey \nlegend whose personality and character remind us all of the human side \nof sports; Lorne ``Gump'' John Worsley. During his years playing \nprofessional hockey in Minnesota, beginning his career with the St. \nPaul Saints and finishing with the Minnesota North Stars, he found a \nspecial place in the hearts of fans who knew him simply as ``the \nGumper.''\n  Lorne Worsley was born in Montreal, Quebec, on May 14, 1929. As a \nchild, he was given the nickname ``Gump'' because the cowlick in his \nhair looked almost identical to that of comic strip character Andy \nGump. The nickname would follow him for the rest of his life. Despite \ngrowing up penniless during the Great Depression, Gump dreamed of being \na professional hockey player, a dream that would lead him into the \nhistory books as one of the most memorable and accomplished goalies in \nhockey.\n  In 1950, Gump Worsley began his professional hockey career, playing \nfor the St. Paul Saints of the U.S. Hockey League. That year, Gump \nobtained the first of many future accolades when he was named the \nleague's Rookie of the Year. Two years later, in 1952, Gump joined the \nNational Hockey League's New York Rangers, where his debut season \nearned him the Calder Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year.\n  As Gump Worsley's career progressed, so did his accomplishments. \nAfter being acquired by the Montreal Canadiens, his hometown team, in \n1963, Gump helped lead the team to four Stanley Cup Championships in \nthe span of 5 years--winning titles in 1965, 1966, 1968, and 1969. \nDuring his time with the Canadiens, Gump was awarded the Vezina Trophy \nas the NHL's top goalie in both 1966 and 1968. In 1966, his record was \n29-14-6 with a goals-against-average of 2.36. In 1968, he amassed a \nrecord of 19-9-8, with an amazing goals-against-average of just 1.98.\n  In 1970, Gump joined the Minnesota North Stars, helping fuel the team \nto the NHL playoffs in three consecutive seasons. Gump Worsley retired \nfrom the sport he loved in 1974 with a record of 335-352-150, including \n43 shutouts. Over the course of his career, Gump was selected to the \nNational Hockey League's All Star Game four times--in 1961, 1962, 1965, \nand 1972. After his retirement as a player, Gump remained active in \nhockey as a scout for the Minnesota North Stars. In 1980, Gump was \ninducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n  Sadly, Gump Worsley passed away on January 26, 2007, at the age of \n77. The world of hockey and the State of Minnesota now mourn the \npassing of a legend. Among his many accomplishments, Gump will be \nremembered for\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nnot being the ``prototypical'' athlete and also for not wearing a \ngoalie's mask until the final six games of his career. Fellow hockey \nlegend Lou Nanne described Gump Worsley as ``the most unlikely-looking \nathlete, but when he strapped on the pads, he was one of the best in \nthe game.'' Gump Worsley's determination to achieve his goals is an \nexample of success that we can all strive for in our lives, and that is \nwhy today we honor ``the Gumper.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1779-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE FACE OF IDAHO AGRICULTURE FOR A DECADE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, one of the marks of a successful \ngovernment official is his or her ability to bridge the gap between the \npublic and the agency in order to foster a positive and productive \nrelationship that benefits the public good. Someone who not only \naccomplishes this, but takes this principle to a level of excellence, \nis nothing short of exceptional. A fellow Idahoan, Pat Takasugi, is \njust such an individual. Pat retired from the Idaho State Department of \nAgriculture on December 31, 2006, serving as its director for the past \n10 years, under three governors. A third-generation farmer from Wilder, \nID, Pat promoted excellence in Idaho agriculture on multiple fronts for \na decade: foreign trade, conservation, regulation, compliance, inter-\nagribusiness partnerships, and beneficial relationships among \nproducers, processors, consumers, and international partners.\n  Pat served his country with distinction even before leading the Idaho \nDepartment of Agriculture. He attained the rank of captain in the Army \nand served as a Green Beret A-team commander in the Special Forces.\n  Pat's knowledge of agriculture is rooted deeply in his family and, as \na grower of alfalfa seed, onions, wheat, pea seed, and garden bean \nseed, he has a well-rounded sense of Idaho crops and the conditions and \nprocesses necessary for success. It is a fact that agriculture in Idaho \nand in the United States is a complex and highly interdependent system. \nAll parts, from regulations to funding to common practices to the \nactual production on the ground, must work in concert in order to keep \nour food supply safe and efficient, and our agri-businesses thriving. \nPat understands these multifaceted relationships on a systemic level; \nthis strength lent itself to superior leadership and accomplishment in \nhis role as director.\n  Regulations pose particular challenges to any commodity system; Pat \nmet these challenges headon, pushing for a commonsense, financially \nfeasible regulatory system. He created a Customer Assisted Inspection \nProgram for fruits and vegetables. He moved the Weights and Measures \nBureau to computerized inspection forms. He streamlined the pesticide \napplicator licensing process. He increased education on the proper use \nand application of pesticides; and he was instrument, in drafting a \nMemorandum of Understanding among EPA, Idaho DEQ, and industry to deal \nwith regulatory compliance of confined animal operations including \nfeedlots and dairies. Compliance goes hand in hand with regulations: \nPat worked to improve chemigation site and equipment inspections.\n  Agriculture today is responding in positive and responsible ways to \nthe environment. Pat led the way in many efforts to help Idaho \nagriculture respond to environmental concerns, including better \nidentification of ground water pollutants and response strategies, \nincreasing collections of unused pesticides, successfully fighting both \nEurasian Milfoil and noxious weeds and improving the smoke management \nprogram, including local outreach to affected communities.\n  Throughout, Pat worked to promote Idaho agriculture products by \ninitiating the ``Idaho Preferred'' marketing program. He also \nconsistently worked to protect Idaho's agriculture producers by \ncreating a seed fund to mirror the Commodity Indemnity Fund and \nimproving the Warehouse Control Program. Finally, he emphasized \nprotection of Idaho's food industry by creating the Idaho Food Quality \nAssurance Lab and working to isolate the potato cyst nematode outbreak \nand reassure our trading partners that Idaho produce remains dependably \nsafe. Others recognized his expertise and vision. He served as \npresident of the National Association of State Directors of \nAgriculture; chairman of several national committees supporting the \nState's commodity indemnity fund, foreign market development and \nagriculture research. He served as cochair of NASDA's Warehouse Task \nForce, a member of USDA's Agricultural Air Quality Task Force, and \ncochair of the US-Canada Provincial State Advisory Group.\n  Undoubtedly, Pat recognizes the importance of foreign markets to \nIdaho agriculture. He was particularly supportive of market development \noverseas, participating in several foreign trade missions and several \ncommodity groups.\n  I especially appreciate Pat's commitment to including multiple \nstakeholders during agriculture policy formulation and review. He \nreached out to national organizations, State, and industry leaders in \nIdaho and the tribes to promote partnerships that aimed to solve rather \nthan perpetuate challenges to successful agriculture in Idaho. Pat's \ncommunity outreach efforts included support of the Access Yes Program \nto allow sportsmen and women on to private land and the creation of a \nuser-friendly public Web site for the Department.\n  Pat handled challenges such as the detection of brucellosis in Idaho \nlivestock, grass-burning issues, and the bankruptcy of the ABT alfalfa \nseed company with strong leadership and deft crisis management.\n  Pat will be sorely missed, and his boots impossible to fill. I am \nhonored to have worked with such a remarkable individual over the years \nand wish him well as he, in his own words, goes home and ``starts \nwalking fields and driving tractors--doing what real people do.'' Idaho \nagriculture will always bear the indelible mark of Pat's \nlegacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1779-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN M. QUEEN III\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. John M. Queen \nIII, of Waynesville, NC, for recently becoming the president of the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n  John is the president and owner of John Queen Farms, a third \ngeneration cattle farm located in the mountains of North Carolina. He \nis a family man, a successful businessman, and a proven leader in his \ncommunity and the beef industry. Over the years, John has been involved \nin almost every area of the beef industry from production to sale, and \nhe has served in numerous leadership roles in the beef industry at the \ncounty, State, and national levels.\n  With his extensive knowledge and experience as a member of the beef \nindustry, John Queen is the kind of leader the beef industry needs \nright now. In the coming months, a new farm bill will be written that \nwill impact our livestock producers. As a producer, John Queen \nunderstands these issues firsthand, and he will have the opportunity to \nserve as an advocate for his fellow livestock producers.\n  The beef industry today is at a pivotal crossroads. As Congress works \nto secure fair and open markets in Europe and Asia, the beef industry \nmust continue to work diligently to foster consumer confidence in one \nof our Nation's largest export commodities. As we continue to work with \nthe Canadian Government and governments in Asia to reopen their markets \nto U.S. beef, we will need diligent and creative leaders such as John \nQueen to help promote our beef to consumers around the world.\n  I am very pleased that a fellow North Carolinian will be leading the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association. This is a great day for our \ncattlemen, and for North Carolina as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1779-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1779-S1780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF RICHARD H. SHAPIRO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I wish to express my \ngratitude to Richard H. Shapiro for 18 years of service to the Congress \nin his capacities as program director and executive director of the \nCongressional Management Foundation, CMF. As he enters retirement, I \nwish the best for Richard and his family. They should know that the \ncontributions he made during his tenure at the CMF have had positive \nimpacts, direct or indirect, on the way every office in the Congress is \nmanaged.\n  Rick started working for the Congress in the late 1970s, when he was\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nhired as a staff investigator for what was then the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. Following the completion of his \ngraduate education in public administration at Princeton, Rick returned \nto the House of Representatives as staff director for a number of \nsubcommittees. His work in the Congress and as a management consultant \nin the private sector helped Rick develop a sense of the importance of \neffective management to the oversight responsibilities of Congress.\n  During his work at the CMF, Rick has helped the organization mature \nfrom a small and little known nonprofit into an established and highly \nused resource for congressional offices. Over the past 18 years, the \nCMF has doubled the size of its staff and quadrupled the size of its \nbudget. More importantly, under Rick's leadership, the CMF has greatly \nincreased the variety of services it offers to Member offices and \ncommittees. The CMF has prepared books specifically tailored to address \nmanagement issues faced by congressional staff members; it provides \nconfidential consulting services to offices struggling with problems of \norganization, operations, and performance. Lastly, the CMF has also \nincreased the variety of training programs it offers to senior \ncongressional staff members on topics as varied as strategic planning \nand interoffice communications.\n  I thank Rick for all his years of service to Congress. During his \ncareer, he dedicated himself to improving the efficiency and \nproductivity of Congress. Rick's commitment to supporting this \nlegislative body is unmatched and I know that Members of Congress and \ntheir staff will suffer a great loss when he retires. Rick, you have \naccomplished a lot during your time with us, and we are forever \nappreciative. Again, thank you for all of your hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1780-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CELEBRATING ALEXANDER McGREGOR DAO DOANE'S 1ST BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is my great privilege to pay \ntribute to Alexander McGregor Dao Doane as he celebrates his first \nbirthday on February 17, 2007, with his parents, W. Allen and Christina \nDoane. This is the couple's first child, born at 11:44 a.m. at the \nQueen's Medical Center in Honolulu. At birth, Alexander was 7 pounds \n9\\1/2\\ ounces and 20 inches long.\n  In addition to being happy and fulfilled parents, the Doanes are \npillars in Hawaii's corporate leadership circle. Allen is chairman of \nthe board and chief executive officer of Alexander and Baldwin. Founded \nin 1870, it is one of the oldest and most prestigious companies \noperating in Hawaii, with its primary focus in real estate development, \nocean cargo carriage and sugar production. Christina was born in \nSaigon, Vietnam, and immigrated to Hawaii as a child where she would \nearn her bachelor's degree from the University of Hawaii, a master's in \nbusiness administration from Hawaii Pacific University, and enter the \nfield of corporate marketing. She is presently enjoying the full-time \njoys of motherhood.\n  To give you some sense of the depth of the Doanes' commitment to our \ncommunity, 8 days after Alex's birth, on February 25, 2006, as the \nevent cochairs, Allen and Christina, hosted the American Heart \nAssociation's Heart Ball. With more than 1,200 guests in attendance, \n$792,000 was raised for this worthy charity. They never skipped a beat. \nI am very proud to call Allen and Christina, and now Alex, my \nconstituents from the great State of Hawaii.\n  Alexander is named for one of the founders of Alexander and Baldwin, \nSamuel Thomas Alexander. He was described as ``outgoing and \nadventurous, the idea man.'' Who knows what the future will hold for \nAlexander McGregor Dao Doane. It is no happenstance that Alexander and \nBaldwin's common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the \nsymbol ALEX.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 525. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide for \nthe appointment of additional Federal circuit judges, to divide the \nNinth Judicial Circuit of the United States into 2 circuits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Ensign, Stevens, Kyl, Craig, Crapo, and Inhofe, in \nintroducing the Circuit Court of Appeals Restructuring and \nModernization Act of 2007.\n  Our legislation will create a new Twelfth Circuit comprised of \nAlaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Arizona and will \ngo far in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the current \nNinth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  One need only look at the sheer geographic size of the Ninth Circuit \nto find reasons for reorganization. The Ninth Circuit extends from the \nArctic Circle to the Mexican border, spans the tropics of Hawaii and \ncrosses the International Dateline to Guam and the Northern Mariana \nIslands. Encompassing nine States and some 1.4 million square miles, \nthe Ninth Circuit, by any means of measure, is the largest of all U.S. \ncircuit courts of appeal. In fact, it is larger than the First, Second, \nThird, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eleventh Circuits combined.\n  The Ninth Circuit serves a population of nearly 60 million, almost \ntwice as many as the next largest Circuit. It contains the States that \nexperience the fastest growth rate in the Nation. By 2010, the Census \nBureau estimates that the Ninth Circuit's population will be more than \n63 million--an increase which will inevitably create an even more \ndaunting caseload.\n  The only factor more disturbing than the geographic magnitude of the \ncircuit is the magnitude of its ever-expanding docket. The Ninth \nCircuit has more cases than any other circuit. Based on figures from \nMarch, 2006, the Ninth Circuit had 71 percent more cases than the next \nlargest circuit--that is equivalent to the caseload of the Third, \nSeventh, Eighth and Tenth Circuits combined.\n  Moreover, because of the sheer magnitude of cases brought before the \ncourts, citizens within the court's jurisdiction face intolerable \ndelays in getting their cases heard. The median time to get a final \ndisposition of an appellate case in the Ninth Circuit takes nearly 4 \nmonths longer than the national average. Former Chief Justice Warren E. \nBurger called the Ninth Circuit's docket an ``unmanageable \nadministrative monstrosity.''\n  The massive size and daunting caseload of the Ninth Circuit result in \na decrease in the ability of judges to keep abreast of legal \ndevelopments within the circuit. The large number of judges scattered \nover the 1.4 million square miles of the circuit inevitably results in \ndifficulty in reaching consistent circuit decisions. This lack of \njudicial consistency discourages settlements and leads to unnecessary \nlitigation. Reversal rates by the Supreme Court remain astonishingly \nhigh. In 2005, 87.5 percent of the Ninth Circuit cases brought before \nthe Supreme Court were reversed or vacated. In 2006, 96 percent were \nreversed or vacated.\n  Another problem with the Ninth Circuit is that it is never able to \nspeak with one voice. Because of its size, the Ninth Circuit is the \nonly circuit where all judges do not sit in en banc, or full court, \nreview of panel decisions. Rather than splitting the Ninth Circuit at \nthe time the Fifth Circuit was split, Congress decided to permit the \nNinth Circuit to test a ``limited'' en banc procedure. The limited en \nbanc allows a full court to be comprised of 11 members, rather than 28. \nTherefore, 6 members of the 28 are all that is necessary for a majority \nopinion.\n  Former Chief Justice Burger strongly opposed the limited en banc \nprocedure:\n\n       Six judges can now bind more than 100 Article III and \n     Article I judges, and this is simply contrary to how a court \n     should function I strongly believe the Ninth Circuit should \n     be divided.\n\n  The legislation that I and my colleagues introduce today is the \nsensible reorganization of the Ninth Circuit. No one court can \neffectively exercise its power in an area that extends from the Arctic \nCircle to the tropics. Our legislation creates a circuit which is more \ngeographically manageable, thereby significantly reducing wasted time \nand money spent on judicial travel.\n  Additionally, caseloads will be much more manageable. Whatever \ncircuit that contains California will always be the giant of the \ncircuits, but as you can see from this chart, caseloads before the new \nNinth Circuit and the new Twelfth Circuit are much more in line with \nother circuits. Such reductions in caseload will clearly improve \nuniformity, consistency and dependency in legal decisions.\n  Additionally, this legislation is not novel. Since the day the \ncircuit was established, over a century ago, there have been \ndiscussions to divide it. Over the last several decades, Congress has \nheld hearings and debated a split and even mandated two congressional \ncommissions to study the issue each of which recommended dividing the \ncircuit. In fact, the scholarly White Commission, which reported to \nCongress in 1998, concluded that restructuring the Ninth Circuit would \n``increase the consistency and coherence of the law, maximize the \nlikelihood of genuine collegiality, establish an effective procedure \nfor maintaining uniform decisional law within the circuit, and relate \nthe appellate forum more closely to the region it serves.''\n  Furthermore, splitting a circuit to respond to caseload and \npopulation\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\ngrowth is by no means unprecedented. Congress divided the original \nEighth Circuit to create the Tenth Circuit in 1929 and divided the \nformer Fifth Circuit to create the Eleventh Circuit in 1980.\n  We have waited long enough. The 60 million residents of the Ninth \nCircuit are the persons who suffer. Many wait years before cases are \nheard and decided, prompting many to forego the entire appellate \nprocess. In brief, the Ninth Circuit has become a circuit where justice \nis not swift and not always served.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 526. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand the \nscope of programs of education for which accelerated payments of \neducational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill may be used, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with Senator \nChambliss and Senator Mikulski to introduce legislation that is \nimportant to my constituents and young veterans all across America.\n  Many of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines coming back from \nIraq and Afghanistan are having a difficult time finding work. I find \nthis troubling, and I feel that we have a responsibility to support our \nreturning veterans who are looking for work. Currently, unemployment \namong veterans between the ages of 20 and 24 is over 15 percent--nearly \ndouble the unemployment for non-veterans in the same age group.\n  At the same time, many of the fastest growing sectors of our economy \nare in vast need of an additional skilled labor source. The Department \nof Labor has identified industry sectors that are expected to \nexperience high growth over the next several years, including trucking, \nconstruction, hospitality, and financial services. In fact, the \ntrucking industry, which is very important to my State, currently has a \ndriver shortage of 20,000 drivers. That shortage is expected to grow to \n110,000 by 2014.\n  We have industries in need of skilled employees and we have many \nyoung men and women in need of good, high-paying jobs. Our legislation \nis intended to help match those with needs through increased training \nbenefits in the Montgomery GI Bill. The GI Bill, established after \nWorld War II, was a commitment that Congress made to veterans of that \nwar. We would like to extend that commitment to reflect the job \nopportunities of our modern economy.\n  To accomplish this task, I join Senators Chambliss and Mikulski in \nre-\nintroducing the Veterans Employment and Training Act--the VET Act. \nDuring the 109th Congress, Senator Burns and I worked very hard on \nmoving this legislation, and we made a lot of progress. Late last year, \nthe language was approved by the Committee on Veterans Affairs and even \npassed the full Senate. Unfortunately, the clock ran out on the 109th \nCongress and the bill never became law. We were very close last \nCongress, and I'm hopeful that this Congress will continue moving the \nVET Act forward and make it law.\n  The VET Act would expand for veterans the Accelerated Payment Program \nunder the Montgomery GI bill to include job training education in five \nhigh-growth sectors of the economy--high technology, transportation, \nenergy, construction, and hospitality--for the next 4 years to help \nveterans returning from the war on terror transition to the civilian \nworkforce.\n  Many of the training programs for employment in the identified \nsectors are short but they are often more costly at the beginning. The \ncurrent structure of the GI Bill only provides veterans with the option \nof a smaller monthly stipend. This arrangement works well for \ntraditional education institutions, such as 2 and 4-year institutions. \nHowever, this same arrangement is not conducive to the nature of our \nchanging economy and the nature of high growth occupations.\n  A reconfigured and expanded Accelerated Payment Program has the \npotential to pay big dividends for our veterans and our economy. The \nArkansas Employment Security Department estimates that between one-\nthird and one-half of all nonfarm jobs in Arkansas are in sectors that \nwould benefit from this legislation.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, let me briefly review a few reasons \nwhy I think this legislation is a wise policy decision.\n  First, I believe the VET Act will help veterans returning from Iraq \nand the war on terror. Accelerating GI Bill benefits for training in \nhigh-growth occupations will help place veterans faster in good-paying \njobs.\n  Second, passing the VET Act will encourage returning veterans to \npursue careers in occupations that will contribute most to the U.S. \neconomy. These sectors identified by the Department of Labor are \nexpected to add large numbers of jobs to our economy over the next \nseveral years. This legislation will assist in matching the available \nworkforce with our needs to keep our economy growing.\n  Third, the VET Act will help make short-term, high-cost training \nprograms more affordable to veterans. GI bill benefits are paid monthly \nwith a maximum monthly stipend of $1,000. Many of the training programs \nfor occupations identified by the Department of Labor as high-growth \nare short term and high cost in nature. Truck driver training courses \ntypically last 4 to 6 weeks, but can cost up to $6,000. Without this \nlegislation, GI bill benefits will only cover between $1,000 and $1,500 \nof the cost. Such a low offset discourages veterans from using GI bill \nbenefits from these types of training programs. Accelerated benefits \nwould cover 60 percent the cost, and benefits would be paid in a lump \nsum.\n  Last, the VET Act will help place veterans in good-paying jobs at a \nvery low additional cost to the Federal Government. This bill merely \nenhances benefits already available--the total cost of the accelerated \nbenefits program for high-tech occupations is only $5.7 million. This \nis a very small percentage of total benefits available to veterans \nalready. Any additional cost will be small and incremental compared to \nthe immediate payoff of reducing unemployment among young veterans and \nenhancing employment opportunities in high-growth occupations.\n  To date, 10 veterans and industry organizations have endorsed our \nlegislation, including the American Legion, AMVETS, American Trucking \nAssociations, Owner-Operator Independent Driver's Association, \nAssociated General Contractors, and the National Restaurant \nAssociation, among others.\n  Distinguished colleagues, I believe this is good legislation that \nwill benefit our veterans and our economy. I look forward to working \nwith all of you to enact the VET Act and stand ready to assist you in \nyour mission of helping our veterans succeed in civilian life.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to prohibit \nthe Secretary of Agriculture from basing minimum prices for Class I \nmilk on the distance or transportation costs from any location that is \nnot within a marketing area, except under certain circumstances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am offering a measure which \ncould serve as a first step towards eliminating the inequities borne by \nthe dairy farmers of Wisconsin and the upper Midwest under the Federal \nMilk Marketing Order system.\n  The Federal Milk Marketing Order system, created nearly 60 years ago, \nestablishes minimum prices for milk paid to producers throughout \nvarious marketing areas in the U.S. For 60 years, this system has \ndiscriminated against producers in the Upper Midwest by awarding a \nhigher price to dairy farmers in proportion to the distance of their \nfarms from areas of high milk production, which historically have been \nthe region around Eau Claire, WI.\n  My legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most harmful \nand unjust feature of the current system, and corrects it. Under the \ncurrent archaic law, the price farmers receive for fluid milk is higher \nthe further they are from the Eau Claire region of the Upper Midwest. \nThis provision originally was intended to guarantee the supply of fresh \nmilk from the high production areas to distant markets in an age of \ndifficult transportation and limited refrigeration. But the situation \nhas long since changed and the provision persists to the detriment of \nthe Wisconsin farmers even though most local milk markets do not \nreceive any milk from Wisconsin.\n  The bill I introduce today would prohibit the Secretary of \nAgriculture from using distance or transportation costs from any \nlocation as the basis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities \nof milk are actually transported from that location into the recipient \nmarket. The Secretary will have to comply with the statutory \nrequirement that supply and demand factors be considered as specified \nin the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in \nmarketing orders. The fact remains that single-basing-point pricing \nsimply cannot be justified based on supply and demand for milk both in \nlocal and national markets and the changing pattern of U.S. milk \nproduction.\n  This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nspecifically which criteria are used to set milk prices. Finally, the \nSecretary will have to certify to Congress that the criteria used by \nthe Department do not in any way attempt to circumvent the prohibition \non using distance or transportation cost as basis for pricing milk.\n  This one change is vitally important to Upper Midwest producers, \nbecause the current system has penalized them for many years. The \ncurrent system is a double whammy to Upper Midwest dairy farmers--it \nboth provides disparate profits for producers in other parts of the \ncountry and creates artificial economic incentives for milk production. \nAs a result, Wisconsin producers have seen national surpluses rise, and \nmilk prices fall. Rather than providing adequate supplies of fluid \nmilk, the prices often lead to excess production.\n  The prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to \nensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an \nincrease in manufactured products in those marketing orders. Those \nmanufactured products directly compete with Wisconsin's processed \nproducts, eroding our markets and driving national prices down.\n  The perverse nature of this system is further illustrated by the fact \nthat since 1995, some regions of the U.S., notably the central States \nand the Southwest, are producing so much milk that they are actually \nshipping fluid milk north to the Upper Midwest. The high fluid milk \nprices have generated so much excess production that these markets \ndistant from Eau Claire are now encroaching upon not only our \nmanufactured markets, but also our markets for fluid milk, further \neroding prices in Wisconsin.\n  The market-distorting effects of the fluid price differentials in \nFederal orders are shown by a previous Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis that estimated that the elimination of orders would save $669 \nmillion over five years. Government outlays would fall, CBO concluded, \nbecause production would fall in response to lower milk prices and \nthere would be fewer government purchases of surplus milk. The regions \nthat would gain and lose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination \ninherent to the current system. Economic analyses showed that farm \nrevenues in a market undisturbed by Federal orders would actually \nincrease in the Upper Midwest and fall in most other milk-producing \nregions.\n  While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing \nfluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was \nformalized in the 1960's, when the Upper Midwest arguably was the \nprimary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to \nencourage local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that did \nnot traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs.\n  That is no longer the case. The Upper Midwest is no longer the \nprimary source of reserve supplies of milk. Unfortunately, the prices \ndidn't adjust with changing economic conditions, most notably the shift \nof the dairy industry away from the Upper Midwest and towards the \nSouthwest, and specifically California, which now leads the Nation in \nmilk production.\n  The result of this antiquated system has been a decline in the Upper \nMidwest dairy industry, not because it can't produce a product that can \ncompete in the marketplace, but because the system discriminates \nagainst it. Over the past few years Wisconsin has lost dairy farmers at \na rate of more than 5 per day. The Upper Midwest, with the lowest fluid \nmilk prices, is shrinking as a dairy region despite the dairy-friendly \nclimate of the region. Some other regions with higher fluid milk prices \nare growing rapidly.\n  While the distance provision is a longstanding inequity, a recent \nproposal threatens to heap additional inequities on top of the current \ndistance provision. A new proposal has been made asking the USDA to \nchange the pricing formulas by decoupling fluid milk, Class I and II, \nprice and the price for milk used in dairy products, Class III and IV, \nalong with increasing the support for fluid milk. This would advantage \nareas with high fluid milk utilization by providing them a relatively \nhigher price and disadvantage areas like Wisconsin where cheese-making \nis also a major use for milk. This price signal would likely then cause \nover-production in these regions, eventually driving down the price for \nmilk used in dairy products and the price received by Wisconsin's dairy \nfarmers.\n  On top of this double-threat is a third negative impact. Decoupling \nthe fluid milk price will undercut the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) \nsafety net in Wisconsin because the trigger price for counter-cyclical \nsupport is based on Class I price in Boston. A higher fluid milk price \nwill mean the MILC safety net is less effective, especially for regions \nthat depend on the now decoupled class II and IV price like Wisconsin. \nIt is very conceivable that this new proposal would allow the Class III \nand IV price to plummet while the Class I price remains above the \ntrigger, eliminating the MILC safety net's usefulness for Wisconsin \nfamily dairy farmers.\n  I joined with Senator Kohl and Representative Obey in sending a \nletter expressing these concerns to Secretary Johanns last month. In \nthis letter we urge the USDA to reject this proposal which would amount \nto further unfair treatment in the federal regulations for Wisconsin's \nhard-working dairy farmers.\n  In a free market with a level playing field, these shifts in \nproduction might be acceptable. But in a market where the government is \nsetting the prices and providing that artificial advantage to regions \noutside the Upper Midwest, the current system is unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and bring reform to this \noutdated\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nsystem, eliminate the inequities in the current milk marketing order \npricing system and reject proposals to add further inequity into the \nsystem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow the modified bloc voting by cooperative \nassociations of milk producers in connection with a referendum on \nFederal Milk Marketing Order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a measure that \nwill begin to restore democracy for dairy farmers throughout the \nNation.\n  When dairy farmers across the country supposedly voted on a \nreferendum eight years ago to consolidate and modernize the order \nsystem, perhaps the most significant change in dairy policy in sixty \nyears, they didn't actually get to vote. Instead, their dairy marketing \ncooperatives cast their votes for them.\n  This procedure is called ``bloc voting'' and it is used all the time. \nBasically, a Cooperative's Board of Directors decides that, in the \ninterest of time, bloc voting will be implemented for that particular \nvote. It may serve the interest of time, but it doesn't always serve \nthe interests of their producer owner-members.\n  While I think that bloc voting can be a useful tool in some \ncircumstances, I have serious concerns about its use in every \ncircumstance. Farmers in Wisconsin and in other States tell me that \nthey do not agree with their cooperative's view on every vote. Yet, \nthey have no way to preserve their right to make their single vote \ncount.\n  I have learned from farmers and officials at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture (USDA) that if a cooperative bloc votes, individual members \nhave no opportunity to voice opinions separately. That seems unfair \nwhen you consider what significant issues may be at stake. Coops and \ntheir individual members do not always have identical interests. \nConsidering our Nation's longstanding commitment to freedom of \nexpression, our Federal rules should allow farmers to express a \ndiffering opinion from their coops, if they choose to.\n  The Democracy for Dairy Producers Act of 2007 is simple and fair. It \nprovides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its members a ballot to \nopt to vote separately from the coop.\n  This will in no way slow down the process at USDA; implementation of \nany rule or regulation would proceed on schedule. Also, I do not expect \nthat this would often change the final outcome of any given vote. Coops \ncould still cast votes for their members who do not exercise their \nright to vote individually. And to the extent that coops represent \nfarmers' interests, in the majority of cases farmers are likely to vote \nthe same as their coops. But whether they join the coops or not in \nvoting for or against a measure, farmers deserve the right to vote \naccording to their own views.\n  I urge my colleagues to return the democratic process to America's \nfarmers, by supporting the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 529\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit products that contain dry ultra-filtered \nmilk products, milk protein concentrate, or casein from being labeled \nas domestic natural cheese, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Quality \nCheese Act of 2005. This legislation will protect the consumer, save \ntaxpayer dollars and provide support to America's dairy farmers, who \nhave experienced a roller-coaster in prices over the past few years.\n  When Wisconsin consumers have the choice, they will choose natural \nWisconsin cheese. But in the past some in the food industry have pushed \nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change current law, which \nwould leave consumers not knowing whether cheese is really all natural \nor not.\n  If the Federal Government creates a loophole for imitation cheese \ningredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats, some cheese labels saying \n``domestic'' and ``natural'' will no longer be truly accurate.\n  If USDA and FDA allow a change in Federal rules, milk substitutes \nsuch as milk protein concentrate, casein, or dry ultra filtered milk \ncould be used to make cheese in place of the wholesome natural milk \nproduced by cows in Wisconsin or other parts of the U.S.\n  I was deeply concerned by these efforts a few years ago to change \nAmerica's natural cheese standard. Efforts to allow milk protein \nconcentrate and casein into natural cheese products fly in the face of \nlogic and could create a loophole that would allow unlimited amounts of \nimported milk proteins of unknown quality to enter U.S. cheese vats.\n  While the industry proposal was withdrawn, my legislation would \npermanently prevent a similar back-door attempt to allow imitation milk \nas a cheese ingredient and ensure that consumers could be confident \nthat they were buying natural cheese when they saw the natural label.\n  Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace \ndue in part to promotional and marketing efforts and investments by\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\ndairy farmers across the country. Year after year, per capita cheese \nconsumption has risen at a steady rate.\n  These proposals to change our natural cheese standards, however, \ncould decrease consumption of natural cheese by raising concerns about \nthe origin of casein and milk protein concentrate. Use of such products \ncould significantly tarnish the wholesome reputation of natural cheese \nin the eyes of the consumer and have unknown effects on quality and \nflavor.\n  This change could seriously compromise decades of work by America's \ndairy farmers to build up domestic cheese consumption levels. It is \nsimply not fair to America's farmers or to consumers. After all, \nconsumers have a right to know if the cheese that they buy is \nunnatural. And by allowing milk protein concentrate milk into \nsupposedly natural cheese, we would be denying consumers the entire \npicture.\n  The proposed change to our natural cheese standard would also harm \nthe American taxpayer. If we allow MPCs to be used in cheese, we will \neffectively permit unrestricted importation of these ingredients into \nthe United States. Because there are no tariffs and quotas on these \ningredients, these heavily subsidized products would quickly displace \nnatural domestic dairy ingredients.\n  These unnatural foreign dairy products would enter our domestic \ncheese market and could depress dairy prices paid to American dairy \nproducers. Low dairy prices, in turn, could result in increased costs \nto the dairy price support program as the federal government is forced \nto buy domestic milk products when they are displaced in the market by \ncheap imports. So, at the same time that U.S. dairy farmers would \nreceive lower prices, the U.S. taxpayer would pay more for the dairy \nprice support program--and in effect be subsidizing foreign dairy \nfarmers and processors.\n  This change does not benefit dairy farmers, consumers or taxpayers. \nWho then is it good for?\n  It would benefit only the subsidized foreign MPC producers out to \nmake a fast buck by exploiting a system put in place to support our \ndairy farmers.\n  This legislation addresses the concerns of farmers, consumers and \ntaxpayers by prohibiting dry ultra-filtered milk, casein, and MPCs from \nbeing included in America's natural cheese standard.\n  Congress must shut the door on any backdoor efforts to undermine \nAmerica's dairy farmers. I urge my colleagues to pass my legislation \nand prevent a loophole that would allow changes that hurt the consumer, \ntaxpayer, and dairy farmer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

NATURAL CHEESE STANDARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products, milk protein \n     concentrate, or casein to be labeled as domestic natural \n     cheese would result in increased costs to the dairy price \n     support program; and\n       (B) that change would be unfair to taxpayers, who would be \n     forced to pay more program costs;\n       (2) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products, milk protein \n     concentrate, or casein to be labeled as domestic natural \n     cheese would result in lower revenues for dairy farmers;\n       (3) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products, milk protein \n     concentrate, or casein to be labeled as domestic natural \n     cheese would cause dairy products containing dry ultra-\n     filtered milk, milk protein concentrate, or casein to become \n     vulnerable to contamination and would compromise the \n     sanitation, hydrosanitary, and phytosanitary standards of the \n     United States dairy industry; and\n       (4) changing the labeling standard for domestic natural \n     cheese would be misleading to the consumer.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 341) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Whenever'' and inserting ``(a) \n     Whenever''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) The Commissioner may not use any Federal funds to \n     amend section 133.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations \n     (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling), to \n     include dry ultra-filtered milk, milk protein concentrate, or \n     casein in the definition of the term `milk' or `nonfat milk', \n     as defined in the standards of identity for cheese and cheese \n     products published at part 133 of title 21, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation or \n     ruling).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 531. A bill to repeal section 10(f) of Public Law 93-531, commonly \nknown as the ``Bennett Freeze''; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould repeal section 10(f) of Public Law 93-531, commonly known as the \n``Bennett Freeze.'' Passage of this legislation would officially mark \nthe end of roughly 40 years of litigation and land-lock between the \nNavajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. Congressman Rick Renzi has introduced \nan identical version today in the House of Representatives.\n  For decades the Navajo and the Hopi have been engrossed in a bitter \ndispute over land rights in the Black Mesa area just south of Kayenta, \nAZ. The conflict extends as far back as 1882 when the boundaries of the \nHopi and Navajo reservations were initially defined, resulting in a \ntragic saga of litigation and damaging Federal Indian policy. By 1966, \nrelations between the tribes became so strained over development and \naccess to sacred religious sites in the disputed area that the Federal \nGovernment imposed a construction freeze on the disputed reservation \nland. The freeze prohibited any additional housing development in the \nBlack Mesa area and restricted repairs on existing dwellings. This \ninjunction became known as the ``Bennett Freeze,'' named after former \nBIA Commissioner Robert Bennett who imposed the ban.\n  The Bennett Freeze was intended to be a temporary measure to prevent \none tribe taking advantage of another until the land dispute could be \nsettled. Unfortunately, the conflict was nowhere near resolution, and \nthe construction freeze ultimately devastated economic development in \nnorthern Arizona for years to come. By some accounts, nearly 8,000 \npeople currently living in the Bennett Freeze area reside in conditions \nthat haven't changed in half a century. While the population of the \narea has increased 65 percent, generations of families have been forced \nto live together in homes that have been declared unfit for human \nhabitation. Only 3 percent of the families affected by the Bennett \nFreeze have electricity. Only 10 percent have running water. Almost \nnone have natural gas.\n  In September 2005, the Navajo and Hopi peoples' desire to live \ntogether in mutual respect prevailed when both tribes approved \nintergovernmental agreement that resolved all outstanding litigation in \nthe Bennett Freeze area. This landmark agreement also clarifies the \nboundaries of the Navajo and Hopi reservations in Arizona, and ensures \nthat access to religious sites of both tribes is protected. As such, \nthe Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, and the Department of Interior all \nsupport congressional legislation to lift the freeze.\n  The bill I'm introducing today would repeal the Bennett Freeze. The \nintergovernmental compact approved last year by both tribes, the \nDepartment of Interior, and signed by the U.S. District Court for \nArizona, marks a new era in Navajo-Hopi relations. Lifting the Bennett \nFreeze gives us an opportunity to put decades of conflict between the \nNavajo and Hopi behind us. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 532. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Bureau of Land Management land to Park City, Utah, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Utah Public Land \nConveyance Act of 2007, S. 532. This legislation is designed to improve \nthe management of public lands and open space for the benefit of the \ncitizens of Park City, UT.\n  Park City has an existing lease on an 88-acre parcel of Bureau of \nLand Management land known as Gambel Oak and on a 20-acre parcel of BLM \nland known as White Acre. The leases for these properties have been for \nrecreational and public open space purposes. This legislation would \nconvey\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\nthese two parcels to Park City, so that they can be better managed for \nrecreation and open space. The BLM has limited resources and is not \nable to manage these lands for the full benefit of the public.\n  It's important to note that although these parcels of lands would be \nconveyed to Park City, they would continue to be protected from \ndevelopment and could be used only for recreational and public open \nspace purposes. Moreover, this bill would require Park City to pay fair \nmarket value for the land.\n  I believe having public lands interspersed with private lands within \na city's boundary creates unnecessary management headaches, and the \nland conveyance to Park City will help bring cohesion to Park City's \noverall effort to manage their city's growth for the benefit of its \ncitizens.\n  Along those lines, the legislation also would allow two small parcels \nof BLM land in Park City to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, \nthus allowing these lands to be brought under the city's zoning scheme. \nProceeds of these sales would go to the Department of the Interior to \npay for the costs of administering this legislation. The remaining \nproceeds would be given to the BLM and dedicated toward restoration \nprojects on BLM lands in Utah.\n  As you can see, this legislation goes a long way to simplify and \nconsolidate the management of lands in Park City, UT. The legislation \nallows the BLM to focus to a greater extent on the public lands which \nlay outside of city limits while raising revenue to facilitate that \neffort.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Congressman Rob Bishop who has worked \nhard to put this legislation together and has introduced a companion \nbill in the House, H.R. 838. I look forward to working with him to get \nthis legislation passed for the good people of Park City.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 533. A bill to amend the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to \nprohibit the issuance of permits for marine aquaculture facilities \nuntil requirements for the permits are enacted into law; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing an important \nbill on a subject that was not resolved last year, and which continues \nto be an outstanding issue for those of us who are dependent on healthy \nand productive natural populations of ocean fish and shellfish.\n  Simply put, this bill prohibits further movement toward the \ndevelopment of aquaculture facilities in Federal waters until Congress \nhas had an opportunity to review all of the serious implications, and \nmake decisions on how such development should proceed.\n  For years, some members of the Federal bureaucracy have advocated \ngoing forward with offshore aquaculture development without that \ndebate. While the administration has entertained some level of public \ninput, the role of Congress must not be undermined. Doing so, would be \nan extraordinarily bad idea.\n  The Administration is in the final stages of preparing a bill to \nallow offshore aquaculture development to occur, and it plans to send \nthe bill to Congress in the very near future. In the last Congress, the \nAdministration proposed legislation to provide a regulatory framework \nfor the development of off-shore aquaculture. While their draft bill is \nan improvement, it still does not establish clear mandatory \nenvironmental standards for the aquaculture industry.\n  I remain steadfast that any proposal should meet the standards of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act and the Jones Act. Why should this \nindustry be exempt from the same laws that our commercial fisheries are \nsubject to? Why should this industry not go through the same rigorous \nenvironmental review as any other activity that will have impacts on \nthe environment?\n  Scientists, the media and the public are awakening to the serious \ndisadvantages of fish raised in fish farming operations compared to \nnaturally healthy wild fish species such as Alaska salmon, halibut, \nsablefish, crab and many other species.\n  It has become common to see news reports that cite not only the \ngeneral health advantages of eating fish at least once or twice a week, \nbut the specific advantages of fish such as wild salmon, which contains \nessential Omega-3 fatty acids that may help reduce the risk of heart \ndisease and possibly have similar beneficial effects on other diseases.\n\n  Educated and watchful consumers have also seen recent stories citing \nresearch that not only demonstrates that farmed salmon fed vegetable-\nbased food does not have the same beneficial impact on cardio-vascular \nhealth, but also that the demand for other fish that we use as feed in \nthose fish farms may lead to the decimation of those stocks. Yet the \nAdministration's bill does not address feed in a meaningful way.\n  Those same alert consumers may also have seen stories indicating that \nfish farms may create serious pollution problems from the concentration \nof fish feces and uneaten food, that fish farms may harbor diseases \nthat can be transmitted to previously healthy wild fish stocks, and \nthat fish farming has had a devastating effect on communities that \ndepend on traditional fisheries.\n  It is by no means certain that all those problems would be duplicated \nif we begin to develop fish farms that are farther offshore, but \nneither is there any evidence that they would not be . . . I certainly \ndon't believe it is prudent to extend the site permits to 20 years, as \nin the draft bill, given all of the questions and uncertainties of the \nenvironmental risks.\n  Not only do the proponents want to encourage such development, they \nalso want to change the way decisions are made so that all the \nauthority rests in the hands of just one Federal agency. I believe that \nwould be a serious mistake. There are simply too many factors that \nshould be evaluated--from hydraulic engineering, to environmental \nimpacts, transportation and shipping issues, fish biology, management \nof disease, to the nutritional character of farmed fish, and so on--for \nany existing agency.\n  We cannot afford a rush to judgment on this issue--it is far too \ndangerous if we make a mistake. In my view, such a serious matter \ndeserves the same level of scrutiny by Congress as the recommendations \nof the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy for other sweeping changes in \nocean governance.\n  The ``Natural Stock Conservation Act'' I am introducing today lays \ndown a marker for where the debate on offshore aquaculture needs to go. \nIt would prohibit the development of new offshore aquaculture \noperations until Congress has acted to ensure that every Federal agency \ninvolved does the necessary analyses in areas such as disease control, \nengineering, pollution prevention, biological and genetic impacts, \neconomic and social effects, and other critical issues, none of which \nare specifically required under existing law.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to understand that this is not a \nparochial issue, but a very real threat to the literal viability of \nnatural fish and shellfish stocks, as well as the economic viability of \nmany coastal communities. We must retain the oversight necessary to \nensure that if we move forward on the development of off-shore \naquaculture.\n  I sincerely hope that Congress will give this issue the attention it \ndeserves. We all want to make sure we enjoy abundant supplies of \nhealthy foods in the future, but not if it means unnecessary and \navoidable damage to wild species, to the environment generally, and to \nthe economies of America's coastal fishing communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 533\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an Unsolved Crimes Section in the Civil \nRights Division of the Department of Justice, and an Unsolved Civil \nRights Crime Investigative Office in the Civil Rights Unit of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Emmett Till \nUnsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, legislation to provide for the \ninvestigation and prosecution of unsolved civil rights crimes. In this \neffort, I am proud to be joined by Senator Leahy.\n  There are those who would say this bill is a case of ``too little, \ntoo late.'' In some ways they would be right. Where is the justice, I \nsuppose, when a monster such as Edgar Ray Killen roamed free for \nliterally decades after killing young civil rights workers in this \ncountry? That fact alone speaks to the inexcusable failures of our \nlegal system to bring to justice those who committed brutal crimes \nbased solely on racial prejudice.\n  Not that many years ago, crimes of this type were rarely investigated \nin parts of our country. There was often little or no effort made \nwhatsoever to determine who engaged in these brutal violent acts. In \nmore recent history, of course, we have seen much stronger efforts and \nI applaud this work. However, I believe there remains good \njustification for dedicating an adequate amount of resources to go back \nand reopen the books on those tragic unsolved crimes. Those who engaged \nin these activities, who think they never have to worry another day in \ntheir lives about being pursued, take note--take note that you may \nnever and should never have a sleep-filled night again, that we will \npursue you as long as you live, that we will do everything in our power \nto apprehend you and bring you to the bar of justice.\n  That is the message we want to convey to the families, the friends, \nand others who lost loved ones, who put their lives on the line by \nadvocating for greater justice, helping our Nation achieve that ``more \nperfect union'' that our Founders spoke about, that Abraham Lincoln \narticulated brilliantly more than a century and a half ago.\n  That is at the heart of this effort--to try to level this field. We \nwill never be a perfect union, but each generation bears the \nresponsibility for getting us closer to that ideal.\n  America stands for the principle of equal justice for all. Yet for \nfar too long, many Americans have been denied that equal justice, and \nmany despicable criminals have not been held accountable for what they \nhave done to deprive people of those equal opportunities. This is a \nfailure we can never forget.\n  So this Senate, in this Congress, on this date, early in the 21st \ncentury, is saying that we will not forget. This bill is on record. \nThis bill seeks to right the wrongs of the past and to bring justice to \npeople who perpetrated these heinous crimes because of racial hatred. \nWe are saying that we want to create the mechanism to allow us to \npursue these wrongdoers in the coming years. It cannot bring back and \nmake whole those who have suffered and were murdered by a racist \ncriminal hand. But it can reaffirm our Nation's commitment to seek the \ntruth and to make equal justice a reality.\n  To do this, we propose the creation of two new offices. The Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crime Investigative Office will be a division of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation devoted to the aggressive investigation \nof pre-1970 cases in coordination with local law enforcement officials. \nThe Unsolved Crimes Section will be an office within the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice and will focus specifically on \nprosecuting those cases investigated by the new FBI office.\n  The hour is, obviously, very late. Memories are dimming. Those who \ncan bring some important information to the legal authorities are \npassing away. This bill may be the last and best chance we have as a \nnation to write a hopeful postscript in the struggle for racial \nequality in our Nation.\n  We are pleased to be working with our friends in the House to help \nright these wrongs done in our past, especially Representative John \nLewis, who has worked throughout his distinguished life to make sure \nthat the promise of America can be realized for all our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in \nreintroducing the Dodd-Leahy Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime \nAct. This bill strengthens the ability of our federal government to \ninvestigate and prosecute unsolved murders from the civil rights era.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership and commitment to enacting \nthis meaningful civil rights bill. And I look forward to working with \nother Senators as this bill moves forward.\n  I am also very pleased that the Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act once \nagain includes the Missing Child Cold Case Review Act, which I \nsponsored in the last Congress to provide the investigative expertise \nof our Inspectors General in reviewing the cold cases of missing \nchildren.\n  Under current law, an inspector general's duties are limited to \nactivities related to the programs and operations of an agency. My bill \nwould allow inspectors general to assign criminal investigators to \nassist in the review of cold case files at National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children. NCMEC, so long as doing so would not interfere \nwith normal duties. I understand that our inspectors general are eager \nto provide this assistance, and this measure allows them legal \nauthorization to do that. These cases need resolution. As parents and \ngrandparents we all know that and, where our Government can provide its \nresources, it should.\n  The primary thrust of this bill targets murders from the civil rights \nera.\n  Nearly 52 years ago, the brutal murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old \nAfrican-American teenager, stirred the concience of our country. Young \nEmmett Till walked into a local country store in Money, MS, to buy some \ncandy and allegedly whistled at the white store clerk. That night, two \nwhite half-brothers, J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant, kidnapped Emmett Till \nfrom his great uncle's home. Several days later, his brutally beaten \nand unrecognizable body was fished out of the nearby Tallahatchie \nRiver. No one was ever punished for this tragic and brutal murder.\n  Emmett Till's death served as momentum for change. It inspired a \ngeneration of Americans to demand justice and freedom in a way America \nhad never seen before. During the civil rights movement, the road to \nMississippi became the highway of change for an entire country.\n  Yet the movement had a darker side. Fifty-two years after Emmett \nTill's murder, the families of many Americans who lost their lives \nduring the civil rights era are still awaiting justice. We must not \nforget their sacrifice. And one way to honor that sacrifice is acting \nbefore the window of time closes. New evidence of cold cases trickles \nin while older evidence continues to fade and witnesses age. We must \nhave a sense of urgency to ensure that justice is rendered. We cannot \nafford to wait.\n  The Emmett Till Unsolved Crime Act would provide the Federal \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\nwith much needed tools to expeditiously investigate and prosecute \nunsolved civil rights era cold cases. To accomplish this goal, the \nlegislation calls for the creation of new cold case units in the \nJustice Department and FBI solely dedicated to investigating and \nprosecuting unsolved cases that involved violations of criminal civil \nrights statutes, resulting in death, and occurring before January 1, \n1970. This measure also seeks to provide proper coordination between \nfederal officials and state and local government officials on these \ncases.\n  This bill ensures that the Federal Government is held accountable by \nrequiring the Justice Department and FBI cold case units to submit \nannual reports to Congress describing which cold cases were selected \nfor further investigation and prosecution and which were not.\n  By shedding light on unsolved civil rights era murders, I hope this \nbill will end our Nation's ``quiet game'' on civil rights murders. \nJustice is better served by allowing our entire nation to acknowledge \npast wrongs, including wrongs aided by lax law enforcement. Just this \nweek, The Washington Post reported that the briefcase of slain Florida \ncivil rights leader Harry T. Moore, which mysteriously disappeared 55 \nyears ago from a local courthouse, was found in a barn. We must hold \nour .government officials more accountable.\n  Progress has been made. According to a February 4, 2007, article in \nUSA Today, entitled ``Civil rights-era killers escape justice,'' since \n1989, authorities in seven States have reexamined 29 killings from the \ncivil rights era and made 28 arrests that led to 22 convictions, \nincluding this month's arrest of former Klansman James Seale for the \nMay 2, 1964, abduction and killings of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles \nEddie Moore.\n  Despite some progress, much remains to be done. Just how many people \ndied during that period is uncertain. At the National Civil Rights \nMemorial in Birmingham, AL, is the Civil Rights Memorial Center, where \n86 additional names appear on a wall dedicated to the ``forgotten \nothers.'' This bill ensures that no sacrifice in the pursuit of freedom \ngoes unnoticed.\n  Even today, violence or the threat of violence serves as a barrier to \nfull and equal participation in our society. On January 11, 2007, the \nNAACP asked the FBI to investigate three recent acts of violence and \nintimidation against against African-American mayors, including shots \nfired into the home of Greenwood, LA's first black mayor and the \nmysterious shooting death of Westlake, LA's, first black mayor two days \nbefore he was scheduled to take office. And two days ago the Anti-\nDefamation League, which monitors racist hate groups, released a report \nshowing that ``Klan groups have witnessed a surprising and troubling \nresurgence by exploiting fears of an immigration explosion.''\n  There is no place for racial violence or political terrorism in a \ndemocracy. We must rededicate ourselves, as a Nation and as \nindividuals, to protecting the full human equality of all Americans. We \nstart today by ensuring that the guilty do not go unpunished, or that \njustice--even if delayed--is denied. By passing this bill and enacting \nit into law, we continue our march toward building a more fair and just \nsociety.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 536. A bill to amend the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 to \nprohibit the labeling of cloned livestock and products derived from \ncloned livestock as organic; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to provide further \nclarity that cloned animals and the products of cloned animals may not \nbe considered organic under the National Organic Program.\n  A recent article in the Washington Post suggested that there has been \nsome confusion over this point at USDA. I would hope that the \nDepartment's advisory board on these matters would utilize existing law \nto protect the integrity of organic standards without Congressional \nintervention. I believe they have more than adequate authority to do \nso. But if they fail to do so, Congress may be left with no option but \nto intervene.\n  This bill has one purpose and one purpose only; to protect the \nintegrity of organic standards. The conditions under which cloned \nanimal products enter our general food systems will be much debated in \nthe months and years to come. But I would hope that we can begin that \ndiscussion with general consensus that it is not acceptable for cloned \nfood products to enter the marketplace under the organic label.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 537. A bill to address ongoing small business and homeowner needs \nin the Gulf Coast States impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane \nRita; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 538. A bill to reduce income tax withholding deposits to reflect a \nFICA payroll tax credit for certain employers located in specified \nportions of the GO Zone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Kerry)\n  S. 539. A bill to address ongoing economic injury in Gulf Coast \nStates impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita by reviving tourist \ntravel to the region; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I again come to the floor today to \nhighlight the ongoing needs of our small businesses in the gulf coast \nwho were devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In Louisiana alone, \nthese disasters claimed 1,464 lives, destroyed more than 200,000 homes \nand 18,000 businesses and inflicted $25 billion in uninsured losses. \nMany of my colleagues here in the Senate have been down to Louisiana \nand have seen firsthand the size and scope of the destruction.\n  The Congress has been very generous in providing billions of Federal \nrecovery dollars as well as valuable Gulf Opportunity--GO--Zone tax \nincentives to help spur recovery in the region. These resources will be \nkey in the recovery of the region but there are additional needs on the \nground that still must be addressed. That is why I am proud to \nintroduce a comprehensive package of three bills today--the Gulf Coast \nBack to Business Act of 2007, the Helping Our States Through Tourism \nAct of 2007, and the Work, Hope, and Opportunity for the Disaster Area \nToday Act of 2007. I believe these three bills provide substantive, \ncommonsense solutions for addressing needs on the ground in the gulf \ncoast. I am pleased that my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, \nas well as Senator Kerry, chairman of the Senate Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, joined me in cosponsoring both the Gulf \nCoast Back to Business Act and the Helping Our States through Tourism \nAct. My friend Senator Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, also joined me by \ncosponsoring the Gulf Coast Back to Business Act. I appreciate my \ncolleagues' support on these bills and hope that we continue to work in \nthis bipartisan manner to provide real solutions for the gulf coast.\n  As you know, Katrina was the most destructive hurricane ever to hit \nthe United States. The next month, in September, Hurricane Rita hit the \nLouisiana and Texas coast. It was the second most powerful hurricane \never to hit the United States, wreaking havoc on the southwestern part \nof my State and the east Texas coast. This one-two punch devastated \nLouisiana lives, communities and jobs, stretching from Cameron Parish \nin the west to Plaquemines Parish in the east.\n  We are now rebuilding our State and the wide variety of communities \nthat were devastated by Rita and Katrina, areas representing a diverse \nmix of population, income and cultures. We hope to restore the region's \nuniqueness and its greatness. To do that, we need to rebuild our local \neconomies now and far into the future.\n  My State estimates that there were 81,000 businesses in the Katrina \nand Rita disaster zones. As I mentioned, a total of 18,752 of these \nbusinesses were catastrophically destroyed. However, on a wider scale, \naccording to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, over 125,000 small- and \nmedium-sized businesses in the gulf region were disrupted by Katrina \nand Rita. Many of these businesses have yet to resume operations\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\nand others are struggling to survive. We will never succeed without \nthese small businesses. They will be the key to the revitalization of \nthe gulf coast.\n  After talking to the business leaders and small businesses in my \nState, there are three things that they need right now: immediate \ncapital and their fair share of Federal recovery contracts, help in \nattracting more travel and tourism to the area, and tax relief, \nespecially on some of the Gulf Opportunity--GO--Zone provisions which \nare set to expire.\n  For example, under current law, the SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved disaster loan without showing collateral. This \nis to limit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. \nHowever, this disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and \nthese days, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running or \nto allow a homeowner to start making repairs. The Gulf Coast Back to \nBusiness Act increases this collateral requirement for Katrina and Rita \ndisaster loans from $10,000 to $35,000.\n  To address the lack of access to capital for our businesses, this \nbill includes a provision to provide funds to Louisiana and Mississippi \nto help small businesses now. Not 3 months from now, but as quickly as \npossible. We are asking for $100 million so that businesses can have \nmoney they need for to repair, rebuild, and pay their employees until \nthey get back up and running again. The States know what the needs of \ntheir affected businesses are and we want to provide them with this \nmoney so they can start helping businesses now. These funds would \nbolster existing State grant/loan programs and would help Louisiana and \nMississippi reach out to more impacted businesses.\n  Many businesses and homeowners are also coming up on the end of their \nstandard 1-year deferment of payment on principal and interest on their \nSBA disaster loans. For most disasters, 1 year is more than enough time \nfor borrowers to get back on their feet. But for disasters on the scale \nof Katrina and Rita, 1 year came and went, with communities just now \nseeing gas stations open and some homeowners are just now returning to \nrebuild their homes. This is a unique situation and for French Quarter \nbusinesses, where tourism is down at least 60 percent from pre-Katrina \nlevels, to require them to start making payments on a $50,000 loan is \nvirtually impossible if there are no customers. Homeowners, too, are \nexperiencing widespread uncertainty and I believe this current 1-year \ndeferment requires serious reconsideration. That is why this bill gives \nborrowers an additional year to get their lives in order--allow \nresidents to begin fixing their homes and allow businesses the time for \neconomic activity to pick back up.\n  The Gulf Coast Back to Business Act also addresses the problem in \nwhich many of our local small businesses have been unable to obtain \nFederal recovery contracts. I understand that this is due to many \nreasons ranging from a lack of sufficient bonding to a lack of \nexperience with contracts of these sizes and scope. That said, I know \nof countless local businesses with the right experience and personnel, \nyet they have had to settle for being a subcontractor on a contract \nsome out-of-State company won. We appreciate out-of-State firms wanting \nto help our region recover, but if our local firms can do the work, \nthey should get their fair share of these contracts. It is a no-brainer \nto let local firms rebuild their own communities but this has not \nhappened on a wide scale in my State or across the impacted areas. This \nbill would fix that by designating the entire Katrina and Rita disaster \narea as a Historically Underutilized Business Zone. The expansion of \nthis program to the devastated areas would help give our local small \nbusinesses a preference when they bid on Federal contracts. I should \nnote that this proposal had bipartisan support in the 109th Congress \nand actually passed the Senate as part of the Fourth Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations bill. However, despite the fact that this \nprovision had widespread, bipartisan support from the gulf coast Senate \ndelegation, it was stripped out in conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. So for the 110th Congress, I am pleased to re-\nintroduce this provision in the Senate and to work closely with my \ncolleagues to get our small businesses this vital help.\n\n  As I mentioned, following these disasters, about 18,000 businesses \nwere catastrophically destroyed, many more economically impacted, and \nmost still are struggling with the ongoing slowdown in travel and \ntourism to Louisiana. In terms of ongoing needs on the ground, the lack \nof tourism is stifling our full economic recovery, particularly the \nrecovery of our small businesses in New Orleans. I do not think that \npeople outside Louisiana know how vital tourism is to our economy. In \n2004, tourism was the State of Louisiana's second largest industry--\nemploying 175,000 workers. The tourism industry also had a $9.9 billion \neconomic impact in the State in 2004 and generated $600 million in \nState/local taxes. That is huge for our State and, by all indications, \n2004 was a record year for tourism to the State and 2005 was on course \nto beat that. But then came Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the \nsubsequent levee breaks, and tourism literally came to a grinding halt \nfor the rest of the year. Travel and tourism picked up somewhat in 2006 \nbut it has remained slow and has economically impacted our small \nbusinesses, many of which are dependent on the steady stream of revenue \ncoming in from out-of-State tourists.\n  For example, according to the New Orleans Conventions and Visitors \nBureau, Mardi Gras brings in about 700,000 tourists each year. Jazz \nFest, which is a world-renowned music festival in New Orleans that \nhappens each summer, usually draws half that--350,000 tourists. These \ntourists not only spend their time and money in New Orleans, but \noftentimes travel around South Louisiana or even visit our friends next \ndoor in Mississippi. So in this respect, New Orleans is the gateway to \ntourism elsewhere in Louisiana and the rest of the gulf coast. For this \nreason, I believe it is important to not only spur travel/tourism to \nNew Orleans but also to the rest of Louisiana and Mississippi as our \nsmaller communities in these areas depend on tourism for their economic \nwell-being.\n  Take Natchez, MS, for example. This historic town is full of \nbeautiful antebellum homes and had a thriving business district pre-\nKatrina. It suffered minimal damage during the storm but now is \nstruggling to get the word out that it is open for business. New \nOrleans is in much the same situation. Many parts of New Orleans, such \nas the Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East, do indeed have damaged \nhouses and vacant businesses--as seen on television. But there are also \nparts of these communities which are slowly recovering and many parts \nof New Orleans, particularly the historic French Quarter, which \nsurvived Katrina are relatively unscathed. Despite that they are \nopen and desperately need the revenue, businesses in the French Quarter \nare struggling to attract visitors.\n\n  With this mind, the Help Our States through Tourism Act, or HOST Act, \nwhich I am introducing as part of this legislative package, will \nprovide significant assets to help our tourism sectors recover. In \nparticular, this bill provides a total of $175 million for tourism \nmarketing for the States of Louisiana and Mississippi. This pool of \nmoney would not only be used for the promotion of the States, but also \nto help communities rebuild their tourism and cultural assets, such as \narts and music, which makes them a unique attraction for visitors.\n  The $175 million is also a wise investment for the Federal Government \nand not without precedent. In 2004, for every dollar spent on tourism \nin Mississippi, the State generated $12 in revenue. Louisiana was even \nbetter, generating $14 for every dollar spent on tourism that year. \nAlso, when we talk about small business recovery, nothing helps our \nimpacted small businesses more than having tourists return and spend \nmoney in these communities. In effect it works just as good as a grant \nbut also helps the airline industry, our local restaurants and hotels, \nas well as the small businesses themselves. Furthermore, following \nSeptember 11, Lower Manhattan was able to use supplemental Community \nDevelopment Block Grant--CDBG--funds for tourism marketing. The State \nof Louisiana also recently used $28.5 million of supplemental CDBG \nfunds for the ``Come Fall in Love With Louisiana All Over Again'' \ncampaign. Given that Katrina and Rita were the first and third most-\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\ncostliest disasters in U.S. history, as well as the unprecedented media \ncoverage on the destruction, these funds are badly needed to spread the \nword that our impacted communities are ready for our friends from \naround the country, and the world, to return and enjoy our unique \nculture, cuisine, and entertainment.\n  This bill also authorizes the U.S. Small Business Administration to \nprovide Economic Injury Disaster Loans to tourism-dependent businesses \nin Mississippi and Louisiana that can demonstrate direct economic \nimpacts from the post-Katrina and Rita tourism/travel slowdown. In \ntalking to Federal agencies as well as our local small businesses, it \nis clear to me that no one believed that the economic impact would \ncontinue this long. Businesses also expected Federal/State assistance \nmuch sooner so many were left in a position of lacking revenue but \nwaiting, and waiting, for the promised recovery funds to get into their \nhands. It has slowly come in the past year but now many businesses who \nwaited months for Federal financial assistance, are now struggling to \nstay in business with little/no customer base. These Economic Injury \nDisaster Loans would help our tourism-dependent businesses stay afloat \nsince the economic injury, as well as the tourism slowdown, has lasted \nmuch longer than most experts expected.\n  The HOST Act also would establish a $2.5 million fund in the Federal \nTreasury for Government agencies to hold conventions, workshops, and \nother events in the Katrina/Rita Disaster Area. Federal workers, like \nother convention visitors, bring in valuable revenue to our communities \nand pre-Katrina, New Orleans was one of the top convention destinations \nin the country. Post-Katrina, Federal agencies are already conducting \nactivities and holding events in the disaster areas, but this fund \nwould be separate of the normal administrative funds normally used for \nthese purposes. Since this would be a separate pool of money that \nagencies could access, it would encourage more Federal agencies to hold \ntheir big conventions/events in the gulf coast. In the scheme of the \nbillions allocated for recovery in the gulf coast, $2.5 million is not \na large sum of money, but for Federal agencies looking to hold large \nevents, it would serve as incentive to choose New Orleans or Mobile or \nNatchez for their next event. This amount of money is also not large \nenough to severely impact other destinations such as Las Vegas or San \nFrancisco, but would be just enough funds to, hopefully, steer a couple \nof large conventions in our direction.\n\n  I am also pleased to introduce the Work, Hope, and Opportunity for \nthe Disaster Area Today Act of 2007 to help small businesses in the \nhardest hit areas of the Gulf Opportunity--GO--Zone as they work to \nsucceed in a very challenging environment. We have made great progress \nin rebuilding our communities and our local economies in the gulf \ncoast. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 has produced needed \ninvestment in housing and provided businesses with important tax \nincentives to invest in new plant and equipment as part of their \nrebuilding. The Federal Government has made funding available to \nrebuild our levees. At the end of the last Congress, we passed the \nDomenici-Landrieu Outer Continental Shelf Revenue sharing bill that \nLouisiana will use to restore our wetlands as an additional barrier of \nhurricane protection.\n  However, we still face many challenges that are making it difficult \nfor our small businesses. In Louisiana, as I mentioned, tourism--one of \nour most important industries--is down. We have had 22 percent fewer \nvisitors and those that are visiting are spending 35 percent less money \nthan before the storm. The city of New Orleans has lost more than half \nof its population. On top of this, labor costs and insurance premiums \nhave skyrocketed, making it more expensive for businesses to keep \npaying the workers they have.\n  The combination of these various factors have hit our small \nbusinesses hard. They used the tax benefits of the Gulf Opportunity \nZone Act to invest and rebuild, and they are open for business. But \nthey are losing money because of downturn in tourism and they cannot \nafford to do that for much longer. I am hopeful that the HOST Act will \naddress many of these needs but additional assistance is needed.\n  The Work, Hope, and Opportunity for the Disaster Area Today Act is a \npackage of short-term tax breaks that will help put money in the hands \nof small businesses immediately, as well as extend tax breaks that \nalready exist in the GO Zone. The main tax provision is a wage tax cut \nfor employers. Small employers in the most heavily hit areas of the GO \nZone--defined as those parishes and counties that experienced 60 \npercent or higher housing damage--will be eligible for a tax credit in \nthe amount of FICA taxes they paid on up to $15,000 in salary per \nemployee. This would lower employer tax burdens immediately, leaving \nthem more money in hand as an offset to the losses that they are \nexperiencing.\n  My bill also contains a bonus business meals and entertainment \ndeduction to encourage business travel to the GO Zone. Under current \nlaw, businesses can only deduct up to 50 percent of meals and \nentertainment expenses. The Work, Hope, and Opportunity Act would allow \na full deduction for these expenses if they are incurred in the areas \nof the GO Zone that need it the most. This will bring more conventions, \nmeetings and conferences to the Gulf.\n  We must also extend some of the expiring provisions in the GO Zone \nAct. For example, my legislation will extend the special small business \nSection 179 expensing that is available in the gulf coast. Small \nbusinesses in the rest of the country can deduct up to $112,000 in 2007 \nof the cost of investments they make in their businesses such as \ncomputers and software, or new equipment and machinery. GO Zone small \nbusinesses can deduct an additional $100,000 for these investments. \nThis special GO Zone benefit, however, will expire at the end of this \nyear. The Work, Hope, and Opportunity bill will extend this much needed \nassistance until 2010. It will also extend the availability of the Work \nOpportunity Tax Credit for Katrina employees and the special 15-year \ndepreciation schedule for restaurants, retail, and other leasehold \nproperty for the GO Zone.\n  In introducing this comprehensive legislative package today, I am \nhopeful that it sends the signal to gulf coast residents and businesses \nthat Congress has not forgotten about them. Congress made great strides \nduring the 109th Congress to help disaster victims, but that does not \nmean we should just write off recurring problems to the responsibility \nof States or disaster victims themselves. There are still ongoing needs \nin the gulf coast and I believe the 110th Congress should address these \nneeds. I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to provide substantive and lasting solutions for our \nsmall businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these important pieces of legislation \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the three bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 537\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002 to promote local and regional support for sustainable bioenergy \nand biobased products, to support the future of farming, forestry, and \nland management, to develop and support local bioenergy, biobased \nproducts, and food systems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I laid out my vision for the legislation \nI introduce today, the Rural Opportunities Act of 2007, in an opinion \npiece that was published in the La Crosse Tribune at the end of last \nyear. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record \nafter my statement.\n  My bill is a four part plan to increase opportunities for rural \nAmerica. Despite its breadth, the bill is not meant to address all of \nthe challenges facing farms, other working lands and rural communities. \nI know from the listening sessions that I hold across Wisconsin about \nthe many challenges facing those communities, such as lack of access to \naffordable healthcare, threats from unfair competition abroad and at \nhome and even misguided Federal policies such as the dairy pricing \nsystem that provides higher prices based on how far your farm is from \nWisconsin. I will continue working to address these and other \nchallenges. My current bill focuses on the future, by identifying and \nencouraging potential benefits for rural areas.\n  The first section of the Rural Opportunities Act of 2007 tries to \nfulfill the potential of bioenergy and the broader bioeconomy to be a \nvalue-added enterprise for farmers and communities by encouraging \nsustainable development with an emphasis on local, farmer and \ncooperative ownership. The second theme supports both the development \nof the next generation of farmers and other rural professionals and the \nareas of agricultural growth such as organic production that provide \nviable long-term models for family farms. In an exciting win/win \nsituation, the third main section of my bill strives to improve both \nfarmers' income and access to healthy foods by supporting local food \nsystems. The final section, while less focused directly on working \nlands, would establish the goal of providing affordable broadband \naccess to rural and other underserved areas. Moreover, my proposal \ndoesn't pass any extra costs on to the next generation, but is offset \nby reducing the payment limits for the largest corporate farms and \ntransferring funds from other unobligated balances within USDA. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting these common sense goals.\n  I will now explain both the details of my proposal and how I have \nmodeled the proposal after programs that I have seen working in \nWisconsin. My goal is to both boost resources for these programs and, \nwhere appropriate, establish partnerships to fulfill common goals and \ndirection--ultimately encouraging similar opportunities across all of \nrural America.\n  Most of the incentives and support for the development of bioenergy \nand other bioproducts, or the bioeconomy, has been at the macro scale. \nI have supported these efforts, including the renewable fuels standard \nand broad goals such as providing 25 percent of our energy from \nrenewable sources by 2025 and increasing our long-term security by \nbecoming more energy independent. But I saw a gap in the amount of \nsupport at the local and regional level, especially with regard to \nmaking sure the bioeconomy develops properly.\n  There is a lot of excitement in rural America about the bioeconomy \nand potential for renewable fuel production especially to be the driver \nof a rural renaissance. But there is also concern, because while this \npotential is definitely there, it is still unclear how it will develop \nand whether the potential benefits to farmers, rural communities and \neven the environment will be fulfilled. This concern seems well \nfounded, as these macro level incentives may fall short, perhaps \nopening up a new market for corn and driving more farms toward \nintensive corn production, but doing little to add value at the local \nor regional level especially if large agribusinesses take over.\n  From an environmental standpoint there is also this combination of \nrisk and opportunity. Cellulosic ethanol produced from biomass has the \npotential to allow for the development of less intensive perennial \nsystems especially on environmentally sensitive land, where the \ncontinuous cover would benefit the soil and water quality. But if the \nonly incentive is to maximize bushels and dollars or remove too much \nbiomass, environmental damage could clearly occur. For example, land \nthat is not well suited for corn production such as that on steep \nslopes could be returned to production or taken out of pasture and put \nin corn production. Or where farmers have shifted to no-till corn \nproduction, the corn plant residue that now feeds the soil could be \ndiverted to biomass for cellulosic ethanol. While these risks exist, \nthere are also abundant win-win opportunities for farmers in following \na sustainable approach. For example, the Wisconsin Farmers Union is \nleading efforts to establish a carbon credit program so the improved \nsoil qualities also mean a return to the farmer.\n  Taking these risks and opportunities into account, it seemed that \nmore needed to be done to make sure that the development of the \nbioeconomy occurred in the best way to maximize the value to the public \nthrough an emphasis on sustainable local and regional research, \nextension and development. This emphasis isn't to say that conventional \ngrain production and large agribusinesses don't belong, just that there \nneeds to be balance. While many individuals have begun working to \nfulfill this potential in Wisconsin, there seems to be a gap at the \nFederal level. This is the gap my proposal aims to close both through \nsome new initiatives and boosting and better focusing existing Federal \nprograms.\n  My sustainable local bioeconomy proposal has six main parts, starting \nwith $30 million per year in matching funds to support implementation \nof collaborative State-based plans. States would be required to prepare \na comprehensive energy plan and support the implementation of the plan \nthrough matching funds for research, extension, energy conservation, \ntechnical assistance and direct support. When developing the plan, a \nState would need to consider ways to encourage the development so as to \nbest support the local communities and protect or even enhance the \nenvironment, with an emphasis in local, farmer and cooperative \nownership of the new enterprises. Wisconsin has already taken \nsignificant steps in this regard, starting with the Governor's \nConsortium on Biobased Industry and Biobased Industry Opportunity (BIO) \ngrant program. In the Governor's recent State of the State address, he \nhas proposed to go even further building on these initial efforts. My \nproposal would allow the Federal Government to be a partner with him \nand every other State.\n  While charting the course of development of the bioeconomy should \noccur at a State and local level, research questions are often of \nregional or even national importance. That is why my bill provides $20 \nmillion per year for regional research, extension and education. These \nmulti-state partnerships would follow the existing USDA research and \nextension divisions. Specific projects would be determined by a \nregional board with broad representation from each State, the region's \nextension service, agriculture experiment stations, agriculture \nsecretaries, farmers, foresters, businesses, cooperatives and non-\nprofits. This cooperative regional effort will bring together the \nresources to make sure these new agricultural and forestry systems can \nbe evaluated holistically at a landscape scale. Independent of my \nproposal, I understand there is a discussion ongoing to develop a \nsimilar partnership within the north central region which includes \nWisconsin. My bill is specifically designed to allow existing or future \nconsortiums\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nto coordinate or even become the regional body supporting these \nresearch and extension activities.\n  While there has been significant focus on agriculture as the means of \ndeveloping the bioeconomy and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel \nespecially, our forestlands can contribute significantly as well. While \nStates and regions will likely include forestry components in their \nstate energy and regional research and extension, my bill also provides \n$10 million per year to support a pair of specific agroforestry pilot \nprograms. The first would evaluate whether there needs to be a support \nmechanism for landowners during the establishment phase of a woody \nbiomass system which can often take up to a decade to develop, though \nit may be the best long-term use of the land both for biofuel \nproduction and for the environment. The second project would assist in \nthe development of at least one commercial scale cellulosic ethanol \nproduction facility using woody biomass as a feedstock. While I expect \nother regions with significant forestry resources to participate as \nwell, with the Forest Products Lab in Wisconsin and the Governor \nrecently proposing support for forestry-based cellulosic ethanol, \nWisconsin is well positioned to be a leader in this area.\n\n  The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements \nprogram, also known as Section 9006 of the 2002 Farm Bill, provides \ngrants to farmers and ranchers to establish a wide range of wind, \nsolar, biomass, geothermal, and conservation technologies on their \nfarms. This direct support is important, which is why I propose a \nsignificant increase in funding to $40m per year so farmers can do \ntheir part in this larger effort for energy independence farm by farm.\n  Another existing federal program that has been beneficial is the \nValue-added Production Grant (VAPG) program. These grants broadly \nassist farmers and ranchers in developing projects that help them \nretain more value from their crops and products, including many \nbioenergy projects. I propose providing an increase to $60m per year \nand shifting the funding to mandatory spending because this program is \nso important in allowing farmers to be entrepreneurs and plan their own \nfuture. Specifically for the bioeconomy, I require that at least 10% of \nthese funds be directed toward projects relating to bioenergy or \nbiobased products.\n  Without the fundamental knowledge on how to convert biomass into \nother products such as fuel and the applied research on how to best \nimplement this technology, the development of the bioeconomy may be \nlimited. For this reason, I propose to double the spending within the \nUSDA's National Research Initiative that is dedicated toward the \ndevelopment of the next generation of technology, including cellulosic \nethanol. The institutions of higher education in Wisconsin are ready to \nassist in this task and often work together or regionally toward this \ngoal. For example, The University of Wisconsin--Madison and Michigan \nState University have recently submitted a proposal to establish a \nGreat Lakes Bioenergy Research Center supported by the Department of \nEnergy. It will take this type of collaboration and involvement of \nmultiple Federal, State and local entities to fulfill the potential of \nthe bioeconomy for increasing-our national security and hopefully at \nthe same time spurring a rural renaissance.\n  Finally, but still very important, we need to assess whether our \ncurrent incentives for bioenergy production and utilization are \nperforming as intended and having no negative side-effects. There is \nsome concern that the current incentives may not be adequately reaching \nconsumers and farmers. My bill requires the Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, to evaluate whether the current incentives are the most \neffective ways to encourage the production and use of bioenergy. I \nespecially ask them to assess whether there are better ways to support \nlocal ownership and the local and regional benefits to communities, \nwhile preventing excessive payments.\n  There are many very positive efforts ongoing in Wisconsin to support \nthe development of the next generation of farmers and ranchers and to \nprovide viable models such as organic production for these new \nproducers, which also benefit existing small and medium-sized farmers \nwho are looking for other options. Like the sustainable local \nbioeconomy highlighted in the first section of my bill, I have designed \nmy proposal so these positive projects in Wisconsin are supported and \nbecome the models for other states that may not be as far along.\n  There is a very strong Federal, State, university and non-profit \ninvolvement in supporting the future of farming in Wisconsin. It is \nheartening to see so many different groups and interests coming \ntogether to work together to support this common goal. I just wanted to \nhighlight a few examples of many that make me proud.\n  From the Federal side, Wisconsin's State office of the USDA's Farm \nService Agency leads the Nation or is the top five States for various \nloans provided to beginning farmers. Fully 37 percent of the loans in \nWisconsin go to beginning farmers, a testament to the dedication of the \nState's FSA office.\n  The University of Wisconsin's Center of Integrated Agricultural \nSystems, (CIAS), continues to be both a leader in innovative ideas and \nresearch, but also in putting that knowledge to work for Wisconsin. To \npick just one of many great projects, the School for Beginning \nLivestock and Dairy Farmers provides both the knowledge and the \nmentoring and support network to help beginning farmers get off the \nground. I have followed CIAS' development and actions since my time in \nthe Wisconsin State Senate, and always appreciate their approach.\n  The future of Wisconsin's agriculture and rural communities has even \nbeen the focus of a project at the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts \nand Letters. The Future of Farming and Rural Life project has been \ngoing around the state holding forums on this important topic and I \nlook forward to their recommendations. I think they have been hearing a \nlot of the same sort of comments I hear at listening sessions in rural \nareas.\n  Organic production, especially dairy production in southwest \nWisconsin, has been a bright light in that comer of the State. The \ngrowth of this production and--potential for more growth shows a need \nfor more significant Federal support in the Farm Bill. But in the \nmeantime, the farmer-owned Organic Valley cooperative and groups such \nas the Midwest Organic and Sustainable Education Service, MOSES, are \nproviding invaluable support for the revitalization of small dairy \nfarming in the area.\n\n  The concept of cooperatives is very important in Wisconsin and often \nprovides support for these developing models of agriculture. For \nexample, the Edelweiss Graziers Cooperative in Dane and Green Counties \nwas recently established with technical assistance of the Wisconsin \nFederation of Cooperatives. This effort combines managed grazing and \ncheese making from this grass-fed milk to support both the \ncooperative's members and the local economy.\n  In addition to supporting important projects, my proposal also \nimproves on existing Federal programs. The first element of this \nsection is $30 million per year in funding for State-based \ncollaborations to plan for and support beginning farmers, ranchers and \nother rural professionals. Specifically these State plans and projects \nshould support, encourage the development of and reduce barriers for \nthe next generation of farmers, ranchers and other important rural \nprofessions such as foresters. States would have flexibility to \ndetermine where to spend the funds, but required to take a broad \napproach that incorporates extension, public colleges, State \nagriculture agencies, non-profits, private-public partnerships and \ndirect aid to support the farmers with tuition and capital.\n  The second main portion of the future of farming section of my bill \nwould fund an important Federal effort from the 2002 Farm bill, which \nunfortunately has never been funded. My bill provides $20 million per \nyear in competitive grants for the Beginning Farmer and Rancher \nDevelopment Program, BFRDP. These funds would be mandatory to make it \nmore likely the program was funded. The BFRDP funds initiatives \ndirected at new farming opportunities in the areas of education, \nextension, outreach, and technical assistance. The program is targeted \nespecially to collaborative local, State, and regionally based networks \nand partnerships.\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\n  The third main element of my future of farming proposal seeks to \nevaluate and improve existing Federal programs. This includes directing \nthe USDA to provide additional support for the Advisory Committee on \nBeginning Farmers and Ranchers to allow for increased meetings and \noutreach activities. It also proposes that this committee work with the \nUSDA Secretary to oversee a series of pilot projects, which would use \n$10 million per year to find ways to better support the credit and \ncapital needs of beginning farmers and ranchers. Also along these \nlines, the GAO would conduct a study to evaluate the effectiveness of \ntax incentives, contract guarantees and other measures that could be \nused to support and encourage the transfer of land from retiring \nfarmers to beginning farmers. Finally, my bill supports the bonus cost-\nshare provided in conservation programs and highlights the importance \nof stewardship through the Conservation Security Program for beginning \nfarmers as part of a broader review to ensure that all USDA farm \nassistance and conservation activities are accessible and useful for \nbeginning farmers and ranchers.\n  Two exciting growth areas in agriculture have been the development of \nmore sustainable agricultural systems and organic production, often \ndriven by consumers' desire to be more responsible. This increased \nsupport includes more than doubling the authorized funding for \nAppropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas, ATTRA, to $5 million \nper year and for the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, \nSARE, program to $120 million per year. The boost for SARE would also \ninclude a dedicated mandatory fund of $20 million per-year for the \nFederal-State matching grant program.\n  Organic agriculture has had the greatest growth in the past decade of \nany segment of agriculture. The funding for research, extension, \ntechnical assistance and direct aid to organic producers has not kept \nup. So my bill would provide significant increases for several existing \norganic programs and propose one new program. More specifically, \nexisting research, extension and education programs would receive $15 \nmillion per year and $25 million in additional certification cost-share \nfunds would be made available. A new $50 million per year program to \nassist with the conversion to organic production and encourage \nconservation practices on the farms is also included. Since the \nintegrity of the organic label is critical to the success of these \nefforts and there have been recent concerns about problems in this \narea, an annual report would also be required on USDA's activities to \nenforce proper use of the organic label and protect the integrity of \nthe program.\n  Finally, no proposal on the future of farming would be complete \nwithout recognizing the need to foster more diversity within the farm \ncommunity. My proposal would quadruple the current funding for outreach \nto socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers by providing $25 million \nper year in mandatory funds. This also includes an added emphasis on \nencouraging the development of new farmers from these communities by \nrequiring the USDA to periodically report to Congress on their efforts.\n  Local markets and especially food systems benefit farmers \neconomically and consumers through access to food that is often \nfresher, riper, better tasting and more nutritious. Farmers benefit \nboth by cutting out the middlemen and through differentiating their \nproducts to often get a premium price. My bill supports these local \nopportunities in several ways including giving local institutions more \nflexibility to preferentially select local products, providing \nadditional funding and areas of emphasis for existing farmers markets, \nfarm-to-cafeteria and value-added grants. A special emphasis of many of \nthe programs my bill supports is to provide healthier food to schools \nand low-income populations that might not otherwise have access to \nlocal fresh produce.\n\n  More specifically, my bill allows local preference in procurement of \nfruits and vegetables by federally supported programs. The current \nprocurement rules are often interpreted to prevent this local \ngeographic preference, so I would clarify the food procurement rules \nfor USDA and Department of Defense programs that support schools \nnutrition programs and other produce procurement, e.g., commissaries, \nto allow agencies to give a preference to locally produced products. \nThis change would allow these institutions to select local produce \nwhich is often better tasting and more nutritious. In order to provide \noversight of this modified rule, my proposal would also require any \nlocal agency that selects a bid that is more than 10 percent higher \nthan the lowest bid to report this to the Federal agency for possible \nfurther review to help ensure the integrity of the system.\n  The Farm-to-Cafeteria program or, as it is also known, the Access to \nLocal Food and School Gardens, was part of the Child Nutrition \nreauthorization. Unfortunately it has never been funded, but it would \nsupport projects like Madison's Homegrown Lunch that link local farmers \nto the cafeteria and often classroom as the students learn more about \nwhere their food comes from. My proposal dedicates $10 million per year \nin mandatory funding toward this important program.\n  There are two important programs that let low-income individuals \naccess healthy local fruit and vegetables at farmers markets which my \nproposal supports. The Seniors Farmers Market Nutrition Program would \nbe increased to $25 million per year to provide more vouchers to low-\nincome seniors. Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee helps distribute these \nvoucher and reports that it is extremely popular and could be expanded. \nA similar program, the WIC Farmers Market Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram, provides similar vouchers to low-income mothers, infants and \nchildren and would be increased to $30 million per year.\n  The proposal also supports farmers markets directly as well and \nincreases the funding for the Farmers Market Promotion Program to $20 \nmillion per year. This program provides grants to assist with the \ndevelopment of new farmers markets and also helps farmers markets \nimprove their services by doing things like installing EBT readers to \naccept Food Stamps.\n  The Value-Added Producer Grants, VAPG, program supports a variety of \nfarmer-based enterprises including support for local food systems. My \nbill already increased the funding for this program to $60 million per \nyear and would also require that 30 percent of the VAPGs go to support \nlocal food, bioenergy and bioproducts. In addition, half of these funds \nwould be dedicated to supporting mid-sized value-added chains, which \nestablish ways for mid-sized farmers to differentiate their products \nand work with distributors and retailers along a supply chain. Many \nbelieve these mid-sized value-added chains are the key to accessing \nregional markets and expanding local food systems. There are several \nexamples in Wisconsin of farmers and cheesemakers working together to \nestablish this sort of relationship and value chain in producing \nspecialty cheeses.\n  My proposal builds on the recommendations from the Community Food \nSecurity Coalition to expand the current Community Food Projects \nCompetitive Grants by providing $60.5 million per year. Community food \nprojects fight food insecurity by increasing the access of low-income \npeople to fresher, more nutritious food supplies along with projects \nthat increase the self-reliance of communities in providing for their \nown food needs.\n  Numerous studies have shown that rural areas lag behind their urban \nand suburban counterparts in access to broadband Internet services. The \nUnited States is losing ground to other nations in broadband \navailability. For example in 2001, the United States ranked 4th out of \nnations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, \nOECD. The United States now ranks 12th.\n  From my trips to rural areas of Wisconsin, I can attest that \nbroadband availability is spotty and a concern for local officials and \nresidents. They tell me that the lack of broadband access can limit \ntheir opportunities for employment, entertainment, education and \ncommunication. There have been several different ways proposed to \nincrease availability of affordable rural broadband. In this \nlegislation, I do not take a specific stand on which solution is best, \nbut I require efforts to better assess the problem and I set forth a\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\ngoal for the Senate in solving this problem.\n  More specifically, the Sense of the Senate finds that given the \ngrowing number of opportunities provided by broadband access, the \ndigital divide affecting rural households and other underserved groups \nshould be eliminated within a decade. The ultimate goal should be to \nprovide affordable access to broadband nationwide.\n  The FCC data on rural broadband availability and affordability is \nlimited in several regards, most importantly by not collecting detailed \nenough information. The zip-code level data now available does not have \na fine enough resolution to fully understand which specific areas lack \nany affordable access to broadband.\n  Even several of the FCC Commissioners agree on that point. My \nproposal requires the FCC to improve this situation to get a better \npicture of the extent of the problem.\n  As technology improves and faster data transfer rates become the \nnorm, the FCC should make sure their definition of broadband keeps up. \nMy proposal requires a periodic review of what is standard in the \nmarketplace and an update of the definition as warranted. Without this \nrequirement, the government could potentially end up subsidizing an \nobsolete service.\n  The USDA Inspector General found a number of deficiencies within the \nRural Utilities Service Broadband Grant and Loan Programs and set forth \na series of recommendations in a report in 2005. My bill would require \nthe USDA to update Congress on the progress of these changes so these \nimportant programs work efficiently and provide the increased access \nthey are designed to support.\n  The Universal Service Fund helps ensure that rural areas have \naffordable access to telecommunications services such as telephone and \n911. The program allows for the coverage to be extended to other \nservices such as broadband Internet based on a review of a Federal-\nState Joint Board. My bill requires a new review by the Joint Board \nafter receiving the updated and improved FCC data since they previously \nhad limited data and have not done such a review in several years.\n  My proposal is fully offset by reducing payments to the largest \nfarmers, transferring funds from unobligated balances within USDA and \nreallocating authorized funds that were replaced by mandatory funding \nin my legislation. This offset, especially the reduced payment limits, \nis consistent with my longstanding feeling that Federal aid should be \ndirected toward the farmers and communities that need it instead of the \nlargest producers who don't. In fact, I estimate that my proposal could \neven return a couple hundred million dollars to the treasury over 10 \nyears.\n  All too often in agriculture we are filling breaches in the safety \nnets, combating unfair trade, seeking equity in the programs such as \nthe dairy marketing orders, or ensuring the large don't take undue \nadvantage of the small. So it was a welcome change to propose ways to \nopen doors and encourage development for family farmers and rural \ncommunities.\n  I worked with many Wisconsin-based groups and individuals along with \nothers nationally and regionally in developing this legislation. I will \nwork to include my proposals in the upcoming Farm Bill or other \nlegislation.\n  I would especially like to thank the following groups and individuals \nwho have supported my legislation: Wisconsin Farmers Union; Sustainable \nAgriculture Coalition; Stan Gruszynski, Director, Rural Leadership and \nCommunity Development Program, UW Stevens Point; the Community Food \nSecurity Coalition; and the Land Stewardship Project. The National \nOrganic Coalition has also sent me a letter expressing support for the \norganic sections of my proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the letters \nfrom the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, the Land Stewardship \nProject and the National Organic Coalition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the La Crosse Tribune]\n\n                           (By Russ Feingold)\n\n       The strength of our rural communities is a big source of \n     pride in our state. Wisconsin is known not just for its \n     agricultural products, but for the special character of our \n     small towns. With a changing economy and tough challenges for \n     our hard-working farmers, it is going to take some new \n     approaches to create more opportunities for people living in \n     these rural communities that mean so much to our state.\n       The federal government has an important role to play in \n     supporting America's small towns and rural areas, which \n     contribute so much to our economy and to our strength as a \n     nation. That is why, when the new Congress starts in January, \n     I plan to introduce a bill to create more economic \n     opportunities in rural America.\n       This initiative is the last in a series of proposals I have \n     announced this year to address domestic issues raised by \n     Wisconsinites; the first three proposals took steps to reform \n     our health care system, fix our trade policy and create more \n     affordable housing.\n       My bill will support rural America in four ways: supporting \n     local bioproducts and food markets, encouraging local \n     renewable fuels and bioproducts, expanding broadband Internet \n     service in rural areas, and helping develop the next \n     generation of farmers, ranchers and land managers.\n       Developing local markets is critical for the future of \n     rural communities, since those markets help farmers get more \n     for their products and counter the power of big agribusiness. \n     My proposal would help schools link up with local farmers to \n     supply their cafeterias with locally produced products. It \n     would also provide additional funds for existing USDA \n     programs, which help develop local markets and help farmers \n     develop and sell products at these markets.\n       My bill would also boost funds to provide additional \n     vouchers--like those distributed by the Hunger Task Force in \n     Milwaukee--for low-income seniors to purchase items at \n     farmers markets. This would both provide a nutritional \n     benefit for voucher recipients and help farmers see more \n     value from their crops.\n       There is a lot of discussion about how renewable energies \n     like ethanol and biodiesel will help rural economies, but for \n     these opportunities to fulfill their potential, we need to \n     make sure the benefits stay local. We need more technical \n     assistance and other efforts to ensure that the benefits of \n     turning agricultural and forest products into fuel go back \n     into local economies.\n       Otherwise, ethanol and biodiesel plants could shift from \n     value-added local and farmer ownership to multinational \n     investment firms and energy corporations. My bill will \n     provide flexible federal matching funds for extension, \n     education and applied research purposes, as well as \n     boosting funding to develop the next generation of \n     biofuels.\n       Not surprisingly, Wisconsin is already well ahead of the \n     curve in supporting biofuels. In addition to many other \n     exciting developments statewide, Gov. Jim Doyle has \n     established a Consortium on Biobased Industry. My bill would \n     give a federal boost to such efforts in Wisconsin and every \n     other state.\n       As we support local agriculture markets, we must also help \n     rural economies grow in new directions, and broadband \n     Internet access is key to that growth. As many Wisconsinites \n     know, the availability of affordable broadband Internet \n     service in rural areas of the state is spotty. The United \n     States is falling behind some of our Western European and \n     Asian counterparts who have supported more universal access \n     to the Internet. My proposal includes a language encouraging \n     improvements in existing programs to increase Internet access \n     and a goal of universal affordable service.\n       Finally, no matter the type of farm, a common concern \n     expressed by farmers across Wisconsin is this: ``How we can \n     support the next generation of farmers, and where will they \n     come from?''\n       My bill will improve existing federal programs to better \n     serve beginning farmers and ranchers, giving them more \n     resources, and targeting those resources toward developing \n     agricultural methods appropriate for small farmers, such as \n     organic farming, farmers markets and grazing. It would also \n     provide federal matching funds for states and regions to \n     address their specific local needs.\n       I've designed my bill to allow Wisconsin to continue to \n     build upon programs such as the University of Wisconsin's \n     Center of Integrated Agricultural Systems' School for \n     Beginning Dairy Farmers. There are even regional grants to \n     encourage regional collaborations, and I could very well see \n     Wisconsin becoming the regional hub for developing the next \n     generation of dairy farmers, just as another region may focus \n     on crop production or ranching.\n       In true Wisconsin style, my bill is fully offset so that it \n     doesn't add to the deficit. The bill reforms our agricultural \n     support system by reducing the subsidies paid to the largest \n     farms, and uses the money to pay for the new assistance.\n       These efforts certainly don't address every challenge rural \n     communities face. There is much more to be done for the small \n     towns and rural areas across Wisconsin, and around the \n     country, that represent America at its best--proud \n     communities built by centuries of hard work and commitment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Sustainable Agriculture Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold, The Sustainable Agriculture \n     Coalition would like to congratulate you for introducing the \n     Rural Opportunities Act of 2007, a bill that contains\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\n     many of the reforms members of the sustainable agriculture \n     community would like to see manifested in the next Farm Bill, \n     including important provisions addressing the health and \n     sustainability of rural communities and small to mid-sized \n     family farms.\n       Reauthorization of the next Farm Bill is a critical \n     opportunity to support the revitalization of family farming \n     and ranching in the United States. Among the positive \n     transformations taking place in American agriculture is the \n     growing consumer demand for high quality, sustainably \n     produced foods from family farms. Programs that support new \n     farmers, organic production, farmer's markets, community \n     supported agriculture, and sustainably raised energy crops \n     help to increase the economic vitality of local and regional \n     economies, improve the environment, and ensure the continued \n     growth of these new markets for the next generation of family \n     farmers.\n       In particular, we want to commend you for including \n     proposals in your new bill that would create or improve the \n     Regional Bioenergy Competitive Research, Education and \n     Extension Program, Renewable Energy Systems and Energy \n     Efficiency Improvements Program, Value-Added Producers Grants \n     program, Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, \n     Sustainable Agriculture Federal-State Matching Grant Program, \n     National Organic Certification Cost-Share, National Organic \n     Conversion and Stewardship Incentive Program, Farmers Market \n     Promotion Program, and Community Food Grants. We also support \n     the language to provide geographic preference for locally \n     produced foods for federal procurement programs.\n       As you know, the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition \n     represents grassroots farm, rural, and conservation \n     organizations from across the country that together advocate \n     for federal policies and programs supporting the long-term \n     economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture, \n     natural resources and rural communities. We are committed to \n     supporting these programs and to working with your office to \n     make certain they are included in the 2007 Farm Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ferd Hoefner,\n     Policy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Organic Coalition,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing to thank you for your \n     introduction of the Rural Opportunities Act of 2007 and to \n     express the strong support of the National Organic Coalition \n     for the important organic provisions included in this \n     legislation.\n       Specifically, your bill would:\n       (1) reauthorize and increase funding for the National \n     Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which has been a \n     critical program to help organic producers and handlers \n     defray the annual costs of organic certification;\n       (2) create a new National Organic Conversion and \n     Stewardship Incentive Program to provide incentives for \n     farmers to transition their farms to certified organic \n     operations, providing assistance during the transition period \n     when farmers are incurring high costs, but are not yet \n     receiving the price benefits that comes with final \n     certification;\n       (3) reauthorize and increase funding for organic research \n     through the Organic Agricultural Research and Extension \n     Program; and,\n       (4) require USDA's National Organic Program to update \n     Congress regarding its enforcement activities and its reforms \n     in response to recent critiques by USDA's Inspector General \n     and by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\n       All of these provisions address issues of high priority for \n     the member organizations of the National Organic Coalition. \n     We look forward to working with you toward their enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steven D.

Our membership of farmers, rural \n     residents and other concerned citizens, based primarily in \n     the Upper Midwest, recognize your bill as sound public policy \n     for our nation. The bill's focus on programs that support new \n     farmers, organic production, farmers' markets, community \n     supported agriculture, and sustainably-raised energy crops \n     helps to increase the economic vitality of local and regional \n     economies, improve the environment, and ensure the continued \n     growth of new markets for the next generation of family \n     farmers.\n       The introduction of the Rural Opportunities Act underlines \n     Senator Feingold's leadership and commitment to a sustainable \n     and economically prosperous rural America.\n       Particularly important are sections in the bill that \n     provide resources to support new and beginning farmers \n     getting started on the land, such as the reauthorization and \n     funding of the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development \n     Program (BFRDP). The BFRDP, which was passed in the 2002 Farm \n     Bill but which never received funds for implementation, has \n     the opportunity to create partnerships between community-\n     based organizations and public institutions and agencies to \n     make a difference for beginning farmers and the land. We also \n     strongly support the language to provide geographic \n     preference for locally produced foods for federal procurement \n     programs such as helping schools work in conjunction with \n     local farmers to supply their cafeterias with locally \n     produced products. It is also critical that the bill provides \n     funding for the Farmers Market Promotion Program and Value \n     Added Producers Grants program, which can contribute to \n     building regional and local food systems as a growing \n     economic sector for family farmers and rural communities.\n       As the next Farm Bill is being debated, we hope many \n     elements of Rural Opportunities Act will provide direction \n     and be included in the final bill.

BROADBAND REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While data collection on broadband access and \n     affordability could be improved, several reports indicate \n     that both factors have led to a digital divide in the nation, \n     with rural areas lagging behind suburban and urban areas.\n       (2) Even as early as 2000, a joint Department of Commerce \n     and Department of Agriculture report demonstrated that there \n     was a noticeable disparity in the availability of broadband \n     access between rural and urban areas, with less than 5 \n     percent of towns smaller than 10,000 people having broadband \n     access, while 56 percent of cities with populations of \n     100,000 and 65 percent of cities with populations of 250,000 \n     have broadband access.\n       (3) A February 2002 report by the Department of Commerce \n     found that among Internet users, only 12.2 percent of such \n     users located in rural areas had high speed connections \n     versus 21.2 percent of such users located in urban areas. \n     Furthermore, the report found higher income households were \n     more likely to have broadband access than lower income \n     households.\n       (4) A September 2004 report by the Department of Commerce \n     evidenced growth in broadband subscribers among all Internet \n     users, however, the broadband access gap between rural (24.7 \n     percent) and urban areas (40.4 percent) remained.\n       (5) A May 2006 report by the Government Accountability \n     Office found that 17 percent of rural households subscribe to \n     broadband service, while suburban households had a broadband \n     subscription rate 11 percent higher and urban households had \n     a broadband subscription rate 12 percent higher than that of \n     rural households.\n       (6) A May 2006 report by the Government Accountability \n     Office found that data collected by the Federal \n     Communications Commission on broadband subscribers at a zip \n     code level was of limited usefulness for an accurate \n     assessment of local availability of broadband service, \n     especially in rural areas. Moreover such report found that \n     this lack of reliable information was a key obstacle in \n     analyzing and targeting Federal aid for increasing access to \n     broadband service.\n       (7) Even with this limited zip code level data, the most \n     recently released Federal Communications Commission data (for \n     December 31, 2005) disclosed that 11 percent fewer of the \n     lowest population density zip codes had at least 1 subscriber \n     relative to the highest population density zip codes.\n       (8) A February 2006 report prepared for the Economic \n     Development Administration of the Department of Commerce \n     found that communities with early broadband availability \n     experienced more rapid growth in employment, number of \n     businesses, and number of information technology businesses.\n       (9) The United States is losing ground relative to other \n     developed countries. According to the Organization for \n     Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States now \n     ranks 12th out of the 30 OECD countries in broadband access \n     per 100 inhabitants. In 2001, the United States ranked 4th, \n     behind only Korea, Sweden, and Canada. A similar worldwide \n     ranking by the International Telecommunications Union put the \n     United States even further behind at 16th in broadband \n     penetration.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, given the growing number of opportunities provided by \n     broadband access, the digital divide affecting rural \n     households and other underserved groups be eliminated not \n     later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act \n     with the ultimate goal of providing nationwide universal \n     access to affordable broadband.\n       (c) Improving FCC Data Collection.--\n       (1) Reporting requirements.--\n       (A) General requirements.--Not later than 180 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall revise FCC Form 477 (relating to reporting \n     requirements) to require each broadband service provider to \n     report the following information:\n       (i) Identification of where such provider provides \n     broadband service to customers, identified by zip code plus 4 \n     digit location (in this section referred to as ``service \n     area'').\n       (ii) Percentage of households and businesses in each \n     service area that are offered broadband service by such \n     provider, and the percentage of such households that \n     subscribe to each service plan offered.\n       (iii) The average price per megabyte of download speed and \n     upload speed in each service area.\n       (iv) Identification by service area of such provider's \n     broadband service's--\n\n       (I) actual average throughput; and\n       (II) contention ratio of the number of users sharing the \n     same line.\n\n       (B) Exception.--The Federal Communications Commission shall \n     exempt a broadband service provider from the requirements in \n     subparagraph (A) if the Commission determines that compliance \n     with such reporting requirements by the provider is cost \n     prohibitive, as defined by the Commission.\n       (C) Report to joint board.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications \n     Commission shall provide the Federal-State Joint Board \n     established pursuant to section 410 of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 with any and all data and analysis collected from the \n     initial set of submitted revised Form 477s.\n       (2) Demographic information for unserved areas.--The \n     Federal Communications Commission, using available Census \n     Bureau data, shall provide to Congress on an annual basis a \n     report containing the following information for each service \n     area that is not served by a broadband service provider:\n       (A) Population.\n       (B) Population density.\n       (C) Average per capita income.\n       (d) Reviews and Reports.--\n       (1) Data transfer rate.--Not later than 2 years after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and every 2 years thereafter, \n     the Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Agriculture and any other Federal agency \n     that administers a broadband program, shall revise its \n     definition of broadband to--\n       (A) reflect a data rate--\n       (i) greater than the 200 kilobits per second standard \n     established in the Commission's Section 706 Report (14 FCC \n     Rec. 2406); and\n       (ii) consistent with data rates in the marketplace; and\n       (B) promote uniformity in the definition of broadband \n     service.\n       (2) USDA report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     report on the adoption or planned adoption of the \n     recommendations contained in the September 2005 audit report \n     by the Inspector General of the United States Department of \n     Agriculture entitled ``Rural Utilities Service Broadband \n     Grant and Loan Programs''.\n       (3) Universal service.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal-State Joint Board in \n     accordance with the authority granted to such Board under \n     section 254(c)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 254(c)(2)) shall recommend to the Federal \n     Communications Commission whether advanced services such as \n     broadband service should be included in the definition of \n     universal service.\n       (B) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Federal-state joint board.--The term ``Federal-State \n     Joint Board'' means the joint board established pursuant to \n     section 410 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     410).\n       (ii) Universal service.--The term ``universal service'' \n     means services that are to be supported by Federal universal \n     support mechanisms under section 254 of the Communications \n     Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254).\n\n     SEC. 7.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \nfeasibility studies to address certain water shortages within the \nSnake, Boise, and Payette River systems in the State of Idaho, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct feasibility studies \nto address certain water shortages within the Snake, Boise, and Payette \nRiver systems in the State of Idaho. My State has experienced \nunprecedented growth in recent years. That growth, coupled with years \nof drought, has created a serious need for additional water storage. Of \ncourse, the first step in developing additional storage is the \nfeasibility process.\n  This bill provides the consent needed for the Secretary to conduct \nfurther studies of the projects that are currently underway in the \nState of Idaho that will help to alleviate water shortages in three of \nour river basins.

Res. 76\n\n       Whereas armed groups have been moving freely between Sudan, \n     Chad, and the Central African Republic, committing murder and \n     engaging in banditry, forced recruitment of soldiers, and \n     gender-based violence;\n       Whereas these and other crimes are contributing to \n     insecurity and instability throughout the region, \n     exacerbating the humanitarian crises in these countries and \n     obstructing efforts to end violence in the Darfur region of \n     Sudan and adjacent areas;\n       Whereas on January 5, 2007, the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that cross-border \n     attacks by alleged Arab militias from Sudan and related \n     intercommunal ethnic hostilities in eastern Chad had resulted \n     in the displacement of an estimated 20,000 people from Chad \n     during the previous 2 weeks and posed a direct threat to \n     camps housing refugees from Sudan;\n       Whereas these new internally displaced Chadians have \n     strained the resources of 12 UNHCR-run camps in eastern Chad \n     that are already serving more than 100,000 internally \n     displaced Chadians and 230,000 refugees from Darfur and \n     providing humanitarian support and protection to more than \n     46,000 refugees from the Central African Republic in southern \n     Chad;\n       Whereas Chadian gendarmes responsible for providing \n     security in and around the 12 UNHCR-run camps in eastern Chad \n     are too few in number, too poorly equipped, and too besieged \n     by Chadian rebel actions to carry out critical protection \n     efforts sufficiently;\n       Whereas on January 16, 2007, the United Nations' \n     Humanitarian Coordinator for the Central African Republic \n     reported that waves of violence across the north have left \n     more than 1,000,000 people in need of humanitarian \n     assistance, including 150,000 who are internally displaced, \n     while some 80,000 have fled to neighboring Chad or Cameroon;\n       Whereas in a Presidential Statement issued on January 16, \n     2007 (S/PRST/2007/2), the United Nations Security Council \n     reiterated its ``concern about the continuing instability \n     along the borders between the Sudan, Chad and the Central \n     African Republic and about the threat which this poses to the \n     safety of the civilian population and the conduct of \n     humanitarian operations'' and requested ``that the Secretary-\n     General deploy as soon as possible an advance mission to Chad \n     and the Central African Republic, in consultation with their \n     Governments'';\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\n       Whereas the Presidential Statement acknowledged ``the \n     position taken by the Central African and Chadian authorities \n     in favor in principle of such a presence and looks forward to \n     their continued engagement in preparing for it'';\n       Whereas a December 22, 2006, report of the United Nations \n     Secretary-General (S/2006/1019) expressed a need to address \n     the rapidly deteriorating security situation of Sudan, Chad, \n     and the Central African Republic and to protect civilians in \n     the border areas of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African \n     Republic and recommended a robust mission that ``would, among \n     other tasks: facilitate the political process; protect \n     civilians; monitor the human rights situation; and strengthen \n     the local judicial, police and correctional system'';\n       Whereas the December 22, 2006, report went on to recommend \n     that the force also be mandated and equipped to deter attacks \n     by armed groups and react preemptively to protect civilians, \n     including refugees and internally displaced persons, with \n     rapid reaction capabilities;\n       Whereas on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), \n     authorizing a multidimensional presence consisting of \n     political, humanitarian, military and civilian police liaison \n     officers in key locations in Chad, including in the \n     internally displaced persons and refugee camps and, if \n     necessary, in the Central African Republic;\n       Whereas continuing hostilities will undermine efforts to \n     bring security to the Darfur region of Sudan, dangerously \n     destabilize volatile political and humanitarian situations in \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, and potentially \n     disrupt progress towards peace in southern Sudan;\n       Whereas a December 2006 United Nations assessment mission \n     report outlined possibilities for a mission in Chad, \n     including a force large enough to monitor the border, deter \n     attacks, and provide civilian protection;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has requested \n     proposals for a United Nations force in Chad and the Central \n     African Republic to help protect and provide humanitarian \n     assistance to tens of thousands of civilians affected by the \n     conflict that began in Darfur; and\n       Whereas a technical assessment mission was dispatched in \n     January 2007 toward that end: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses concern for the more than 1,000,000 citizens \n     of Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic who have \n     been adversely affected by this interrelated violence and \n     instability;\n       (2) calls upon the Governments of Chad and Sudan--\n       (A) to reaffirm their commitment to the Tripoli Declaration \n     of February 8, 2006, and the N'Djamena Agreement of July 26, \n     2006;\n       (B) to refrain from any actions that violate these \n     agreements; and\n       (C) to cease all logistical, financial, and military \n     support to each others' insurgent groups;\n       (3) urges the Government of Chad to improve accountability \n     and transparency as well as the provision of basic services \n     to redeem the legitimacy of the Government in the eyes of its \n     citizens;\n       (4) urges the Government of Chad to take action to increase \n     political participation and to strengthen democratic \n     institutions to ensure that all segments of society in Chad \n     can participate in and benefit from a transparent, open, and \n     capable government;\n       (5) urges the Government of Chad, the Government of Sudan, \n     and other key regional and international stakeholders to \n     commit to another round of inclusive political negotiations \n     that can bring lasting peace and stability to the region;\n       (6) calls upon the President to advocate for the \n     appointment of a senior United Nations official to direct and \n     coordinate all international humanitarian activities on both \n     sides of Sudan's western border and expand the response to \n     emergency needs related to the political and humanitarian \n     situation in the Central African Republic;\n       (7) urges the President to utilize the resources and \n     leverage at the President's disposal to press for the \n     immediate deployment of an advance mission to eastern Chad to \n     lay the groundwork for a robust multilateral and \n     multidimensional presence;\n       (8) urges the United Nations Security Council to authorize \n     a multilateral and multidimensional peacekeeping force to \n     eastern Chad with the mandate and means--\n       (A) to ensure effective protection of civilians, \n     particularly refugees and internally displaced persons, \n     including by preempting, preventing, and deterring attacks on \n     civilians;\n       (B) to organize regular patrols along the western border of \n     Sudan and implement practical protection measures for asylum \n     seekers;\n       (C) to maintain the civilian and humanitarian nature of the \n     internally displaced persons and refugee camps in Chad and \n     facilitate the efforts of aid workers;\n       (D) to deter, monitor, investigate, and report attacks on \n     humanitarian personnel and assets;\n       (E) to provide around the clock physical security in the \n     camps and surrounding areas, including organized patrols to \n     guarantee freedom of movement to all civilians and \n     humanitarian workers;\n       (F) to coordinate and share information with humanitarian \n     organizations, actively preserve unhindered humanitarian \n     access to all displaced persons, and ensure the safety of all \n     humanitarian workers in accordance with international \n     humanitarian law;\n       (G) to collect and report evidence of human rights \n     violations and perpetrators to the United Nations on a timely \n     and regular basis; and\n       (H) to support domestic and multilateral initiatives to \n     strengthen local judicial, police, and correctional systems \n     in Chad; and\n       (9) urges the President and the international community to \n     coordinate efforts to make available sufficient resources in \n     support of this multilateral and multidimensional mission, as \n     well as adequate assistance to meet the continuing \n     humanitarian and security needs of the individuals and areas \n     most affected by this conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1809-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 237.

Today the Senate confirmed the nomination of GEN George \nCasey to be the Chief of Staff of the Army. Also, we began \nconsideration of the continuing funding resolution, and cloture has \nbeen filed on the joint resolution. However, the majority leader has \nindicated on more than one occasion that we will continue to discuss \nthe parameters of how the Senate will conclude action on the \nlegislation. There will be no rollcall votes Friday, nor will the \nSenate be in session. Also, there will not be any rollcall votes \nMonday. However, we will be in session and continue our discussions \nabout several issues, including the issue of BRAC, which has been the \nsubject of some debate today. Senators are advised that the cloture \nvote on the funding resolution will occur Tuesday morning.\n  Mr. President, at this point, in deference to the minority leader, to \nmake sure there are not any housekeeping items that should be \nconsidered before we close business, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend, the \nassistant Democratic leader, we appreciate the willingness of the \nmajority leader and the Senator from Illinois to consider the \namendments that we would like to offer to the continuing resolution. \nMembers on my side of the aisle have been on the Senate floor all \nafternoon discussing what they believe to be the shortcomings of the \ncontinuing resolution as it is currently structured. I appreciate the \nmajority taking a look at those amendments and allowing us to continue \ndiscussion about the appropriateness of making some adjustments to this \nmassive $464 billion bill.\n  I have also had some conversations with the majority leader about \nsome nominations that we hope to wrap up next week. There is a circuit \njudge reported out of the Judiciary Committee today. I have an \nunderstanding with the majority leader that judge will be confirmed \nnext week. There are some other executive branch nominations that we \nthink should not generate any controversy that, hopefully, we can wrap \nup before the Lincoln recess.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with the \nminority leader on the business ahead. We want to pass this continuing \nresolution and make sure there is no interruption in the services of \nour Government. We face an extraordinary challenge because much of the \nwork that we are doing now is work that should have been done \npreviously. But in a positive, constructive, and bipartisan fashion, I \nam confident we can complete it in time and not risk any possibility of \nshutting down the Government. So I look forward, on behalf of the \nmajority leader on our side, to working closely with the minority and \nits leader.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/08/senate-section/article/S1812-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2007, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
