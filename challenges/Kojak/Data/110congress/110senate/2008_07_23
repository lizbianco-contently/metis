Mr. President, the House is going to vote, probably \nsometime shortly after lunchtime today, on the comprehensive housing \nlegislation. I have spoken during the last month or so to Secretary \nPaulson several times. Each call he places to me--I don't call him, \neven though I feel comfortable in calling him--is because he is very \nconcerned about what is going on with the American economy. He \nrecognizes that there are deep problems, but one of the problems is \nhousing.\n  People understand more every day that it is more than just the person \nlosing their home that is a concern to us with foreclosures. There are \n8,500 new foreclosure notices every day. It is more than just that \nperson or that family in that home. It affects the neighborhood. It \naffects the government entity where the home is located\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\nbecause their taxes are no longer coming in. And, of course, it also \nhas a dramatic effect on the servicer of these loans and the ultimate \nlender of these loans. It is a situation where, if there is a \nhomebuilding turndown or cessation of homebuilding, it has a tremendous \nimpact because so many different items go into a home--carpeting, \nappliances, brickwork, landscaping. It has a tremendous pyramid effect. \nSecretary Paulson recognizes that.\n  The package that has been put together by Senator Dodd and the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, working with their \ncounterparts in the House, is a piece of legislation imperfect in \nnature but a very good piece of legislation. The package basically \nkeeps the Senate-passed bill intact but includes a variation of the \nproposal made by the administration to shore up Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac.\n  I am happy to report to everyone that the Bush administration has \nreversed its veto threat on this legislation. That is really good news \nfor the American people. But we still see, even in today's press, there \nare some Republican Senators threatening to delay and possibly try to \nderail this legislation. I have had conversations with Senator \nMcConnell, and I don't think it can be derailed. They can slow it down \na little bit. We are going to do everything we can--I am confident that \nis the case--Senator McConnell and I, to get this done just as quickly \nas we can. I hope we can finish it today. That would be great, if it \ncould go to the President today, because now that President Bush has \njoined our call to pass this crucial legislation into law, I would hope \nthose few stragglers who have said in the press they will do what they \ncan to slow this down would understand that if we have to invoke \ncloture, because it takes a couple days, it would mean another 17,000 \nforeclosures. I hope that is not necessary. The Senate doesn't need and \nour country cannot afford another filibuster on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7090-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ADVANCING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. REID. Let me briefly say on the package of bills we have put \ntogether because of the obstruction of mainly one Senator, I was \ndisappointed to read in this morning's press that a Republican Senator \nheld most of these up, saying: I am going to do everything I can to \nstall this legislation, to prevent it from passing. He may be \nsuccessful. If we don't get enough support from our Republican \ncolleagues, that, in fact, will be the case. But I hope everyone \nunderstands that this has some extremely important measures in it.\n  This package we have put together has the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nparalysis legislation. It is so important. From the time we started \nmoving forward on this legislation until today, they are both dead. One \nexperienced the paralysis; the other experienced taking care of \nSuperman, the man who was Superman and was injured in that very \nterrible accident where he was thrown from a horse.\n  We are trying to establish with this legislation a registry for \npeople who have Lou Gehrig's disease. This is a terribly difficult \ndisease. From the time one is diagnosed with it until you die is an \naverage of 18 months. We will never, ever get ahold of this disease \nunless we pass what we are trying to do in this bundled legislation. We \nare simply trying to establish a registry so that for someone in \nBaltimore, MD, who has this disease--there are about 6,000 people who \nget this disease, and then they die--someone in Las Vegas, someone in \nLouisville, someone in Chicago, there is a registry where physicians \ncan put it all together, start computerizing it so that scientists \ntrying to get ahold of this disease can look at the histories of these \npatients from around the country. That is the beginning of every \nsuccessful scientific conclusion to these diseases, so that something \ncan be done to alleviate the pain and suffering and hopefully arrive at \na cure.\n  Those are just two examples. There are many others. There are 40-odd \nbills. There is the Emmett Till bill which directs the Federal \nGovernment to do something about these unsolved murders. There is \nlegislation in here dealing with child pornography.\n  I would hope people don't look at this as taking away Senators' \nrights. This doesn't take away Senators' rights. I saw in this \nmorning's press one Senator said: Well, I don't like to start taking \naway Senators' rights. In fact, it is just the opposite. When 98 \nSenators think something should happen, why should 1 or 2 Senators \nprevent for months and months our moving forward? We had to do it once \nbefore, bundling a bunch of bills from the Energy Committee that had \nalready passed the House. These bills have all passed the House of \nRepresentatives. They have all been reported out of the committees \noverwhelmingly. I would hope that when we get to this, it can end very \nquickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7090-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7090-S7091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. REID. We have, as Democrats, made it clear that we will consider \nresponsible solutions or a solution to energy policy that would help \nalleviate the price of gas. We would hope we can do something that \nwould deal with energy supply, do something to reduce demand and \nultimately lower prices for American families.\n  Earlier this week, we offered a comprehensive proposal to address the \nenergy crisis. As a first step, though, we have offered a proposal to \nstem excessive speculation of Wall Street traders who buy and sell oil \nfutures with the click of a mouse. They have only been able to do that \nfor 8 years, but now they are doing it in huge numbers. What they do is \nthey bid the price higher and higher and leave the American people to \npay the money they are putting into their pockets.\n  I am somewhat disconcerted. We have had on this Senate floor 47 of 49 \nRepublican Senators come to the floor and talk about speculation being \na real problem with America, and gas prices. As part of their package \nof doing something about the energy crisis, they had in that \nspeculation. So we have a measure on the floor now, and they don't want \nit. They don't want to do that. It is very hard to comprehend that.\n  We know speculation is not the problem, but we do know it is a \nproblem. We know there are experts who have said that speculation has \nraised the price of oil from 20 to 50 percent. So it seems that it is \nsomething we should address and address very strongly, and that is what \nour legislation does.\n  Now, I said this is not the entire solution. Of course, not. It is a \nproblem but not the only problem. We Democrats believe there should be \nmore domestic production, and we have said that day after day after \nday. We are willing, as Senator Bingaman has so directed in public \nforums and privately--we have legislation we believe will increase \nsignificantly domestic production.\n  Right now, oil companies hold leases to 68 million acres of land on \nwhich they could be drilling but are doing nothing. It was less than 2 \nyears ago that we worked with our Republican colleagues to increase the \nability of oil companies to move into the Gulf of Mexico, which they \nsaid was the best place they wanted to go. We were generous; 8.3 \nmillion acres are now available off the coast that were not before, but \nin the 2 years the oil companies have done nothing.\n  Again, you do not have to take just what I say. Time magazine \nyesterday said if you go through all the steps for offshore drilling, \nit will take 13 to 15 years. Once you decide you are going to go out \nand take a look at it, it would take 13 to 15 years before a drop of \noil would come out under the best of circumstances.\n  So the American people obviously cannot wait 13 years for solutions \nto high energy prices. We have heard day after day, now week after \nweek, the Republicans saying the panacea, the silver bullet, is to \nallow Governors to decide where drilling should take place off the \nOuter Continental Shelf. So we have said: Fine, if you want to vote on \nthat, let's have a vote on that. We would have Senator Bingaman's \nproposal as a so-called side by side. We would vote on both of them. I \ndo not understand why now we hear from the Republican whip that the \nRepublicans want to offer 28 amendments. I have heard the statements. I \nhave heard the statements: On other bills, we have offered more than \none amendment. We have spent days debating this.\n  We are where we are. We are here. We are going to be out of session, \nhopefully, by a week from Friday. So we do\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\nnot have 3 weeks to do on this Energy bill, and we cannot do everything \nthat needs to be done with energy. But it would seem to me if we did \nsomething about speculation and solve the domestic production problem, \nas the Republicans have said they want to do--let's vote on their issue \nand let's vote on ours--it seems to me that is a pretty fair way to go. \nBut Republicans will not take yes for an answer.\n  The oil companies run full-page ads saying: Please let us drill off \nthe Outer Continental Shelf more than what we do now. Please let us do \nthat. They pay for these full-page ads. For the Republicans, that is \npart of their playbook. They go along with what the oil companies want. \nWe are saying: Go ahead. We will have a vote on that. You said for \nweeks now that is what needs to be done. In fact, they had a term that \nsaid: Talk less, drill more. So let's have a vote on their proposal.\n  But as of a short time ago, we had no one agreeing to do that. If \nthey choose to reject a vote on their drilling amendment, it will be \nleft to the American people to clearly decide--and I think it would be \npretty easy--as to who is serious about addressing the energy problems \nwe have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7091-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7091-S7092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3268\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture \ntime be yielded back and the Senate adopt the motion to proceed to S. \n3268; that once the bill is reported, the only amendments in order be \none amendment for each leader, or designee, on the subject of drilling \nand that these amendments be subject to an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold; that if the amendments do not achieve that threshold, then \nthey be withdrawn; that debate on each amendment be limited to 2 hours \neach, to be debated concurrently, equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the majority amendment first in the \nsequence; that upon disposition of both amendments, the bill be read a \nthird time, and the Senate then proceed to Calendar No. 864, H.R. 6377, \nthe House companion; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and \nthe text of S. 3268, as amended, if amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof, the bill be advanced to third reading, and the Senate then \nvote on passage of H.R. 6377, as amended, without further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we all \nagree--I know the majority leader agrees with me--and we all understand \nthe price of gas at the pump is the biggest issue in America. The only \nthing that has rivaled this in recent years was terrorism right after \n9/11.\n  The American people overwhelmingly are in favor of seeing us get at \nthe business of solving this problem. With all due respect to my friend \nfrom Nevada, to deal with the biggest issue in the country with a \ncouple amendments is not consistent with the traditions of the Senate, \nnot even consistent with the traditions of this current Senate led by \nmy good friend from Nevada.\n  On last year's Energy bill, we had 15 days on the floor. We had 16 \nrollcall votes. Forty-nine total amendments were agreed to. At the time \nwe were dealing with our Energy bill last year, the price of gas was \n$3.06 a gallon--about a dollar per gallon lower than it is now. Even \nthough it was a serious problem, it is even more serious now.\n  Back in 2005, when my party was in the majority, we had an energy \nbill on the floor. We spent 10 days on it. Gas at that time was $2.26 a \ngallon. We had 19 rollcall votes. Fifty-seven amendments were \nultimately agreed to.\n  The American people expect us to approach this issue seriously, to \ngrapple with it. I think sort of dealing with it in a dismissive \nfashion or trying to deal only with a small portion of it does not pass \nthe threshold of credibility.\n  So, Mr. President, I would object to that consent request, and I \nwould offer a counter consent request that would be more consistent--I \ndo object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That would be more consistent with the way we have \noperated on this hugely important issue, even in this Congress just a \nyear go.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds \nto the bill, it be limited to energy-related amendments only; further, \nthat the amendments be offered in an alternating fashion between the \ntwo sides; I further ask unanimous consent that the bill remain the \npending business to the exclusion of all other business, other than \nprivileged matters and other matters that the two leaders might agree \nupon.\n  Before the Chair rules, I would say to the other side that what this \nwould do would be to allow us to have a debate on this issue consistent \nwith the way we have dealt with this issue in the past, when it was not \neven the biggest issue in the country, as it is now, entirely \nconsistent with the traditions of the Senate on matters of this \nmagnitude.\n  I would say to my good friend from Nevada, what are we afraid of \nhere? Why should we not be spending our time dealing with the most \nimportant issue in the country?\n  So, Mr. President, that is the consent request I proffer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the American people here, let's check \nthis out and understand the Republicans are not even now wanting to \nmaintain the status quo. They want to go backward. They want yesterday \nforever. We are not back when we were debating other energy bills. We \nare debating today's energy crisis, and that energy crisis is pretty \nsignificant.\n  We have two issues before this body today that we should resolve. No. \n1, all experts, with rare exceptions, say the runup in prices is caused \nby speculation--20 to 50 percent. The American people could stand a \nbreak at the pump. If we pass antispeculation legislation, let's say it \nis the lower number--we only lessen gas prices by 20 percent--that is \npretty significant. Let's do simple math: $4--20 percent--that is 80 \ncents a gallon. It is then $3.20 a gallon rather than $4 a gallon. \nPretty good. That is what we are being called upon to do here today. \nThe Republicans do not want to do that.\n\n  In addition to that, get this picture: For weeks, the Republicans--\nweeks--the Republicans have been talking about they want to have \nGovernors decide what should happen off their coasts. Let's have a vote \non that. If they think that is the crucial thing to do rather than \nspeculation--drilling is their deal--let's vote on their proposal, and \nanytime we will take that as a debate we would love. We will take \ntheirs. We will have a counterproposal. We will debate those two \nissues. That is what we should do. But instead of that, the Republicans \nare running as they have done all year, dodging and feinting and \nsaying: Well, not today. Later. Later. We are saying: It is time to do \nthis now.\n  There is no question this energy thing is extremely important, and we \nshould do something about it. We say: Let's do it. Let's get the \ndomestic production thing done. Let's have a vote on that. We believe \nour proposal is extremely important, and it will certainly do a great \ndeal to affect the price of oil, not the least of which in our proposal \nis telling President Bush to do something with the huge multimillion \ngallon reserve we have, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and start \ndrawing some oil out of that. His dad did it, and it lowered prices \nsome 10 or 15 percent. So we have speculation at 20 percent minimum. We \nwill do that. We have another 10 percent. That is 30 percent. We are \nwilling to do that debate. That is a pretty significant debate.\n  We have a lot of other things we have to do--maybe not as important \nas gas prices but pretty important. Housing we have to work in here \nsometime. We have to do something with old people, senior citizens, \npeople who are infirm and disabled who benefit from LIHEAP. We want to \ndo that legislation. That is important, and that is also energy \nrelated. But we are being prevented from doing that because the \nRepublicans\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\nwant to live yesterday again. We want to look to the future. That is \nwhy we believe speculation is where we should be. We should also do \nsomething about domestic production.\n  Finally, there are other things. We are going to have a recess. The \nnational conventions are coming. We have to come back in the fall and \ncomplete our work and that could take a significant period of time. But \nwe also have to do something with renewable energy. That is one of the \nmain things pending--renewable energy--and we have been prevented from \ndoing that.\n  Why? Listen to this one. Because the Republicans do not want to pay \nfor it. They want to continue, as we have done with the Iraq war, \nspending $5,000 every second in borrowed money. We have been told by \nthe House of Representatives--and I have a letter with 218 signatures \non it--saying: Send us the bill for renewables, and send it quickly, \nbut you cannot have it not paid for. You have to pay for it. We have \ntwo pay-fors. We are going to tax the hedge fund companies, but they \nagree it should be done because they are manipulating the system by \ngoing offshore playing around with their taxes. Even the hedge fund \noperators say: That is right, we should not be able to do that. But the \nRepublicans are holding that up.\n  In answer to the energy problems of this country, Sun, wind, \ngeothermal, biomass, that is where the future of our country is, as \nindicated by a staunch lifetime Republican by the name of T. Boone \nPickens. Eighty-one years old, and he has suddenly become bipartisan. I \nam happy about that. I have great admiration and respect for T. Boone \nPickens. T. Boone Pickens has said: I have made my fortune in oil, and \nthat is not where it is. His words were: I don't want to leave this \nEarth thinking all I was interested in was making money. I want to \nchange this country. What he wants to do is have a few years--5, 6 \nyears--where there would be a bridge using natural gas, and then it \nwould all be done with renewable energy. That is T. Boone Pickens, and \nhe is putting his personal fortune on the line to do that.\n  Al Gore has done a wonderful job presenting the problem. T. Boone \nPickens has done a wonderful job of pointing out to the American people \nwhat the solution is. That is what we should be doing--not debating how \nmany amendments will be offered. We want to do something on \nspeculation. We want to do something on domestic production. That is a \npretty good step forward for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7092-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I notice my good friend from Nevada did \nnot mention T. Boone Pickens' views on whether speculation is a part of \nthe problem. Republicans are perfectly happy to have a speculation \ncomponent of the overall issue. But if we are in the business of \nquoting T. Boone Pickens, I had a chance to meet with him for an hour \non Monday. He told me, without equivocation, he did not think \nspeculation had anything to do with this particular runup. I do not \nknow whether it does. I think most of my Members are in favor of \ntransparency. We want to put more cops on the beat to make sure the \nmarkets are working properly. But if we are quoting Pickens, I am sure \nI will be safe in saying Pickens would not be voting for this bill that \nthe majority leader thinks is the way we ought to go.\n  Right now in Lexington, KY, and Las Vegas, NV, and every other city \nand town across the country, Americans are hurting from high gas \nprices. Right now, there is a man watching his hard-earned paycheck go \ninto his gas tank instead of his daughter's college fund. That man \ndoesn't care about cloture motions or second-degree amendments; he \nwants Congress to do something. He wants us to act.\n  We have all heard the frustrations from constituents literally for \nmonths. They have made their feelings known. So we were surprised \nyesterday to learn about the intentions of our friends across the aisle \nwhen it comes to high gas prices. The majority leader told reporters \nthat voting on more than one amendment per side--this is in some ways \nalmost laughable--voting on more than one amendment per side on the No. \n1 domestic issue facing our Nation is unreasonable.\n  Let me repeat that. Our friends on the other side are saying that \nhaving a real debate and considering good ideas from all sides is too \nmuch for the Senate to handle. They have apparently rejected the idea \nof finding a serious solution to high gas prices. Instead, they want us \nto take up a proposal that is designed to fail. They want us to try to \nfool our constituents into believing we are addressing this problem in \na serious way, when everyone knows we are not.\n  It is no surprise that the Democratic leadership won't allow \nAmericans' top priorities to be heard. It is the same reason they have \nbeen canceling hearings and markups all week. They don't want to choose \nbetween their Presidential nominee--whose position on bringing down gas \nprices is: No, we can't--and the demands of the guy at the gas pump who \nis watching his daughter's college fund shrink with every gallon he \nputs in the tank.\n  It is a sad commentary, given the propositions they made. Our friends \nacross the aisle promised a year-and-a-half ago in their ``Six for 06'' \npledge to lower gas prices and to free America from dependence on \nforeign oil, but things didn't turn out exactly as planned. The fact \nis, a gallon of gas is now $1.70 higher than it was when the new \nmajority took over and promised to lower it. At a time when Americans \nare clamoring for them to make good on their pledge, they must muster \nthe political will to do something about it. We should not be content \nto leave town after a couple of failed votes and a speculation proposal \nthat no serious economist in America believes will have a significant \nimpact by itself on the price of gas.\n  Let me reiterate. The Republicans believe we can strengthen the \nfutures markets. Our bill would do just that--the Gas Price Reduction \nAct. If bad actors are out there, we would like to find them by putting \nmore cops on the beat and by bringing greater transparency to the \nmarket, but we don't claim this provision alone will solve the problem. \nNo serious person would claim that. The other side has made the \nastonishing claim that the speculation provision alone will lower the \nprice of gas by 20 to 50 percent. Yet I have found no one--not the \nchairman of the Federal Reserve, not the 27-nation International Energy \nAgency, not even the most famous rich Democrat in America, Warren \nBuffett--to back up that claim.\n  Yesterday, our colleague, the junior Senator from Texas, asked here \non the floor for any citation backing up such a claim. My good friend \nthe majority leader came back to the floor to respond, but the only \nperson he could name who had made this claim had been so thoroughly \ndiscredited here in the Senate that the Democratic chairman of the \nSenate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a stinging 11-\npage rebuttal of his recent testimony. In testimony before the \ncommittee, the majority leader's source--a lawyer, not an economist--\nclaimed that ``overnight,'' the speculation bill dealing with energy \ncommodities would ``bring down the price of crude oil, I believe, by 25 \npercent.''\n  The committee's public response to this notion of an overnight \nreduction of 25 percent was blunt. Here is what the committee had to \nsay:\n\n       There is no credible evidence that simply amending the \n     Commodities Exchange Act to regulate energy commodities as if \n     they were agricultural commodities will lead to lower energy \n     prices.\n\n  So in other words, the one source our friends across the aisle point \nto when they claim their bill will lower the cost of energy by 20 to 50 \npercent is the subject of an 11-page, bipartisan rebuke which says \nthere is zero credible evidence to support his claim.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the report from the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  Let me say it again: We, as do our friends, support legislation that \nkeeps bad actors from driving up gas prices. We have addressed this in \nour own bill, the gas price reduction bill, but serious people \nunderstand that if this activity\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nis occurring, it is a small portion of the overall problem.\n  This leads me to a broader point. The price of gas at the pump is a \nserious national problem that requires a serious legislative response. \nWe cannot solve this problem with timid, half-hearted measures. We need \nto act boldly, and that means we need to consider good ideas from both \nsides, as we have typically done when dealing with the biggest issues \nin the country. Now is not the time to be timid or to play political \ngames that are designed to benefit a single party. Our job, it seems to \nme, is to help the man or woman at the gas pump who is making hard \nchoices in order to keep his gas tank full. That is why it is so \nirresponsible to shortchange this debate. Until we have acted boldly to \ncut gas prices and our reliance on Middle East oil, we will be ignoring \nthe demands of the American people.\n  So it is time to be serious about this problem. No more unsupportable \noutlandish claims, no more relying on discredited testimony, no more \ncanceling markups simply to avoid taking votes on a serious approach to \nlowering the price of gas at the pump.\n  We need to find more and we need to use less, and we need to start \nnow. We need to consider good ideas from all sides, and we need to take \nseriously that energy is the No. 1 domestic issue facing our Nation. We \nsimply can't go through a failed process, claim credit for trying, and \nthen pack up and go home. Let's get serious. Let's open this debate to \nmore than one good idea rather than bring it to a premature conclusion, \nand let's find a solution that incorporates increased domestic supply \nas well as conservation. We need to find more and use less, and the \nAmerican people are simply demanding no less from us.\n  I see the Senator from New Hampshire is here.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, would the Republican leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield to my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand the proposal from the Democratic leader, \nit would not allow an amendment, for example, on oil shale. As I \nunderstand it, the Democratic proposal suggests that we use the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. That would give us an estimated 3.5 days \nof oil. Were we to be able to extract oil shale, as I understand it, we \nwould have the potential for 40,000 days of oil.\n  I guess my question to the Republican leader is if we are going to \nhave a comprehensive energy policy, shouldn't we at least take up the \nissue of whether the restrictions which have been placed on the ability \nto use oil--which restrictions have been offered by the Democratic \nParty--shouldn't an amendment on that issue be allowed, as well as an \namendment on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New Hampshire, \nof course. That moratorium was installed by this new majority last year \nto shut down this promising new source that we have right here in our \ncountry, some have estimated as much oil as the entire reserves in \nSaudi Arabia times three.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Republican leader's answer on that.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator was not talking.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I also have a question for the minority \nleader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I am trying to understand basically the differences between \nthe proposals that have been put forth by the majority leader and by \nthe minority leader in terms of unanimous consent requests. As I \nunderstand it, they basically boil down to the following, and I wonder \nif the Senator could confirm this for me.\n  What the majority leader has said is there could be either one \namendment--or possibly two, I am not clear--but that they would pit the \ntwo sides against each other; that is, a Democratic proposal and a \nRepublican proposal.\n  What I believe the minority leader has suggested is that we engage in \nwhat Senators call the regular order, which is a process of debate and \nproposals for amendments which would try to build a bill with \namendments that could actually be adopted by both sides--or by Members \non either side, let me put it that way--rather than simply having two \nparty positions, neither of which could win 60 votes, would fail, and \ntherefore we would end up with nothing. What the minority leader is \nsuggesting is a process by which both Democrats and Republicans could \noffer ideas--pieces of the puzzle, as it were--that could appeal to \nMembers on both sides in such a way that a bill could eventually be \nbuilt and passed to actually do something about this energy crisis and \nthe high cost of oil; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think my friend from Arizona is correct. What I \nproposed to the majority leader and to the Senate--to which he \nobjected, unfortunately--was that we proceed on this measure related to \nthe subject that is most on the minds of the American people in a way \nentirely consistent with the way we have dealt with energy in the past \nwhen it wasn't the No. 1 issue in the country.\n  Last year when we were on an energy measure, the way we proceeded \ninvolved 15 days on the floor, it involved 16 rollcall votes and the \nadoption of 49 amendments. I say to my friend from Arizona, at that \ntime gasoline was way too high, but it wasn't nearly as high as it is \nnow. It was $3.06 a gallon; now it is about a dollar a gallon higher. \nThat was in this Congress.\n  In 2005, when our party was in the majority, we passed an energy \nbill, and we spent 10 days on the floor. At that time gas was $2.26 a \ngallon. We had 19 rollcall votes, 57 amendments were adopted, and we \npassed the bill.\n  So if we were treating the subject of energy in a credible way \nconsistent with Senate traditions in 2005 when it wasn't the No. 1 \nissue and in 2007 when it wasn't the No. 1 issue in the country, my \nthought is why in the world would we be trying to do something less \nthan that--something that doesn't give all Senators, many of whom have \ngood ideas to propose on both sides of the aisle, an opportunity to \ncraft a proposal that gets at the No. 1 issue in the country. That is \nwhat my unanimous consent request would have allowed. I proffered it a \nwhile ago. It was objected to. It would have allowed us to have energy-\nrelated amendments only, I would say to my friend from Arizona, that we \nwould rotate from side to side--a Republican amendment and then a \nDemocratic amendment--and we wouldn't put a sort of arbitrary timeline \non ending the discussion prematurely before we had dealt with the \nproblem.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from New \nHampshire----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader has the floor \nunder leadership time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if the Republican leader would entertain \nanother question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would be happy to yield to my friend from New \nHampshire for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Republican leader has made the point that we need to \nhave a good piece of legislation, something that can be bipartisan in \nthe area of drilling. Hopefully, we can also have an equally bipartisan \neffort in the area of oil shale.\n  Isn't it also likely we could probably have a bipartisan amendment on \nthe issue of how we bring more nuclear power online, and shouldn't that \nbe considered as part of any energy solution, because it addresses the \nenvironmental concerns which the Democratic leader spoke of so well \nrelative to making sure we have clean energy? Shouldn't that also be \npart of any package such as this? Isn't it also totally reasonable that \nwe could allow these types of amendments and do it in a fairly orderly \nway and in a quick way within this week, and certainly within next \nweek, which is a small amount of time and certainly a reasonable amount \nof time, considering the fact that the American people continue to pay \nsuch extraordinary fees at the gas pump and expect us to act?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from New Hampshire that under the \nconsent agreement I proffered, to which there was an objection lodged \nby the majority leader, such an amendment would have been entirely \nappropriate, and as he suggests, entirely\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nconsistent with the subject that I know my good friend, the majority \nleader, cares deeply about.\n  He brought up in the Senate a climate change measure back in the \nfirst week of June--something he obviously felt was important. We spent \na number of days on it. Many people feel nuclear power is one of the \nbest solutions to the climate change issue, an entirely relevant \nsubject to energy, and would have been permitted under the consent \nagreement that I offered earlier.\n  So I think the point is well made, that it is the kind of amendment \nyou would normally expect in the Senate on the biggest issue in the \ncountry to be offering, debating, and voting on.\n  I see my friend from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the distinguished minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have been listening to the colloquy and the \nquestions and the urging all of us have been making to have an open \namendment process.\n  I wonder if the Republican leader, the Senator from Kentucky, is \naware that we actually have a vehicle that would increase production, \nand the process could be done immediately, and that is through the \nappropriations bills that have been steadily marked up by the \nAppropriations Committee. But is the leader aware that the markup for \nThursday was canceled?\n  It was canceled because the Interior appropriations bill, which has \nthe moratorium against offshore drilling and shale production, is in \nthat bill, and there was going to be an amendment offered by myself and \nSenators Domenici and Bond to take that moratorium off so that we could \ndo something for the American people to bring the price down and start \nproduction and use our own resources. But that markup was canceled. I \nwanted to see if the leader was aware of that and what possible reasons \ncould there be for not having the opportunity, again, to address this \nissue of production.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might say to my friend from Texas \nthat I was surprised to learn that not only was the meeting canceled, \nthe rationale for canceling the meeting was announced by the chairman \nas being precisely what the Senator from Texas suggests, which was the \navoidance of having to vote on the question of offshore drilling.\n  The last two surveys I looked at--one is a Fox survey and one a CNN \nsurvey--indicated that over 70 percent of the American people believe \nwe ought to move in previously off-limits offshore areas to increase \nAmerican production. I was surprised to see that the chairman of the \ncommittee doesn't want to allow a vote on that. It strikes me that \nthere is a lot of dodging and weaving going on here to try to avoid \nvoting on the things the American people are clearly asking us to do.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for raising that issue. Does she have \nanother question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would just say that the \nAppropriations Committee and this Senate have had a tradition of \nbipartisan participation, and there is a great bipartisan bill for the \nInterior to be able to go forward, and we have the chance to address \nthe issues of the congressional moratorium in a bipartisan way. There \nis no other bar to being able to let the States explore on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, and the States that have oil shale reserves, to be \nable to open those, and that bipartisan spirit has been in the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  So I just saw that we have this opportunity on the Senate floor right \nnow to work all weekend, with amendments, deciding what the majority of \nthe Senate wants to do. We have something that is an opportunity that I \nhope we will take, and that is to let the American people see the \ndebate and let the American people decide if we have some proposals \nthat would increase production, and would that in fact bring down the \nprice of oil and gasoline at the pump right now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The appropriations process has certainly been used in \nthe past to achieve the opposite result. I believe the process was used \nlast year to put a moratorium on going forward with the development of \noil shale, much of which is found in Utah. I see our friend from Utah. \nSo it is not at all inappropriate, it strikes me, for the \nappropriations process to consider the other side of the equation, \nwhich is to actually provide additional domestic production.\n  It is pretty clear what is going on here, I say to my friend from \nTexas. There is a great effort to avoid having the Senate go on record \non the issues that are on the minds of the American people, that they \nbelieve--I think correctly--would take us in the direction of moving \ntoward energy independence, which is something that clearly has not \nbeen accomplished.\n  Mr. President, this is an important debate which I and most of my \nMembers think we ought to continue to be on for many days, and to try \nto achieve an accomplishment for the American people that would make a \ndifference. I don't think we should be afraid of this issue. That is \nwhat the Senate is here to do--grapple with the big issues confronting \nthe country. This is the biggest one. It is time that we dealt with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what the American people are now watching is \nwhat has been taking place for 18 months. The Republicans said they \nwanted a vote on drilling. We offered them a vote on drilling. They \ncannot take yes for an answer.\n  We have had statement after statement by people who say drilling is \nimportant. But remember what Senator McCain said. The Republican \nnominee for President, John McCain, said drilling wouldn't make any \ndifference; it is only psychological. Think about that. They have been \ntalking for weeks about drilling.\n  We say: OK, let's have a vote on drilling.\n  They say: No, we don't want a vote on drilling, we want the open \namendment process.\n  That is a buzzword for: Folks, we are not going to do anything.\n  If they want a vote on shale, I thought that would be part of their \namendment. If they want a vote on shale, we will give them a vote on \nshale. They want a vote on nuclear. We could limit the time on those \nthree amendments. We are happy to do that if they want a vote on \ndrilling, shale, and nuclear.\n  Of course, Mr. President, everybody knows, as Senator McCain has \nsaid, these are only psychological things. We know that shale would \ntake at least 15 years, even if we started doing something about it \nyesterday. We know that, regarding nuclear, there hasn't been a new \nnuclear plant built in 40 to 50 years, and there likely would not be \nin the near future.\n\n  These are only ploys by the Republicans to avoid voting on what they \nsaid is the best thing. They go through all this stuff about the \nappropriations process. The appropriations bills are going nowhere \nbecause of George Bush, the President. Remember, last year, he had us \nwhere he wanted us. We had to do everything he wanted because, \notherwise, we would have to deal with him in January after a CR. Well, \nwe will not have to deal with this guy anymore; after January 20, he is \ngone.\n  To suggest that in some way I have said we are only going to have one \namendment--I didn't say that. We made a unanimous consent request \nasking them to do what they said they wanted. They said they wanted \ndrilling. OK, drill. Vote on that. We believe our domestic production \nis much better than theirs.\n  Now, let's talk about a few other things, Mr. President. These are \nthe words of my Republican counterpart: ``Timid, half-hearted, bobbing \nand weaving.'' Talk about bobbing and weaving--we give them what they \nwant and they say no.\n  Now, on speculation, we have done this before, and we will do it \nagain.\n  Economist Mark Zandi said speculation is driving up oil prices.\n  Gary Ramm of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America blamed \nspeculation for driving up oil prices. He did that less than a month \nago.\n  The Acting Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said \nthe oil markets are ``ripe for those wanting to illegally manipulate \nthe market.''\n  The former Director of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's \nTrade Division, Michael Greenberger--\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nnow a professor at the University of Maryland Law School--said \nspeculation is one of the big problems with the energy problem. He also \nsaid the price has gone up 20 to 50 percent because of speculation.\n  The Japanese Government said speculation added $30 to $40 to the cost \nof each barrel of oil last year.\n  Consumer advocate, Mark Cooper, testified that speculation on energy \nhas cost the American people $500 billion in the last 2 years.\n  Now, let's take one of the pals of the Republicans. ExxonMobil Senior \nVice President Stephen Simon testified that ``the price of oil should \nbe about $55 a barrel.'' It is speculation, Mr. President.\n  So the Republicans are where they have been for 18 months. They still \nhave their nose out of joint because we are in the majority. It is a \nslim majority. They have done everything to slow down, stop, or \ndisguise their stalling.\n  We have said we think we should do something about speculation. Now \nthey say it is no big deal. We are willing to vote on what they think--\nand they have been saying it for a month--is the most important thing \nto do: drill off the Outer Continental Shelf. We are saying: Good, draw \nup your amendment and let's vote on it.\n  Now they say oil shale, and now--it is remarkable--they are back-\ntalking about nuclear. If you want to talk about the only thing that \nuses more water than coal, it is nuclear. There isn't enough water in \nNevada to have a nuclear powerplant. It is in the West. That is why \nthey are usually on oceans or rivers because they need huge amounts of \nwater.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the record is clear, I ask the Senator, we want to \nconsider the impact of speculation on energy prices and whether it is \nraising the cost of a barrel of oil and the cost of a gallon of \ngasoline--we believe it is--and we want to put in more regulators to \nwatch this industry, add more transparency, more computer capacity, \nmake sure there is more disclosure from markets around the world.\n  We want to limit the trades to commercial trades that really have \nvalue to businesses rather than just speculators, as the leader said, \nclicking a mouse and moving around millions of dollars. And we want to \noffer this as an amendment.\n  I ask the majority leader, did we say to the Republican side: You can \noffer your own version of the speculation amendment, and you can try to \nstrike ours, if you wish. Offer yours. But we are giving you the \nopportunity to offer your amendment, in your terms, with your \nsubstantive suggestions, and we will vote on each one of them. Is that \nthe offer on the table to the Republicans?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, they are not seriously \ntrying to solve the problem. They are stalling, as they have done for \n18 months. My friend, the Republican leader, said--to answer the \nquestion of the senior Senator from Illinois, the assistant leader--\nthat no serious person has suggested that speculation has anything to \ndo with the price runup.\n  Talk about a serious person. Glenn Tilton is running a company that \nwe have all heard of, United Airlines. United Airlines is trying to \nhang on without going bankrupt. Is this just some corporate executive \nwho has an idea that the price of oil is too high? He is also a former \npresident of Texaco and formerly the vice chairman of Chevron, so he \nhas a little background.\n  He said speculation is a big problem. My friend, the Democratic whip, \nattended a meeting where he desperately told us we needed to do \nsomething about speculation. Does he remember that meeting?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I ask the majority leader, if we believe that \nspeculation on energy prices is part of the problem, and we have a \nmeasure to try to address it, and we say to the Republicans ``offer \nyour version of it,'' are we stopping them from the substance of the \namendment that they offer? Are they able, under our proposal, our \nsuggestion, to put whatever they want into their version of the \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. We have been saying that for weeks. Certainly, since our \nbill has been on the Senate floor, it has been clear--and I have said \nit on the floor many times--if they don't like our speculation bill, \ncome up with a better one.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have also offered to the Republicans to put together \ntheir Energy bill, to include in their Energy bill what they think is \nimportant. Day after day, in press conference after press conference, \nthey say drill, drill, drill--which they could include in their Energy \nbill. We have heard talk about oil shale. We have not objected to them \nputting a provision for that in their bill.\n  Senator Gregg said, ``Let's bring in nuclear power.'' If we said to \nthem, write your own bill, bring it to the floor, and we will debate it \nand have a vote, with the same number of votes on both sides, and let's \nsee who prevails, have we restricted the Republicans in anything that \nthey include in their Energy bill in the proposal we have given to \nthem?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that we have not stopped them from doing \nanything. We have oil shale as part of our proposal. Senator Bingaman \nput that in as part of his bill. So I relish the debate of our proposal \nand theirs. I suggested 2 hours. If they want more time, that would be \nfine. But they want to live yesterday. They want to live yesterday \nforever. The status quo isn't even good enough for them now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The last question I ask the leader is----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Democratic \nwhip--the Republican leader took a lot of time, and I have no problem \nwith that. So I ask unanimous consent that the Democratic whip be \nallowed to finish his question.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This will be my last question. I wanted to do a \ncalculation. When we talked to the Republicans 2 days ago, they \nsuggested that at that time they had 28 amendments they wanted to \noffer. We are hoping to wrap up this session without stopping for the \nweekend by going 10 straight days.\n  I heard from the Republican leader that in a previous debate over the \nspan of 15 days of debate on the floor of the Senate, there were 19 \nrollcall votes. If I do the simple math here of 28 separate Republican \namendments to start with 2 days ago, there is no way in 10 days we \ncould finish this debate on the Energy bill before the August recess.\n  I ask the majority leader, does the math work in terms of opening \nthis to as many amendments as people can dream up and actually \nfinishing within 10 days?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, that is what they want, \nand in the process housing is gone, it is a casualty; the Lou Gehrig \nregistry is gone; the Reeve paralysis bill is gone; we don't do \nanything about LIHEAP to help the disabled and old people who are going \nto freeze this winter, and we don't do anything about renewables. But \nthis would be in keeping with the 83 filibusters that have taken so \nmuch time, 83 Republican-led filibusters.\n  They are not serious about this. We have tried. We have told them: \nHere is what we will do. They cannot take yes for an answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7095-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I sat and listened to this exchange, and it \nis\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\namazing to me after 32 years in the Senate that they want to bring up a \nbill and allow their bill and one substitute amendment that they know \nwill fail, where there are components of that substitute amendment that \nthey know will pass and will help us to find some oil and alleviate \nsome of the pressures we have in this country.\n  I wish to address the legislation under consideration in the Senate \ntoday, the speculator bill.\n  Here we are, the Congress of the greatest Nation in the world, facing \na national energy crisis, a crisis that affects every single American, \nthe American economy, and America's place in the world, and this is the \nbest we can do, this speculator bill? This is our answer, another \nproposal that will not produce one drop of oil or hardly any energy? It \nwill not produce any energy. Frankly, I am embarrassed for this body \nand for the people we represent.\n  At some point, I wonder when the leaders of the Democratic Party will \nwake up and realize that blaming and taxing the energy industry does \nnot equate to an energy policy. It is an anti-energy policy. Finding \nsomeone to blame is no substitute for finding more oil. And the answer \nto getting America to use less oil is not always more taxes and more \nmandates.\n  We are a country of addicts in that sense. The seeds of our addiction \nto foreign oil have been sown here by an anti-oil Congress. If Members \nof Congress are hunting for some of the blame, they are in luck because \nthe blame begins and ends right here under the Capitol dome.\n  It is very clear that the most extreme environmental groups have an \nanti-oil agenda, and it is just as clear that the Democrats have \nadopted that agenda as their energy platform. It is a recipe for \ndisaster, and America is reaping the whirlwind as a result.\n  Some are arguing for more solar, wind, and geothermal as an answer to \nhigh gas prices. I sponsored the current tax incentives for renewable \nelectricity, and I hope my actions speak to my support for renewables. \nThat is law now in the 2005 act. I know enough about energy to \nrecognize trains, planes, automobiles, and ships do not run on \nelectricity. They run on oil right now.\n  This first chart is solar, wind, and geothermal. They are not \ntransportation fuels. Biofuels is still only 3 percent of \ntransportation fuels, and yet that is the only other major alternative \nto oil at the present time. We rely on oil for 97 percent of our \ntransportation needs, and the other 3 percent is made up mostly of \nbiofuels, especially corn ethanol. I have strongly opposed the current \nethanol mandate, but I have long supported free-market incentives for \nethanol. In fact, I sponsored the CLEAR Act, as I mentioned, which is \nthe current law giving tax incentives for E85 fuel and E85 \ninfrastructure. We need as much ethanol as we can make, and I am all \nfor it. But I also recognize that ethanol has so many inherent \nlimitations that it will not be able to break us free from our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  The fact is that we will have to tap into our Nation's gigantic \nresources of oil shale or we will remain addicted to foreign energy \ntraffickers for the long haul. They are afraid to have a separate \namendment up on oil shale because we should win that amendment. Anybody \nwith brains would vote for it. There are 3 trillion barrels of oil in \nColorado, Wyoming, and Utah, in oil shale, about 2 trillion of which is \nestimated recoverable--more oil than all the rest of the world \ncombined. If we don't tap into those resources, we are going to remain \naddicted to foreign energy traffickers for the long haul.\n  When the Republicans controlled Congress in 2005, we passed a very \nbipartisan energy bill which promoted each of these very necessary \nunconventional oil resources, along with alternatives, renewables, and \nconservation. When the Democrats took over Congress, they immediately \nbegan dismantling every effort to develop oil from oil shale, oil \nsands, and coal-to-liquids even though they knew full well that we have \nmore oil in those resources than all the rest of the world combined.\n  Chart 2 says world oil reserves are 1.6 trillion barrels. Recoverable \nU.S. oil shale is between 1 and 2 trillion barrels of oil.\n  In most cases, an addiction brings about financial ruin. Democrats in \nCongress have made a lot of noise about the tens of billions of dollars \nwe spend each year on the war on terror, but apparently it does not \nbother them as much that our citizens send more than $700 billion every \nyear to foreign governments to feed our addiction, some of which are \nnot even friends; in fact, some of which are enemies. Congress's \nlamebrained anti-oil actions have put our people at the mercy of \nforeign governments that are smart enough to produce their own energy--\nsomething we could do if they would open this bill to amendment. We are \nselling away our Nation's place in the world and funding the rise of \nour most aggressive competitors and even our enemies.\n  Of the major world oil shale resources, we hold 72 percent of the \ntotal. We can see Israel, Estonia, China, Australia, Morocco, Jordan, \nBrazil, United States, and the total world. Did you know, Mr. \nPresident, that China and Brazil have been smart enough to produce \ntheir own oil from oil shale for decades--China and Brazil--and that \nEstonia has produced oil from oil shale for over 90 years? We act as if \nwe cannot do it. My gosh, of course, we can do it. Did you know the \nUnited States controls more than 70 percent of the world's known oil \nshale resources? Yet we are stopping its development because of their \nanti-oil agenda over there, and that is what is involved here, trying \nto cover it up with a so-called speculators bill that all of us will be \nglad to have in a final bill, but that does not produce one drop of oil \nto help our problems.\n  Is it because our industry cannot compete or is it unwilling to \ninvest in oil shale production? They most definitely are willing, but \nthe sad fact is that our own Government owns most of the oil shale in \nthe United States and our own Government has said no because of these \npeople over here.\n\n  The biggest argument I keep hearing against oil shale development is \nwe cannot allow the Government to even establish rules for oil shale \ndevelopment because we just plain don't know enough about it yet. Think \nof Estonia: For 90 years, they have been producing oil from oil shale. \nThink of Brazil: For decades, they have been producing oil from oil \nshale. You think the greatest Nation in the world can't do it? We don't \nknow how much water it will use; we don't know how much wildlife \nhabitat it will use, they say; we don't know about the greenhouse gas \nfootprint. Guess what. The Department of Energy has been studying oil \nshale for decades, and we have a pretty good idea about each of those \nquestions.\n  Why do the Democrats say no to oil shale production? I hear some say \nthey are concerned about water use. Let's take a look at water use \ncompared to ethanol.\n  Mr. President, did you know oil shale uses less water than ethanol, \nno more than gasoline? Right now, corn does not rely on irrigation, for \nthe most part. However, if we hope to increase ethanol's share of the \nfuel supply, we will have to move into drier areas that require \nirrigation.\n  Look at the water use. Ethanol takes 4 to 5 barrels of water and \n1,000 barrels of water on irrigated lands. Oil shale, for the entire \nprocess--processing, upgrading, and land restoration--three barrels of \nwater. A September 2007 article in Southwest Hydrology states that \nirrigated corn requires well over 700 barrels of water for each barrel \nof ethanol. A barrel of ethanol has about 30 percent less energy than a \nbarrel of oil. In other words, to make just 1 oil-equivalent barrel of \nethanol, it would take over 1,000 barrels of water. The Department of \nEnergy reports that oil shale, for the entire process, including land \nrestoration, would require just three barrels of water for every barrel \nof shale oil, about the same as gasoline.\n  Let's compare how much water it would take to make enough ethanol to \nproduce 20 percent of our fuel with the amount of water it would take \nto produce the same amount of oil shale. Look at what it would take. \nLook at the red, ethanol. We can hardly see the red of the water \nrequired for oil shale. We would need about 64 cubic miles of water to \nproduce that much ethanol and only .17 cubic miles of water to produce \nthe same amount of oil shale.\n  It is time we stop confusing oil shale with Canadian oil sands. They \nrequire\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\ncompletely different processes. Canadian oil sand production uses a lot \nof water and a lot of steam to produce oil from oil sands. With oil \nshale, you apply heat directly to the rock. The last thing you want in \nyour process is water. They are very different, so let's stop \npretending they are the same thing. And let's remember Estonia and \nBrazil. Isn't this country as good as them?\n  The other red herring often raised against oil shale is concern about \nland use and wildlife habitat. Mr. President, did you know that oil \nshale uses much less land than either ethanol or gasoline? One acre of \ncorn produces 7 to 10 barrels of ethanol. One acre in the oil patch \nproduces about 10,000 barrels of oil. One acre of oil shale produces \nbetween 100,000 and 1 million-plus barrels of shale oil. That is right, \non average, 1 acre of oil shale will produce around 500,000 barrels of \noil.\n  So those who are truly concerned about land use and wildlife habitat, \nlet's look at how much land it would take to make enough ethanol for 20 \npercent of our fuel supply compared to the same amount of oil shale.\n  With regard to that green spot in the middle of this chart, it would \ntake those five States to produce 20 percent of our energy needs from \nethanol. Think about that. Producing 20 percent of our oil from oil \nshale would take the equivalent of the smallest county in Kansas being \nin production at one time, and as each oil shale acreage is used, it \nwould be restored to nature, according to the very strict mining and \ngas laws already on the books. It is environmentally sound as well.\n  We are learning that land use is very important, and not just in \nterms of wildlife habitat and watershed protections. Scientists have \ndetermined that disturbing land for activities such as cultivating corn \nand switchgrass, or any other crop, releases a giant amount of \nCO2 into the atmosphere.\n  Look at this chart. Oil shale without carbon capture, 7 percent more \nthan gasoline, but switchgrass for ethanol, including land use, is 50 \npercent more than gasoline. Greenhouse gas emissions for corn ethanol, \nincluding land use, is 93 percent more than gasoline. Oil shale is much \nmore environmentally sound from the get-go.\n  Even taking into account that burning ethanol is an improvement over \ngasoline, the researchers discovered that when land disturbance is \ncalculated, corn ethanol emits 93 percent more greenhouse gases than \ngasoline. Thank goodness for switchgrass, our new hope for the future \nof biofuels. The problem is that the same study calculates that \nswitchgrass, even when grown on existing corn land, produces 60 percent \nmore carbon emissions than gasoline. The Department of Energy \ncalculates that oil shale production emits only 7 percent more \ngreenhouse gases than gasoline, and that is without any carbon capture \ntechnology, which many in the industry plan to use.\n  Whether your concern is carbon emissions, water use, or wildlife \nhabitat, oil shale is a better answer than ethanol. And when it comes \nto transportation fuels, ethanol is the only alternative of any real \nsignificance today. The fact is that I am for it, but let's not get \nconfused on which one is more efficient and better. I am certainly not \nhere to bash ethanol. I still believe we should produce as much as \npossible, but ethanol is the only current significant alternative to \ntransportation fuels available today. It is important that we start \ndealing in realities around here and not just political puffery, is \nwhat we are hearing from the other side.\n  To be honest, when it comes to energy policy, it is like never-never \nland on Capitol Hill. On the one hand, we pass a giant mandate on top \nof giant incentives to produce ethanol, with all its limitations. On \nthe other hand, we ban oil shale production which would give our people \naccess to almost unlimited amounts of cheap energy. The oil shale \nindustry is not asking for any mandates, environmental loopholes, or \nsubsidies. They simply ask to have access to the Federal Government's \nvast oil shale resources.\n  I have no problem with debating the impact of speculation on oil \nprices. It is something we ought to be discussing. I have no problem \nwith that. But it is not going to produce one drop of oil. It is no \nsubstitute for providing our people with the transportation fuels they \nneed, and we will never accomplish that goal until we find more and use \nless.\n  Our goal as Republicans is to amend this bill so we can find more oil \nand use less of it so that we can solve our problems as we go into the \nfuture, where we get into not only hybrids but plug-in hybrids, \nelectric motors, fuel-cell motors, hydrogen cars and, of course, \nnuclear, wind, solar, thermal, and geothermal. We have to do all of \nthat. But until we can really move down that line, we have to have oil \nto run our transportation needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Tennessee \nis recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, will you let me know when I have \nconsumed 9 minutes, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I listened to the Democratic leader discuss the \nlegislative calendar. With respect, I believe the Democratic leadership \nin the Senate is approaching the crisis of $4 gasoline with all the \nurgency of naming a post office. It seems their idea is to talk until \nthere is one amendment over there and one amendment over here, both of \nwhich may fail, and then go on to the next thing.\n  I have just come back from 4 days in Tennessee. I believe that if I \nwalked down the street in Nashville or Maryville or Knoxville or \nwherever and talked to 100 people and said: What do you think we ought \nto be doing in the Senate? I would get the same answer. It would be \nthis: We would like for you to go do something serious about $4 \ngasoline prices and we would like you to work across party lines to get \nit done.\n  We are ready to do that, we on the Republican side, and I think many \nDemocrats are as well. Yet what the Democratic leadership did was bring \nup a bill on Friday that addresses oil speculation and put us in a \nprocedural situation where all we can do is talk and talk and talk. We \ncould have started last Friday with amendments on finding more oil and \nusing less oil. We have 25 or 30 on this side. I will bet there are \nthat many on the other side--I will bet there are more than that. We \ncould be on our fifth day of debating and voting on a substantial piece \nof legislation to increase the supply of American energy and reduce our \nuse of oil, which is the way to lower gasoline prices. That is what we \nshould do today. If we do not do it today, we should do it tomorrow. We \nshould not stop until we get it done. That is why we are here. That is \nwhat the American people expect of us.\n  The majority leader has brought up a bill about speculation. There is \nnothing wrong with that. It is his right to do that. We recognize that, \nbecause in the Republican bill we offered, we suggested we would find \nmore oil by drilling offshore and giving States the option to do that \non their shores, and by lifting the moratorium from oil shale final \nregulations--that would increase American production of oil by a third. \nThat is substantial. We are the third largest producer of oil in the \nworld. That may help affect prices. On the other side, we want to use \nless oil, and we would do that by making plug-in cars and trucks \ncommonplace, cars and trucks powered by electricity, which would reduce \nour use of oil. If we did those three things on the find more and use \nless side, we could cut our use of imported oil in half over time, \nwhich would stop sending about $250 or $300 billion a year overseas to \nother countries, some of which are paying terrorists who are trying to \nkill us.\n  But oil speculation has its limits. Oil speculation is a part of our \nbill. We believe we should put 100 cops on the block. We need more cops \non the block who are commodities regulators. We need to find out more \nabout these new financial instruments and the effect they might be \nhaving on the price of oil. But you cannot deal with oil speculation \nunless you deal with supply and demand.\n  The Interagency Task Force on Commodity Markets has been studying \nthis question for 5 years. They said today--I heard it on National \nPublic Radio because I drove in early--their interim report on crude \noil studied fundamental supply and demand factors and\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\nthe roles of various market participants, and it found that ``the \nfundamental supply and demand factors provide the best explanation for \nthe recent crude oil price increases.'' That is what the Government \nsays.\n  Here is what a private sector individual, who has been pretty \nsuccessful, says--Warren Buffett: ``It is not speculation, it is supply \nand demand.''\n\n  We can deal with oil speculation. We have proposed doing that in the \nGas Price Reduction Act. But saying that by passing a bill on oil \nspeculation we deal with $4 gas would be like saying we are passing a \nbill on thirst without dealing with water. We have to move on to supply \nand demand. That is why we say we should be finding more and using \nless.\n  In Tennessee yesterday, Nissan announced that it was entering into an \nagreement with the State of Tennessee and the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority to make our State hospitable for a pure electric car that \nNissan intends to have on the market for fleets by 2010 and for \nindividuals by 2012. According in Nissan's plans, the car will go 100 \nmiles without having to be recharged. Carlos Ghosn, the president of \nNissan and Renault, wants a zero emissions or an emissions-free car on \nthe market. He wants counties and mayors who want that to be able to \nhave it in their fleets.\n  That is part of the Gas Price Reduction Act proposal. We understand \nwe have to reduce demand as well as increase supply. But the other side \nis stuck on using only half of the law of supply and demand. They have \nforgotten economics 101. We say offshore drilling. They say no, we \ncan't. We say oil shale. They say no, we can't. We say five or six new \nnuclear powerplants a year so we can have clean electricity for our \nplug-in cars and trucks. They say no, we can't.\n  We say bring up gas prices and put it on the Senate floor and let's \nstay here until we finish. I heard all this talk about the legislative \ncalendar. The legislative calendar isn't more important than the family \nbudget. The legislative calendar is not more important than the family \nbudget, and what is breaking the family budget today is gasoline \nprices. Four-dollar gasoline is driving up the price for fueling our \ncars and trucks. It is driving up the cost of food because, as we know, \nenergy is such an important part of agriculture.\n  People are hurting. Every week, I am on the floor reading e-mails \nfrom Tennesseans who are canceling their vacations, losing their jobs, \nunable to go get medical treatment because they cannot afford the price \nof gasoline. What are we doing? We are talking when the Democratic \nleader could instantly put us into a situation where we could spend a \nweek or 10 days considering two or three dozen good amendments, vote \nthem up or down, and see if we could work across party lines to come to \na result.\n  Will we solve every problem in a week's debate in a bill we pass \nbefore August? No, of course not. We really should be on the path \ntoward clean energy independence. I suggested in May that we need a new \nManhattan Project, like the one we had in World War II for the atom \nbomb, where we have a crash program for 5 years on the things we don't \nknow how to do, such as make solar power competitive with fossil fuels \nor reprocess nuclear waste so it can be stored more easily or make more \nnew buildings green buildings or advanced research on biofuels--crops \nwe don't eat.\n  But there are some things we know how to do today. Mr. President, 85 \npercent of the Outer Continental Shelf, where we have the opportunity \nto produce oil and gas, is, by congressional action, off limits today. \nIt was off limits according to the President's action too, but he \nchanged the Presidential order last week. What happened? The price of \noil went down. I don't know exactly to what extent the President's \naction had an effect on the price of oil, but I do know this: If we \nwere to take action today on supply and demand, the price of gasoline \ntoday would stabilize and begin to go down because today's price is \nbased upon the expected supply and demand 3 to 5 years from now. If we \ndemonstrate in our proposal, as our proposal says, that the United \nStates of America, which consumes 25 percent of all the energy in the \nworld, is prepared to increase our production of oil by a third and \nreduce our use of oil by a sixth, that together would reduce the supply \nof imported oil; it would cut it in half. If we did that today, it \nwould affect the price of oil today.\n  Our solution is four words: Find more, use less.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Find more, use less. We believe in both parts of the \nsupply and demand. The other side is dancing around. I think they have \nbadly misjudged the American people and the urgency of this question. \nWe need to do everything we can in the next week or so to fashion a \nbill that takes a substantial step toward increasing the supply and \nreducing demand for oil--not saying no, we can't; no, we can't; no, we \ncan't. We can say yes, we can, to finding more and using less, and the \nAmerican people expect us to do that. That is why we are here. We can \nstart today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nspeak in morning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, America is suffering a gas price crisis. In \nresponse, our Democratic colleagues are blocking our attempts to get \ngas prices down for new oil supplies. Yesterday, Senate Democrats went \nso far as to cancel an Appropriations Committee markup over fears that \nan amendment to open offshore oil production would succeed.\n  Senator Hutchison of Texas and I had announced our intention to offer \nan amendment to rescind the continuing moratorium in appropriations \nbills that currently blocks new oil production off our Atlantic and \nPacific shores. With the support of Senators Domenici, Alexander, and \nall the committee Republicans, we would have given the Appropriations \nCommittee a chance to reverse the annual law blocking America from new \noil supplies. I suppose they were afraid we would win the vote, and \nthat is why they canceled the meeting. How undemocratic can you get? \nYou are afraid to lose a vote? Cancel the vote.\n  We have been struggling all year with Democrats blocking Republicans \nfrom offering amendments on the Senate floor. Democrats are saying \ncurrently that they will block Republicans from offering amendments to \nlower gas prices by increasing oil production. Afraid to vote on the \nfloor? Block the vote. Cancel the vote. Block the vote.\n  What is next? Will Democrats try to disband the Senate or have the \nmajority leader act as a Rules Committee so only what he says can be \nvoted on on the floor? That is not the way this Senate acts.\n  Why is this so hard? Why are Democrats so desperate to deny the \nrelief the American people need and are demanding? Maybe things are \ndifferent in New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, and California, but I can \ntell you Missouri families are struggling with record pain at the pump. \nNot just families, Missouri truckers and small businesses and \ncharitable institutions and local governments are suffering from \nrecord-high prices. Diesel prices are driving truckers out of business. \nMissouri farmers are fed up with high energy costs. They do not need to \nhear, as our Presidential candidate from Illinois said, that the \nproblem is not that gasoline prices have gone up; the problem is they \nwent up too quickly. I can tell the Senator from Illinois that the \npeople of Missouri are fed up with both the speed and the level of gas \nprice increases. Four-dollar gasoline is as popular in Missouri as a \nBelgian company trying to buy out Budweiser.\n  Missourians know this is a fundamental problem. We all learned it in \neconomics 101. Prices are high because there is not enough supply to \nmeet demand. We need to find more and we need to use less. There is \nplenty out there to find, if only they will allow us to go and get it.\n  We have heard the numbers before, but let me repeat them again. At \nleast 18 billion barrels of oil are waiting for us in the waters off \nour Atlantic and Pacific shores. That is 10 years of supplies we can \ngive ourselves. Republicans plan to add 10 years of new supplies versus \na Democratic plan to open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would \ngive us, by that rate, 3.5 days more oil supply.\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\n  Today's new Democratic half measure--it is not even a half measure, \nit is not a quarter measure, it is not an eighth measure--is to swap \nsweet crude for heavy crude in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, again \nto get a little more gasoline when the oil is refined. It still takes \nrefining capacity. It is still a Band-Aid that is not even well placed \nover the wound.\n  These Democratic ideas for ``new supplies'' keep getting smaller and \nsmaller, weaker and weaker. They say: Well, drill where you have \nleases. It is called exploring. And when you explore, you did not find \nsomething, you do not drill, it goes back to the Government. That is \nalready the law. Give us a break.\n  At prices as they are today, if there is oil out there, if they see \nan opportunity to get it, the oil companies are going to go after it, \nbecause that is how they make money. That is how they make the money \nthey invest in developing more oil supplies.\n  We are not forgetting that the biggest thing we can do, the boldest \nthing we can do, the most aggressive thing we can do is to increase \ndomestic oil supply. And that is exactly what we will need to end this \ngas price crisis.\n  Yes, there are other things--using less. I come from a battery State. \nWe need a major American battery manufacturer, because right now most \nof the batteries coming in for hybrid and hybrid plug-in cars come from \nAsia. We need to put Americans to work in a large facility or \nfacilities making batteries that will run electric cars.\n  These are the big ideas. American people do not deserve small \nDemocratic ideas. They do not deserve modest Democratic ideas. They do \nnot deserve timid Democratic ideas. The American people deserve bold \naction, the American people deserve aggressive action, the American \npeople deserve real action. It is time we get real about gas prices.\n  We need to stop putting offshore oil off limits. Give us a vote to \nopen more offshore oil production. That is what we propose. That is \nwhat we demand. That is what the American people deserve. We cannot \nfulfill our duty to the American people by walking away from half a \nloaf, a half a small loaf solution without giving the American people \nthe right to see where their elected Senators are going to vote in \nterms of providing the big relief we need for a big problem. We need to \nhave votes and we need to move on that oil bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, unless we change course, our Nation will \nsoon be sending $1 trillion a year abroad to purchase foreign oil, and \nno amount of drilling is going to change that. That is why I am \nfrustrated that we are wasting valuable time here on the Senate floor \ndebating last century's policies instead of talking about tomorrow's \nsolutions.\n  We know that today we are facing an oil crisis, but we also know that \nwith less than 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, there is no way \nthe United States is going to drill its way out of this quagmire. \nAmerican families and businesses are depending on us to put aggressive \nnew policies in place, not continue to dwell on the old policies that \nare not going to provide any relief at the pump.\n  Unfortunately, it seems as though there are some who only want to \nfocus on big oil's top priority; that is, lifting the moratorium on \nOuter Continental Shelf drilling.\n  Pro-drilling advocates, and certainly the President of the United \nStates, seem perfectly comfortable perpetuating what I think is a cruel \nhoax on the American people saying that drilling will lower oil prices. \nThey are willing to imply, to insinuate, and to pretend that drilling \noff of our coastlines will somehow provide relief at the pump or \nsomehow lessen our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.\n  The reality is even the biggest drilling advocates admit that opening \nour Nation's pristine coastlines will have no impact on pricing at the \npump. That is right, no impact.\n  In fact, the President of the United States, on June 15, said:\n\n       I readily concede that, you know, it is not going to \n     produce a barrel of oil tomorrow, but it is going to change \n     the psychology.\n\n  My colleague who is running for President seemed to say a similar \nthing:\n\n       I do not see any immediate relief, but even though it will \n     take some years, the fact that we are exploiting these \n     reserves would have a psychological impact that I think is \n     beneficial.\n\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, a senior adviser for Senator \nMcCain also acknowledged in a news conference in a call to reporters \nthat:\n\n       New offshore drilling would have no immediate impact on \n     supplies or gas prices.\n\n  In fact, the White House went on to say the same thing:\n\n       There's not a real good short-term answer to high oil \n     prices, and we've been very explicit about that from the \n     beginning.\n\n  So I think it is safe to say many people are confused about what is \nbeing discussed here on the floor.\n  Another White House spokesman said:\n\n       Anyone out there saying that something can be done \n     overnight or in a matter of months to deal with the high \n     prices of gasoline is trying to fool people.\n\n  Now, this is from the same White House and Republicans that are now \nadvocating that maybe there is a psychological advantage here that \nsomehow supply that we will not see until 2030 could have an impact on \ngas prices today.\n  Well let me tell you what some energy experts told the Energy \nCommittee's roundtable on oil prices Roundtable this past week. And for \nthose of you who did not attend--we had many of our colleagues attend--\nwe had two expert witnesses, Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge \nEnergy Research Associates, an author of a very well-known book about \noil, and Roger Diwan, an energy analyst at PFC Energy. They both firmly \nrejected the notion that the President's announcement he was breaking \nthe Outer Continental withdrawal moratorium somehow caused a drop in \noil prices. They were asked that question and basically laughed at the \nsuggestion that lifting the moratorium could cause a drop in oil \nprices.\n  For those who want to pretend that opening up drilling could have any \npsychological effect, I think this chart illustrates what is going on. \nWe see here on the left that prices are forcing Americans to basically \nconsume less. Basically they are using 800,000 fewer barrels of oil \nthan we did this time last year. But that certainly has not had a \npsychological impact on the price. We know that Saudi Arabia, here in \nthe middle, announced that they were going to increase output by \n500,000 more barrels a day. That announcement did not have any \nimmediate impact. In fact, we saw oil prices surge to $140 a barrel.\n\n  So the lesson here is that even though these are significant \nreductions in demand and increases in supply happening it is not \nimpacting world old price. So how can some of my colleagues argue that \nby producing 200,000 barrels a day, which is what the Outer Continental \nShelf drilling would get you, that somehow that is going to have a \npsychological effect? How can they make that case when this amount of \nreduction of consumption cannot, and this amount of new supply did not; \nthat somehow by producing 200,000 more barrels per day in 2030 is going \nto magically reduce prices today. I think what is clear is it does not \nmatter how many oil fields we have, or how many holes we poke in the \nground, it is not going to bring down the price. Only by ending our oil \naddiction and providing Americans with real energy solutions can we do \nthat.\n  I am not the only one who believes that. The administration's own \nEnergy Department has said similar things. In fact, in the Energy \nInformation Administration's 2007 Annual Energy Outlook they have said:\n\n       Access to the Pacific, Atlantic, and eastern Gulf regions \n     would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and \n     natural gas production or prices before 2030.\n\n  No impact before 2030. That is 22 years from now. In 22 years, we \nneed to have a significant reduction in fossil fuels or our climate \nwill be giving us a lot more things to worry about than the price of \noil.\n  Scientists are now telling us there is a 75-percent chance within 5 \nyears the entire North Polar icecap will completely disappear in the \nsummer months.\n  According to Tufts University, doing nothing about global warming \nwill cost the United States economy more than\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\n3.6 percent of our gross domestic product or $3.8 trillion annually by \n2100.\n  So why are we talking about taking on all of this risk of drilling in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf? For what? We are talking about something \nthat is a fraction of the demand of oil the United States is going to \nneed in the future.\n  In fact, the Energy Information Administration says we will be using \n22.6 million barrels a day in 2030. But the most we would get from the \nOuter Continental Shelf drilling would less than 1 percent of what the \nUnited States will need in the future. So some of my colleagues have \nstaked America's energy future on a proposal that is going to give us \nless than 1 percent of what the United States needs today.\n  In fact, the Energy Information Administration continued on this \ndiscussion and said that drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf and \nlifting the moratorium, that these 200,000 barrels a day would have a \nminimal impact on what the United States needs.\n  This particular chart shows you how much additional supply we will \nneed, 2 million barrels more a day than we are currently using today. \nAnd this is what the Outer Continental Shelf will give us, only 200,000 \nbarrels per day. So it is not exactly as if this is going to help much \nif at all in the future.\n  In fact, the Energy Information Office continues to say:\n\n       Because oil prices are determined on the international \n     market, any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to \n     be insignificant.\n\n  That is an analysis of drilling in all the offshore areas currently \nin moratorium. So the math is simple. Even if we drill in every last \ncorner of our Nation, we would never be able to have an impact on world \noil prices. The world price is always going to be set by others, \nleaving a critical aspect of our economy in the hands of OPEC.\n  As long as we use a quarter of the world's oil and have less than 2 \npercent of the world's oil reserves, facts that no amount of drilling \ncan change, our country is vulnerable. It reminds me of the old adage: \nIf you are in a hole, stop digging. But some want us to keep digging, \ndigging toward a meager 200,000 barrels a day.\n  And that 200,000 barrels assumes that drilling off the coast of the \nAtlantic and Pacific is something people will want to do.\n  We have already heard from some States that think the risks are too \ngreat to their economies. For example we will not be able to drill the \n10 billion barrels that are covered under the Federal ban off the coast \nof California, a State where bipartisan opposition exists to further \ndrilling.\n  Here is what Governor Schwarzenegger said recently:\n\n       California's coastline is an international treasure. I do \n     not support lifting this moratorium on new drilling off of \n     our coast.\n\n  The Governor added:\n\n       We are in this situation because of our dependence on \n     traditional petroleum-based oil. The direction our country \n     needs to go in, and where California is already headed, is \n     towards greater innovation in new technologies and new fuel \n     choices for consumers. That is the way we will ultimately \n     reduce fuel costs and also protect our environment.\n\n  I could not agree with the Governor more.\n  Governor Schwarzenegger is not alone in his straight talk because \nthere are many citizens across the country from coastal States who also \nknow the impact of what oil spills can have, that it can mean billions \nof dollars in economic loss. Ask the tens of thousands of people who \nlost their livelihood after the Exxon Valdez. I know some of my \ncolleagues have made remarks that new technology somehow makes spills \nfrom offshore platforms impossible. I know the minority leader said \nrecently there was not a single reported example of spillage in the \ngulf during the Katrina hurricane.\n  I respectfully--and I mean respectfully--ask the minority leader if \nhe has seen the President's own report on lessons learned from the \nFederal response to Katrina. This is a copy of the cover of the report. \nIt says:\n\n       Hurricane Katrina caused at least ten oil spills, releasing \n     the same quantity of oil as some of the worst oil spills in \n     U.S. history.\n\n  There it is. A report that basically says it caused ``ten oil spills, \nreleasing the same quantity of oil as some of the worst oil spills in \nU.S. history.''\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       All told, more than 7.4 million gallons of oil poured into \n     the Gulf Coast region's waterways, over two thirds of the \n     amount that spilled out during America's worst oil disaster, \n     the rupturing of the Exxon Valdez tanker off the Alaskan \n     coast in 1989.\n\n  This is a satellite image of the Gulf of Mexico on September 2, 2005, \nright after Hurricane Katrina hit. It shows the various areas of oil \nspills that did, in fact, happen.\n  Although there are oil risks, the fact is that most of our Nation's \nrecoverable oil supplies and related infrastructure are, for better, or \nworse, in the Gulf of Mexico. That is not to say we can't have \nenvironmentally responsible oil and gas recovery. In fact, many of my \nSenate colleagues did support in 2006 opening more of the gulf waters \nafter President Bush issued a Presidential directive stopping some of \nthe drilling that was endorsed by the previous administration. But in \nhindsight, opening the gulf seemed to be another lesson in how we are \nnot going to help impact the price. Back when we opened 6 million acres \nin lease 181, many oil companies promised it would have a dramatic \neffect on new production. It was going to be an incredible find. The \nprice was at $57 a barrel.\n  But a year later the price was already $89 a barrel and we all know \nthe price today. Obviously, access to more drilling didn't help us \nimpact the price of oil then.\n  And with prices so high, why did the oil companies bid on only 200 \nmillion acres of the 500 million acres recently put out for bid in the \nGulf of Mexico? Not utilizing existing leases seems to be a pattern \nwith oil companies. In fact, many oil companies are not using 83 \npercent of the public offshore lands they have tied up in leases. That \nis an area larger than the States of New York or Alabama that is just \nsitting idle. This chart shows that 83 percent of the leases offshore \nare not producing energy, and the oil companies are choosing to only \nuse this area in the green.\n  Why don't we hear more about why they aren't choosing to drill? It \ndoesn't make sense, given what the price is. We know one of the reasons \nmay be that every single available drill rig, drill ship is being used \nright now. You can't go and drill when you don't have the equipment. \nAccording to the House of Representatives, oil companies have access to \nover 100 billion barrels of conventional oil in areas not under \nmoratorium. That is how much is already there in existence on land that \ncan be leased. It is already there. It is already available. But \nclearly the oil companies can't, or it is in their financial interest \nnot to, utilize this vast amount of public land they already have.\n  The fact is, depending on oil companies to get us out of this mess is \nexactly what has gotten us into this mess. It is not a viable solution. \nWe need to break our addiction to oil.\n  The question is, What can we do today to help bring supply and demand \ninto balance? Last week, Dr. Yergin told us at the gas prices forum:\n\n       If Americans took a few precautionary steps when driving, \n     including properly inflating their tires, demand for oil \n     would decrease by 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day.\n\n  That is something we can do now, not in 10 years, not 20 years. We \ncan do it now. In fact, there are many things we can do now to reduce \nour dependence on oil. More efficient tires is one of them at 300,000 \nbarrels per day; keeping your car tuned, 400,000 barrels a day; \ncommuting with an extra passenger once a week, 200,000; keeping tires \nproperly inflated, 200,000; and other ideas. These are things that can \nhave an impact today, not like drilling which will only have an \ninsignificant impact and only in 2030.\n  These are the things we should be working on aggressively. These are \nthe low-hanging fruit we should be grabbing. Drivers are desperately \nseeking any measure that they can use to lower prices at the pump. That \nis why the Bush administration should speed up its rulemaking on a \nprovision in the 2007 energy bill that established fuel efficiency tire \nlabeling. We need a national campaign of public awareness to show \nconsumers how to properly inflate their tires. I am for giving away air \npressure gauges at the stations and making sure there is a national \neducation program in place. We can start helping consumers today.\n  According to tests by the Consumers Union, choosing the right tires \nand maintaining them with the proper pressure can save consumers about \n$100\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nbased on today's gas prices. It is critically important we take actions \nsuch as this that will help consumers, that will give them some relief.\n  To me, the debate over drilling highlights a generational change that \nwe actually need in Congress. Americans know it instinctively. They \nknow many of our institutions and safety nets are not working when it \ncomes to this issue.\n  Think of what a different situation we would be in if we had spent \nthe last 8 years acting more aggressively to build a clean energy \nfuture that our country desperately needs. For example, we could have \nbeen investing more in plug-in electric hybrid vehicles, which would \nhave had a tremendous impact on oil addiction. The Pacific Northwest \nNational Lab found that our current electricity infrastructure could \nsupport an estimated 70 percent of America's passenger vehicle fleet. \nSeventy percent of our Nation's cars could be supported by today's \nelectricity grid, if we would have gotten plug-in hybrids into the \nmarketplace. Fully utilizing the grid would displace 6.5 million \nbarrels of oil a day, an amount equivalent to 50 percent of what we \nimport, and cut our greenhouse gases by 20 percent. That is the type of \npolicy we should have been pursuing.\n  Juxtaposed to drilling, the 6.5 million barrels of oil plug-ins could \nsave is basically 32 times the savings of what the proposal for Outer \nContinental Shelf drilling would be. Obviously, that could have a \nsignificant impact.\n  The study also found that charging a plug-in electric vehicle at the \ncurrent national electricity rate would cost the equivalent of just $1 \na gallon. Instead of paying the fuel prices you are paying today at $4, \nyou would be paying only $1 to plug in your car. A car that gets 100 \nplus miles per gallon. It would have such an unbelievable impact on the \nAmerican consumer and the economy and opportunity.\n  There is a lot more we could have also done in the last 8 years. \nThere is much more we could do now in making sure we extend expiring \nclean energy tax incentives that will save $20 billion in clean energy \ninvestments. I don't think it is too late to get the extender package \nand have 42,000 megawatts of planned renewable energy projects in 45 \nStates go forward. That is the equivalent of 75 baseload electricity \ngeneration stations. I hope we can see progress on that bill.\n\n  Passing clean energy incentives will also provide renewable energy \nthat will lessen demand for natural gas, lowering household electricity \nbills, to say nothing of what New England is facing with the high price \nof fuel for their homes.\n  Also under the Baucus extender bill, consumers can utilize $500 in \ntax incentives for measures that make their homes more efficient. This \ncould lower their home heating bills by 20 percent or more. That is a \nhuge opportunity for us moving forward, if we would only pass the \nlegislation.\n  I don't know how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nmajority side.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will take a minute or two more.\n  These solutions I talked about are solutions we can do now. They are \nnear term. If you look at this chart of what options we have for the \nfuture, this is what drilling and the moratorium can save us in barrels \nof oil by 2030, less than a million barrels a day. Here is what \nefficiency in automobiles and trucks and the measures I described in \nthe last few minutes can do in saving us on energy and oil consumption, \nover 6 million barrels per day.\n  We have to get off this 27-year debate and get on to an energy future \nthat will help make America more secure. We must move faster, further \npast these old energy policies, past convoluted logic and on to an \nopportunity where the United States can become an energy leader. We \nknow there are countries that are already doing it. Let's make sure we \nhave learned the lessons from our global neighbors about changes they \nhave made. Let's commit to a real energy strategy on renewables. It is \nsomething America deserves and something we need to pass as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom Virginia for majority time.\n  Mr. WEBB. I will do my best. I wish to speak for a few minutes today \nabout why I believe it is not only appropriate but important for us to \nbe focusing on the issue of oil market speculation, separate from the \nlarger issues that confront us in our energy policies, as a way to \naddress the most serious problem and the most fixable problem as it \nrelates to the high price of oil and the high price of gas. There are \nmany on the other side who have commented that speculation is not the \nreason gas prices have gone up so dramatically, that this is simply the \nfree market working. I am reminded that when this Congress voted in \nOctober of 2002 to go to war in Iraq, the price of oil was $24 a \nbarrel. It has gone up all the way to $145 a barrel. That is six times \nthe cost of oil when we went into Iraq.\n  I certainly wouldn't venture that demand has gone up six times in the \nlast 6 years, even if we adjust for the devaluation of the dollar \ntaking place for a lot of reasons, that demand has gone up in those \nkinds of multiples. I, similar to many on this side of the aisle, would \nlike to see a comprehensive energy package, a comprehensive energy \nstrategy that addresses all our assets and all the assets we can bring \nto this issue in the future.\n  This simply is not the right time. You cannot do this with a series \nof amendments, whether it is for another week or another 2 weeks. You \ncan only do that with another serious consideration of a piece of \nlegislation that addresses all these different areas. I am among those \non this side of the aisle who are not opposed to the idea of offshore \nexploration for oil and natural gas and have joined the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia in a proposal to that effect.\n  I would like to see us go into a more serious development of nuclear \npower. We have not had a new nuclear power plant built in this country \nin 30 years. Nuclear power technology has improved. Carbon dioxide \nemissions from nuclear power plants is benign. It is good for the \nenvironment. It would have a dramatic increase in jobs. These are all \npositives.\n  I also would like us to explore, in a proper way, alternative energy \nproposals that have become increasingly popular and increasingly viable \nover the last 20 years. There has been a lot of attention on wind power \nover the past few days because of what Mr. T. Boone Pickens has \nproposed. Solar technology has dramatically increased in its \ncapabilities over the past 10 to 15 years.\n  I come from a State that produces a lot of coal. I think the answer \nto coal--which is a national asset in this country in terms of the \nsupply that is available--when it is used under the right circumstances \ncan be environmentally neutral, when we develop the right technologies.\n  Those are all issues which should be on the table as we approach a \nfull energy strategy in terms of reducing our dependence on foreign oil \nand becoming more energy independent. But they are simply not the only \nissues we should be addressing this week.\n  Why is speculation so important? Quite obviously, because as of the \nend of 2000, there are people other than users who have been buying oil \nfutures. They have been buying them not for their use, but purely as if \nthey were buying stocks. They are doing this in an environment where \nthere are no regulations in the same sense as there are in other \ninvestment areas, the areas that apply to stocks.\n  As I said, this policy changed in late 2000, and this is when the \nspeculation market began to have these aberrations in it. You can buy \noil futures for 3 or 4 percent on margin. We have dramatically more \ninvestors than we have users, and there are plenty of estimates \navailable as to how this has affected the market, totally absent from \nsupply and demand.\n  A whole series of big oil executives have agreed that the oil market \nhas been affected by as much as $60 a barrel because of this type of \nspeculation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four of those testimonies \nbe printed in the Record at this time, rather than going through them, \nin the interest of time.\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Even Big Oil Executives Agree Excessive Speculation Has Driven Up Oil \n                                 Prices\n\n       CEO of Royal Dutch Shell Said Fundamentals of the Oil \n     Market Are the Same as When Oil Sold for $60. Jeroen van der \n     Veer, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell said, ``The [oil] fundamentals \n     are no problem. They are the same as they were when oil was \n     selling for $60 a barrel, which is in itself quite a unique \n     phenomenon.''

It has to be speculation on the futures market \n     that is fueling this.'' [Detroit Free Press, 10/30/07]\n       Exxon Mobil Executive Testified Price of Oil Should Be $50-\n     $55 Per Barrel.

[Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, 4/1/08]\n       President of the Inland Oil Company Testified Speculation \n     is the Fuel that Is Driving Up Oil Prices. In June, Gerry \n     Ramm, President of the Inland Oil Company on behalf of the \n     Petroleum Marketers Association of America, testified, \n     ``Excessive speculation on energy trading facilities is the \n     fuel that is driving this runaway train in crude oil \n     prices.'' [Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \n     Committee Hearing, 6/3/08]\n\n  Mr. WEBB. The whole point of this is, we need, as a government, to \ngain control over this process for the benefit of all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I appreciate that.\n  We need to gain control over this process for the benefit of all \nAmericans, as a necessary, preliminary step before we begin addressing \nall these other areas I mentioned, as we move toward a more balanced \nand independent energy future.\n  This is an area where the potential for immediate impact on the price \nof oil is available, and it is not only appropriate we address the \nissue of speculation, in my view, it is absolutely necessary if we are \ngoing to bring down, in a reasonable time period, the price of oil and \nthe price that our citizens are paying at the pump.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that speakers on \nthe Republican side be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the bill before us today has to do with \nspeculation. Let's talk about speculation for a minute. What is it? It \nis investment on the basis of assumption or expectations.\n  There are those who are investing in oil futures because of the \nexpectation that the price of oil will rise. If you want to get \nspeculation under control, you have to change those expectations.\n  What are the expectations of investors right now with respect to oil? \nIt is their expectation that the price of oil will go up. It is very \nrational. The only reason they are buying an oil futures contract is \nthey expect the price to go up.\n  What can we do to change those expectations? Well, let us look at the \noil market as a whole and look at it in a historical perspective. The \nfirst thing we must remember--and remember all the way through this \ndebate--is this: The oil market is a world market. Oil prices are set \nby world supply and by world demand. It is not a market that is limited \nto the shores of the United States of America.\n  So what has been going on in the oil market? Over the last 10 years, \navailable sources of supply--that is, reasonable sources that could be \nproducing oil relatively quickly--have been growing but very slowly. I \nhave tried to get absolutely authoritative figures.\n  I have been unable to come up with exact ones. But there is a \nconsensus that available production capacity has been growing over the \nlast 10 years at the rate of about 1 percent per year. What we do know \nis, over the last 10 years, worldwide demand has been growing at 2.5 \npercent per year. Oil demand now is roughly 25 percent greater than it \nwas just 10 years ago.\n  It does not take a mathematical genius to put these two numbers \ntogether and recognize that if the available sources of supply are \ngrowing at only about 1 percent per year, and demand is growing at 2.5 \npercent per year, the time will come when the safety margin between \navailable supply and worldwide demand will be very small.\n  We have reached that time now. We have reached the time where the \nsafety margin between available supply and worldwide demand is so small \nthat any one single incident anywhere in the world can immediately \ntrigger expectations that the price of oil is going to go up. Whether \nit is domestic difficulty in Nigeria or political activity in \nVenezuela, the price of oil goes up when an event comes along that \nindicates there might be a hiccup in available oil supply. This is \nperfectly rational. It is not an act of manipulation on anybody's part. \nIt is simply a logical expectation.\n  Now, at one time in our history America could determine what the \nworld price of oil would be. The Texas Railroad Commission could \ndetermine what the available productive capacity would be simply by \npermitting a few additional wells in east Texas. Every time there was a \nconcern that there would not be enough oil, the Texas Railroad \nCommission would permit more wells. People would look at the safety net \nbetween available production and demand and say that it is high enough \nfor us to keep the price of oil close to the cost of producing. For \nyears and years and years, the price of oil was around $7, $8, $9, $10 \na barrel because that is what it cost to produce, and the safety margin \nbetween the available source of supply and demand was very large.\n  Sometime in the 1970s, that power left our shores. It went from \nAmerica over to the Middle East, and the Saudi royal family replaced \nthe Texas Railroad Commission as the agency that could determine the \nprice of oil. They would either increase production or lower \nproduction, and they found they could control the world price of oil by \nwhat they did to the safety margin.\n  But as the safety margin has shrunk, now even the Saudi royal family \ncannot control the price of oil. There are Members of this body who \nhave written President Bush asking him to go to the Saudis with a tin \ncup and beg them to increase that safety margin in the hope it will \nbring down gas prices. That is not the long-term solution to this \nproblem.\n  What I want to do, what Republicans want to do, is get America back \nin the game and bring the pricing power back on American shores by \nfinding more and using less oil. We can do this because we have, within \nour continental boundaries, the ability to increase that safety margin. \nThe Gas Price Reduction Act talks about it in two obvious areas.\n  The first one is oil development in the Outer Continental Shelf. This \ncould produce enough oil to increase the safety margin by a million \nbarrels a day originally, and it could go up significantly from there. \nThis would change the expectation, if you are focusing on speculators. \nRight now, 85 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf is off-limits by \nvirtue of an executive branch moratorium that was placed on it over 25 \nyears ago.\n  President Bush has lifted that moratorium and the markets reacted \nimmediately and the price of oil fell dramatically--not because the oil \nwas immediately available but because the expectation was changed. Now \nit is up to Congress to lift the congressional moratorium on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and make sure the expectation is fulfilled.\n  The second area where we can find more oil is in oil shale, an \nabundant resource located in my home State of Utah. There are people \nwho say, ``Oh, the technology is expensive. The technology does not \nwork.'' Oil shale is producing oil in other countries today. It is time \nwe allowed oil shale to produce oil in the United States. And how much? \nThere is three times as much oil in the oil shale in my State, \nColorado, and Wyoming than there is in all of Saudi Arabia. We have not \ngotten to it because it is all on public lands, and we have been \nprevented from going on to that.\n  There is now a moratorium in the law that prevents the Department of \nthe Interior from even writing the final\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\nrules under which exploration for oil shale can take place and bids \nunder which the oil shale for leases can go forward. The Department of \nthe Interior has now issued a draft of what the rules will be if that \nmoratorium is lifted. In the Gas Price Reduction Act, we call for that \nmoratorium to be lifted.\n  As soon as the moratorium is lifted, what will happen to the \nspeculators? Expectations will change, and they will understand that \nAmerica is serious about getting back in the game and bringing the \npricing power back onto American shores and away from the Saudi royal \nfamily.\n  Now, there has been discussion here about the other aspects of the \nGas Price Reduction Act: hybrid cars, plug-in hybrids. I have been \ndriving a hybrid car for 8 years. I know what it is like to drive a car \nthat gets 55 miles to the gallon. I understand how important that is. \nThat is why it is in the Gas Price Reduction Act.\n  I have already addressed the question of speculation. What we need to \ndo--and it is in the Gas Price Reduction Act--is increase the number of \naccountants at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission so we can make \nsure, if there is real market manipulation going on, it can be \ndiscovered and dealt with. But only going after speculators is not the \nway to get the price of oil down. I agree with Warren Buffett, perhaps \nthe Nation's richest Democrat, who says all this talk about speculation \nbeing the problem is nonsense. The problem is supply and demand.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act is the logical way to deal with supply \nand demand, get America back in the game, change the expectations, and \nbring down the price of oil.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to indicate when I have \nused 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank you the Chair.\n  I am very glad we are finally taking significant time on the floor of \nthe Senate to debate and hopefully to act on the single most important \nchallenge facing American families, and that is gasoline prices and \nenergy. I have been urging all of us in the Senate to do this for some \ntime, and finally we are on that key topic.\n  Let me restate the obvious: This is the top challenge facing American \nfamilies across our country, certainly including Louisiana. This is the \ncore of everyone's uncertainty and concerns about our economic future. \nTo get to the heart of the matter, this is what hits people in the \npocketbooks every week because they gas up every week. They go to the \ngas station. They need gas to get to work. They want to be able to take \nfamily vacations during the summer. This hits everybody where it hurts: \nin the family pocketbook.\n  That is why it is crucial we attack this problem head on. That is why \nI am hopeful we are going to act in a meaningful, broad-based way here \non the Senate floor. I urge all of my colleagues--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to come together to bring every good idea they have \nrelated to gasoline prices and energy to this debate so we can act in a \nbroad-based and meaningful way; not just talk and not just debate and \ncertainly not just point fingers and be partisan but come together and \nact for the good of the American people. The American people are \nhurting. They are jolted by the dramatic rise in gasoline prices and \nthey want us to act.\n  It is also in the best traditions of the Senate that we have open and \nfull debate and an open and full amendment process. I urge all of us--\nagain, Democrats and Republicans--to come together and demand and rally \naround the concept of the best tradition of the Senate being an open \nand full debate and amendment process. The American people want this \nbecause they not only understand this is the greatest challenge facing \ntheir families, they also understand there is no single answer. There \nis no silver bullet. There is no magic wand. We need to do a number of \nthings, and we need to do them now. In fact, we needed to do them \nyesterday--last year, 10 years ago--but certainly at this point we need \nto act now. We need to act on a number of fronts.\n  The majority leader's bill on the floor is a narrowly drafted bill \nabout speculation on oil and energy in the marketplace. I certainly \nsupport addressing that, among other issues, as we try to stabilize and \nbring down gasoline and energy prices. Again, the American people get \nit. They understand there is no easy or single answer. There is no \nmagic wand or silver bullet. We need to do a number of things, both on \nthe demand side and the supply side. We need to use less and we need to \nfind more right here at home.\n  Today I am filing seven amendments for consideration and votes in \nthis debate. We need to do a number of things that are significant to \nhelp stabilize the price of gasoline, to help develop a rational energy \npolicy, and we need to act both on the demand side and the supply side. \nWe need to use less and we need to find more right here at home.\n  Let me speak about exactly what those amendments are. My first \namendment would increase domestic production of oil and gas offshore as \nwell as develop alternative energy sources offshore. It is based on a \nfreestanding bill I introduced several weeks ago, the ENOUGH Act--the \nEnergy Needed Offshore Under Gas Hikes Act. It allows for increased \ndomestic production of oil and gas in the Outer Continental Shelf when \na particular State's Governor, with the concurrence of the State \nlegislature, petitions the Federal Government for this activity. It \nwould also provide an incentive for States to do that by offering \nrevenuesharing. Specifically, while 45 percent of the royalties on that \nproduction would still go to the Federal Treasury, 37.5 percent would \ngo to the producing State involved, 12.5 percent would go to the \nFederal Land and Water Conservation fund, which I strongly support, and \n5 percent would go to historically producing States which have produced \nfor 50 years or more and never got revenuesharing for all of that \ncommitment to meeting the Nation's energy needs.\n  This amendment is not only about producing more; it is also about \nalternatives. In addition, this amendment develops alternative energy \noffshore by establishing a grant program for offshore alternative \nenergy production, by converting existing offshore energy \ninfrastructure into alternative production facilities--for instance, \nturning old lease areas into new offshore wind farms--and for allowing \nrevenuesharing in that alternative energy production offshore as well. \nI urge my colleagues to look favorably on this positive amendment.\n  My second of seven amendments would flat out repeal the present \ncongressional moratorium on activity in the Outer Continental Shelf. \nLast week, President Bush took a very positive and necessary step \nforward. He lifted the existing Executive moratorium that had been in \nplace for the Outer Continental Shelf. However, as we all know, there \nis a congressional moratorium at the same time, so his action wasn't \ngood enough to allow us to develop those resources. My amendment, my \nsecond amendment No. 5090, would lift the existing congressional \nmoratorium. It too includes developing alternative energy offshore--\nthat package of proposals I enumerated--to develop new, clean, \nalternative energy sources offshore.\n  My third amendment is somewhat akin to the second amendment which \nlifts the congressional moratorium on the OCS. My third amendment would \nlift the present congressional moratorium on shale production in the \nWest. As we all know, Congress placed a moratorium on final regulations \nfor the development of oil shale in the western United States. That \nputs to a halt all of that positive productive activity that could lead \nto major energy finds in the western United States on land--oil coming \nout of that western shale.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has consumed 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank you the Chair.\n  It is very important that we lift that counterproductive \ncongressional moratorium and move forward with regard to western shale. \nThere are enormous energy resources there. We need to tap those. To do \nthat, the first step we need to take is lifting that current \ncongressional moratorium on all of that activity.\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\n  My fourth amendment is to develop alternative energy offshore--that \npackage of proposals I mentioned a few minutes ago which is also part \nof the first three amendments.\n  My fifth amendment is to streamline the permitting process so we can \nexpand refinery capacity. We would start with existing refineries which \nhave the ability to expand. As we all know, we need to find more energy \nhere at home, but we also have a refinery capacity issue and we need to \naddress both sides of that coin. So it is crucial we streamline the \npermitting process for refineries right here at home. It is far too \ncumbersome and uncertain and complicated. My fifth amendment would \nallow us to expand refinery capacity here at home in a way we sorely \nneed to do.\n  Finally, my final amendment would streamline the permitting for \noffshore leases. Excuse me. That is No. 6, to streamline the permitting \nprocess for offshore leases, which also is far too cumbersome and \ncomplicated and takes far too long, to allow producers and developers \nto get in the field and actually produce energy from those offshore \nleases.\n  My seventh and final amendment would change the seaward boundaries \nfor the Gulf States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Under current law, Florida and Texas have State waters for 9 miles \nfrom their coastline, but in stark contrast to that, Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama's State waters are only the first 3 miles from \ntheir coasts. This is grossly unfair. In addition, expanding the State \nwaters of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to match their neighbors \nto the west and the east--Texas and Florida--would help promote more \nproduction in the gulf because it is a far easier, less cumbersome \nprocess to produce, get permitting, and move forward on State waters \nthan on Federal lands.\n  With that in mind, I certainly hope we can have the full, open debate \nand open amendment process to consider these and other good ideas.\n  In that vein, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds \nto S. 3248, it be limited to energy-related amendments only; further, \nthat the amendments be offered in an alternating fashion between the \ntwo sides. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill remain the \npending business to the exclusion of all other business other than \nprivileged matters and other matters that the two leaders might agree \nupon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Ohio, I \nobject.\n  The senior Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today to also discuss the No. 1 issue that is facing our \nNation. That issue is the rising price of energy. Everyone out there \nwhom this affects knows who they are: It is anyone who rides or drives \nor eats. While I am glad the Senate is finally considering energy \nlegislation, I am disappointed by the scope of that legislation. I hear \nfrom my constituents each and every day that the Senate needs to do \nsomething about energy prices. I couldn't agree more. We need to put \naside partisan politics in order to pass legislation that will address \nthe energy situation we are facing.\n  Today, the Senate is considering S. 3268, the energy speculators \nbill. This bill is kind of like a hearty meal of meat, bread, and \npotatoes but without the meat--oh, and without the bread--and it \ndoesn't really have potatoes in it either. This bill deals only with \nthe issue of oil speculation. It does not deal with the issue of supply \nand demand. It does not deal with the need to encourage conservation. \nIt does not deal with the extension of important tax credits to promote \nrenewable energy.\n  Instead, the bill seeks to extend the long arm of the law to reach \nout and strike down those ``speculators'' who are supposedly driving \nthe price of oil faster and higher than a rocket ship. I ask my \ncolleagues now, why would we in the Senate want to strike down \nteachers, civil servants, and farmers? The bill does not recognize that \nthat is who the so-called speculators are. Speculators are oftentimes \npension fund investors who protect the retirement of teachers and civil \nservants. The ``evil'' speculators are American farmers who want to \nsave money on their supplies and fertilizer and on airlines that want \nto cut fuel costs by locking in a price that will make the customer's \nplane tickets cheaper.\n  This legislation does not recognize that futures markets and the \ninvestors who trade in them are crucial to getting the best price for \nthe product and attracting investment in the United States. Cities such \nas Dubai and countries such as India and China are the places that will \nbenefit from this bill. They would benefit because many of the jobs \nthat would be in New York or Chicago--jobs that are currently \nAmerican--would no longer be.\n  I am the ranking member of the Senate committee that handles \npensions, so let's get back to the people who have pensions and how \nthis bill impacts them. These people are the employees of most of our \nlargest companies and include airline, trucking, automotive, \nmanufacturing, education, and public civil servant employees. This bill \nwould hurt them. I am alarmed the bill could declare portions of our \nfinancial markets off limits to institutional investors, including \npension funds, endowments, and foundations.\n  Laws we have passed say that pension money should be vested in a \nprudent manner. We in Congress have long insisted pension plans \ndiversify their assets so they don't have ``all their eggs in one \nbasket.'' However, if we start down the slippery slope the majority \nleader has set before us in his bill, then we will limit the ability of \npension plans and other institutional investors to diversify their \ninvestment strategies. This bill takes away baskets that they could put \ntheir eggs in. If the pension plans are prudently invested and well-\nmanaged, there is no reason they should be barred from any segment of \nthe commodities, futures, or capital markets.\n  The majority contends that this legislation will bring down the price \nof gas. Let's see, this bill will not result in the production of any \nmore gas, nor will it result in any less demand for gas.\n  I tend to agree that many of the Nation's brightest minds who suggest \nthat ``speculators'' have little to do with the increase in energy \nprices are right.\n  Warren Buffett, the Nation's wealthiest Democrat, does not believe \nspeculators are the cause. T. Boone Pickens, who has been in the news \nfor his efforts to end our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and who \naddressed Democrats at their weekly caucus lunch, has said that \nspeculators play a minimal role. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \nmade his views clear at a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee \non July 15 when he stated:\n\n       If financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the \n     levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, \n     we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum \n     products to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But in \n     fact, available data on oil inventories show notable declines \n     over the past year.\n\n  Bernanke continued:\n\n       This is not to say that useful steps could not be taken to \n     improve the transparency and functioning of futures markets, \n     only that such steps are unlikely to substantially affect the \n     prices of oil or other commodities in the longer term.\n\n  Chairman Bernanke's statement should provide us with a starting point \nfor any legislation, and I am a cosponsor of legislation that begins \nthe process of having a sensible energy policy. The Gas Price Reduction \nAct addresses the need for more transparency in our markets and more \noversight by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. However, that \nis not the focus of the legislation. While the transparency is \nimportant, the larger problem we face is a lack of supply and an \nincrease in demand. The majority leader's bill is like the novel an \nunwise motorist reads while driving down the highway. The novel is the \nwrong focus and while you pay attention to that you could get \nsideswiped by something you should be paying attention to--in our case, \nno supply and a whole lot of demand.\n  We need to find more American oil from American soil at the same time \nthat we use less, and we need to look at alternative fuels.\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act includes provisions to open coastal \nwaters in States that want energy production. It ends the ban on the \ndevelopment of promising oil shale in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. At \nthe same time, it encourages increases in supply. It promotes the \ndevelopment of better technology so that we use less energy, and it \nexplores alternative sources. The supply and demands issues are not \naddressed in the majority leader's oil speculation bill.\n  The majority leader's bill also ignores the important role that coal \ncan play in securing America's energy future. It ignores the need to \nstreamline the process for permitting new refineries. It ignores the \nneed to increase the use of nuclear as a clean energy source.\n  You will notice that a lot of these things are also not in the \nRepublican bill that I mentioned. That bill is a compilation of items \nthat everybody here ought to be able to support. The items that have \nbeen controversial have been left out. We can use my 80/20 rule. We can \nagree on 80 percent of the issues 80 percent of the time. If we stick \nto that and leave the rest to the pundits, it will work out well. \nSometimes we try to do things that are too comprehensive because one \namendment will pull off 3 votes and another one might pull off 10 votes \nand another might pull off 15 votes. Then you don't have a majority to \npass a bill. I am not sure that is what the other side is hoping for.\n  I hope we can keep this simple and get something done--something \nbesides just speculation. I hope we are able to have an open debate \nover the next 2 weeks. I hope we are allowed to offer energy amendments \nand have up-or-down votes. If we can have that real debate, I am \nconfident the Senate can come up with a package that could be signed \ninto law, and both sides will get credit. Believe it or not, I actually \nagree with the majority party on some steps that would help to make \nthis country more energy independent. Wind tax credits are one example. \nBut restricting Senators' participation, stopping them from \nrepresenting those who put them in office, is not going to get us any \nfurther than an empty tank of gas. That is what this bill will do in \nits current form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today gas costs $4.09 in Bellefontaine, OH. \nIn Conneaut, it is $4.05 a gallon. In Galion--not far from where I grew \nup in Mansfield--gas costs $4.04 a gallon. In southern Ohio, in New \nBoston, on the Ohio River, gas costs $4.06 a gallon.\n  Instead of helping the residents of those communities and in other \nStates around the country, my Republican colleagues are asking for \nanother handout for Exxon, Shell, BP, and Chevron. The last thing oil \ncompanies need is a handout. They don't need more drilling permits on \ntop of the unused permits they already have. What big oil does need is \nto revisit their business strategy because if they think complaining \nabout the need for more drilling permits and getting my friends on the \nother side of the aisle to do their bidding and having a President of \nthe United States and a Vice President--two oilmen--siding with them \ntime after time--if they think that will win over the hearts and minds \nof the American people, they have another thing coming. The people I \nreport to don't like opportunists, they don't like snake oil salesmen, \nand they don't like unbridled greed.\n  Big oil has 68 million acres, directly or indirectly, of leased \nFederal lands they are not even drilling. That is 2.5 times the size of \nmy State of Ohio. But somehow, to big oil, that isn't enough. Somehow, \nrecord profits aren't enough. Somehow, big oil executives making tens \nof millions of dollars every year isn't enough. Big oil wants the right \nto drill everywhere and anywhere so they can attract more shareholders \nand make more money. Perhaps that is understandable. What is not \nunderstandable is people who are elected to office doing bidding for \nthem. Oil companies should use the lands that are already leased, and \nthey should reinvest in refineries and alternative fuels--not lobby for \nanother land grab.\n  Republicans back the oil companies up, parroting them on the need for \nmore drilling. I suppose it is nice to have friends in the oil \nindustry. But we are not in Congress to make friends with the oil \nindustry. We are not in Congress to do the oil industry's bidding. We \nare in Congress because Americans put us here, and they deserve real \nanswers, real solutions.\n  Talking about drilling is a lot easier than doing real work. It is \neasier than tracking down the most promising avenues in alternative \nenergy and accelerating their development. It is easier than opening \nthe stockpile of U.S. oil and demanding real accountability from oil \ncompanies. And it is easier than taking on the speculators--as the \nmajority leader's bill does today--who are making handshake deals that \npush prices higher and higher.\n  Going after the speculators is what this bill we are debating today \nis about. It would go after unscrupulous, unregulated traders. It would \ncrack down on underhanded price manipulation so we can pop the energy \nprice balloon.\n  Instead of cuddling up to the energy industry and specialty oil \ncompanies, we should go after price gouging, price manipulation, and \nprice speculation. The White House may report to big oil, but we don't. \nSome in the other party, in both the Senate and House, may do the \nbidding of big oil too, but we should not and cannot, and we won't.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak about the myth about oil shale and what some people have been \ntalking about on the floor of the Senate and around the country is a \nquick fix to the oil challenges we face in America today, a quick fix \nto the high prices of gas and diesel we are paying across the country, \nand offering oil shale as the panacea that will cure that problem.\n  The fact is that is not the case. Those who are propounding that view \nof our future energy world, in my view, are false prophets because they \nare not telling the American people the truth about oil shale.\n  I am concerned and involved with this issue because of the fact that \n80 percent of the oil shale reserves are located in my State of \nColorado. We are not at a point in time where the technology has been \ndeveloped for us to move forward in the development of oil shale. So \nanyone who says this is a panacea to the oil challenges we face in \nAmerica today is simply wrong.\n  The oil companies themselves have said we are not ready to move \nforward with a commercial oil shale leasing program at this point in \ntime. Chevron, one of the largest oil companies in the world, had the \nfollowing to say:\n\n       Chevron believes that a full-scale commercial leasing \n     program should not proceed at this time without clear \n     demonstration of commercial technologies.\n\n  That was March 20, 2008. That is what Chevron is saying. Yet \nnotwithstanding what Chevron says about oil shale and development of \noil shale technology, we have the Department of the Interior, the White \nHouse, and the Bureau of Land Management saying we have to move full \nspeed ahead and rush forward with the issuing of these oil shale \nregulations which essentially will lock up close to 1 million acres of \nlands across the West, most of that in my State of Colorado, and doing \nit without knowing whether we have the technology to develop oil shale.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that as we engage in this debate \nconcerning the high price of gas and our addiction to foreign oil that \nwe come together in a bipartisan way and focus on solutions that \nultimately will get rid of the addiction we have to foreign oil and \nthat we embark on a Manhattan-type project that will actually get us to \nthe point where we can finally claim we have set America free.\n  There is broad bipartisan agreement on real solutions that we know \nwork. In fact, in the Energy Committee, on which the Presiding Officer \nhas been\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\nsuch a distinguished and effective member, we know we have come up with \nsolutions that we need to continue to push and push further.\n  If we think back to what we did in 2005, 2006, and 2007 to increase \nsupply, we have also done a lot to diminish the demand for oil in the \nUnited States of America. The CAFE standards alone, which we passed and \nwhich the President signed into law last December 2007, will save the \nUnited States about 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. We use about 20 \nmillion barrels of oil per day in America. The CAFE standards we have \nput in place will save us 1.2 million barrels per day. That was \naccomplished in a bipartisan spirit, Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether in this Congress.\n  With respect to biofuels, an agenda which also is neither a \nDemocratic nor Republican agenda, we have a law now in place that will \nembrace a new energy frontier that includes biofuels. It is not only \nethanol, it is cellulosic ethanol and other forms of biofuels we can \nuse. We know when we do the estimates of how much oil we will save by \nuse of biofuels, we will be able to save up to 1.6 million barrels a \nday that we will not have to import from the Middle East and other \ncountries that have the world's oil reserves.\n  There are things we have done that we know, in fact, will work. This \nmorning in the Energy Committee, we had a hearing on some of the things \nthat can work. We had a memorandum prepared by the staff of the Energy \nCommittee in which they reviewed some of what we have already done, \nstarting with the 2005 act. They included the following:\n  Section 701, use of alternative fuels by dual-fueled flex vehicles. \nThat is the Flex Fuel Program. Review of the fuel/hybrid vehicle \ncommercialization initiative; advanced vehicles; fuel cell transit bus \ndemonstration; clean schoolbus program; diesel truck retrofit and fleet \nmodernization program; fuel cell schoolbuses; railroad efficiency; \nreduction of engine idling.\n  Each of those is a different section in the 2005 Energy Policy Act \nwhich passed under the leadership of Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman, and with many of us on both sides of the aisle a part of \ncrafting it.\n  It goes on. Ultra-efficient engine technology for aircraft; \nenforcement of the fuel economy standards; Federal procurement of \nstationary, portable, and micro fuel cells; diesel emissions reduction \nauthorizations; renewable content of gasoline, and on and on.\n  There are major provisions enacted into law which are good policy \nwhich will help start getting us off this addiction we have to foreign \noil.\n  We continued in that fashion in 2006 when, again, a bipartisan group \nof Senators came together and decided to open part of the gulf coast \nwith lease sale 181. That opened about 8 million acres for exploration \nand production in the gulf coast, a place where we know we have some of \nthe largest reserves that are under the control of the United States.\n  We have been pushing programs that embrace a new energy frontier, as \nwell as trying to put more production online here for the United States \nof America.\n  It is very important to think about what happened not so long ago, at \nthe end of last year with the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007. We passed a series of programs that are intended to help us get \nto energy independence. Chief among them was CAFE standards which were \nso long in coming and which had been neglected for such a long time. \nThose CAFE standards, when implemented, will save, as I said earlier, \nover 1 million barrels of oil a day that we will not have to import \nfrom other countries.\n  Those are the kinds of efforts on which we can come together. We can \nfind a new way for America that will deal with the inescapable forces \nof our time that call us to move forward in an imperative way toward \nenergy independence. Those inescapable forces that are with us today \nare the national security of the United States of America, the \nenvironmental security of our globe, and the economic opportunity which \nwe can create at home with a new energy agenda.\n  That is the kind of program we ought to be getting to today and this \nweek as we try to move forward with energy legislation in the Senate.\n  But there are those who would say, again, it is all about oil shale, \nthat what we ought to do is go ahead and open the OCS, including those \nareas where there are moratoria. They say we ought to go ahead and take \nthe 1 trillion barrels or 800 billion barrels of oil that are locked up \nin the rock of the West. And they say we ought to do that to deal with \nthe current problem we have.\n  I am one of those people who is pro-production, and we do have a lot \nof production that comes from my State. In fact, in the last 5 years, \nthe production of oil and natural gas in my State has increased more \nthan twofold, so we are adding significantly to the pipelines that \nproduce energy for our Nation. But oil shale is not the answer. Chevron \nsaid they do not believe we are ready for commercial regulations for \noil shale. They were joined by some of the major newspapers in both \nColorado and Utah, Colorado being the place where most of the oil \nreserves are.\n  The Denver Post said:\n\n       Developing oil shale has been a dream since the early 20th \n     century. But careful planning is needed to make sure the \n     dream doesn't turn into a nightmare.\n\n  In recent days, some politicians loudly demanded the immediate \nleasing of massive oil shale reserves in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah as \na way to swiftly lower gasoline prices.\n  The Denver Post says:\n\n       The idea is ludicrous, and goes directly against the advice \n     of the very energy companies that are actively researching \n     how to tap the enormous but economically elusive oil shale \n     reserves.\n\n  They were not alone. The Grand Junction Sentinel, which covers 20 \ncounties, had the following to say:\n\n       The notion that the one-year moratorium on commercial \n     leasing approved by Congress last year is somehow a barrier \n     to commercial development is nonsense. If anything, that \n     moratorium should be extended.\n\n  One might say that is what the oil companies said and one might say \nthat is what the editorial boards of Colorado said, where 80 percent of \nthe oil shale reserves are located.\n  What do the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land \nManagement have to say with respect to how we move forward with oil \nshale development? Yesterday, the Bureau of Land Management and the \nSecretary of the Department of the Interior said we are going to go \nahead and issue regulations that will allow the full-scale \ncommercialization and development of oil shale in the West.\n  What is included in the report that the Department of the Interior \nand the Bureau of Land Management issued? In their own words, this is \nwhat the BLM said yesterday in issuing the report on commercial \nregulations:\n\n       Currently, there is no oil shale industry and the oil shale \n     extractive technology is still in its rudimentary stages.\n\n  It ``is still in its rudimentary stages.'' It baffles my mind why it \nis that the Bush administration and the Department of the Interior \nwould want to move forward as fast as they can to get this done before \nthe election and a new administration. Why would they want to do that? \nWhy would they want to do that given their own findings in the \nDepartment of the Interior?\n  That is not all they said. They continued in their own report \nconcerning commercial oil shale regulations to say the following:\n\n       The lack of a domestic oil shale industry makes it \n     speculative to project the demand for oil shale leases, the \n     technical capability to develop the resource, and the \n     economics of producing shale oil.\n\n  So with that kind of a statement, how is it that the Department of \nInterior, Bureau of Land Management, can be in a place where they can \nissue finalized regulations for the leasing of oil shale for commercial \nproduction?\n  The BLM, again in its own words--this is not an editorial board, it \nis not even one of the oil companies, this is the Department of the \nInterior, Bureau of Land Management in its own findings saying:\n\n       It is not presently known how much surface water will be \n     needed to support future development of an oil shale \n     industry. Depending on the need, there could be a noticeable \n     reduction in local agricultural production and use.\n\n  I wish to make a comment about that. I spent good part of my life \ndealing with the water issues of the West--the water issues of \nColorado, the interstate compacts that deal with the allocation of \nwater in the West--and there\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\nis no question that for those of us who come from the arid West, we \nrecognize that water is the lifeblood of our communities. Without \nwater, communities die. They dry up and they go away. We are a water-\nshort State. We don't know how much water will be used in the \ndevelopment of the oil shale of western Colorado. The BLM says we don't \nknow how much water will be used in the development of oil shale in \nwestern Colorado. So how, without knowing this very crucial fact, can \nthe Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management be \nready to move forward with a full-scale commercial leasing program for \noil shale? It makes no sense in the world.\n  That is not all they say. They continue with some other comments. \nAgain, this is the Bureau of Land Management, July 22, 2008. That was \nyesterday, by the way, when the BLM went ahead and issued its proposed \nregulations. In the documents, July 22, 2008, the BLM says:\n\n       We have no reasonable way to generate meaningful scenarios \n     to quantify the potential impacts for an industry that does \n     not exist or technologies that have not been deployed.\n\n  This is not the Denver Post or the Rocky Mountain News or the Grand \nJunction Sentinel or even the likes of the Salt Lake City Tribune. \nThese are not the words of the Chevron Oil company. These are the words \nof the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. Yet \nnotwithstanding these realities, we have a number of people who are \ntelling us to rush headlong and develop the shale of the West.\n  If you look at that shale, what you will find is rock. It is solid \nrock. That is why, for nearly 100 years, people have been trying to \nfigure out how they can extract the oil from that rock. It is a lot \nmore difficult than it seems. That is why this sense that oil shale \ndevelopment is something that can help deal with the gasoline prices we \nare facing today is simply a falsehood.\n  I would hope, as we move forward with the debate over our energy \nfuture in this country, we can address real solutions--the problem with \nspeculation, which experts tell us accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the \nprice we are now paying for a barrel of oil. We can address the issue \nof speculation that is included in legislation the Republicans have \noffered in their amendment and the legislation Senator Reid has on the \nfloor, and there are other proposals we can also include in an energy \npackage, including being much more aggressive in those issues we have \nincluded in the 2005 Energy Policy Act, as well as in the 2007 Energy \nAct we passed.\n  So I hope as we move forward, we will offer real solutions, not false \nsolutions. I believe we have a bipartisan basis from which we can \ndevelop that way forward in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is this the beginning of the \nRepublican time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic side, but it does not appear it is presently being asked \nfor, so the Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, am I correct that the next 30 minutes \nis Republican time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak because I think the \nSenate has a duty. We have a duty to the American people to take \npositive, logical, decisive action to deal with the energy crisis we \nare facing. Since control of Congress changed hands last year, the \nprice of gasoline has soared from an average of $2.33 a gallon to $4.06 \na gallon. That is a 75-percent increase.\n  In my State of Texas, my husband took our van to fill it this weekend \nand he came home with sticker shock, similar to every husband or wife \nin every family in this country. It is $100 to fill a tank in many \nplaces in our country. So the American people have a right to look to \nCongress for leadership, but what have they gotten in response? The \nbill that is before us today does not reduce a single drop of oil, not \na cubic foot of natural gas, and not a single watt of electricity. \nThere is nothing in this bill before us that will address the issue of \nproducing more and using less.\n  What we have is addressing one very small portion of what might be a \npart of the problem, and that is speculators. We should be looking at \nspeculators, I agree. We all support transparency in speculation. But \nwe have an energy bill and an opportunity on the floor today. Why don't \nwe open this bill so we actually are doing something about the price of \nenergy? The long-term solution is the short-term solution. Bringing \ndown the price of oil and gas at the pump is a long-term solution that \nwill have short-term consequences that will help every American small \nbusiness and every family in this country.\n\n  We could be looking at conservation. We have already done something \nin the last Energy bill we passed. We increased CAFE standards to 35 \nmiles per gallon by the year 2020. That is conservation, and it will \nmake a big difference. We have time to get to that point. We have \nincluded in the Gas Price Reduction Act that the Republicans put \nforward a provision that will help America's transportation sector \ntransition into advanced hybrid and electric vehicle technology more \nquickly.\n  But what is missing? What have we not addressed that would make a \ndifference? Increased production, that is what. By refusing to pass any \nbill that would produce more energy inside our country, we are left to \nwonder: Do our colleagues want to bring down cost? Do they understand \nthe plight of the American people? Or is it an exercise to deal with \nsomething that is very much on the fringes and which is not going to \nmake a consequential difference and certainly not a long-term solution.\n  Does anyone think Congress can take an action on a speculation bill \nand say: Oh good, we have done something for the American people? The \nRepublicans do not believe that is the case. Here is what Republicans \nwant to do: We want to apply common sense and expand access to drilling \non the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  According to the Minerals Management Service, the OCS--the Outer \nContinental Shelf--could produce 14 billion barrels of oil and 55 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas. Advances in technology have made it \npossible to conduct oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf that \nis out of sight of tourists, and it protects against oil spills. States \nshould have the option of opening the OCS resources off their own \nshores, and the Federal Government should allow States to have a share \nin the leasing revenues.\n  State leaders in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and \nGeorgia have expressed support for this concept. Why won't Congress \ngive it to them? Because we are being blocked by the Democratic \nmajority, I am sad to say. We can do this, and we can do it right now. \nThere are four provisions that prevent us from using those resources. \nAll we have to do is delete that moratorium that has been put in place \nby Congress. The President has asked Congress to do this, and we could \nmove forward.\n  I was disappointed yesterday to learn that the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee canceled the markup on the bill that was scheduled to be \nmarked up tomorrow, the Interior Appropriations bill, and it appears \nthe reason is that last week, Senator Domenici, Senator Bond, and \nmyself announced we would have an amendment that would strike the \ncongressional moratorium on Outer Continental Shelf options for States. \nThe markup on an Appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior \nwas canceled because they didn't want to vote on an amendment that \nwould open the Outer Continental Shelf based on a State option.\n  The initiative also would tap the potential of oil shale. Now, I \nheard the Senator from Colorado say we shouldn't be acting because we \ndon't know enough yet. The other Senator from Colorado says: Yes, we \nshould act because we know there is shale in Colorado, Utah, and \nWyoming that is controlled by the Federal Government, and the estimates \nby the experts are there is 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil, \nwhich would be three times the reserves of Saudi Arabia. Again, the \nPresident has called on Congress to lift the moratorium. If we don't \ntake the first step, we will never know. We will never know how much is \nthere, and we will not be able to start the process of increasing \nsupply so the price will come down.\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\n  For those who say we can't drill our way out of the energy problem, I \nagree. We can't drill our way out of it. But drilling should be part of \nthe solution. The oil and gas we have in places such as the OCS can be \nused as a bridge to cross into the next generation of energy \ntechnologies, including solar power, wind, and nuclear power. The \nAmerican people see this. Thank goodness the American people have the \ncommon sense to see through the argument it will take too long to do \nit; that we shouldn't be looking at our own natural resources, that we \nshould be ranting about other countries not using their natural \nresources for our benefit.\n  We should take control of our own resources and we should solve this \nproblem the way Americans have always solved the problems of our \ncountry over the last 200 years and that is to look to ourselves--look \nto our natural resources, which are abundant, let's use technology, \nlet's use our brains, let's use solar, wind, and the new energies we \nknow can be found if we put our minds to it--and oil and natural gas \nare the first step. They are the transition. They are what we know now, \nand we know we can do this in an environmentally safe way.\n  Some question: Well, what about the environmental impact of drilling \noffshore? We had one of the worst hurricanes, with the worst damage \naftermath in the history of our country--Katrina--in 2005, which was \nfollowed immediately by Hurricane Rita, and it struck the gulf coast \nhard. We have oil rigs in the gulf coast. Yet there was not one major \nspill. There was no damage to the environment. The technology has \nimproved so much for offshore drilling, that we know we can do it and \nprotect our environment and also help our people, our economy, and our \nnational security by controlling our own energy supply and destiny.\n  Our country will spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year to \nimport energy from foreign countries, many of which do not wish us well \nand could shut us off in a moment. Those dollars should be spent right \nhere in America, giving jobs to Americans and giving an energy supply \nto American small businesses and families that will bring the price \ndown. That is what the Republicans are offering.\n\n  It is time for Congress to act in a bipartisan way with a policy that \nis balanced, that will give us a transition into the next generation of \nenergy. We have the chance. I implore the majority to give us that \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCochran and I be permitted to use 10 minutes to enter into a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in the next few days and weeks, the Senate \nhas an opportunity to engage in real bipartisanship. We have a chance \nto adopt pragmatic solutions in the 25 or so remaining days we have in \nsession this year. We can adopt concrete steps to address what many \nregard as the greatest energy crisis of our lifetime. I see an \nopportunity for Congress to act now to bring an end to the pain \nAmericans are feeling each time they go to the pump.\n  As a Senator from Mississippi, I can tell you as I travel around my \nState, as I have town meetings and as I talk to people on the phone and \nengage them in any way a legislator does, that the No. 1 issue among my \nconstituents is the ever increasing price of gasoline. We have some \nurban areas in Mississippi but not many. We have some suburbs, but we \nare mostly small towns and rural areas. We do not have the option of \nusing public transportation. We know it is not possible for the farmers \nin Mississippi to park their farm equipment if they are going to try to \nstay in business.\n  Skyrocketing gas prices are hitting American families and communities \nand they are also hitting our government agencies. Police departments, \nfire departments, schools, and even our military are being squeezed by \nthe high price of fuel. Yes, the price of fuel and our reliance on \nforeign sources even constitute a threat to our national security \nbecause of the effect they are having on our military. We are reaching \ncloser and closer to a true emergency situation and it is past time for \nreal legislative accomplishments. What the people of the United States \nneed and what our Nation deserves is a comprehensive long-term plan for \ndomestic exploration, conservation, and the introduction of renewable \nand alternative fuels into the energy marketplace. That is why I hope \nwe can have an open amendment process on this legislation, to allow \nopen debate in the Senate about this.\n  The average price of gas in my home State of Mississippi is currently \nbetween $3.80 and $3.90 per gallon. Only a year ago it was $1 less. \nMany people do not understand why these prices have risen so \ndramatically. There is a variety of viewpoints but it all comes back to \nour unwillingness to produce more energy here in the United States.\n  At this point I yield to my friend from Mississippi, the senior \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nyielding. I am pleased to join him, to thank him for his remarks and \nhis leadership on this pressing concern. The Department of Energy \nestimates that even with intensive conservation efforts in place and \nenforced, maintaining our economic growth through 2025 will require a \n36-percent increase in energy supply. Unfortunately, over half of the \noil we are now using is imported, imported from high-cost foreign \nsources. As demand rises and domestic supply is not increased to \naccommodate for our own needs, we will continue to be subject to the \nprices being set by foreign countries.\n  This is not only due to increases in demand from developed countries. \nThe increased cost for petroleum is also affected by the demand in \nemerging economies such as India and China. There are new pressures and \nnew reasons why the cost continues to go up. In fact, between 2008 and \n2030 it is expected that in China and India, they will account for 70 \npercent of the increase in global consumption.\n  What we are urging is not just to take the shortsighted look, the \neasy answer the majority party has put before the Senate, but take a \nbold stance--come out for using more American energy, not from \nexpensive foreign sources. We can develop our offshore resources in the \nGulf of Mexico, for example, far from the coastline, and add to our \nenergy supply. That will bring down costs.\n  We need to do real things. We need to conserve more. We need to look \nfor alternative sources, and there are plans in place and programs to \ndo that. What I am saying is we should not give up. That is what this \nbill that has been brought before the Senate does. It is a bill to \nsurrender--surrender to the high cost of foreign oil and gas. We do not \nneed to adopt it. There are better alternatives and we are urging that \nwe embrace them.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I have long supported the efforts to lift \nthe moratorium on energy exploration in the United States and Alaska's \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, which we commonly refer to as ANWR, \nand also on the Outer Continental Shelf. A lot of us in Washington, DC \nuse the term ANWR and we bandy it about. I am afraid some people out in \ngrassroots America may not realize what ANWR is. ANWR is an Arctic \nreserve that is the size of the State of South Carolina. It is a vast \nfrozen area in the very northernmost part of Alaska.\n  What we have proposed is drilling for oil there in a small area, \nabout the size of the typical metropolitan airport in this vast \nreserve. Congress sent President Clinton a bill in 1995 to provide for \nenergy exploration in ANWR. We are told that if President Clinton had \nnot vetoed that bill in 1995, we would today be getting the same amount \nof crude oil from ANWR as we are currently having to import from Saudi \nArabia. This would have been American jobs. This would have been \nAmerican dollars spent here in the United States to make us less energy \ndependent on foreign and unstable sources.\n  Last week, President Bush took a major step in moving us toward \nenergy independence when he lifted the Executive ban on offshore \ndrilling. We still have the obstacle of a congressionally mandated ban \non offshore drilling, which we ought to be discussing in this\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\nlegislation today. We ought to be voting on it in the next 25 \nlegislative days that we have remaining.\n  The peak of pricing for a barrel of crude oil was $146 per barrel \nonly a few short days ago. Yesterday it closed at $126.80 per barrel. \nThere are experts who will tell you that the confidence injected into \nthe markets by this simple step by President Bush caused a drop of some \n$19 per barrel in the price of crude oil.\n  If Congress would take the further step and actually pass the \nlegislation to lift this ban or, more precisely, to allow the \nmoratorium to expire at the end of the fiscal year, I think there would \nbe even more confidence in the market, and the price of crude oil and \ngasoline would continue to drop.\n  We also need to eliminate the ban on oil shale. This has been \ndiscussed this morning. We have three times the amount of crude oil \nreserves in three Western States in the form of oil shale, three times \nthe supply as we currently see in Saudi Arabia.\n  I think lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling, lifting the \nmoratorium on ANWR, and lifting the moratorium on the exploration of \noil shale in our own country, are steps we definitely need to take. \nEvery moment we are idle we will be ever more dependent on foreign \nsources of oil. I think we need to act and act this year.\n  Again, I toss it back to my friend, the senior Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding again \nto me. We do not have time to waste. This is the point. We have \nproposals to utilize more of our own energy. We can do it. We just need \nto make ourselves realize that is a better answer than pushing the \ndates farther along when we do nothing, do nothing, say we are doing \nsomething but not getting at the problem. Unless we produce more of \nwhat we need here at home, we are going to continue to be subject to \nthe decisions being made overseas by those who have the oil, have \ngreater resources than we do. But we have enormous resources in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. Technologies have developed to the \npoint we can produce that energy and protect the environment at the \nsame time. We need to gut it up and approve it, approve expanded \nexploration and production from our own resources.\n  The Gulf of Mexico has a huge reserve of untapped resources. We need \nto use that too.\n  Senate Republicans are not interested in structuring votes designed \nfor failure and designed for political cover. This issue is too \nimportant to blame for our collective lack of accomplishment. We now \nneed to address this vital issue. Energy and gas prices should not be \npoliticized and we are not going to walk away and give up on this \ndebate. We are here to stay and fight.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, this is an immediate problem and it \ndeserves immediate and comprehensive attention. Last week I sent a \nletter to Senate leaders, the majority and minority leaders, to say we \nshould not leave Washington for the annual August work period without \npassing energy legislation that will make a true difference for the \nAmerican people. There is no more important action that this body \nshould be taking than to address this issue with pragmatic solutions to \nthe problem. This is a critical time and this is an important debate, \nthe most important debate we could have as elected officials.\n  I am encouraged to hear that there are bipartisan discussions going \non even as we speak to adopt solutions on which we can all agree. I \nknow that a bill I would craft might not receive a majority vote in the \nSenate, but there are common solutions that I believe a majority of us \ncan and must agree on. The time to act is now.\n  May I ask how much time remains in the 10 minutes that has been \nallotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WICKER. If I might continue to speak. I see we have no one who \nhas asked to speak at this time. When another speaker arrives, I will \nbe happy to yield at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator may proceed.\n  Mr. WICKER. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, this is an \neconomic security issue. But it is also a national security issue.\n  Last week, the LA Times reported that the Pentagon will spend $16.4 \nbillion on fuel this year--$16.4 billion as compared to $5.2 billion in \n2003. The cost of fuel for our national security has gone up that much. \nThis is a major concern for our military. They are having to budget for \nongoing missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and all of the areas around \nthe world in which we are engaged.\n  That same article in the LA Times mentioned another important point \nabout the need to adopt alternative fuel sources, now more than ever. \nThe Air Force, a branch where I served for some 4 years, and longer \nthan that in the Reserve--the Air Force is already researching the use \nof coal to liquid for its fighter jets.\n  Their goal is to have half of the planes burning coal-based fuel by \nthe year 2016, a substance which we have an abundance of in the United \nStates of America.\n  At these record prices, commercial carriers are beginning to follow \nsuit. The Federal Government should encourage and incentivize the \nventures, doing research on coal-to-liquids.\n  Congress has an opportunity to be proactive. We could choose to boost \nour economy by producing more energy domestically, and I am proud to \njoin my Republican colleagues in a clear message which I think also \nstates an obvious truth: We need to find more resources and we need to \nuse less.\n  That is the reason I have readily cosponsored the Gas Price Reduction \nAct. We offered it only a few weeks ago, and it gets to the very heart \nof our debate--increasing supply to keep up with increasing demand as \nwell as using less through conservation and alternative fuel methods \nhere in the United States.\n  Both Senator Cochran and I are cosponsors of this legislation. It is \nmy hope that we can work together across partisan aisles to come up \nwith a solution for America. We do not need political games. We do not \nneed to have a limited structural legislative vehicle that allows our \nside only one vote on one proposal which probably cannot pass in its \ncurrent form and allows one vote on the Democratic side for a \nlegislative proposal that will also probably not ever see its way to \nthe statute book. We need to do something about this problem. And this \nyear, these few remaining days of this legislative session comprise the \ntime to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 2 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was a bit late arriving. I ask unanimous consent for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, let me say to you that \nI rise to speak again on what may be one of the most important issues \nfacing the American people.\n  Let me repeat, today we have before us a bill that addresses \nspeculation in the energy business in the United States. I regret to \ntell you that the high cost of gasoline is straining our Nation's \nfamily budgets. The American people are looking to us to do something. \nInstead of providing some needed relief, the majority has brought a \nspeculation-only bill before the Senate with limited debate and \nminimal, if any, opportunity for amendments. I am forced to say that in \nmy 36 years in the Senate, I have never seen a problem so big met by a \nproposal or a solution that is so small.\n  The other side suggests that at this particular time in our history, \nthere is no need to move beyond this, the one bill which the majority \nleader, using extraordinary rules, has brought before us under our rule \ncalled rule XIV. It has not been before committee, it has not been \nreported out by a committee; just put together in his office. And it is \nthe Energy bill supposedly for the end of this year; it is all we are \ngoing to do, with the American people clamoring for us to do more since \nthey are so burdened with the high price of gasoline. The American \npeople, by an overwhelming majority, want action. They are getting \nnothing except excuses and evasion.\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\n  Yesterday, the majority continued to trot out a baseless proposal \nthat they are calling ``use it or lose it'' in an attempt to convince \nAmericans that despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are \nactually in favor of some domestic production. Make no mistake, if the \nDemocrats wanted more production, they would have included in the \nunderlying bill, the one I just described that the majority leader got \nbefore the Senate, if they wanted to address some real energy issues, \nthen there is no question that all they had to do was add those issues \nto that bill, and those issues would be before the Senate.\n  If we needed any more evidence that most of my colleagues on the \nother side opposed new domestic energy production, it came in the form \nof a canceled Appropriations Committee markup.\n  In the news this morning, we read that the majority's spin on this \ndecision is:\n\n       On the Interior Appropriations bill, the Republicans had \n     threatened to strike the ban on offshore drilling that has \n     been in effect for nearly 20 years, even though they have \n     been offered a separate vote to strike this ban on the Senate \n     floor. Their rejection of this offer makes it clear that they \n     are more interested in playing political games to score cheap \n     political points than to complete action on the bills that \n     fund America's priorities.\n\n  Can you imagine? I beg to differ. Republicans are not trying to score \ncheap political points, we are trying to get something done--something \ndone to deal with the supply and demand imbalance at the heart of this \nenergy crisis. Our rejection of the so-called offer to bring up a \nsingle amendment tells you more about the majority's decision to avoid, \nat all costs, a solution that measures up to the scale of the energy \nproblem than it does about the Republican's desire to get our work done \nhere in the Senate.\n  This ban on production of our own energy resources can no longer \nstand in the face of a growing crisis. What we are talking about now, \nSenators, is that starting 20, 25 years ago, some 27 years ago, the \nCongress of the United States decided, 1 year at a time, in the \nappropriations bills, that they would put a ban on drilling off the \nshores of certain States, until we got to the point where 85 percent of \nall the coastal areas of America have a ban, a congressionally imposed \nban. You cannot go into those areas using the lease proposals of the \nU.S. Government and give oil companies, large and small, leases to \ndrill and find oil and gas for the American people.\n  Now, obviously this ban on production of our own energy can't stand \nwith today's problems. Those bans started when we were worried about \noil spills, and they started when we didn't worry about the price of \noil. They started when oil was so cheap that we did not care about \nproducing our own. We could, with reckless abandon, put bans and \nprohibitions on drilling anywhere we wanted and nobody would get hurt \nand the American people would not suffer.\n  Such is not the case now. That is why I beg to differ with Democrats \nwho say we are here playing some kind of politics. If there is any \npolitics being played, it is the politics that is trying to prevent \nRepublicans from presenting here on the floor amendments that try to do \nthe people's business, that try to use this oil and gas that is ours in \nsuch a way that it will reduce the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  They have called hearings on their own proposals; they have canceled \nthem. They have called for markups on their own bills which would \ninclude these same issues; they have canceled those hearings. They can \navoid hearing testimony on their own policy proposals. They can avoid \nproduction votes on their own appropriations measures. They can \neven avoid real production votes on the Senate floor. However, my \ncolleagues will not be able to avoid their constituents during the \nAugust recess.\n\n  Thus far this week, instead of action, we have heard a great deal of \ntalk from the other side. We have heard tales of how Republicans are \n``blocking another bill.'' I mean, it is really hard for a Senator like \nthis one, who has been here 36 years--this is my last year--I have been \nin charge of energy legislation, been in charge or ranking member only \nfor the last 4 or 5 years. Prior to that, I did budget work and other \nwork. But in terms of being chairman or ranking member, it is only a \nfew years. We got a lot of things done in those few years.\n  We are here since the Democratic leader brought a bill to the floor. \nIt was his choice to bring it here. He brought the bill here in an \nextraordinary manner. It is now here, it is pending, and it should be \ntreated the same as any ordinary bill that is pending.\n  It is a bill which allows for any responsible provision to be added \nto it as an amendment and a responsible provision, as we see it, that \nwill help with the crisis confronting America and we say any amendment \nthat will produce more oil, more gas that will be added to what America \ncan drill for and use. That is important. We are not blocking anything.\n  Can you imagine, they bring down a bill that does one little thing \nthat has been said by most experts to not even be needed. If anything, \nit is a minor problem. And they want to vote on it and go home and tell \nthe American people they have done something about the energy problem? \nWe turn around and say: Yes, let's do something about it, and we are \nthe ones ``blocking'' another bill.\n  The majority has said they want something done on energy. This would \nbe believable if the leadership on the Democratic side had not clearly \nstated in December that they would pivot away from highlighting \naccomplishments in the coming year, abandoning any attempt at \naccomplishments, and a staged attempt to manufacture the appearance of \nobstruction is transparently political.\n  This strategy of campaigning from the Senate floor has weakened the \ninstitution and left the American people without much needed leadership \nduring this energy crisis. Instead of impugning the name of the \nAmerican President from the Senate floor, instead of reading poll \nnumbers on the Senate floor, instead of providing daily opinions on the \nstatus of the Presidential campaigns--Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Instead of providing daily opinions on the status of \nthe Presidential campaign and special elections, the Senate could have \nbeen legislating.\n  We have been told that Republicans may be allowed to offer one \namendment; I repeat that, just one amendment. And I repeat that in my \n36 years, I have never seen a problem so big met by a proposal or a \nproposed solution that is so small. The offer of a single amendment was \naccompanied by a baseless assertion from the majority that they are \nwilling to compromise and work together on energy legislation that both \nsides can live with.\n  We were told that one amendment from the majority and a competing \nproposal from the minority is how the legislative process is supposed \nto work. I disagree. The Senate passed bipartisan comprehensive energy \nlegislation in 2005 and 2007. I was here every moment of it. The \nprocess for those bills, which passed both Chambers in the Congress and \nwere signed by the President, was quite different.\n  Take the Energy Policy Act of 2005, for example. And now I will go \nthrough the history of that one and the two that followed it.\n  We devoted 10 days of the Senate's time to debating that measure. \nThere were 19 rollcall votes held on amendments, 23 rollcall votes on \nthe legislation itself, there were 235 amendments proposed, and 57 of \nthem were agreed to. There is a similar story to be told of the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007. Over 15 days, the Senate voted \non 16 amendments, held 22 votes on the bill itself, saw 331 amendments \nfiled and 49 of them agreed to.\n  We can look back further, of course, to a time when the Senate \nsuccessfully moved legislation focused purely on environmental \nprotection. During consideration of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, \nthe Senate devoted 5 weeks to a thorough and open debate. A total of \n180 amendments were offered and 131 were ultimately acted upon by the \nfull Senate.\n  And yet, we are told that one amendment from each side is how the \nlegislative process is ``supposed to work.'' This approach is more \naccurately described as a lesson in how to steer the legislative \nprocess towards failure. The\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\nAmerican people want action, not excuses; they want real proposals, not \npolitical ploys; and they want genuine solutions, not small measures.\n  During the recent climate change debate, perhaps it was good that the \nmajority undertook a process that was doomed to fail. The cap-and-trade \nbill would have increased gas prices by more than a dollar per gallon, \nand energy prices across the board would have increased as well. But \nnow, as a growing majority of Americans from all political camps demand \nmore energy production here at home, we have to get serious about doing \nthe work that we have been elected to do. Advancing a bill that focuses \non such a narrow part of the energy crisis we face, stifling the \nability to offer amendments to that bill, cancelling markups, and \nabandoning hearings are not what the American people want from the \nCongress.\n  I am disappointed that we will not be offered the opportunity to act \nin a real way this week on the most important issue facing the American \npeople. Despite the majority leader's assertions about the recent \ndecline in the price of oil, talking will not solve what all experts \nsay is a supply and demand imbalance. Solving this problem requires \naction and leadership. I hope we will see both before we depart for our \nhome States in August.\n  It is pretty clear to me, and I think we are able to make it pretty \nclear to anybody who is interested, that now is the time to pass \nmeaningful legislation that will help the American people through the \ncrisis of the high prices of gasoline. While we are building a major \nplan and have come along with a minor plan, in a couple weeks we could \nknock out a very good bill. I am willing to sit down, bipartisan. If \nthe majority side is willing and the chairman of the committee is \nwilling to invite me, I will be there. Maybe we can do it. Thus far, it \nseems it was not possible. So we are trying the best we can to do the \nwork for the American people. That means good amendments to a pending \nbill which we did not bring up, but it is there for us to use, pursuant \nto our rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Housing Crisis\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the housing crisis \nwhich has gripped the United States for many months now, more than a \nyear, but especially to talk about the bipartisan work done in the \nSenate and across the Capitol in the House. I commend the work of \nChairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby from the Senate Banking \nCommittee, as well as Chairman Frank on the House side, for their \nefforts to put together a bipartisan piece of housing legislation which \nwill have the effect of stemming the tide of foreclosures and bring \nsome measure of relief to families. We know the data, the statistics, \nwhich bear repeating. Every weekday in America, only because \ncourthouses are not open on Saturday and Sunday, some 8,500 families \nbegin the foreclosure process or take some step in the process of being \nthrown into that nightmare. Every day that happens. No day does it not \nhappen. We are thinking today about those families and their problems \nand their lives.\n  We think about the necessity of this legislation on a lot of days, \nbut today the New York Times reported the average 30-year fixed \nmortgage rate went, from last week, from 6.44 percent to 6.71 percent, \nin a matter of days going up by that much. For a lot of those families, \ninterest rates are going up. The misery and the nightmare of \nforeclosure is overwhelming them. It is incumbent upon the Senate and \nthe House and the administration to do something about it, not just to \nkeep talking about it but to do something about it. Fortunately, there \nare people who have done that.\n  One of the elements to this, of course, is dealing with the crisis \nwhich has gripped the two largest providers of mortgages, two entities \nin our system that provide as much as $5 trillion--it is hard to \ncomprehend that number--of our mortgages, Fannie and Freddie, as we \nknow them by their commonly known names, using that terminology.\n  In the first quarter of this year, 70 percent of all new mortgages \nwere provided by Fannie and Freddie. These two government-sponsored \nenterprises, described as mortgage giants, have a tremendous impact on \nour mortgage market but also have a tremendous impact on our economy \nhere at home and around the world. We cannot let them fail. Some people \nwill talk about what Secretary Paulson has proposed and others about \nFannie and Freddie, and they will say how much does it cost. That is an \nappropriate question. There are a series of questions I have asked that \nI will get to in a moment. The other question we need to ask is: What \nis the cost of letting them fail? That is why this bipartisan effort \nhas been so important.\n  I commend Secretary Paulson for doing an extraordinarily difficult \njob under difficult circumstances. He has worked hard. He has tried to \nfind common ground. I haven't always agreed with him. I am sure he has \nnot always agreed with me and every Member of the Senate and the House, \nbut I think he has worked hard with both parties to try to work \nsomething out.\n  It is very simple. If Fannie and Freddie are going to come to the \nCongress and say, we need your help, we need a line of credit, and we \nneed to have the authority to purchase equity, then we say, last time \nwe checked, we were elected by taxpayers. So if you are going to ask us \nfor help, we are going to ask you questions and demand that you put on \nthe table and we put into any agreement the kind of principles any \ntaxpayer should have a right to expect. That is the exchange. They want \nhelp, and we will give them help. We think it is important to make sure \nthey don't fail. But if they are going to get the help, they have to \nput some principles in place. So Fannie and Freddie, those major \norganizations--institutions--have to bring some measure of \naccountability to their own practices.\n  I looked at a chart yesterday. I am using round numbers here, but \nthey are not off by very much, to generalize. If you look at the top \npeople at Fannie and Freddie, about 13 people, when you add up bonuses \nand salaries and other incentives, it is about $76 million in 2007. So \nif 13 people are getting $76 million in 1 year, you better believe \ntaxpayers have an interest in this. I think Fannie and Freddie have \nstill a ways to go. Even if the House does their job today and passes \nthis legislation, even if the Senate passes it, Fannie and Freddie have \nto prove to taxpayers, these two mortgage giants have to prove to \ntaxpayers that they are going to be accountable, that it is not just \nsymbolic. They have to put practices in place and measures in place.\n  I have asked for that. I have said both of them should pursue \nlitigation, if it takes that, to recover excess bonuses. They should \nmake sure that when they make any agreement on stock purchases or any \nother benefit to their executives, that they have to consider steps \nthat will hold them accountable, in addition to all the other \nsafeguards taxpayers have a right to expect, if taxpayers are going to \nhelp them. Again, I support making sure we don't let these two fail, \nbut taxpayers have an interest here.\n  One of the other features of the bipartisan legislation is that in \norder for Fannie and Freddie to work well, to be effective in the \nmortgage market, we have to have a tough, independent regulator for \nboth. That is what we worked out in the Banking Committee. The \nPresiding Officer knows of our work. We have worked that out as part of \nthe legislation. It is critically important the American people know \nthat part of the non-Fannie and Freddie part of this housing \nlegislation is a provision that speaks to how we regulate their \nactivities. In addition to working on any kind of help that we are \ngoing to give Fannie and Freddie, the Banking Committee and people in \nthis Chamber have a real concern about making sure we have a strong, \nindependent regulator in place.\n  Two more points, one of which is on community development block \ngrants. Thank goodness that apparently Secretary Paulson and others, I \nand others have called upon the President to lift his veto threat and \nto stop using help for local communities as an impediment to signing \nhousing legislation\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\nwhich is needed to stop those 8,500 foreclosures every day of every \nweek. Apparently, from what we hear today, the President has, in fact, \nlifted his veto threat. Thank goodness for the housing market. But also \nthank goodness for families across America, especially those who might \nbe 1 of those 8,500 every day of every week in the near term, before \nfamilies fall into that dark hole, that nightmare we hope this \nlegislation will help.\n  Community development block grants are one way to help here. There is \nno reason why local communities, those local officials who are closest \nto the problems and closest to the people, there is no reason why they \nshouldn't get the help they need through this legislation. There are a \nlot of other provisions we could talk about in the legislation, but I \nwish to commend the work done by the committee, the Banking Committee, \nby Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Chairman Frank on the \nHouse side. This, in the end, is not about some esoteric Fannie Mae or \nFreddie Mac issue. It is not about some distant theoretical housing \nissue. This is about real lives and real families. Many of them are not \njust struggling with impending foreclosure and the devastation that can \nbring; this is about families also who are paying the highest gasoline \nprices we have ever seen in American history, paying higher health care \ncosts, paying college tuition costs, paying the higher cost of food. \nThis is one of many problems that has been heaped upon middle-class and \nlow-income families.\n  This legislation will provide some relief. I am thankful the House is \nworking on it today. I look forward to prompt passage in the Senate and \nhaving President Bush sign it into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to speak basically about the need \nfor more energy production as well as more conservation. Before I do, I \nwould like to follow up on the comments of my colleague from \nPennsylvania. This housing bill we have all worked on for quite some \ntime now is hopefully going to be passed by the House. The President \nhas withdrawn his threatened veto. It looks like this major piece of \nreform will finally come to pass. I thank Chairman Baucus, Chairman \nGrassley, and Chairman Dodd for including in that bill, before it left \nthe Senate, an extremely important provision for the State of Louisiana \nand Mississippi, the whole gulf coast, that will provide some \nsignificant tax relief to people who had received Road Home benefits \nbased on the extent of their damage, whether they received a $20,000 \ngrant or a $50,000 grant or a cap at 150, to try to make them somewhat \nwhole.\n  This is not making people whole along the gulf coast. But if their \ninsurance failed them or they were in a place that was not a flood \nplain and didn't have insurance because they weren't in a flood plain \nbut lost everything anyway because of the magnitude of the storms, we \nallow them an opportunity for a grant to rebuild. It is working. It has \nbeen very slow. It has been painful. The programs were not established \ncorrectly initially, but both Mississippi and Louisiana are making \ngreat progress. The problem was, these grants would have been taxable, \nputting people in a tax bracket where they would have to write a check \nto the Federal Government for $5,000 or $15,000 or $20,000. It would be \nimpossible for them to do that under these circumstances. So this bill \nhas corrected that. They will still have to pay regular taxes but not \non these Road Home grants. It is basically a billion-dollar direct \nrelief to homeowners in the gulf coast. We could not be more grateful \nto the Members, to the Presiding Officer and others who voted to \ninclude that and particularly to the chairman. If any homeowners in \nAmerica need help, not just the ones who were foreclosed on through no \nfault of their own but most certainly the 300,000 homeowners who lost \ntheir homes because these storms took everything they had, we are very \ngrateful for that help in housing.\n  I wish to speak about energy. There have been a lot of charts and \ngraphs put up because this is a dynamic and tense debate. There are \nlegitimate issues on both sides. I wished to bring a new chart that can \nexplain the situation at least much more clearly. The facts are that in \nthe United States, along the Outer Continental Shelf which is off our \nshore, there is currently now a moratorium along the west coast, along \nthe east coast from Maine to the top of Florida, and on the eastern \nside of the gulf. This goes out 200 miles from State waters, and it is \nnow off-limits to exploration.\n  Meanwhile, Canada, our friendly neighbor, is drilling right here off \ntheir entire coast.\n  I do not know how much they are producing off this coast, but it is \nsubstantial resources. Right here in the gulf, off the coast of \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, as you all know, we have a long \ntradition of believing that natural resources actually belong to the \npublic, and we should be exploring these resources for the benefit not \njust of our region but for the Nation.\n  Most of the oil and gas--basically a third of the oil and gas--of the \nNation is coming off the shores of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and, \nto some degree, Alabama, despite the no-drill zone or no-exploration \nzone off Florida.\n  Now, interestingly enough--which is what is partly driving a change \nin this debate--is this area right here, as shown on the map, which is \noff the coast of Cuba but very close to Florida. It is currently being \nleased for drilling by the Chinese, by European powers. So the fact is, \nwhile we sit and lock up our resources off our coasts, China and Europe \nare coming in and drilling closer to the land of the United States than \nwe are allowing ourselves to drill, which does not make sense.\n  What we need to do to get prices down is to increase the supply of \noil and gas domestically and--and--significantly reduce our usage of it \nby moving away from gasoline-only vehicles. It does not mean we all \nhave to move from big cars to tiny cars. It does not mean our farmers \nhave to give up their pickup trucks. It does not mean our truck drivers \nhave to park their big vehicles and sit on the side of the road.\n  What it does mean is we can, through legislation, build new trucks, \nnew cars, and new pickup trucks that get 50 miles a gallon or 60 miles \na gallon and not just gallons of gasoline but gallons of ethanol \nproduced from corn or from sugarcane or cellulosic matters or fiber or \nwaste, municipal waste.\n  So we need to look and see where we can drill safely in these places. \nThere is drilling allowed right now in Alaska but very limited. \nAlthough it is allowed, it is limited. We need to look at how we can \naccelerate this drilling. The great news is--even though I support \ndrilling in ANWR; we do not have enough votes to do that--ANWR \nrepresents this tiny dot, a dot. We should not stop fighting about \nANWR, but we should also think about other places in Alaska where we \ncould drill safely and open exploration in limited places, providing a \nbuffer zone for States and providing very strategic care.\n  One myth I wish to correct today--because it is a rampant myth--is \nthat there is hardly any oil and gas off our coast. People will come to \nthe floor and say: The Senator is correct. This is off-limits to \nexploration, but the reason it is is because there is no oil and gas \nthere.\n  That is not true. I know people are not purposely misleading because \nthey are citing statistics from old material. But I wish to give you \nsome statistics that will prove my point.\n  The estimates come from Minerals Management through the Energy \nDepartment. In 1995, the Government was making estimates of what was in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. They said, in 1995, there were only 5 billion \nbarrels of oil in the gulf. But when they started drilling more and \nexploring more and using new technologies, we have now determined there \nare 20 billion barrels of oil.\n  So in 1995, the same group that is doing these estimates here, said \nin the gulf there was only 5 billion barrels. But after we did the \nright kind of exploration and testing, we actually found more than 20 \nbillion. That was in 2000. So the idea is that today, if we would allow \nthe inventory to take place right now, the estimates might be that \nthere are only a few billion barrels. But based on the experience we \nhave in the Gulf of Mexico, we know it is going to jump considerably.\n  We are the only country, to my knowledge, in the developed world that\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\nhas not even explored or taken an inventory of what the resources are. \nIn those days, we did not have the kind of technology we have today. So \nwe can use modern 3D seismic technology. I am going to suggest we do \nnot have to wait until 2030. We do not have to wait until 2040. There \nis infrastructure in place now in this part of the Gulf of Mexico, and \nit could be established in some other places as well, to go after the \noil and gas that is there that this country needs to increase our \ndomestic supply.\n  Mr. President, I know I only have 1 more minute to close.\n  As you know, people from this Chamber send letters overseas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for an additional minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We keep sending letters overseas asking everybody else \nto increase production so they can send us oil and gas. Yet off our own \nshore, we have great resources of oil and gas for which we must make a \nbreakthrough and open for exploration.\n  So I know my time is wrapping up now. I wish to come back to the \nfloor and talk about the safety and the new technology.\n  I am going to show one picture in the Chamber. This is what an \noffshore oil rig looks like. There is a platform on top of the water, \nwhich a lot of people have not seen. But you can see these off the \ncoast of Texas and Louisiana. We like the way they look. It talks about \nmoney and independence. That is what it means to us. It can be done \nquite safely. This is as blue as the water looks, with lots of fish \naround those rigs. The pipelines are down on the ocean floor.\n  So I will come back and talk more about the new technologies that \nallow us to drill safely. But I hope the facts I have shared help us to \ncome to terms with opening more resources in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues to help explain \nthe need--the crucial need--for comprehensive action on the Nation's \nmost pressing domestic issue, as explained so eloquently by Senator \nDomenici. We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his leadership and his \nservice in the Senate.\n  This is a national issue. But I wish to focus on an individual \nbecause this affects individual people and families as well as it being \na national and domestic energy issue.\n  Never was the energy crisis made so clear to me than when I met with \nJohn Grau, a Kansan who runs a cattle operation--or did before a \ntornado--near Soldier, KS. I visited with John at what used to be his \nhome, until a June 11 tornado reduced it to a basement, opened to the \nsky except for a fruit closet, of all things, with the fruit jars still \nthere. What a miraculous thing. He and his wife had taken shelter and--\nalso a miracle--they had survived, thank the Lord.\n  Despite everything he had been through and everything he would face \nas he would begin to recover from his losses--we were standing there, \nlooking at what used to be his ranch and what used to be his home--he \nwanted to talk about gas prices. He said: I am going to be all right, \nafter the storms. I can make it back. Look at the 200 friends here \nhelping me. But Congress has to do something, he said, because the high \ncost of gas was a crucial hardship for his employees, his neighbors, \nhis friends, and his future.\n  Now, I have been retelling this story because it is important for \nthose engaged in the debate to understand how high prices are affecting \nreal people and that we need real answers and we need them now.\n  Now, when I hear those on the other side of the aisle criticize our \nproposals on the basis that it will take several years for new oil and \ngas to hit the market, I am reminded that over the last two decades \nthis body has held over 20 votes on energy production. That is 20-plus \nvotes on deep sea, oil shale or Alaska production that have been \nblocked by my colleagues.\n  The only thing that has changed in this surreal argument is energy \nprices and gas prices have continued to increase to a crisis level \nproportion. Twenty years of policy that increased our reliance on \nforeign oil is enough. That is why the American public is calling for \nus to change course and to do it now.\n  They know we cannot tax or regulate our way out of high energy \nprices. We must enact a long-term, comprehensive strategy that steers \nthe Nation in the right direction so we are not at the mercy of foreign \ninterests.\n  This is also a matter of national security. We do not want to be \ndependent on people with names such as Ahmadinejad and Putin and \nChavez. It is not only about John Grau. As I have said, it is a matter \nof national security. But John Grau is the individual who is being \nhurt, similar to so many millions of Americans today.\n  The answer is pretty simple: Adopt policies that lessen demand on \nenergy and create more energy here at home, from sources we can depend \non. We need action on this strategy, and we need it now.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act takes these necessary steps. The bill \nwould tap as much as 14 billion barrels of oil along the Atlantic and \nthe Pacific. The legislation would also open three times the oil \nreserves of Saudi Arabia through Western State oil shale exploration.\n  Now, some of my colleagues want to paint this side of the aisle as \nadvocating for drilling only. It is obvious they have not read our \nproposals. Yes, we--and the majority of Americans--support increased \ndomestic production. But we also support reduced consumption and \nincreased transparency, oversight and efforts by the CFTC regarding the \nfutures markets.\n  Our policy position does not stop at ``find more.'' Our message--and \nthe message from my constituents--is: Find more and use less.\n  Our bill encourages alternative sources of energy, including plug-in \nelectric vehicles through the development of better batteries to \nmaximize electricity range and use less gas.\n  Our bill is the latest in a number of actions we have taken to reduce \ndemand on foreign oil and increase production of clean energy here at \nhome. In 2005, we passed the Energy Policy Act that developed \nincentives for ethanol production. In 2007, we passed the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act, which improved vehicle fuel economy by \nincreasing CAFE standards and provided incentives to develop cellulosic \nethanol, the next generation in ethanol production. I might add, in \nregards to the CAFE standards, it was also with the cooperation of the \nautomobile industry, for the first time.\n  Limiting our efforts to only address concerns about speculation \nignores the root cause of higher prices, and that is production. The \nPresident lifted the ban on offshore exploration. All that is left is \nfor Congress to act.\n  Again, clearly, the next step is action on a long-term comprehensive \nenergy solution for the Nation which would increase the supply of \naffordable, clean domestic energy. We can start by passing the Gas \nPrice Reduction Act. However, the alternative on the floor--the bill we \nare debating--is the majority leader's speculation bill, and it has \nbeen proposed basically on the floor. It did not go through the \ncommittee process. The President's working group, working on the very \nsame problems, has strong concerns with this bill.\n\n  The Interagency Task Force on Commodity Markets' preliminary report \njust came out and also shows that supply and demand is the driving \nfactor in energy price increases. Another final report will hopefully \nbe out in September.\n  Now, concern for the unintended consequences of this so-called \nspeculation bill is precisely why we must engage in an open and fair \ndebate where ideas and all pertinent proposals are discussed and should \nbe voted upon. The American people deserve no less. However, that is \nnot happening. That is not happening, and that is an egregious error.\n  Our constituents expect and deserve more from their Senators. They \nneed solutions--real solutions, comprehensive solutions--and they need \nthem now.\n  I harken back to my comments in regard to Kansas cattleman John Grau \nlooking over his home and ranch, completely destroyed by a tornado. He \nsaid\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\nit best: I can make it back, Pat, but Congress has to take real action. \nWe should--we should and eventually we will--find more and use less. I \ncompletely agree with John Grau.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is imperative--imperative--that American \nleaders declare war on high gas policies and implement policies to \nachieve energy independence. We are almost 60 percent dependent on \nforeign sources of oil, from the likes of Iran's Ahmadinejad, Russia's \nPutin, and Venezuela's Chavez, all of whom harbor anti-American \nsentiments and get richer while American families are suffering and our \nbusinesses are hurting terribly.\n  To secure our energy future, America needs what I would call a \n``kitchen sink'' policy. We need to throw everything and the kitchen \nsink at our energy crisis--conservation, alternative energy, \nexploration, and market fairness. We need policies that provide \nimmediate relief as well as short- and long-term solutions.\n  I urged that we halt deposits to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and \nwe successfully passed legislation to that effect. I support right now \nreleasing one-third of the current reserves which would increase \nsupply, drive down prices, and signal to speculators that the U.S. \nGovernment is dead serious about addressing high gas prices.\n  It is also important to protect consumers from illegal market \nmanipulation and corporate corruption. I, along with some of my \ncolleagues, am calling for an oil and gas market fraud task force to \npolice oil speculators and ensure that energy markets are functioning \nproperly.\n  As we know, the Senate is currently considering a bill to rein in \nenergy market speculation, and I agree that additional enforcement and \ntransparency can help better manage these commodities that are critical \nto our economic and national security. We should move forward with \nresponsible actions, but cracking down on speculators alone will not \nsolve our gas price woes.\n  We must also decrease demand and increase supply. Rising gas prices \nare driven primarily by supply and demand imbalance in global energy \nmarkets. Last year, global demand exceeded supply by nearly 1 billion \nbarrels per day. The result: Over the past year, gas prices in North \nCarolina have increased by more than 30 percent.\n  To decrease demand, I strongly support conservation efforts and \ninvestments in alternative energy research. No question, America needs \na crash course in conservation. I have cosponsored numerous bills to \npursue these goals, including the Clean Energy Investment Act, the \nClimate Security Act, and the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act.\n  To increase supply, we also must utilize America's vast energy \nresources. Surely, bringing these energy resources on line will not \nhappen overnight but, if anything, that means we should move more \nquickly to pursue them. For instance, if President Clinton had not \nvetoed legislation in 1995 to open 2,000 acres of the 19 million acres \nin remote areas of Alaska for exploration, our current energy deficit \nwould already be reduced by roughly 1 million barrels of oil a day.\n  After careful consideration, I support lifting the moratorium on the \nOuter Continental Shelf--OCS--giving States the option of allowing \nexploration at least 50 miles offshore, where it is not visible from \nland. A portion of revenues generated from leases would go to the \nStates and could be used for dredging and beach renourishment and other \ncoastal priorities. Families struggling with high gas prices cannot \nafford for Congress to keep energy options off the table. They must all \nbe on the table.\n  I am excited about lifting restrictions on oil shale exploration in \nthe Rocky Mountain West. With the potential for oil shale to produce \nmore than three times the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia, we can ill \nafford to further delay utilizing this American oil resource.\n  However, we should not explore for more petroleum at the expense of \nalternative energy. We must pursue all available resources, including \nnuclear, clean coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and biofuels.\n  Along those lines, let me add that not only are families being \nslammed with high energy costs, but they are also being hit hard with \nescalating food prices. I am very concerned that food-to-fuel mandates \nhave resulted in a substantial volume of our corn crop and vegetable \noils being diverted into ethanol and other fuel supplies, severely \nimpacting food and feed prices. In fact, since February 2006, the price \nof corn has increased by more than 200 percent, and this has caused \nfeed price increases that impact the cost of basic items such as milk, \neggs, and meat.\n  During consideration of the 2007 Energy bill, Senator Inhofe and I \ntried to include a safeguard in the renewable fuel standard which would \nhave helped prevent a situation such as we face today. The \nadministration should waive the mandates, and we need to correct these \nunintended negative consequences where an excessive amount of corn and \nvegetable oils have gone to ethanol production. This is having an \nimpact worldwide and emptying the shelves of our food banks and our \nfood pantries. Alternative energy must absolutely be a part of our \nenergy future, but there are obvious and painful lessons to be learned \nfrom the ripple effects of these mandates.\n  One day we will be free from the stranglehold of high gas prices and \ndependence on foreign oil. We will power our economy with alternative \nenergy sources, and no longer will the petrotyrants in Iran, Venezuela, \nand Russia be able to hold the world economy hostage.\n  However, to get there, we are going to have to throw everything and \nthe kitchen sink at our energy crisis. I call on President Bush to hold \na national summit now for congressional and national leaders to come \ntogether and develop a comprehensive plan. The time is now for \nrealistic, bipartisan solutions to provide families and businesses with \nimmediate relief to meet our energy needs for the short term and to \nsecure our energy independence for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think Senator Dole's idea of the kitchen \nsink approach is right on target. Maybe we will even find a way for the \nkitchen sink to somehow help us out here, but at least it is everything \nbut the kitchen sink that Republicans are suggesting is the answer to \nour oil crisis.\n  There isn't just one answer. That is why we don't agree with the \nDemocratic bill, which is simply to deal with speculators and \nspeculation. I am going to talk about that in a moment. First, to \nreiterate what Senator Dole said, Republicans support a broad-based, \nbalanced approach to this problem that recognizes there isn't one \nsilver bullet, but through a combination of things such as \nconservation, such as renewable energy, such as producing a lot more \noil and gas which this country has. Also, if we will simply lift the \nmoratoria that currently preclude us from exploring for more energy, \ndeal with speculation to the extent it exists, as well as certainly \nnuclear power--all of these things together can help us work our way \nout of the crisis. Part of it is short term, part of it is medium term, \npart of it takes long term. We have to look at this as a long-term \nproblem.\n  I shake my head at those who say: Well, that particular solution \ndoesn't do anything for 3 to 7 years. My answer is, of course, I have \nnever completed a journey I didn't start. If we had completed some of \nthe things we started years ago, we wouldn't be in the crisis we are in \nright now. However, we are stuck right now with one bill on the floor. \nUnfortunately, it is not the Republican approach, which is a balanced, \nbroad-based approach, and includes new production, but simply the \nlimited approach of dealing with so-called speculators.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about why only focusing on speculation \nisn't going to produce one more drop of oil, it is not going to reduce \nthe price at the pump, it is not going to solve the problem and, in the \nlong term, could actually hurt, and I will try to explain why.\n  It is propitious that yesterday a report came out that supports what \nI am now saying. We didn't have anything to\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\ndo with the timing, but I say it is propitious because it helps to \nanswer questions that people have been asking. For over 3 months now \nthe regulatory body of our Government that looks at speculation, called \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has been testifying, and \ndespite enormous pressure from the other side to point the finger at \nspeculators, they have consistently said they don't think it is \nspeculators. We believe it is the law of supply and demand, the fact \nthat there is much more demand for oil than we are producing that is \ncreating a problem.\n  Well, an interagency task force led by the CFTC and composed of staff \nfrom the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Treasury, the Federal \nReserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Trade \nCommission all reaffirmed yesterday that:\n\n       Current oil prices and the increase in prices between \n     January 2003 and June 2008 are largely due to fundamental \n     supply and demand factors.\n\n  Furthermore, the report--and again I am quoting:\n\n     suggests that changes in futures market participation by \n     speculators have not systemically preceded price changes. On \n     the contrary, most speculative traders typically alter their \n     positions following price changes, suggesting that they are \n     responding to new information--just as one would expect in an \n     efficiently operating market.\n\n  The other side has ignored this CFTC analysis for a long time. I hope \nthe new report will not be ignored, because what it illustrates is you \nare not going to solve this problem by trying to figure out a way to \nsomehow regulate speculators. You have to deal with the law of supply \nand demand.\n  I tried to explain this to a younger person who was wondering what \nall of this debate was about, and this is the example I came up with--\nor the analogy: These are investors, these so-called speculators, and \nwhat they are trying to do is to predict into the future what the price \nof something is going to be. Now, if they guess right, they can make \nmoney. If they guess wrong, they may lose money. They are researchers \nand they are looking at the best evidence they can. One of the things \nthey look at is will there be more supply or more demand. Obviously, if \nthere is more demand, then the price is going to go up. It is a little \nbit like the weatherman predicting the weather. The weatherman is a \nprofessional too and he looks at all of the research and he concludes \nthat by this weekend we are going to have some rain. Now, he may be \nright, he may be wrong, but that is his job, to try to predict, and \nmore often than not, he can predict it fairly accurately. What if we \ndon't want rain next weekend? What if we don't think rain is a good \nidea? Are we going to muzzle or fire the weatherman and say: We don't \nwant you to report this because we don't want the rain? Is that going \nto do any good? It doesn't do any good at all. If it is going to rain, \nit rains. If not, it won't.\n  If the prices are going to go up because Iran is rattling its sabers \nin the Persian Gulf, the prices are going to go up. If they don't, and \nthe prices don't go up, it is not the speculators who make the price go \nup or down. The speculators are reporters. They are people who are \ntrying to figure out what the price is going to be. They don't make it \nwhat it is; they are trying to figure out what it is going to be.\n  That is why the CFTC said they typically alter their position \nfollowing price changes, reacting to new information. Again, it would \nbe like trying to shut the weatherman up because we don't like the \nweather he is predicting. That is the role these speculators have. They \nare trying to predict the future and they actually help the market by \nsetting a price that is useful to those who are trading in the market.\n  I appreciate that there are colleagues on the other side who are \nskeptical about this, but let me explain why I think it is unlikely \nthat commodity traders actually push up the price of oil. Here is the \nexplanation. They can only do this and drive up prices if they actually \ntook physical possession of the product and then hoarded that, withheld \nit from the market.\n  But between 2003 and May of 2008, only about 2 percent of oil futures \ncontracts actually resulted in physical delivery. Those are the \nutilities, airlines--folks like that.\n  If commodity index fund investors were, in fact, hoarding actual \nphysical inventories to raise prices, one estimate suggests that they \nwould need to fill storage tanks with more than 40 times the amount of \noil currently held in the inventory at the Cushing oil terminal in \nOklahoma where the West Texas intermediate oil contract is valued. \nSince we have not seen all of this frenzied new construction of oil \nstorage tanks and facilities equivalent to 40 Cushing oil terminals, it \nis very clear that there is no hoarding occurring.\n  What is actually happening to supply today? Total oil stocks in the \ndeveloped countries have been static. In other words, we have not been \nincreasing the supply. A year ago, including strategic reserves, they \namounted to about 4.1 billion barrels and today are at about the same \nlevel. Global demand, on the other hand, was 86 million barrels a day \nin 2007, while supply totaled 85.5 million barrels, creating a deficit \nof half a million barrels a day. As one would expect, prices are rising \nto reflect the fact that there is not as much supply as there is demand \nfor the product.\n  I also think it is interesting that when you talk about speculators, \nyou know the price has been going down in the last few days. I haven't \nheard anybody complaining that the price of oil is going down. If they \nare to blame for the price going up, maybe we ought to pat the \nspeculators on the back for driving the prices down. Of course, they \ndon't have that effect; I am being facetious. But who are these \nnefarious investors?\n  If you have a relative who is retired or a friend or someone who has \na pension, you probably know a speculator. That is who is primarily \ninvesting in these kinds of funds. All investors want to diversify \ntheir portfolios to protect themselves against risk. You do that by \npurchasing as many different kinds of assets as you can, by investing \nin commodities. Pension funds and other institutional investors can \nprotect beneficiaries like retirees from market downturns. In the \ncurrent market, commodities are one of the few investments that have \nbeen actually generating positive returns. Under the legislation before \nus, if you declare these people bad investors or illegitimate \nspeculators, you are going to be hurting regular investors in the \nmarket. I don't think we want to do that.\n  Interestingly, one of the pieces of legislation the Republicans have \nsponsored--the legislation called the Gas Price Reduction Act--is very \nsimilar to a bill introduced by my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, who I think takes a thoughtful approach to speculation in the \nenergy markets. Like our bill, his focuses primarily on increasing the \nresources available to the CFTC so it can continue to do its job and \neven do a better job of ensuring there is enough transparency in the \nsystem to enable it to continue to investigate and take action, if need \nbe. With just a few modifications, I think the Durbin bill would be a \ngood approach, as is the Gas Price Reduction Act, which Republicans \nhave introduced, which strengthens the CFTC and makes sure it has the \nassets it needs to do the job we asked it to do.\n  In conclusion, I think everybody agrees that a stronger CFTC and \nadditional transparency are good. I think we can all support that. It \nis part of that kitchen sink approach we heard talked about earlier, \nbut it is only one small part of this. In no way are we going to see \nthat approach drive down the price at the pump. As I said, it is little \nbit like the weatherman, these speculators. They find out what the \nprice is and they, in effect, report it by their purchases or sales--\neither one. But you don't improve anything by killing the messenger--\nthe speculator--any more than you improve the weather by shooting the \nweatherman.\n  As we proceed with the debate, I hope my colleagues will agree that \nwhile there may be a lot of good ideas--and one may be to strengthen \nthe CFTC somewhat--that is not the answer to the crisis we face. It \ndoesn't produce one more drop of oil or gas. At the end of the day, we \nare not going to be successful unless we find a consensus to enable us \nto produce more so that, along with using less, we can drive down the \nprice of gas at the pump.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, it is now Wednesday, and we have been \ndebating the issue of speculation for\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nseveral days. I believe it is time to stop talking and it is time to \nvote to end speculation in the oil marketplace.\n  There is an honest debate going on about our long-term energy \npolicy--one I am glad we are having. We need to talk about the \npotential of expanding our domestic production and about new \nrefineries. I live next door to North Dakota, and I see their potential \nwith the oil shale. Certainly, as T. Boone Pickens has been doing over \nthe last few weeks, we need to lead the way with wind, solar, and to \nput the focus on hybrid and electric cars, biofuels, as we have seen in \nMinnesota. We have seen a revival in our rural areas with wind. We are \nthird in the Nation with wind. We have seen it with biodiesel, \nbiofuels.\n  I have seen firsthand the potential for this next energy revolution. \nIt is my belief that we should be investing in the farmers and workers \nof the Midwest and not the oil cartels of the Mideast. So I welcome \nthis debate, and I hope we can get something done on that.\n  Let's look at the short-run. What are the American people facing now \nwith $4-per-gallon gasoline? Right now, they don't have the time or the \npatience for us to tell them we are not going to get anything done on \nspeculation even though almost every Senator in this Chamber has \nadmitted there are problems with speculation and that it is part of the \nproblem. We may differ on how much of a problem it is, but we know it \nis part of the problem.\n  I believe our Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act will help to pop \nthe oil speculation bubble. This bill has a number of provisions that \nwill fight the kind of excessive speculation that drives up energy \nprices for hard-working American families.\n  This bill will close the so-called London loophole. It will stop \ntraders from routing transactions through offshore markets to get \naround limits on speculation put in place by U.S. regulators. The \nIntercontinental Exchange, or ICE, allows trading on American oil \nfutures, gasoline, and home heating oil with far less stringent \nreporting requirements than we have here at home. I can tell you that \nmy constituents--it is not great to tell them: Don't worry, Dubai or \nLondon will be taking care of you. They don't buy that, and they don't \nbuy it for a good reason. The way the world has worked now with the \nloopholes that have existed, like the Enron loophole--and I see Senator \nFeinstein, who worked to close that loophole to the point where we can \nbetter regulate our energy future. We know there is more we can do, and \nthat is what this bill contains.\n  This bill will make foreign trades in American oil and gasoline \nfutures subject to the same reporting requirements as trades made here \nat home, so we can stop a glut of overseas trades from driving up our \nenergy prices.\n  This bill would also require the CFTC to review the letters of ``no \naction'' that it issued to the ICE electronic exchange in Atlanta, and \nthe Dubai electronic exchange, which operates in cooperation with NYMEX \nin New York. With these ``no action'' letters, the CFTC gave these \nexchanges permission to operate in this country and trade in American \nenergy futures with no oversight from U.S. regulators. Personally, I \ndon't believe it is good enough to say that the Dubai Financial \nServices Authority is looking out for people in my State. We need to \nlet speculators know that if they want to trade in American energy \nfutures, they are going to be subject to American regulation.\n  The bill would also convene an international working group of \nfinancial market regulators to develop uniform reporting and regulatory \nstandards in the major trading centers in the world to put an end to \nthe problem of speculators shopping around for the country with the \nweakest regulations. The world has changed. One of our jobs in the \nSenate is not to just put our heads in the sand and pretend the world \nhasn't changed. It has. The laws must change with it.\n  This bill would also require the CFTC to impose position limits on \nspeculators who trade in energy futures but don't actually produce \nenergy or receive physical deliveries of energy commodities. If you are \nan investor who buys and sells oil futures but you don't plan to ever \ntake delivery of actual barrels of oil, this bill will limit how much \nyou can buy and sell so that you won't be distorting prices for your \nown personal gain. We know some limits are in place right now in \nAmerican laws, and this is to cover the situation we see going on in \nthe world today.\n  Last, this bill is going to give the CFTC the funding authority to \nhire at least 100 full-time employees so the Commission can strengthen \nits regulations and improve its enforcement over the energy derivative \nmarket. As a former prosecutor, I know--I have seen it before--you can \npass all the laws you want, but if you don't have the cops on the front \nline enforcing the law, you will not be able to get the job done. I \nheard the head of the CFTC testify before the Agriculture Committee. I \nwas surprised. As a prosecutor, I said: Give me all the tools I need, \nbecause you want to have the tools. That is what this bill does.\n\n  We have heard from the other side of the aisle that speculation is \nnot a major contributor to high oil prices. It is hard to imagine such \na position, but our friends on the other side seem intent on finding \nsome straw to hang on to that just doesn't work. They are literally \nliving in an evidence-free zone. Look at what has happened. Oil prices \nare up 25 percent. Gasoline is up 25 percent in 6 months; it is around \n$4. We know demand hasn't gone up 25 percent. Have we seen some \nincrease in worldwide demand? Yes, but demand in the United States is \ndown. It is nowhere near 25 percent, though.\n  We know something is going on. It is our job to adjust our laws and \ngive the agency that enforces these laws the funding it needs to do its \njob. We saw this happen with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. \nExports went way up, millions of exports; at the same time, the agency \nbecame a shadow of its former self. It is no surprise that we suddenly \nhad little foam toys, which were supposed to inflate in water, morph \ninto date-rape drugs. We had a little boy in Minneapolis die because he \nswallowed something from a toy that was 99 percent lead.\n  You have the same thing going on here. It is this Congress which has \nto step in and say: Let's get the agency the resources it needs to do \nits job. When oil prices jump $16 in 2 days without any events to drive \nthem up, we cannot say speculation isn't having an impact. When the \n12th largest private company in the United States is filing for \nbankruptcy after losing billions in oil trading, we cannot say \nspeculation isn't having an impact. Even Walter Lukken, the Acting \nChairman of the CFTC, has stated that oil markets are ``ripe for those \nwanting to illegally manipulate the markets.'' We had an expert testify \nbefore Congress that speculation in the oil market is the biggest \ngambling hall in America. We had CEOs saying it should be trading at \n$55 or $60 a barrel. Do you know who is taking a hit? It is Americans \nacross the country. They are taking a hit every time they go to fill up \ntheir gas tanks.\n  There is no excuse for this Congress not to act on speculation. We \nare listening to the people of this country, and we are hearing that \nthis bill--Majority Leader Reid's bill--makes common sense to everyday \nAmericans.\n  Groups across the country that deal with high gas prices every day \nhave come out in support of our efforts to stop the out-of-control \nspeculation going on in the oil market. These groups include the \nNational Farmers Union, the Teamsters, the Air Transportation \nAssociation, the Consumers for Competitive Choice, Northwest, and the \nAmerican Feed Industry Association. And the airlines in Minnesota \naren't exactly partisan organizations. They are businesses. They have \nseen their profits go down. They have seen their routes go down. The \nnumber of planes they can fly has gone down. They have unhappy \ncustomers. They have millions of airline customers who are writing in \nto do something on speculation. Speculation is where the rubber hits \nthe runway for the airlines in this country. We must do something about \nit. Even the beer wholesalers want to do something about it. I talked \nto one of their members last night. They want to get something done. I \ncan tell you that my friends across the aisle say speculation has \nlittle to do with this. I will use a good beer word: That is all foam \nand no beer.\n  It is time to get something done. It is time to act on speculation.\n  In conclusion, the cost of energy is hurting Americans from all walks \nof\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\nlife, in businesses and every sector of our economy. We need to work \nhard. I have pushed, in the last year and a half, for a long-term \nenergy policy. We need a bold energy policy to carry our Nation \nforward. We also need to do something now--today, not tomorrow, not \nnext week, not in September. Let's pass this speculation bill and help \nthe people of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n12 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish I could come to the floor and \nsay there is a quick fix for gasoline prices at the pump. This is \nneeded as much as anywhere in California where gas prices are high and \nat times the very highest. I wish I could say there was this quick fix, \nbut I cannot. I wish I could say if we could drill all of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, if we could drill on all of the public land in \nAmerica, the price of gasoline at the pump would drop immediately, but \nI cannot.\n  In all good conscience, I do not believe opening the Outer \nContinental Shelf to new drilling would lower the prices at the pump \nanytime in the near future. In the first place, it takes 2 years for \nMMS, Minerals and Management Service, to do the contracts. Secondly, \nall drilling rigs are now leased. There need to be new rigs. Thirdly, \nthere is no additional refining capacity. Fourth, drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf and on public lands in America over the last 8 years \nhas increased by 361 percent and, at the same time, the price of oil \nhas doubled. So there is no relationship between drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, drilling on public lands in America, and the price \nof oil. I deeply believe this.\n  Some say it is simply a problem of supply and demand, but physical \nsupplies of oil and natural gas have remained relatively stable over \nthe past year. In fact, if you remember, executives from oil companies \ntestified before Congress recently and asserted that the price should \nbe about $60 a barrel if it were just a matter of supply and demand.\n  Some point to instability in the Middle East and Africa's production \nregions. Others have pointed to the falling dollar. These are certainly \nfactors. But I cannot explain the sharp uptick in prices we have seen \nat the pump over the last few months.\n  So what is really going on? What is new in this picture? Consumption \nin America has dropped 3 percent this year over the same period last \nyear. So what is new? There is only one thing that is different, there \nis only one thing that is new, and it is a massive influx of \nspeculation in the marketplace. This is the 800-pound gorilla.\n  Increasingly, experts now say rampant speculation in energy markets \naccounts for anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of the energy price \nincrease. Some will say even more. So I think we have to take a look at \nwhy this is the case and what we can do about it.\n  In May, Congress took a major step forward in the effort to bring \nmore oversight to energy futures markets when we enacted legislation to \nclose the notorious Enron loophole. The Senator from Minnesota just \nreferred to it. I had worked on this for 6 years. I came to the floor \nwhen Phil Gramm argued against it. I lost. I got just 48 votes. We came \nback again. We finally got it in the farm bill this time, and the \nnotorious Enron loophole today is closed.\n  What was that? This loophole was created in 2000 when a measure was \ninserted in the dark of night into a must-pass appropriations bill at \nthe behest of Enron and others to essentially eliminate them from the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act. Two commodities were left out: \nenergy and metals.\n  During the western energy crisis in 1999 and 2000, we saw the costs \nin my State soar from roughly $8 billion in 1999 to $27 billion in 2000 \nand then to $27.5 billion in 2001. The reason for this was, in the \nmain, manipulation, fraud, and reckless speculation of the worst sort, \nall because you could trade on electronic platforms with no \ntransparency and there was no antifraud, antimanipulation oversight by \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  When all was said and done, these energy traders left California \ntaxpayers with an increased bill of about $40 billion. To date, 32 \ncompanies have pled guilty to market manipulation and settled $6 \nbillion in claims.\n  In recent years, we also saw the $6 billion collapse of the Amaranth \nhedge fund because of unregulated speculation in natural gas futures on \nelectronic exchanges. And the list goes on.\n  This has typified the energy marketplace. So it became clear that a \nlegislative fix was needed. We finally got that done, as I said.\n  The bill, which is now law, ensures that all major trades of energy \nfutures that could drive up prices or have what is called a price \ndiscovery impact are placed under the oversight of the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. The new law imposes limits on rampant \nspeculation, prevents fraud and manipulation, requires traders for the \nfirst time to keep records, and provides an audit trail to the CFTC. \nThis was a significant victory. It is signed into law.\n  But as we continue to learn more about what is really going on with \nenergy futures markets, it is clear more work remains to be done. We \nare learning about additional loopholes that must be closed, and the \nlegislation before us is critical to ensure that we can level the \nplaying field in energy markets, that there is transparency there.\n  First, the problem of large institutional investors, such as pension \nfunds; this is what is new in this market. From 2003 to 2008, \ninstitutional investments in commodity index funds rose from $13 \nbillion to $317 billion. That is in 5 years, from $13 billion to $317 \nbillion.\n  One might say, what does that have to do with it? Daniel Yergin, to a \ngreat extent, said what it has to do with it when he said:\n\n       Oil has become the ``new gold''--a financial asset in which \n     investors seek refuge as inflation rises and the dollar \n     weakens.\n\n  ``Investors seek refuge.'' So the implications are potentially \ndevastating, and here is why. Unlike gold, energy and agricultural \ncommodities meet essential needs in everyday lives of average people. \nThey are limited. They are not potbellies. Energy is limited in the \namount we have.\n  These institutional investors, the big pension funds, such as my own, \nthe California Public Employee Retirement Fund, has invested over $1 \nbillion in these markets. These institutional investors are trading \nlong on energy futures prices. In other words, they are betting that \nthe prices in these future markets continue to rise. They are not \nhedging against the risk of changing oil prices, as airlines and \nutilities frequently do. They never take delivery of a product. They \nparticipate in the oil markets only on paper. Yet these investors, the \nbig ones, are currently exempt from CFTC regulation when they execute \nthese trades through brokers or dealers. These trades are called swaps.\n  Currently, the CFTC limits speculation positions to a total of 20 \nmillion barrels of oil and 3 million barrels of oil in the last 3 days \nof a contract. However, these same investors avoid these limits by \nexecuting their trades as swaps. This is a mistake. Institutional \ninvestors have become speculators.\n  Last month, the CFTC announced that it will review trading practices \nfor these investors, and this is a positive step. But legislation is \nstill needed to level the playing field and close the loophole. The \nbill before us will limit the size and influence of institutional \ninvestor positions in energy markets.\n  To further increase transparency, this bill also requires the CFTC to \nbegin distinguishing between the institutional investor index trader \nand the swaps dealers who broker their trades. This legislation closes \nthe swaps loophole, bringing transparency and speculative position \nlimits to contracts executed through swaps dealers, in that way \npreventing a price discovery function as much as possible to keep \nprices from continuing to escalate.\n  Specifically, the bill gives the CFTC the authority to begin \ncollecting data on large over-the-counter traders so that it can \ndetermine whether price manipulation or excessive speculation is taking \nplace. This would ensure that the CFTC has a clear picture of all\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\ntrading in over-the-counter commodity markets.\n  The London loophole, what is the London loophole? I think we also \nmust prevent U.S. crude oil contracts from being traded on \ninternational exchanges without robust oversight.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A recent CFTC report found the traders were using the \nLondon exchange to trade U.S. crude oil futures to avoid U.S. \nregulations--in other words, go around it. Trades exceeded U.S. \nspeculation limits every single week since 2006.\n  Last month, CFTC announced that it would limit this offshore market \nspeculation and require recordkeeping and an audit trail for these \ntraders. That is a start. But legislation is still needed to codify the \nregulation. This legislation will require foreign exchanges with \ncustomers in the United States to adopt the same speculation trading \nlimits and reporting requirements that apply to U.S. trades, ending the \nregulatory race to the bottom. This language is based on legislation \nthat Senator Levin and I introduced previously.\n  I believe very strongly that we must ensure that American energy \ncommodities are protected from manipulation and excessive speculation, \nregardless of where the commodities are traded.\n  Bottom line, this bill brings transparency, it brings accountability, \nit brings recordkeeping, it brings oversight to the energy markets. It \nwould impose sound, proven economic principles to markets that are \ncurrently broken and where speculation has increased so dramatically \nthat it is pushing up the price. It would close regulatory and \nlegislative loopholes that prevent the CFTC from enforcing the \nCommodity Exchange Act in energy commodity markets.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill. I suspect it may not \npass. I hope it does because there is no question in my mind that the \n800-pound gorilla in the price of gasoline at the pump is excessive \nspeculation on commodities futures markets dealing with energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, will you be kind enough to notify me \nwhen there is 30 seconds remaining so I can conclude without imposing \non the other party's time?\n  Mr. President, today, Rhode Island drivers are paying more than $4 a \ngallon for gas, and they have been paying those prices for well over a \nmonth now. We all know that 8 years of two oilmen in the White House \nequals over $4-a-gallon gas, a nearly sixfold increase in oil prices.\n  These record oil prices have sent consumer prices skyrocketing, not \nonly at the pump but at the supermarket and the department store. Food \nand household goods take energy to produce and transport and have \nbecome more and more expensive. While George Bush and Dick Cheney's \nfriends in the oil industry celebrate grotesque profits, ordinary \nAmericans struggle to make ends meet. Families in Rhode Island and \nacross the country are having to choose between filling their tank and \nfeeding their families and between heating their home and buying needed \nmedicine. They are frustrated, they are angry, and they are looking for \nsolutions any way they can find them.\n  Unfortunately, rather than taking steps that will help consumers \ntoday, the Bush Republicans are now trying to harness Americans' anger \nand frustration and, of all things, use it to capture more inventory \nfor big oil. The energy companies have already bought 68 million acres \nof public lands to drill, and they are sitting on it. They are spending \nmore buying back stock than they are drilling these holdings. Now, \nrather than drill what they have, they want more.\n  The administration and its allies have said that opening more land to \ndrilling is the one and only way to lower the price of gas in this \ncountry. That is flat wrong. The United States owns 3 percent of the \nworld's oil reserves and consumes 25 percent of the world's oil. The \nmeasures endorsed by the administration and its allies would have zero \neffect on gas prices--zero effect for at least a decade. Even then, the \nEnergy Information Administration projects these proposals aren't \nlikely to make any significant dent in gas prices--cold comfort for \nAmericans who have watched gas prices rise by about $3 a gallon while \ntwo oilmen occupied the White House.\n  We cannot drill our way out of this problem, now or ever. But that is \nnot all. Even as the Bush Republicans say their only answer to our \nenergy crisis is drill, drill, drill, they have repeatedly refused our \ngood-faith offer to bring their proposal to a vote. If they are \nconfident this is the right solution, then give each of us the chance \nto vote up or down, based on what we think is right for the people we \nrepresent.\n  Why not? Because as we have seen, time and time again, they are not \ninterested in finding the right solution, in doing what is right by \nfamilies who need help today. No, the Bush Republicans are much more \ninterested in playing politics and pouring more money into the pockets \nof oil companies already reaping world record, history-of-the-universe \nprofits. Their proposal would encourage our continued dependence on \noil, harm our environment, and delay our badly needed transition to the \nvibrant green economy that beckons us. Make no mistake, if the \nRepublicans would let us walk through this door, a vibrant green \neconomy does beckon American workers and families.\n  We need real commonsense solutions that can make a difference now. \nOne factor most economists believe has played a major role in driving \nup prices is rampant speculation in the commodities and futures \nmarkets, something we can address today. Speculators invest in oil \nfutures with no intention of taking possession of the commodity itself. \nThey have historically played a role in the marketplace, but under \nGeorge Bush's watch, excessive and irresponsible speculation has \nexploded. Experts may disagree on whether speculators have run up the \nprice of oil by 10, 30 or 50 percent, but there is broad and growing \nagreement that speculation is a serious problem and that fixing that \nproblem can help bring gas prices down now.\n  Of course, the big oil companies, and those in Congress who support \nthem, say the dynamics of supply and demand, not speculation, is the \nreal cause of the massive price increases. There are two problems with \nthat argument. First, we have heard testimony from experts who say \nthere is no way that simple supply and demand for oil can explain the \nhuge rise in energy costs that have plagued American families in the \nlast several months. Second, energy speculation has its own supply and \ndemand in the commodity market. According to data from the CFTC, \nspeculators now control 71 percent of the oil market, up from 37 \npercent when President Bush took office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Chair.\n  With relatively constant supplies of futures and the dramatically \nexpanding demand of speculators, prices have nowhere to go but up. So I \nam here to support legislation that our colleagues have offered to get \nto the bottom of the energy speculation boom. Senator Maria Cantwell, \nin particular, has been a leader, but I wish to commend Majority Leader \nReid for offering the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008, \nwhich would address the problem of excessive speculation.\n  In the time that remains, I will simply urge my colleagues to take a \nlook at this problem. When there is $16 billion that used to chase \nthese indexed futures funds and it is now over 300, clearly something \nis going on in these markets that we need to get a look at. We should \nregulate them the way we do other markets, such as grain.\n  These funds, which include university endowments and pension funds, \nmay unknowingly be helping drive up prices by holding energy assets--\ncommodities they don't intend to sell or consume--as part of broad \ninvestment strategies.\n  The amount of money in commodity-based index funds has exploded in \nrecent years, rising from $13 billion in 2003 to $317 billion today, \naccording to one estimate.\n  Leader Reid's bill would bring to light the role of index traders in \nthe energy market by requiring the CFTC to collect and publish data on \ntheir\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\nparticipation. Greater transparency combined with the new investigatory \nresources that this bill provides will help lower energy prices.\n  Do we know for sure that speculation is driving oil prices? Not for \nsure. But we do know two things--one, we regulate speculation in this \ncommodity, oil, less than we do other commodities such as grain, and \ntwo, there is more than enough evidence of excessive speculation to \nprompt a reasonable and prudent person to act.\n  I hope the Senate will act quickly to pass legislation strengthening \nthe government's authority to crack down on rampant speculation in the \nenergy markets and call on my Republican colleagues to take action that \nwill help consumers in the near term, instead of resorting to political \ngimmickry.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Would the Chair remind me of how much time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. If you wouldn't mind letting me know when 60 seconds \nremain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would be happy to notify the Senator when he \nhas 60 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. You are a most helpful Chair, and I thank you so much.\n  Madam President, I rise to talk about energy today. My good friend \nfrom Rhode Island mentioned how we would like to vote, and I agree with \nhim. I think it is an amazing thing that the biggest issue in the \ncountry today is energy and here we are, in the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world, for some reason, not allowed to vote to try to solve \nthis particular issue.\n  I had a townhall meeting last night. On the telephone, we had about \n1,200 callers at all times. I can assure you that while other subject \nmatters arose, the issue constituents care most about today is gasoline \nprices.\n  I am part of a bipartisan group that is trying to craft some kind of \nlegislation to pass, and we were all asked to put down on a piece of \npaper those things we think ought to be considered and those things \nthat should not be considered--five Republicans and five Democrats. \nAfter we did that, there were many things we all agreed should at least \nbe discussed as part of an energy bill. Yet it is fascinating to me \nthat when we have an issue of supply and demand--and I think contrary \nto what my friend from Rhode Island said, most economists all agree \nthere is a supply-and-demand issue--an issue where we have continuing \ndemand throughout the world and in this country and we have lessening \nof supplies and, in fact, the price of oil continues to rise, it is \ninteresting to me that when we have this phenomenon of supply and \ndemand, we focus on speculation.\n  Now, this is one of those bills, unfortunately, Madam President--and \nI know you are from the great State of Missouri and use a lot of common \nsense in the things you have done there--that is a ready, aim, fire \nbill. This is not a bill to be taken seriously. It is a bill to sort of \ntake the American people's minds off the issue of supply and demand.\n  Let me read a couple of sentences. On page 14, it says:\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     subsection, the Commission shall impose by rule or regulation \n     speculative position limits on trading that is not legitimate \n     hedge trading.\n\n  The bill is referring to the CFTC in that sentence. Then it goes \nfurther to say that they will, 30 days after enactment, put together an \nadvisory group that, after 60 days, will make some recommendations. \nThis is, of course, after the CFTC has already, per this ``shall'' \nlanguage, imposed various requirements and stipulations on hedging in \nplace. Then, after that, 270 days after that, this advisory commission \nwill look back over what has occurred to see if it is right or wrong.\n  This bill is not on the floor to be taken seriously, and I think most \nof us who have talked with people throughout the industry realize that. \nAgain, this is something to take the voters' minds off the real issue--\nthe issue of supply and demand.\n  I wish to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I \nam willing to look at everything there is to look at in the equation of \nsupply and demand. There is no question that in a country which has 3 \npercent of the oil reserves in the world, has 4 percent of the \npopulation, yet uses 25 percent of the world's oil production, \nconservation needs to be a big part of it. I would love to talk with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about what we might do in the \narea of conservation. My guess is there would be a lot of people on \nboth sides of the aisle who would reach agreement over what we ought to \ndo as a country to lessen demand by focusing on conservation.\n  Yesterday, in the State of Tennessee, Nissan--a great automobile \nproducer--announced their focus on producing an all-electric car by the \nyear 2012. I welcome that day. I look forward to the day when I and my \ndaughters and my wife Elizabeth drive a vehicle that we plug in at \nnight, that is being charged with base load power at low prices and \nthat we drive the next day and not use petroleum. Why don't we debate \nsome amendments on this floor that have to do with that?\n  Much of the discussion has been about offshore drilling, about the \nOuter Continental Shelf. Again, as part of the equation, we ought to \nlook at supplies. I am all for looking at additional offshore \ndevelopment. I think it only makes sense at a time when we have rising \ndemand and lessening supplies. But I would like to talk about a lot of \nother things.\n  Again, it is an interesting thing to me that one person, the majority \nleader of the Senate, can decide that we have one so-called speculation \nbill on the floor that, again, majors in the minors. The issue is \nsupply and demand. Yet in this body of ``100 great Senators,'' we don't \nhave the ability to talk about an issue that is the biggest issue in \nfront of the American people.\n  I think all of us know right now what I am doing, and this is \nsomething I am not accustomed to doing, but I am burning up time on the \nfloor. The last speaker was burning up time on the floor. Basically, \nwhat we are doing is waiting to see if later this afternoon the \nmajority leader of the Senate will allow 100 grownups--100 grownups \nelected by their respective States--we are basically waiting to see if \nthe majority leader of the Senate will allow 100 grownups, who \nrepresent people all across this country, to actually offer amendments \nthat might help solve the supply and demand issue we have in our \ncountry.\n  I think it is very obvious that we, as a country, need to produce \nmore and use less. My daughters, 19 and 20, learned this when they were \nin middle school; that there is an issue of supply and demand.\n  Again, I wish to meet my colleagues in the middle. I agree that \nconservation, as I have stated before, needs to be a big part of this, \nbut it is a diminishment of this body to know that basically all day \nlong people are parading back and forth on this floor to make points on \none side or the other about energy, the biggest issue before the \nAmerican people, and what it is all about is killing time until we find \nout whether the majority leader will allow us--treating us like \nteenagers--allow us to offer amendments. It is an amazing thing.\n  It seems to me that if we were going to be serious about this, that \nwe would have the gumption to stand here on the floor, offer real \namendments, talk about those amendments, and hash them out. That is why \nI came to the Senate. I think that is why the Presiding Officer came to \nthe Senate and has offered so much in the way of making this body \nfunction in an appropriate way. So I hope that very soon we will move \naway from these political games and things that might affect the fall \nelections and move to the serious issues the American people care \nabout. That is what I came to do.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CORKER. So for 1 minute 15 seconds I will talk about supply and \ndemand again, something that I think most of us understand.\n  I will say again to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that \nI am willing to look at every possible amendment that has to do with \nconservation, that has to do with green technology, that has to do with \nadditional production, so that over the next 10 years, we don't send \n$10 trillion overseas.\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\n  We talk a lot about the oil companies in this country, and I know \nthere are some things that can be said pro and con, but the fact is \nthey are public companies and they do operate in the light. It seems to \nme that when we argue about big oil--and we do that in a negative way \nsometimes--what we forget is that every year--this year $700 billion--\nand again over the next 10 years, under present trends, we will send \n$10 trillion overseas to countries that, in many cases, wish us ill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair for your courtesy, and I now yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his good work and \ngood words on this important issue. I agree with him that it is a \nserious problem and it calls for serious answers. We need a response by \nthe Senate when it comes to energy, when it comes to our dependency on \nimported oil. As T. Boone Pickens has pointed out in his crusade to try \nto help people understand where we are on this, he said we send $700 \nbillion of American money to foreign countries to pay for the oil we \nimport. That is because we are not producing enough here at home, \nbecause we are not conserving, and we are not far enough down the road \nin terms of coming up with alternative sources of energy.\n  What is Congress's role in all this? We have done some things. I \nthink we ought to give credit where credit is due. We have passed a \ncorporate fuel efficiency standard for automobiles. We have passed tax \nbenefits and subsidies for things such as solar power and wind energy. \nWe have encouraged the production of biofuels such as ethanol, although \nwe are finding sometimes that the unintended consequences of using food \nfor fuel creates problems in and of itself. Suffice it to say, this is \na serious problem and Congress has, in many respects, acted I think \nappropriately to address some parts of the problem. Unfortunately, like \nso much of politics these days, this sometimes degrades into a name-\ncalling contest. I am going to try my best not to engage in that. But I \ndo want to respond to the accusation that was made earlier that somehow \nthis is attributable to the current administration's tenure in office.\n  As you can see from this chart, the price of gasoline back when \nPresident Bush was sworn into office in January 2001 was $1.49 a \ngallon. It has grown over time to when the Democrats took control of \nthe Congress, in January of 2007, to $2.33 a gallon. Then of course it \nhas spiked since that time to now on the order of $4.06 a gallon on \naverage, more than $4 a gallon. It has gone from January 2001 to today \nto more than $4 a gallon. While our friends who are in charge of the \nagenda and the floor schedule of the Congress, the Democrats who were \nput in a majority status, have been here, we have seen it spike to the \nfigures of today.\n  That is not to say it is directly attributable to them, but I would \nsay it is unfair to suggest that because President Bush has been in \noffice since January 2001, he is the only one responsible. The fact is, \nit is our responsibility too. It is the majority leader's \nresponsibility, I submit, to give us an opportunity to come up with \nserious answers to a serious problem and not play the same old broken \ngame of politics and ``gotcha'' that turns people off so much when it \ncomes to the Congress. It is no secret why the approval rating of the \nCongress is at historic lows. There is no secret to that. It is because \npeople look at what is happening here in Washington, DC, and they say: \nThey are not listening or they may be listening, but they are playing \npolitical games rather than trying to solve real problems on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I know there is plenty of fault to go around, but why can't we work \ntogether to try to solve the most pressing issue for working families \nin America today, and that is the high cost of gasoline and energy? We \nknow there is a bill on the floor that deals with one part of the \nproblem. This has to do with the so-called speculation. Last month, \nWarren Buffett, one of the richest men in America and perhaps one of \nthe richest in the world, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said: It is \nnot speculation that is the problem, it is supply and demand.\n  T. Boone Pickens, whom I mentioned a moment ago--who is spending $50 \nmillion of his own money--met with Republicans today, met with \nDemocrats yesterday, to explain why he is spending so much of his own \nmoney to elevate the profile of this issue so it will be something \nCongress cannot run away from and neither can the Presidential \ncandidates but is something they will have to address and solve. He \nsaid focusing solely on speculation is a waste of time.\n  Why would Congress deal with a bill that only addresses speculation? \nI would say I am not sure. What I am willing to do is certainly \nconsider and probably support a bill that would be supported on the \nDemocratic side that would provide for greater transparency of the \ncommodity futures markets and would provide more resources to make sure \nwe have more cops on the beat, so to speak, to police the commodity \nfutures trading that goes on and to make sure that is not the problem \nor, if it is part of the problem, as the majority leader said \nyesterday--he stood here on the floor of the Senate and said he thought \nit was 20 percent of the problem in terms of the price of oil. I don't \nknow if T. Boone Pickens is right; I don't know if Warren Buffett is \nright; I don't know whether the majority leader is right. Let's say the \nmajority leader is right and it is 20 percent of the problem. Why in \nthe world would we leave the other 80 percent off the table? Why would \nwe settle for a 20-percent solution when we could have a 100-percent \nsolution, in trying to address this important domestic issue?\n  We have come up with a lot of ideas. We have said we need to explore \nand produce more American oil so we have to buy less from overseas. We \nhave been told no, we cannot do that. We have been told no, we can't \nproduce more nuclear power to help generate more electricity. No, we \ncan't investigate the possibility that we could use the coal we have \nhere for new technology that would allow us to use that coal to make \naviation fuel--as the U.S. Air Force is currently testing, a synthetic \nfuel made with coal-to-liquid technology.\n  Again--I don't think this is unfair and I think this is exactly what \nwe keep hearing--it seems that the answer from the other side of the \naisle is: No new energy. They want to investigate. They want to \nlitigate. They want to raise taxes. But when it comes to new energy \nsources, they say no.\n  The one law that Congress of course cannot repeal or suspend, even \nhere in Washington, DC, is the law of supply and demand. We know from \nthe experts that there is rising demand in countries such as China and \nIndia, with more than a billion people each. They are buying cars, they \nare consuming more energy. They have watched us and they have seen that \nAmerica consumes about 25 percent of the oil in the world, even though \nwe represent a small fraction of the population. They look at that and \nthey say maybe that is the reason for their great prosperity.\n  I think there is something to that.\n  We are having more and more competition globally for this scarce \ncommodity. What is our answer on this side of the aisle? We say we need \nto find more and we need to use less. Find more, use less.\n  I heard the Senator from Tennessee bemoan the fact that the majority \nleader has said he will not allow a full debate and amendments to this \nlegislation. I think it is absolutely critical that we allow full \ndebate and amendments that would be likely to actually solve the \nproblem, rather than go through what is a patently political exercise \nso somebody or another can check off the box and say: OK, we have been \nthere, done that. Now we can go home on August recess. I believe we \nought to stay here. Rather than go on recess in August, I believe we \nought to stay here until we actually come up with a commonsense \nsolution to this problem.\n  Some have said OK, if we start drilling today in the Outer \nContinental Shelf, it is going to take years for that oil to come on \nline. I wish we had thought better about that 10 years ago, when \nPresident Clinton vetoed production from the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, which Congress had authorized, which would have produced 1 \nmillion additional barrels of oil 10 years ago. That would be flowing \ntoday if President Clinton had not vetoed that bill.\n  The fact is, oil is a globally traded commodity. That is where we get \nback\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nto the speculation question. Actually, the market is a pretty rational \nprocess. For everybody selling a contract for future delivery of oil, \nthere is somebody who is willing to buy it. That is how the market \nworks, a willing seller and a willing buyer. If Congress were to do the \nrational thing, the sensible thing, the thing that would actually have \na positive impact by pushing gas prices downward, we would say we are \nopen to producing more American energy, perhaps as many as 3 million \nadditional barrels of oil a day here in America, which is 3 million \nbarrels less than we have to purchase from abroad. That would give us \nsome time.\n  It would also send a message to the commodity futures markets that in \nthe future there is going to be additional supply that is going to come \non line. That would help bring down the price of oil because 70 percent \nof the price of gasoline is related to the price of oil. I think that \nwould have a dramatic impact on the price of gasoline at the pump and \nwould provide the American people some relief at a time when they need \nsome financial relief.\n  It would give us some time so we could do the research and use good \nold-fashioned American ingenuity to come up with alternatives, things \nsuch as in 2010, when many of the big automobile companies are going to \nintroduce plug-in hybrid automobiles that you can actually plug into \nthe wall socket in your home and charge the battery you can use then to \ncommute to work or, if you believe what Boone Pickens has suggested, he \nsaid if Government would mandate that all new Government cars and \ntrucks run on natural gas, that would relieve a lot of the pressure on \ngasoline and oil prices and bring down the price of gasoline by 38 \npercent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Cornyn probably heard, as I did, when President \nBush said America is addicted to oil. I took that to mean that we try \nto find a way to move to alternatives and renewable and sustainable \nenergy. I hear the Senator's speech moving in that direction as well.\n  Could the Senator tell me why he believes 68 million Federal acres of \nland, which we have now given to the oil and gas companies, which they \nare not using for exploration and production, is an argument for giving \nthem more acreage?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the question and the \nopportunity to try to answer that. Let me do the best I can. I think \nthere is the illusion here in Washington that every acre of land that \nis available for exploration is going to produce oil. As a matter of \nfact, in Texas--I am not unfamiliar with the term ``dry hole.'' As a \nmatter of fact, this is a very complex enterprise, where you do seismic \ntesting to try to figure out where oil is likely to be. Sometimes you \nare wrong and it costs millions, even sometimes billions of dollars to \ninvest to try to produce that oil.\n  What the oil companies try to do is figure out where their chances \nare best so they start there. But the more land--including the \nsubmerged lands in the Outer Continental Shelf--that is available to \nthem that now Congress has put out of bounds, I think the better the \nchances are they will be able to find it.\n  As a matter of fact, there are experts--I am not an expert, but I \nread what the experts say--who believe there are vast quantities of oil \nand gas available in the Outer Continental Shelf that are not available \nnow on the lands to which they have access.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If you were given the opportunity to lease either a \nbarrel of rainwater or a lake to go fishing, I assume you would lease \nthe lake. And I assume these oil and gas companies, in leasing this \nland, believe it is likely to have oil and gas.\n  So I ask you, if they have paid their money to lease Federal lands, \n68 million acres--half of it offshore, half of it onshore--and another \n23 million acres in Alaska, where is this mother load of oil you are so \ncertain we are holding back from these oil and gas companies that would \nbring us the oil instantaneously and bring down gas prices?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, I am delighted to try to answer that question, as \nwell, because I think the Senator's question demonstrates--I am not \ncomplaining; I am not criticizing. You know we are not oil and gas \nexperts, but I have had a little bit of exposure. Let me try to answer \nthat.\n  There is not a big lake of oil under the surface of the land that is \navailable to anybody who can punch a hole in the earth and then suck it \nout with a straw. So I do not think the analogy is apt.\n  These oil companies in America are owned by shareholders. They are \nnot interested in drilling dry holes. They are interested in drilling \nwhere there is actually going to be some oil that can be produced. The \nmore opportunity they have, the more lands available to them, the \ngreater, they believe and I believe, they can maximize the likelihood \nthat they will actually find oil.\n  This is not to help the oil companies, this is to help us quit \nsending 700 billion a year of American dollars to foreign countries for \noil while we have more of it at home, if you believe the experts, about \n3 million barrels a day.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, who is in control of time now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3.5 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Americans are probably wondering what the Congress is \ndoing to solve the Nation's energy problems? Apparently, just asking \neach other questions.\n  What I would like to do is do something. I would like to have a \ncomprehensive plan that would address the fact that most of you out \nthere who are listening to me are hurting. You are having to fill up \nyour car's gas tank with $4-plus gas. Food prices are going up, and we \nare fiddling while your budget is burning.\n  I cannot explain this; I do not know. But you are figuring this out. \nThe Congress is at an all-time low in terms of approval rating. It \nseems to me this is something we could all agree on: how to address our \nenergy needs.\n  Seventy percent of our oil comes from overseas, most of it from the \nMideast. If you feel good about that, great. I do not. I think most \nAmericans would like to get away from that. There is oil off the \neastern coast.\n  I do not know why you would not want to add more supply. If there are \nleases that the oil companies have now they are not using, they expire \nin 6, 8, or 10 years, and they have to pay to renew them. I would \nimagine if there is oil out there, they would go get it.\n  But there is a lot of oil and gas, they tell me, off the east coast. \nBut there is a moratorium on us being able to explore for it. Lift the \nmoratorium, add it to our supply. Every barrel of oil America can \nextract from American-owned resources is one less barrel we need from \nthe Mideast, and it makes us more independent. And, yes, get away from \nusing oil. I am all for that. But that is not going to happen anytime \nsoon.\n  Just by lifting the moratorium at the executive level, oil prices \nhave come down about $20.\n  Nuclear power--everybody talks about it. The French, 80 percent of \nthe French power comes from the nuclear industry. They recycle the \nwaste too. They do not put it in the ground. They know what to do with \nthe waste. Surely we can be as bold as the French.\n  Anyway, there is a lot we could do, but we are choosing to do \nnothing. We are choosing to blame each other.\n  There is a bill on the Senate floor that addresses one part of the \nproblem, speculation. We should be dealing with speculators, we should \nbe adding domestic inventory, we should be doing something about \nnuclear power to make sure we can expand our nuclear footprint. It \nwould be good for the environment. It would make us less dependent on \nfossil fuels, and, yes, we should come up with new cars that run on \nbatteries.\n  We should be doing it all. We should do it together. All boats rise \nif we could work together. This is one time when Democrats and \nRepublicans, if we would lay down the partisanship and focus on \nAmerica's interests, would\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\nlook better. But we have a bill that allows us to do one thing, and \nthat is ridiculous. We should be doing a bunch of things together.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, America is watching and they are \nnot pleased.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, before my friend from South Carolina \nleaves the floor, as usual, but not always, I agree with him. I hope we \ncan get to a point where we can deal with both of those issues, \noffshore drilling and the development of more nuclear powerplants.\n  I wanted to clarify for the Record, when you said we should be as \nbold as the French, you were speaking only of their use of nuclear \npower?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I would like to refine my remarks. But I would like \nto add, if I may, the French, with all joking aside, the French have \nfigured out how to use nuclear power in a safe manner. And we can learn \nfrom everyone, including the French.\n  I say to my good friend from Connecticut, he has the right attitude \nabout his job. I wish we all would adopt it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from South Carolina.\n  Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the Stop Excessive \nEnergy Speculation Act.\n  I want to commend and thank Senate Majority Leader Reid for \nconsidering and adopting a series of ideas on this subject, including \nparticularly the Commodity Speculation Reform Act, which I was \nprivileged to introduce along with Senator Collins of Maine and Senator \nCantwell of Washington State.\n  The commodity markets perform a crucial function in our economy as a \nplace where producers and consumers of specific commodities can enter \ninto what are called futures contracts that help hedge the risks of \nprice fluctuations in their industries to give them this certainty that \nthey can buy or sell the product that they are dealing with at some \ntime in the future. And that gives them some stability for their \nbusinesses.\n  Those markets have existed for a long time, and they perform a \ncritically important function. The real physical commodity market \ntraders--the airlines, the refineries, the manufacturing firms, and the \nother users and producers of energy--are the people who actually intend \nto produce or take delivery of those commodities such as oil as part of \ndoing their business.\n  That is why they go out to the futures markets. Historically, \nparticipation in those markets, quite naturally, has been dominated by \nthose commodity traders. That is why they were created, why the markets \nwere created.\n  Financial speculators, including pension funds, university \nendowments, and other large institutional investors, however, have in \nrecent years poured billions and billions of dollars into commodity \nmarkets betting on rising prices.\n\n  Let's make it clear, these are bets. There is nothing illegal about \nwhat they are doing. But as I learned long ago, just because something \nis not illegal does not mean it is not wrong or it does not hurt \npeople. And the underlying premise of this legislation is that \nexcessive speculation in these commodity markets, futures markets for \noil, particularly, is unnaturally raising the price of oil, which is to \nsay immediately, the outrageous price of gasoline that people are \npaying all across our country today.\n  The difference between the physical traders, as we call them, the \npeople who actually want the product physically or have it to sell, \nsuch as the producers of energy or airlines or refineries or \nmanufacturers and the speculators, the speculators never intend to buy \nor sell the product.\n  They are moving paper around, and they are moving enormous amounts of \npaper around. The numbers speak for themselves. In the past 5 years, \nthe amount these so-called institutional investors have put into \ncommodity index funds has gone from $13 billion to $317 billion. That \nis with a ``b,'' billion.\n  And, of course, the price of commodities in these funds rose nearly \n200 percent over the same period. That is what is shown in this chart: \n1970 is here, 2008 there. You can see the black line shows the prices, \nand it shows the stock price commodity index over here, the amount of \nmoney put in.\n  It goes up and down, but it is basically staying here. Then, yes, \nlook at that. The amount invested goes up and the prices go up \ndramatically.\n  One way to understand this is I think one of the witnesses before our \ncommittee said there had been an amazing increase in the demand for \nthose futures contracts. So, in part, the price has gone up for that \nreason. But I will come back to that.\n  Moreover, the amount of money that pension funds have moved into the \ncommodities thus far may be the tip of the iceberg. Estimates suggest \nthat less than 1 percent of the $2 trillion--trillion this time with a \n``t''--of private pension fund assets is currently allocated to \ncommodities. Imagine if that percentage increases to 5 or 10 percent, \nwhat an impact that will have.\n  Through some mystery and magic that I never fully appreciated and \ncertainly do not support, futures contract prices, even though they are \nfor oil that will be delivered in the future, somehow get read right \nout at the gas pump pretty much the next day. Add that private pension \nmoney to increasing commodity investments from State and local \ngovernments, pension plans, hedge funds, insurance companies, and other \ninstitutional investors, and the result is clear: rising oil, gas, and \nfood prices.\n  The stark reality is the speculators today threaten to overwhelm our \ncommodity markets and substantially increase food and energy prices for \nyears to come.\n  In a series of hearings that Senator Collins and I conducted in our \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, we heard testimony \nfrom one expert that this kind of excessive speculation in the \ncommodity markets may be adding as much as $40 to $60 to the cost of a \nbarrel of oil. Of course, that then gets pushed through the system and \nwe pay at the pump or this winter in our home heating oil purchases.\n  There are some people who say that 40 to 60 number is much too high. \nBut I would say most everybody we talked to said that speculation in \nthe commodities market is certainly adding something to the retail \nprice of fuel. I would say even a single dollar increase due to \nexcessive speculation is a dollar too much because of the terrible \neffect it has on individual consumers who are struggling to spread \ntheir budget and use it for the necessities of life, but also because \nof the overall effect it is having now on the American economy.\n  Let me give you this example: One of the worst protected industries \nby the increase in fuel prices is the airline industry. Fuel prices are \nan important part of them doing business. And what we read periodically \nwhen they file their quarterly reports are the stunning losses that \nthey are suffering; laying off people as a result, cutting flights as a \nresult from their schedule.\n  So here is a number. According to the Air Transport Association, \nevery $1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil adds $470 \nmillion a year in jet fuel costs, almost half a billion dollars more \ncost to the American airline industry. Of course, those costs are \npassed on to consumers in the form of higher ticket prices and other \nsurcharges that are now keeping a lot of passengers on the ground and \nthe airline industry reeling.\n  If speculators want to invest in energy, they can buy stock directly \nin energy companies and that would bring needed investment into a means \nof production; that would increase supply and eventually contribute to \nlower gasoline prices.\n  Unfortunately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, known as the \nCFTC, has ignored the urgent task of providing a frontline defense \nagainst this rampant speculation in the commodity markets. As we \nlistened to the witnesses from this commission before our committee, it \nseemed they had not even been prepared to recognize and acknowledge \nthat there is such a thing as excessive speculation and that it is \ncontributing to rising commodity prices. Instead, the commission has \ndelegated much of its regulatory authority to the for-profit commodity \nexchanges themselves. This is a very unusual circumstance. These are \nvery professionally run exchanges, but what\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\nhas happened is that the regulator we created--and I will talk about \nthat in a minute--in the 1930s has given the authority to the regulated \nexchanges to say how many speculation positions--in other words, how \nmany futures contracts--any one investor in the market can hold at any \none time.\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission was created in the 1930s \nbecause some of the physical traders, particularly in food-related \nproducts--grains, et cetera--felt that speculators were unfairly and \nunnecessarily driving up the price of food. So the Congress created the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and gave them the power to \nregulate and prevent manipulation and, we would say, excessive \nspeculation. They seemed to say they only have the right to police \nmanipulation, which is doing something out and out unethical, as \nopposed to putting billions of dollars into the market, moving paper \naround, and raising the price of commodities for consumers. In \ncontradiction with Congress's original legislative intent, therefore, \nthe commission seems to view its responsibility as confined to that \nsingle purpose--preventing market manipulation. On the contrary, the \nrecord will show that Congress fully intended the commission to \nregulate not only market manipulation but what we are seeing today that \nis hurting consumers all across the country badly, and that is \nexcessive speculation.\n  I want to talk about what this bill before us does. First, I do want \nto say, in fairness and clarity, I am not saying--I don't think anybody \nsupporting this bill is saying--that the only reason why gasoline, for \ninstance, has gone over $4 a gallon is speculation on the commodity \nmarkets. There are other causes. One is clearly rising world demand. \nThe other is a sense that there is a limited supply of oil under the \nground. The third is a problem that we in both Houses of Congress and \nthe President have created over a period of time, and I suppose others \nin our economy have contributed to it. That is the weakness of the \nAmerican dollar. What is clear is that one of the reasons why this \nenormous amount of money is pouring into the commodity markets and \nspeculative index funds over the last 5 years is that the dollar has \ngotten weaker. People who used to leave their money in the dollar as a \nsecure place to be, as a kind of hedge against inflation, feel it is \nnot working now. That is why they are going into these commodity index \nfunds as a better, kind of a gold standard of the day. Until we do \nsomething about our national fiscal health and strengthen the dollar \nagain, there still will be that incentive for people to put money into \nthe index funds. So it is not only speculation in the commodity markets \nbut, I am convinced this is one of the contributing causes, perhaps the \none cause that we in the Federal Government, by wisely regulating, can \nactually do something through that will, in fact, put downward pressure \non retail gasoline and oil prices.\n  Here is what the leadership bill does. It incorporates a bipartisan \nproposal that was developed with Senator Collins and Senator Cantwell \nto create a seamless system of speculative position limits that apply \nto commodity positions held both off and on the regulated exchanges. To \nbe brief, there is a whole world now that has been created over the \nyears outside of the exchanges, New York, Chicago, where these futures \nare traded, so-called over-the-counter, unregulated, foreign exchanges. \nThis bill has the aim of covering all those. Because if you are going \nto regulate speculation, you should regulate it wherever it is \noccurring. We in Congress have the power to adopt a law such as that.\n  Speculative position limits, the primary policy tool of the CFTC for \npreventing excessive speculation, authorized back in 1935, were used \nsuccessfully for decades. Now it should be extended to where the action \nis occurring. Speculative position limits would put a cap on the size \nof any one investor's holdings in futures contracts of speculation with \nrespect to a specific commodity, wherever those contracts were \npurchased. Current caps only apply to positions on the regulated \nexchanges, and we think that no longer does the job.\n  In addition, I am working with other Members on a substitute \namendment that, similar to this bill, because it covers over-the-\ncounter markets, I want to go on to cover investments on the foreign \nexchanges, incorporate foreign holdings. The outstanding value of over-\nthe-counter commodity derivatives is estimated by the Bank of \nInternational Settlements to be $9 trillion. So no bill that wants to \ndeal with the commodity trading business can do so without addressing \nover-the-counter trading. We want to go on to the foreign holdings as \nwell so that the system will be complete. It won't have any holes in \nit. One of the witnesses before the committee said the current system \nof regulating sales and futures contracts, speculative contracts, is \nlike Swiss cheese, a lot of holes in it. Senator Collins and I want to \nmake it like good, strong New England cheddar cheese, no holes.\n  The bill includes another concept from the Lieberman-Collins-Cantwell \nbill that establishes a specific criteria that the CFTC must use when \nit sets the speculative position limits. It adopts and expands a rule \nfrom our bill by requiring the CFTC to consider the overall effect of \nspeculative activity and to set the position limits at amounts no \ngreater than necessary to ensure liquidity in the markets. We are not \nsaying all speculation is bad. Some speculation makes the markets \nliquid. It makes them function. It makes them work for those farmers \nand fuel producers and home heating oil dealers and airlines that want \nto deal in the actual physical product. We think that provision is \nnecessary.\n  Congress fully intended the regulators use the speculative position \nlimits to counteract excessive speculation when it passed the original \nCommodity Exchange Act of 1935. I talked about this briefly, but you \ncan see it here. Congress stated its purpose was ``to provide a measure \nof control over those forms of speculative activity which too often \ndemoralize the markets to the injury of producers and consumers. . . \n.'' ``[T]he bill''--not this bill but the bill in 1935--``has another \nobjective, the restoration of the primary function of the exchanges \nwhich is to furnish a market for the commodities themselves.''\n  That is from a House report of March 18, 1935. A lot of years have \npassed since then, but that states the problem we are dealing with now. \nIt is worse now because of the hundreds of billions of dollars of \nspeculative activity that is going on now.\n  Other provisions in this bill are drawn from legislation introduced \nby several of my colleagues, including a proposal from Senator Levin to \nauthorize the CFTC to liquidate over-the-counter positions, if \nnecessary, in response to major market disturbance. It also includes \nprovisions pushed by Senator Bingaman of New Mexico that would enhance \nthe tools available at present to the Federal Government to prevent \nmarket manipulation.\n  What I am saying is that rather than constituting a radical \ndisruptive attempt to distort commodity markets, our legislation \nbasically returns the regulation of commodity markets to where it was \nintended to be in 1935. It adjusts to the changing reality by embracing \nall the places where these speculation futures contracts are being sold \nand regulates them as the Congress of 1935 intended. I know some \ncritics of the bill have said it would encourage investors to foreign \nexchanges. I don't believe so. The bill will actually discourage flight \nfrom the major American exchanges, because it puts all trading \nplatforms under the same regulatory umbrella. It is an even playing \nfield now because everybody is going to be covered. Speculators are \nsubject to the same position limits as those who are investing from \nhere, regardless of whether they invest in New York, London, Dubai, or \nover the counter.\n  There is another area of the bill I am working with my colleagues to \naddress. I want to touch on it briefly. The bill I have introduced with \nSenators Collins and Cantwell would extend the reforms to both energy \nand agricultural commodity markets. The bill before the Senate now only \ndeals with the energy markets. I must say that in many respects the \ncase for reforming agricultural markets is even greater than the case \nfor energy markets, though the American consumer is feeling the \nincrease in food prices less painfully than the increase in gas prices. \nBut trust me, anybody who has been to the supermarket lately knows they \nare feeling the pinch from increasing food prices as well.\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\n  Here is the reason. The agricultural commodity markets are \nhistorically very small. As investor money flows into index funds--this \nis a kind of package of investments in commodities that the big \ninstitutional investors put money in--that include agricultural \ncomponents, there is a significant risk that the speculative activity \nwill actually overwhelm the agricultural commodity markets to the great \ndetriment of farmers and American consumers as well. We put our \nproposed legislation on the Homeland Security Committee's Web site. We \ngot wonderful responses from people, one very poignant one from \nactually an agricultural food broker in the Midwest--I believe Iowa--\ncomplaining about the unbelievable impact on farmers of this excessive \nspeculation coming into the food commodity markets. As he said, even \nthough the farmers I deal with are making more money because food \nprices are going up, they know this is going in a bad direction because \nprices are going up for no good reason. They are going up for \nspeculation.\n  There are those who will object to the bill because they think that \ngovernment should never interfere in free markets. The father of \ncapitalism, Adam Smith, noted in ``The Wealth of Nations,'' the great \nclassic text on capitalism, that even in a free market, there needs to \nbe some limits. He wrote:\n\n       Those exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals \n     which may endanger the security of the whole society are and \n     ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments.\n\n  I forgot who said it, but somebody else said, probably a little less \nelegantly, that the world has never seen anything like a free market \nsystem to create wealth. It is a magnificent means of creating \nwealth. But inherently the free market system has no conscience, and \nthere are simply occasions when, to maximize gain, people will be \ndownright greedy without regard to the consequences on society as a \nwhole.\n\n  We honor wealth creation in America. People are not against wealthy \npeople in America. Everybody wants to be wealthy in America. But when \nthere are no, essentially, policemen on the economic beat, then people \nwho have a lot of money begin to take advantage of people who are on \nthe other end.\n  That is why we have a whole system of regulation. I daresay it is \npart of the reason failure to regulate adequately, which has been noted \nby people in both parties--Secretary Paulson and others have talked \nabout it--failure to regulate financial markets, to adequately create \naccountability in the extension of home mortgages--a banker gives a \nmortgage to somebody who is not able to pay it over the long term, but \nthe banker has no accountability because the banker puts it in a \npackage, sells it to somebody up the chain, and the next thing you know \nsomebody is buying a bond based on those mortgages who lives in Norway, \nas somebody gave me a real-life example.\n  That is beginning to happen in a different way in speculation in \ncommodity markets, which is why I think we have to extend the original \nlaw to cover the reality of our day, to protect the American consumer \nand, in fact, to protect the American economy.\n  So I know there is what has become a characteristic classic Senate \nmoment where there is a potential gridlock over this bill because of \ndisagreements on what amendments will be allowed. I surely hope we can \novercome that because the American people need the relief this bill \nwill offer. I hope we can figure out a way to come to a lot of the \nother ideas that colleagues want to put on as amendments because the \nAmerican people need the relief those amendments will offer as well.\n  I know people comment on and joke about the fact that in recent \npolling, the people who have a favorable impression of Congress has \ndropped below 10 percent to 9 percent. My friend, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, says when you get down to 9 percent favorability \nfor Congress, you are down to family and staff. I want to thank my \nfamily and my staff, all of you who are here.\n  But it is not a laughing matter, and the public is not happy with us \nfor good reason. We are not getting anything done to solve their \nproblems that they worry about, that they face every day: the cost of \nenergy, the cost of health care, the security of their jobs, et cetera, \net cetera, et cetera, the price of energy.\n  This bill is one way to bring some help. So I hope we will figure out \na way to get beyond the gridlock and get this done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7124-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate has engaged over the last day \nand a half or two in probably one of the most important debates and, I \nhope, series of votes and actions this Congress can take this year. For \nthe future years ahead, it may be precedent setting as to whether this \ncountry will return to its ability to produce not only traditional \nforms of energy but will grow to expand into new and alternative \nsources of energy so we can become increasingly less dependent upon \nforeign sources.\n  Great nations--and ours is a great nation--do not depend, in a way \nthat they become dangerously at risk, on other nations' resources for \ntheir strength and their vitality. The great strength of our country \nhas always been we could feed our people during a time of war and \nemergency, that we could take care of our own because we had an \nabundance of resource. It was also true of energy--all forms from \nenergy--from the day we discovered the use and the effective use of \nwhale oil as a form to light our houses and illuminate our worlds, to a \nprogression from there to petroleum products, coal and then kerosene \nand then diesel and now, of course, gas and diesel and a myriad of \nproducts that flow from the hydrocarbons our Nation so abundantly \nproduced.\n  I came to this Congress in 1980. At that time, we were about 35 \npercent dependent for our hydrocarbon needs on foreign nations. The \nrest of it we produced ourselves. As a result of that, we had \nflexibility and we had little to no liability, and, therefore, little \nrisk, that we could be held hostage or that our economy and, therefore, \nour people and their will could be shaped by a foreign power. That time \nhas changed because, over the last two decades, we made a concerted \ndecision--a political decision--to stop producing. We began to put vast \nknown oil reserves off-limits in the name of the environment, and we \nbegan to increasingly buy from foreign production and foreign-producing \npowers. Today, we stand at a near 70-percent dependency, and for any \ngreat nation to be 70 percent dependent on someone else other than \nthemselves, that great nation is a nation at risk.\n  Today, the United States of America is at risk because we don't \ncontrol our energy destiny. We have to react to it. We send our \nPresident to foreign countries with hat in hand, asking them to produce \nbecause we have grown so rich and so arrogant we refuse to produce \nourselves. That game plan or that scheme, while it wasn't working, at \nleast was reasonably well accepted, until other consumers began to \nenter that world market of oil: China and India and other developing \nnations. They began to consume from that finite pool of resource from \nwhich we were the large takers. The price began to change.\n  I remember a few years ago I thought: Well, gee, at $2, that is a\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\nbreak point. The American consumer will finally react. We went by $2 a \ngallon for gas as if it didn't exist. Well, at about $2.75, I began to \nget phone calls from some of my farmers and large consumers saying: \nLarry, it is getting pretty pricey out here. But the average consumer \nstill wasn't reacting. Last year, we went by $3 a gallon as the world \nbegan to recognize we were consuming more and more and producing less \nand less of a very important product--crude oil. In the high dollar, \nthe $3-and-some-odd-cents range, my phones began to ring. Idaho \nconsumers, who are large consumers of energy--because we travel long \ndistances in big, expansive, Western rural States such as Idaho--were \nsaying: Larry, this is expensive stuff. We are having trouble. That was \nat $3.50 or $3.60. Then, all of a sudden, it hits four bucks and \neverybody's phones light up. America asked us--the politician, the \npublic policy shaper--what happened? Why are we here? Why was this \nallowed? Why are you standing in the way of the ability of the \nmarketplace to drill and produce? That is the debate we are having \nright now. It is a very important debate.\n  The majority leader, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, has brought \nS. 3268 to the floor saying: It is speculation. Somebody out there in \nthe marketplace is profiteering; therefore, this is the bill that will \nfix it. Well, I am saying: Harry, that is fine. There might be some \nslight maneuvering in the market, so let's debate the bill, but we also \nknow it is clearly a supply-and-demand situation and maybe we ought to \nfigure out how markets work. A few of us know about that. Others try to \ndeny it; that is: If you have more being consumed than you are \nproducing, you create a new value to the commodity or the product being \nconsumed.\n  So what I am saying and what other Republicans are saying is: We will \ndebate S. 3268, but we want an opportunity to add to it a production \nconcept. We want to be able to produce, to turn this great Nation on to \nproduction. Guess what they are saying over here. No, no, no, no. We \nhave built our political base on nonproduction over the last 20 years. \nWe have said let's be green. Let's don't produce anymore. Let's take it \noff-limits.\n  It didn't work, did it? No, it didn't. If you are paying four bucks \ntoday and you are angry about it, there is a clear answer why you are: \nThis Nation quit producing. We didn't quit consuming. We began to \nconsume what the rest of the world had, and the rest of the world wants \nit now as badly as we do. That is the reality of the problem we are in. \nThis Senate ought to spend all the time it takes to produce a bill that \ndeals with speculation, if it is there, and allows this Nation to \nproduce once again.\n  We have done it. We did it in 2005. We were responsible. We brought a \nbill to the floor, we spent 2 weeks, we had many amendments, we debated \nthem up or down, they passed by 50 percent plus 1 or more votes, and \nthose that didn't failed. We produced one of the better energy bills \nour Nation has seen. When we started that debate, there wasn't a \nnuclear reactor on the drawing board for design. Today, there are 33--a \ndirect result of a responsible action on the part of the Senate and the \nHouse in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Then, in 2007, last year, another energy bill--because the Senate was \nsomewhat awakening and public policymakers were awakening to the \nreality of the need that had not hit us full force in 2008. We passed a \nbill that had a new renewable fuels standard that allowed increased \nproduction in biofuels. Today, the Department of Energy said if we \ndidn't have ethanol in the market, the gas at the pump would be 25 to \n40 cents more a gallon. So we have done some things there, and there \nare those who oppose it. There were some on the floor who opposed it, \nbut we handled it in a responsible fashion. We brought the bill to the \nfloor. We allowed it to be amended. We debated it. There was no \nfilibuster. There is no filibuster today. It is simply a majority \nleader of a party that has based their politics on a nonproducing \npolicy, and they can't allow the consumer to understand it or see it. \nSo when we come to the floor and say: Let's amend it, let's add \nproduction to it, the answer is: Oh, no. Politically, we can't go \nthere. There is an election out there. Let the American consumer and \nhis pocketbook burn down.\n  Well, if that is the policy of the day, it is the wrong policy. It \nshould not be allowed. I am one who will refuse to allow it to go \nforward. We are either going to debate energy in a full-blown, \nresponsible fashion; we are going to allow amendments that are going to \nbe up or down, we will win or we will lose, but America deserves to see \na robust, proproduction, proconservation, proalternative, \nantispeculation debate and bill produced on the floor of the Senate. \nAnything less isn't acceptable. I hope the American people are \nlistening today. Anything less than that isn't acceptable.\n  My time is nearly up, so let me conclude because others are on the \nfloor to debate this important issue. Two years ago, I introduced this \nchart to the lexicon of the debate on American oil production. Then I \ncalled it the ``No Zone,'' and others are now using it, and I am mighty \nproud they are, because this red area was where American politics said \nyou cannot drill. We called it the ``No Zone.'' Well, we know there is \npotentially billions of barrels of oil there, but oh, we dare not touch \nit, for whatever political reason, I am not sure. But guess what \nAmericans are saying today and what is incorporated in the opportunity \nto debate and amend a bill here on the floor: That is to allow \neffective and responsible exploration in areas where oil is known.\n  So come on, Harry Reid. Give America a chance to save some money. \nGive America a chance to get back into production. It is quite that \nsimple. I will conclude by saying: How simple? Use the bill you have. \nAllow it to be amended. Allow a full debate. Allow Senators to work \ntheir will, and we can produce something that in time will allow \nproduction to flow and the American consumer to be once again \nadvantaged by a robust energy market.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by suggesting that a number \nof my Republican friends who come to the floor speak under the mantra: \nDrill, drill, drill; it is going to solve all our problems. Well, you \nknow what. The American people, the people in Vermont are disgusted, \nangry, and frustrated that they are paying $4.10 for a gallon of gas. \nThe people in my State--the Northern part of this country--are worried \nsick about how they are going to be able to heat their homes next \nwinter when the price of home heating fuel may well be double what it \nwas just a few years ago. Well, you know what. Drill, drill, drill is \nnot going to solve the problem because President Bush's own Energy \nDepartment has told us very clearly that increased drilling offshore--\nwhat many of my Republican friends want--would have ``no significant \nimpact'' on gas prices until the year 2030. Even then, its impact would \nbe negligible.\n  So if you are outraged about paying $4.10 for a gallon of gas, it is \nof no help at all for our Republican friends to say: Well, gee, maybe \nin 20-some-odd years we may be able to lower the cost of gas by a few \ncents a gallon. We must do a lot better than that. We have some folks \nwho think we should drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. Well, President Bush's own Energy Department told us in 2005:\n\n       Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would only \n     reduce gasoline prices by a penny per gallon and only in 20 \n     years when drilling is at or near peak production.\n\n  So if we are serious about addressing the energy crisis this country \nhas, and we don't want to wait another 20 or 25 years to lower gas \nprices by a few cents a gallon, we have to start looking at some other \noptions. The first option we have to look at is taking a hard look at \nthe excessive speculation which is now taking place in the energy \nmarket.\n  We have heard experts, energy economists, come before one committee \nor another to tell us, in fact, that the price of a barrel of oil today \nmay be 25 to 50 percent higher than it should be under normal \nprocesses--supply and demand and the cost of production--because of \nexcessive speculation. So we have to move aggressively on the \nspeculation issue.\n  Second, because I know ExxonMobil feels that the public doesn't trust \nthem, it is nice to see so many of my\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\nRepublican friends who have such confidence in the oil industry, and \nwho believe that if we allow the oil companies to drill offshore in \nareas where there has been a drilling moratorium, to ignore the fact \nthat there are over 60 million acres of land they already have leases \non, and people believe if a oil company is given more land to drill, \nthen prices will go down. I am glad to see some people have confidence \nin the oil companies. I personally do not.\n  While oil prices have been soaring, it is important to point out \nthat, year after year, oil companies have been making record-breaking \nprofits. Year after year, they have been paying their CEOs huge and \nexcessive compensation packages. Year after year, instead of investing \nin new machinery to, in fact, drill for more oil, they have been using \ntheir profits to buy back stock and raise the price of the stock.\n  Last year alone, ExxonMobil used $38 billion of their windfall \nprofits to buy back their own stock in increased dividends to their \nshareholders. Mr. President, $38 billion is enough money to reduce gas \nprices at the pump by 27 cents a gallon for an entire year. But it is \ninteresting to know that some of our Republican friends have so much \nconfidence that if we gave our friends in the oil companies even more \nterritory to drill on, in environmentally sensitive areas, they will \nabsolutely do the right thing, that the oil companies are staying up \nnights--ExxonMobil and the others--worrying about the American \nconsumer. If you believe that, I have a couple of bridges to sell you.\n  I think we have to take a hard look at the continued greed of the oil \ncompanies. It would be a nice thing if we had a President of the United \nStates who wasn't, in fact, an oilman. It would be a good thing if we \nhad a Vice President who wasn't part of the oil industry. It would be \nnice if we had a President of the United States who would bring the oil \nindustry into the Oval Office and say, gentlemen--and they are \ngentlemen--stop ripping off the American people. You have to start \nlowering your prices.\n  Thirdly, when we deal with the myriad of problems we have in terms of \nenergy, we have to be mindful not only of the greed of the oil \ncompanies, not only of Wall Street speculation, but we have to \nunderstand that right now--right now--this summer and this winter there \nare millions of Americans who need and will need immediate help to deal \nwith the coming winter, as to whether they are going to be heating \ntheir homes, whether they are going to be going cold, and in fact we \nhave to worry about people now in the southern States who are seeing \ntemperatures of 110, 115 degrees, who cannot afford the rapidly \nincreasing price of electricity, and are seeing their electricity \nturned off.\n  If you are old and you are sick and frail, do you know what. That 115 \ndegree temperature is not particularly healthy for you. What we need to \ndo--and I hope we can get the bill on the floor immediately--is \nsubstantially increase funding for LIHEAP. We have legislation that \nwould double LIHEAP funding. I am proud to say this bill has \ntripartisan support. We already have 49 cosponsors, including 12 \nRepublicans. I have little doubt that if we can get that bill on the \nfloor, if the Republicans do not continue to object to Senator Reid's \neffort to bring it up, we can get not only 60 votes but maybe a lot \nmore. There is companion legislation in the House. We can move this \nquickly, while we continue the debate on energy policy, and we should \ncome together. We have the votes to significantly expand LIHEAP funding \nand make sure that old people who are trying to exist in 115 degree \ntemperatures in the Southwest do not get sick from heat exhaustion \nbecause they don't have electricity, which is a problem that LIHEAP \ncould address.\n  Of course, as part of this overall debate, it is very clear to many \nof us that we must, finally, in a significant way, a dramatic way, in a \nway that Vice President Gore was talking about a few days ago, break \nour dependency on fossil fuel, on foreign oil, and move this country to \nsustainable energy and energy efficiency.\n  That is an outline of where we want to go. I think some of my \nRepublican friends are talking about very insignificant lowering of \nprices in 20 years or 25 years. I think we have to pass the speculation \nbill that is on the floor right now.\n  It is interesting to me that we have had executives of major oil \ncompanies who have come here to Congress--and people are saying, ``Why \nis oil $125, $130, $140 a barrel?'' Do you know what they say? The CEO \nof Royal Dutch Shell testified before Congress:\n\n       The oil fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel.\n\n  That was the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell. My friends say it is supply \nand demand. That is not what a number of executives from the oil \nindustry, who presumably know something about the issue, are saying.\n  The CEO of Marathon Oil recently said:\n\n       $100 [this is back when it was $100 oil] isn't justified by \n     the physical demand in the market.\n\n  The senior vice president of ExxonMobil, Stephen Simon, told the \nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee:\n\n       The price of oil should be at $50 to $55 per barrel.\n\n  So you have folks from the oil industry, who, I suspect, know \nsomething about oil fundamentals, who are telling us that the price of \noil today is way, way, way higher than it should be. One of the reasons \nthey point to is the role of speculation. By ``speculation,'' we mean \nthat as a result of an action by Senator Gramm back in 2000, with the \nso-called Enron loophole, energy trading has been deregulated. We have \nseen the results in a number of areas. Some people say: You guys are \ntalking about speculation; you are into conspiracy theories. You are \npointing out the bad guys there, and you are trying to create demons.\n  Let's look at recent history. Is the idea of speculation in energy \nmarkets a new idea? Well, in 2000 and 2001, our friends at Enron \nsuccessfully manipulated the electricity markets, and the results, of \ncourse, were that in the western part of our country, electric rates \nwent off the wall. I remind you that during that discussion you may \nremember that what Enron was saying was: Don't blame us; this is supply \nand demand. Well, some of those people who were telling us that, I \nsuspect, are in jail now, because as everybody knows, Enron manipulated \nprices big time until they were finally uncovered. Enron collapsed, and \nsome of their executives, I believe, are now in jail. That was \nmanipulation of the electricity markets in 2000 and 2001.\n  That is not all that has happened in the last decade. In 2004, energy \nprice manipulators moved to the propane market. Many people use propane \nto heat their homes. That year, the CFTC, Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, found that BP artificially increased propane prices by \npurchasing enormous quantities of propane and withholding the fuel to \ndrive prices higher. In other words, they manipulated the propane \nmarket and prices went up. By the end of February of 2004, BP \ncontrolled almost 90 percent of all propane delivered on a pipeline \nthat stretches from Texas to Pennsylvania and New York. BP's cornering \nof the propane market caused prices to increase by 40 percent during \nthe month of February 2004, which eventually caused them, because of \ntheir illegal manipulation of the propane market, to pay a $303 million \nfine.\n  So, again, when we are talking about speculation, and people say you \nare into conspiracy theories, etc, etc, etc--we have, in 2000 and 2001, \nEnron manipulating the electric market; and, in 2004, we have BP \nmanipulating the propane market.\n  But it goes on. In 2006, energy price manipulators moved to the \nnatural gas market. When Federal regulators discovered that the \nAmaranth hedge fund was responsible for artificially driving up natural \ngas prices--natural gas. So we had electricity, propane, and now we are \non natural gas. Amaranth cornered the natural gas market by controlling \nas much as 75 percent of all of the natural gas futures contracts in a \nsingle month. The skyrocketing cost of natural gas, because of \nAmaranth's control of the market, cost American consumers an estimated \n$9 billion. Shortly after Amaranth was suspected of manipulating \nnatural gas prices, the hedge fund collapsed.\n\n  Today, there are many who believe that what happened in electricity, \nwhat happened in propane, and what happened in natural gas is now \nhappening in oil. I think we should not be\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\nshocked by that, given the recent history I have mentioned. I think we \nhave to move very aggressively in dealing with speculation.\n  Let me take this opportunity to say a few words about the LIHEAP \nlegislation. The bill we introduced would increase LIHEAP funding by \ngoing from $2.5 billion to over $5 billion. Basically, it is a doubling \nof funding. That, in fact, is the amount that has already been \nauthorized. We should be very clear. In terms of the need to increase \nLIHEAP funding, we are literally dealing with a life-and-death \nsituation. People will die. People will die of exposure to cold. People \nwill die of heat exhaustion if we do not move, and if we do not move \nquickly.\n  It is important to understand, because CNN cameras do not go there--\nthey do not go to an old person's house in Tucson, AZ, who is \nstruggling with 110 and 115 degree temperatures without electricity. \nThey don't go to a low or moderate income home in Vermont and Maine \nwhen people are trying to stay warm, when the temperature gets 20 below \nzero. The truth is that more people have died from the extreme heat and \nhypothermia since 1998 than all natural disasters in this country \ncombined, including floods, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes. I know we \nall see and appreciate the pain people in the Midwest are experiencing \ntoday with the floods. We appreciate and want to respond to the crisis \nin California with the fires. But the fact is that more people die from \nexposure to cold and to heat than from these natural disasters, as \nterrible as they are.\n  To give you an example--this is hard to believe, and many people \ndon't know this--over the past decade, more than 400 people have died \nof heat exposure in Arizona. That is one State. That is 400 people in \nthe last decade, including 31 people in July of 2005. All of these \ndeaths could have been prevented if these people had had air \nconditioning.\n  What I worry about is that electricity prices are going up because \nfuel prices are going up. Our economy is tanking, and we are seeing a \nrecord number of disconnects. So I ask people to be concerned about \nwhat happens when it gets 20 below zero in Vermont and in Maine. I also \nask people to be concerned about what happens when people get \ndisconnected from their electricity in Arizona, Nevada, Texas, and \nother States.\n  Let me simply conclude that, clearly, we are in the midst of a major \nenergy crisis. There are a number of aspects to that crisis and they \nhave to be addressed. I hope that, as a Congress, while we debate those \nissues, we come together, as I think we are, in saying that no one in \nthis country this year should die of heat exposure, no one in this \ncountry should die through being frozen to death when the temperature \ngets very low in the northern part of our country.\n  I thank, again, the 49 cosponsors of this legislation. It is \ntripartisan. Both Independents are on it. We have 12 Republicans on it. \nThe rest are Democrats. I thank them all. I thank Senator Reid for \ntrying his best to try to get that bill to the floor as soon as \npossible. The AARP and dozens of other national organizations know how \nimportant it is that we pass an increase in LIHEAP funding and do it as \nsoon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I inquire, I believe the Republicans have \n13 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will you please let me know when 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes has expired.\n  Mr. President, it is somewhat humorous to listen to the class warfare \nthat has been coming from the other side of the aisle talking about \ntrying to explain to the American people that supply and demand does \nnot work. It is interesting that the other day, there was an editorial \nin the Washington Post saying even Congress can't repeal the law of \nsupply and demand. Supply and demand does work, and it is a tough job \nto try to explain to people and it is going to be very difficult to \nexplain to people who are buying gas at the pumps why increasing supply \nis not going to bring down the price.\n  Let me clarify one point. It is always easier to find someone to \nblame for a quick fix. On this speculation bill, none of the people who \nare really well informed on this issue believe that would have anything \nto do--anything to do--with the price of gas at the pumps. Walter \nWilliams, an economist at George Mason University, said:\n\n       Congressional attacks on speculation do not alter the oil \n     market's fundamental supply and demand conditions.\n\n  He goes on to say it wouldn't lower it at all.\n  We have the International Energy Agency saying:\n\n       Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking \n     the necessary steps to improve supply of oil and gas.\n\n  That is what it is all about, it is supply and demand. There is not a \nperson in America who has a high school education who has not already \nstudied the law of supply and demand, and they know, in fact, it does \nwork.\n  I came down really to talk about something about which I am proud, \nand that is what T. Boone Pickens is doing right now. He is saying we \nhave to continue to drill, drill, drill everywhere we can--offshore, \nANWR, into the shales--do everything we can to produce and increase the \nsupply. But in the meantime, let's try to do something that has a more \nimmediate effect, and that has to do with compressed natural gas.\n  Let me state to you, Mr. President, that I have introduced a bill \nthat will allow us to use compressed natural gas for automobile use. It \nsimply does three things.\n  We now have a tax credit for alternative fuels, and we want to add \nbiofuels to that. One of the problems we have currently, if you have a \ncar that has been converted to natural gas, to compressed natural gas, \nit is not readily available all over. There is a machine you can get \nnow which you hook up at nighttime which will compress it overnight and \nyou can use it. A lot of people don't have that machine. There are some \nplaces you cannot buy it. So biofuels vehicles should have the same tax \ncredit as the alternative-fuel vehicles have. If we can do that, then \nthat is going to allow people to have an engine to run on regular \ngasoline or on compressed natural gas.\n  The second thing we need to do is to have the mandatory renewable \nfuels standard include natural gas. If it does that, that is going to \nbe another great advantage.\n  The third thing is, I was talking to a man named Tom Sewell in Tulsa. \nHe is the one who I believe invented the machine you can hook up to \nyour gas line and compress the gas for use in automobiles. He said one \nof the major problems is, when you go to convert your car, you have EPA \nrequirements that are the same--if you have one engine that would be in \nthree different manufactured automobiles, such as General Motors, \nChrysler, and Ford, and some others, they have to get the same \ncertification for that engine from each source. Certification is around \n$80,000. If we can pass this legislation, this will knock down the \nadditional cost of converting your car by about $2,000 for each one.\n  I think this is something that has to be in the mix. I agree with T. \nBoone Pickens when he says there are some things we can do that would \nbe effective, but in the meantime we have to take the natural gas we \nare using for other sources and replace it with--he is saying wind \nenergy. I don't care what you replace it with, but let's use that so we \ncan have compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas. All these \nbuses around Washington, DC, say ``This bus is running on clean natural \ngas.'' That is liquefied natural gas. Those technologies are here. You \ndon't have to wait.\n  To answer the previous speaker--he spent 30 minutes trying to explain \nto people that supply and demand does not work--just look at this and \nrealize that if we were able to open the Outer Continental Shelf, 14 \nbillion barrels; ANWR, 10 million barrels; Rocky Mountain oil shale, \nwhich is the big reserve out there, 2 trillion barrels--right now \nDemocrats have a moratorium, so we cannot go to those areas. They are \ntrying to do the same thing with the Canadian oil sands. They already \nput a prohibition on using that for defense purposes. There are 179 \nbillion barrels out there. This is what we can use. If we should open \nthis, the market would immediately respond. All the smart people say \nthey know that would happen because they know that help would be on its \nway.\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\n  Some of this we don't have to wait 10 years or 15 years for, as the \nprevious speaker wants you to believe, because it can happen in 2 years \nor 3 years. In the meantime, the market will respond. People who say it \nwould have taken 10 years for ANWR, if you remember back when President \nClinton vetoed the bill that would have allowed us to drill in ANWR as \nwell as offshore--that was 1995--we would have all of that. The next \nspeaker from Alaska will tell you that would be coming down through the \npipeline today, more than what we are importing now, not just from \nSaudi Arabia but all the Middle Eastern countries and Venezuela \ncombined.\n  Supply and demand still works. It is still out there, it is still \nalive and well, and Republicans want very much to increase the supply. \nThere it is, right there. It is something we can do. All we need is to \nhave 10 Democrats join us, and we will be able to increase the supply \nof oil and gas in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I had the opportunity to \nspend about half an hour on the floor talking about the leasing issues \naround the country and more particularly in Alaska. I had the \nopportunity to talk about ANWR and about the NPRA, the National \nPetroleum Reserve, and spent a fair amount of time on the facts. I was \nquite pleased this morning to come in and read e-mails from people \naround the country who said: Thank you for talking about some of the \nfacts. We appreciate learning and understanding what ANWR really is, \nwhat the potential is in NPRA. Today, I would like to continue on that \nsubject.\n  In Alaska, as we know, we have been blessed with incredible \nresources. There have been some suggestions in the debate on the floor \nthat perhaps there isn't enough oil and gas in this country for us to \nreally make a meaningful impact with new production. So I wish to speak \njust a little bit to the production side of the energy solution.\n  According to the latest estimates by the USGS and the Minerals \nManagement Service, it is possible to produce nearly 24 billion barrels \nof oil and 100.6 trillion cubic feet of gas from onshore areas in \nnorthern Alaska--these are mean estimates--and up to another 41 billion \nbarrels of oil and about another 290 trillion cubic feet of gas from \noffshore waters around Alaska. Just this afternoon, USGS came in with \ntheir new Arctic resource appraisal, and they forecast that the \nBeaufort and Chukchi Seas have a mean chance of containing 30 billion \nbarrels of oil. From an oil perspective, Alaska's Arctic is being \nforecast to contain a third--a third--of all the undiscovered \nconventional oil in the Arctic region.\n\n  We recognize that when we operate up there, we must protect the \nenvironment while we develop that energy, and we will. But Alaska \noffers a lot of energy potential. When I hear some of the comments on \nthe floor that we simply do not even have enough to start, I beg to \ndiffer. The potential production from Alaska is triple America's \ncurrent proven reserves of oil and would be enough oil to meet the \nNation's total oil needs for nearly a decade. The gas reserves are \nnearly double America's current proven reserves and enough to handle \nall of America's current natural gas consumption for 18 years. These \nare not trivial reserves, if we are ever allowed to develop them. Just \nlook at what we have up in ANWR, looking at opening the 1.5 million \nacres of the 1002, the Arctic Coastal Plain.\n  As we talk about ANWR and its potential, what we are not really \nhearing is what ANWR's oil potential really means to the Nation at the \ncurrent gas prices, recognizing we are right at $130 a barrel.\n  Earlier this year, the EIA released its latest estimates for ANWR \nproduction and what it would mean. At that time, it predicted that \nANWR's opening would save the Nation from paying up to $327 billion--\n$327 billion--to buy oil from overseas over the life of the field. It \npredicted that it could reduce America's dependence on imported oil \ndown to 48 percent compared to the more than 60 percent dependence we \nare at currently.\n  The EIA forecast on ANWR from this winter again actually has been \nused by some on the floor to argue against opening ANWR, saying ANWR \ndoesn't help the Nation enough, it is going to take too long to have an \nimpact, and therefore we shouldn't be doing it. There is a Chinese \nproverb out there that says the best time to plant a tree was 10 years \nago; the second best time is today. I think that holds true with ANWR. \nThose who make these arguments saying there is not enough and it is too \nlate do not recognize this EIA forecast is based on the most \nconservative assumptions possible. We believe the benefits are likely \nto be twice to three times the amount of the official forecast. The \nreason is this: The report pegs the price of oil in 2020 at $59.49 a \nbarrel in 2006 dollars. They are looking out to 2020, and they are \nsaying: We figure the price of oil is going to be $59.49. Given that \noil is more than twice that today and that few economists predict it is \ngoing to drop to $70 or $80 a barrel in the future, ANWR production \ncould help to drive down the price at the pump by a whole lot more than \nthe Government officially forecasts.\n  The International Energy Agency just this week reported that it \nexpects oil prices to rise even further. I know that is not something \nmost Americans want to hear, but given that the era of cheap and easy-\nto-find gas is over, we should acknowledge that those predictions are \nreliable.\n  We all remember the Goldman Sachs comment earlier this year. They \nforecast that oil could reach $200 a barrel, particularly with the \ngeopolitical tensions that are out there. So opening ANWR could help to \nlower our prices in this country.\n  The myth that ANWR production is not worth doing because there is not \nmuch oil there is yet, again, another myth. According to EIA's January \nforecast, ANWR oil development, assuming a 50-50 chance of finding 10.4 \nbillion barrels of oil, is going to produce 780,000 barrels a day \nstarting in 2018. We think that it can be brought on prior to 2018 and \nbelieve that is realistic.\n  We can do more in the State of Alaska. We are ready and standing by \nto do more, but we need the permission from the Congress to go into \nANWR.\n  I know I just spoke strictly to production. I don't typically like to \ndo that. I like to talk about other efforts, including conservation and \nrenewables. Tonight, it is just the facts on ANWR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hope that what is happening on the \nfloor today is visible to people across our country. They have to see \nwhat is happening on the Senate floor as they pay through the nose, to \nuse the expression, for higher prices for gasoline. Our Republican \ncolleagues are blocking our efforts to eliminate harmful oil \nspeculation and to provide some relief at the gas pump for hard-working \nAmericans everywhere. They are holding up our speculation bill with a \nreckless plan to let oil companies drill along our shores.\n  We do not have to look any further than what happened just this \nmorning on the Mississippi River to understand why this planning is so \nreckless.\n  Two boats collided--one was a chemical tanker and the other an oil \nbarge--dumping 400,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi River. Now, \nthese numbers, 400,000 gallons, may not really reach the senses of \npeople because it is so far removed, but this collision covered more \nthan 12 miles of the river with thick, tar-like fuel oil, and it closed \ndown almost--closed down the Mississippi River for about 30 miles. This \nspill shut down water supplies to the area, and there is a frantic \neffort going on right now to try to contain the spill and the damage it \nis causing to nearby wetlands. This incident highlights the danger and \nthe serious risks of transporting oil from rigs and refineries to other \nplaces.\n  Many of my colleagues have come down to the Senate floor over the \nlast several days to urge more drilling off our coasts, more drilling \nacross our country, but in particular we know the danger to coastlines. \nWe see today that it is clearly not as safe as some would like us to \nbelieve.\n  It is a sad commentary, though, that regardless of the reality, there \nare those who are carelessly suggesting that drilling will solve our \nproblems with the outrageous price of high gasoline, prices that are \nrobbing our families of their ability to stay financially\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nafloat. For lots of people, these increases in gas prices destroy any \nreserve that families had because we are, by and large, a commuting \nnation, and people pay enormous prices for the ability to get to work \nor to places of necessity.\n  But there is something happening here. There is an advantage that \naccrues gigantically, I might add, to the big oil companies and \nspeculators. Big oil has fared incredibly well during the last 7\\1/2\\ \nyears. That is thanks to their friends and cohorts at the White House. \nThere was a point in time when the energy policy was being written that \nheads of major oil companies were invited to a secret meeting with the \nVice President of the United States to design a program.\n  Who do you think they were going to take care of? They weren't \nworried about the average working family, not at all. They were looking \nat the companies and their ability to price gouge.\n  In fact, hard to believe, these oil companies have earned--pocketed \nis a better expression--more than $600 billion in profits over the last \n7\\1/2\\ years. For instance, ExxonMobil made over $10 billion in a \nsingle calendar quarter, and their profits have been coming out of our \npockets and going into theirs.\n  President Bush's latest plan is to give the industry more public land \non which to drill. But this is nothing more than a parting gift, his \nparting gift to the oil companies.\n  I want to make one thing clear. More drilling now cannot lower gas \nprices for American consumers. In the amount of time that it takes to \nget it to the gasoline pump, we could be witnessing a financial \ncalamity in our country. More offshore drilling will not impact prices \nuntil, at the very earliest, the year 2030.\n  We all recognize the importance of reducing gas prices to stabilize \nthis country's economy and to ease this terrible burden on America's \nfamilies, but the plan for new drilling along our coasts could be a \ndisaster. It will do nothing to solve our energy crisis, nothing to \nlower gas prices, nothing to fight inflation, and nothing to help \nAmerica's families.\n  Here is another reason lifting the ban on offshore drilling is a bad \nidea. It will endanger our environment which for coastal communities is \na huge source of revenue from tourism and recreation. Just imagine if \none of these proposed drilling rigs or, as happened today, a boat had \nan accident and spread thick sludge along our beaches and coastlines. \nIt would create a disaster culturally, financially, and recreationally. \nWe would see the same kind of economic catastrophe that we had in New \nJersey in 1988 after sewage and medical waste washed up on our beaches. \nThe tourism industry, our biggest source of revenue, collapsed for 2 \nyears.\n  It is clear the oil companies are hoping they can get as many leases \nas they can out of the Bush administration before this President's term \ncomes to an end. But when it is giving the oil companies new leases, we \nhave nothing to gain and everything to lose. We must not cater to the \noil companies, but we can do something to lower gas prices quickly and \nstart easing the burden on the American people, and my Democratic \ncolleagues and I have offered a solution.\n  I hope my colleagues will step up to their responsibilities and \npermit us to act on this solution, the Stop Excessive Speculation Act, \naimed at combating harmful oil speculation at the expense of the \nAmerican people in every State in this country.\n  The price of oil has doubled in the last 12 months, and many point to \nspeculation as the problem.\n  The top analyst at the Oppenheimer--when talking about speculation--\nsaid the commodities market was ``the world's largest gambling hall.'' \nAnd the CEOs of Continental, Delta, Jet Blue and other airlines, which \nare struggling to cope with crushing oil prices, have joined together \nto create the Web site Stop Oil Speculation Now Dot Com.\n  The fact is, you don't have to be an airline CEO or even a financial \nanalyst to realize that we must ring out excess speculation from the \nmarket. And that is exactly what our bill does.\n  It fixes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which oversees the \noil futures markets but is currently both underfunded and broken.\n  It gives the commission more staff and power to police the market and \nstop speculators from grossly distorting the price of oil.\n  And it closes a major loophole that allows traders to conduct \ntransactions on foreign exchanges and outside the watchful eyes of U.S. \nregulators.\n  For months, my colleagues and I have been working to solve this \nenergy crisis. But the Republicans have blocked our efforts a half \ndozen times.\n  American families and American businesses are suffering because \nRepublicans--working on behalf of the oil companies--continue to block \nour efforts. The Republican tactic of blocking good energy legislation \nmust stop for the good of the economy, the good of businesses and the \ngood of families across this country.\n  I plead with my Republican colleagues to stop focusing only on giving \ngifts to Big Oil in the form of a public land grab and to focus instead \non ending excessive oil speculation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7129-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7129-S7130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             STOP EXCESSIVE ENERGY SPECULATION ACT OF 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its consideration at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5098.\n\n  Mr. REID.

There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5099 to Amendment No. 5098\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike ``5'' and insert ``4''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems that the Republicans have two tools \nin their obstruction and delay kit. It is a tool kit that has worked \nquite well for them. First, they prevent the Senate from getting to \nbills. The Republican leader uses this tool when he can convince enough \nof his caucus to kill legislation before the Senate debate even begins.\n  Second, when a bill is so popular that the Republican leader is \nunable to convince enough of his colleagues to kill it before debate \ncan begin, he switches to his second tool--claiming the process is \nunfair. That is what we have before us today.\n  The Republican leader requests an unlimited or virtually unlimited \nnumber of amendments on which he is unable or unwilling to provide \nspecifics. When these requests are not accepted in their entirety, as \nthe Republican leader knows they cannot be, he then turns to his caucus \nand asks them to oppose any further action on the bill.\n  Regardless of which tool the minority leader uses, the result is the \nsame. The Republicans refuse to let us address the most critical \npriorities of the American people.\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\n  This situation reminds me of a story I learned as a young lawyer that \nhas now become somewhat legendary, which says: If you have the facts, \nyou pound the facts. If you have the law, you pound the law. If you \nhave neither, you pound the table.\n  That is exactly what is happening today and has happened on many \nother occasions. Unfortunately, it has happened, Mr. President, a \nrecord number of times this session--84 filibusters. That is \nobstruction at its zenith.\n  Republicans would love to muddy the issue by claiming that the \nDemocratic majority won't let them be heard, but that is simply not the \ntruth. Democrats have proposed a comprehensive plan to address our \nenergy crisis, starting with speculation. The Republicans, if they do \nnot like our speculation legislation, let them offer something to the \ncontrary. The Republicans have been talking about their plan for weeks \nand weeks now. That plan is to drill, to drill, and to drill.\n  Now, both parties want more drilling. It is not something that simply \nthe Republicans want. We Democrats believe that increasing domestic \nproduction is certainly a big part of the problem, and we should do \nsomething about it. But, Mr. President, realistically--and we all know \nthis--realistically we have a situation where we have, counting ANWR \nand all the offshore oil, less than 3 percent of the oil in the world. \nWe use more than 25 percent of the world's oil every day. So we can't \nproduce our way out of the problem. We can certainly increase domestic \nproduction, and we should do that, and we have a comprehensive plan to \ndo that.\n  Our approach is different from theirs on drilling. We believe our \napproach is more responsible because we basically force the oil \ncompanies to take a look at the land and do an inventory of it and tell \nus why they are not using certain pieces of land. That is 68 million \nacres in addition to about 25 million acres in Alaska that are \navailable with the signing of the President's pen. That increases it up \nto, as you know, about 90 million acres.\n  We have offered our plan to the Republicans. They say they want to \ndrill. They have talked about what their drilling plan is, and we have \nsaid: Let's have a vote on it. But they have said no. They can't take \nyes for an answer. So it is very clear. The only conclusion the \nAmerican people can reach from this is that the Republicans would \nrather talk than act. They would rather score, in their own minds, some \nkind of political points with the oil companies than accomplish \nsomething for the American people.\n  The Republican leadership has refused our offer of votes on drilling, \nso I am going to now, Mr. President, file cloture on this piece of \nlegislation before us--the speculation legislation. I think it is very \nimportant that we do that, and it is important for a number of reasons.\n  I should mention that one of the things they refuse to take yes for \nan answer on is their drilling proposal. But I am confident the \nAmerican people are seeing what the Republicans are doing, and have \nbeen doing, for 18 months--talking and talking about drilling and then \nrunning for the exits when we give them a vote on what they have asked \nto do.\n  I am equally confident, when given a choice of who to send to \nCongress, the American people will choose to send people who want to \nget things done and not those who seek delay, obstruction, and the \nfailed ways of the past.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like to make the \nSenator aware that I believe we could arrange a unanimous consent to \nshorten the time, if you would allow one amendment that would prohibit \nFannie May and Freddie Mack or organizations from lobbying during this \ntime of taxpayer-secured funding. So we are prepared to shorten the \ntime, if you are willing to allow that unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Senator from South Carolina, that \nthis bill is so important. We have filed--I kind of lost track, but \nbecause of your side we have had to have four cloture motions. This \nwill be the fifth on this most important piece of legislation, a piece \nof legislation that has been promoted and the administration has \nprodded us to get this done weeks ago.\n  Of course, if your amendment is made part of what we are going to do \nhere and this legislation is changed, it goes back to the House again. \nThen we have a process that seems never ending.\n  I have no problem with the intent of the Senator from South Carolina. \nI think there would be, perhaps, support on both sides of the aisle for \nyour amendment.\n  That being the case, I think it would be a real travesty at this \ntime. I don't know if there is a day that has gone by this week--it is \nonly Wednesday, so probably not--a day that has gone by this week that \nI haven't received a call from someone in the White House, including on \nseveral occasions the Secretary of Treasury, saying please do not hold \nthis up at all. This has to be done.\n  So I say to my friend again, in no way denigrating the intent of the \noffer because I think the intent is sincere, I hope you would not force \nus to do this.\n  Speaking on behalf of President Bush--and I don't do that very \noften--I don't think we should do this. I don't think we should send \nthis back to the House. I think we should complete it here.\n  I will be happy to consider joining the Senator in a letter to the \ntwo entities regarding some way to make sure they are transparent in \nany lobbying they do. I would be happy to do something on this. But I \nfeel constrained not to slow this very important legislation, which is \nwell over a month overdue at this time. Every day that we do not do \nsomething--every day there are 8,500 people who get foreclosure \nnotices; 8,500.\n  It may not seem like much, but if we send this back to the House, we \nwould complete it sometime late next week. During that period of time, \nwe would probably have about 45,000 people who would have entered \nforeclosure proceedings, when this legislation will allow, some say, up \nto 1 million people to be able to save their homes.\n  I hope the Senator would not press us on that. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I offered a unanimous consent request, the last one I \noffered, and my friend from South Carolina reserved the right to \nobject, so I withdraw that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7131-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7131-S7140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        WARM IN WINTER AND COOL IN SUMMER ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

The bad news is, it \nonly deals with a very tiny part of the overall problem we confront.\n  We know that over 80 percent of the American public believes we ought \nto expand domestic production of oil and gas, both onshore and \noffshore. We know a speculation-only bill, while interesting debate as \nto what part of the price of gas at the pump speculation involves, we \nknow that alone is not going to deal with the core problem, which is we \ndo not have enough supply of oil and gas.\n  As the most famous rich Democrat in America, Warren Buffett, said: We \ndo not have a speculation problem, we have a supply and a demand \nproblem.\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n  As T. Boone Pickens, who has been liberally quoted on both sides of \nthe aisle here, and has been in town this week, has repeatedly pointed \nout to us, his view is we ought to do everything we can to both expand \ndomestic production and to conserve. But he too does not believe \nspeculation alone has anything to do with the core problem.\n  The dilemma we have now is that we have a very narrowly crafted \nmeasure that the majority leader has made impossible to amend, that no \nexperts in the country think would have a real impact on the core \nproblem. Senate Republicans find that unacceptable.\n  The American people are pounding the table. They are angry as they \ngas up their cars every week and see the pricetag. They are saying: Do \nsomething and do something now that will make a difference. This is the \nbiggest issue in the country since terrorism right after 9/11, and our \nresponse: A no-amendment approach. That is simply unacceptable and \ninconsistent with even the recent history of the Senate when preventing \namendments by the minority has become all too common.\n  Look back to last fall or last year. We did an energy bill on the \nfloor of the Senate, an important energy bill that, among other things, \nraised the corporate average fuel economy of automobiles. We spent 15 \ndays on the floor. The price of gas at that point was $3.06 a gallon. \nIt is a full dollar or so higher now. It was not the biggest issue in \nthe country at that point. Although it was a big issue, it was not the \nbiggest issue. We had 16 rollcall votes. We agreed to 49 amendments; in \n15 days, 49 amendments when the price of gas was $3.06 a gallon.\n  In 2005, when this side of the aisle contained the majority, we had \nan energy bill, an important energy bill. The price of gas at that time \nwas $2.26 a gallon, which we all felt was entirely too high then. We \nspent 10 days on the floor on that debate, we had 19 rollcall votes on \namendments, and we adopted 57 amendments.\n  Both of those measures ended up becoming law. They were clearly not \none of those check-the-box exercises where you put everybody on record \nand move on. I think the American people would be appalled and will be \nappalled as they learn that the plan here is to not do anything serious \nabout the biggest issue in the country.\n  There is a lot of dodging and weaving going on. We know the Senate \nAppropriations Committee decided not to function out of fear that \namendments would be offered relating to offshore drilling. The chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, I gather, was rather candid about it: \nWe are not going to meet because we might have votes on the No. 1 issue \nfor the American people, which is to expand domestic supply.\n  Now, we have said repeatedly on this side that we do not think \nexpanding supply is the key. We think you should both find more and use \nless--do both. As T. Boone Pickens repeatedly told us this week, both \nsides of the aisle: You need to do all of these things. You need to do \nall of them quickly. ``Get about it,'' he suggests.\n  I am sure he said to the Democrats, as he did to the Republicans, \nthat he is 80 years old, he wants to see some results soon. He said he \nwas running out of time. Well, the American people are running out of \ntime too. So my suggestion is we proceed with this bill, the most \nimportant issue in the country, in a way that will get a result for the \nAmerican people. A proven way to get a result, demonstrated last year \nwhen the Democrats were in the majority and in 2005 when the \nRepublicans were in the majority, is to have a process that is fair to \nboth sides, that allows all Members of the Senate to participate in \nwriting a bill on an important subject.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3268\n\n  Now, in that regard, I have indicated to my friend the majority \nleader that I was going to propound a unanimous consent agreement that \nI think would be reasonable, related to the subject, and begin to move \nus in the direction of having an accomplishment and not a check-the-box \nexercise.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the \npending measure in the following manner: that the bill be subject to \nenergy-related amendments only; provided further, that amendments be \nconsidered in an alternating manner between the two sides of the aisle, \nfirst an amendment on one side, then on the other. I further ask \nunanimous consent that the bill remaining be the pending business to \nthe exclusion of all other business other than privileged matters or \nitems that are agreed to jointly by the two leaders. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the first seven amendments to be offered on my side of the \naisle by the Republicans, by either myself or my designee, be the \nfollowing: an Outer Continental Shelf amendment, plus the conservation \nprovision; an oil shale amendment, including a conservation provision; \nan Alaska energy production amendment, including a conservation \nprovision; the Gas Price Reduction Act, which has 44 cosponsors; a \nclean nuclear energy amendment; a coal-to-liquid fuel amendment, plus \nconservation; and a LIHEAP amendment.\n  All this would do would be to indicate what the Republicans have in \nmind on those seven amendments related to the subject, and would give \nnotice to the other side that were we permitted to do so, those would \nbe the first seven we would offer.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that that be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the matters the \ndistinguished Republican leader has outlined are part of their proposal \nthat they offered before, I think they call it the Gas Price Reduction \nAct. Everything he has talked about here is part of that legislation, \nand it is part of an alternative we have also. Senator Bingaman has \nworked for more than a week with the assistance of other Senators on \nthis side of the aisle coming up with different amendments which, of \ncourse, have the Alaska energy production. That is part of ours. We \nhave the oil shale amendment as part of ours. We have the LIHEAP, of \ncourse, which is now or shortly will be before this body.\n  It is very obvious that the Republicans, especially when they want \nthis to be the exclusive matter we deal with, that is this energy bill, \nthat they want this to go on, as a lot of things have this year, into \noblivion. That is why they had 84 filibusters and we have had to file \ncloture 84 times.\n  These are the first seven amendments. I hope everyone heard that; the \nfirst seven amendments they want to offer. We know that the drilling \namendment is a subterfuge. We know that John McCain, the Republican \nnominee for President of the United States, has said it will do nothing \nfor short-term oil supply. He said it is psychological. That is what \nthe Republican nominee for President has said.\n  We said what we wanted to do is have a vote on speculation, which is \na very big deal. Now I know my friend keeps bringing up Warren \nBuffett's name, said he does not think speculation has anything to do \nwith it. I have great respect for Warren Buffett. I consider Warren \nBuffett a friend. I have talked to him many times and have met with him \non many occasions. By the way, he told me the best business he has ever \nhad in his whole life is a furniture store in Las Vegas.\n  We read into the Record today numerous scientists, economists, \nregulators, who said that speculation is from 20 to 50 percent of the \ncost of a barrel of oil.\n  We believe that is an important issue. My friend said: It is only a \ntiny part. Only a tiny part? Twenty to fifty percent of the cost of a \nbarrel of oil a tiny part? Remember, it is very interesting. It is \ninteresting that their so-called Gas Price Reduction Act that they \nintroduced with 42 cosponsors--part of that is a provision dealing with \nspeculation. So speculation is not a tiny part.\n  This morning, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire said he \nthought there should be a vote on oil shale. I said: Fine, we will have \none. He said he thought it would be great to have a vote on nuclear \npower. I said: We have not built a plant in 40, 50 years. I am sure \nthat is not much of a short-term solution to the energy problem facing \npeople buying gasoline in Las Vegas or Reno. But we said we would do \nthat.\n  So, Madam President, this is nothing more than what the Republicans \nhave done from the very beginning. They are not concerned about \nspeculation. Drilling, as their Presidential nominee has said, is only \npsychological. We want to\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\ndo something to certainly focus on speculation.\n  I would say, as LIHEAP is part of it, they are going to have that \nopportunity. We are going to take up LIHEAP. People have come to me and \nsaid they think this is an important issue. Well, join with Democrats \nbecause we also believe it is an important issue. They will not let us \ndo anything on speculation. Maybe they will let us do something on \nLIHEAP.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, Madam President, the good news is we are on the \nsubject the American people are interested in. Republicans believe it \nis important to talk about the biggest issue in the country. We have \nagreed that speculation is something we are willing to take a look at.\n  As the majority leader pointed out, it is part of the Gas Price \nReduction Act. But we need to do a lot more than that, and we will be \narguing during the pendency of this issue that we ought to open this \nbill, give all Senators on both the Democratic and Republican side an \nopportunity to turn this into a serious, comprehensive energy proposal, \ndebated and amended, consistent with Senate tradition.\n  That, we know, will lead to an actual law. What happens when you go \nthrough these expurgated, slimmed-down, check-the-box exercises is, you \ndo not get anything done. The American people are out of patience. \nMaybe this is one of the reasons this Congress has a 14-percent \napproval rating, which makes the President's approval rating look \npretty good. They sent us here to do something, and I think I can \nsafely speak on behalf of the Republican conference that we are ready \nto do something about the most important issue in the country.\n  We are pleased to be on the subject matter, and I see my good friend \nfrom Arizona on his feet.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, might I just ask the minority leader to \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, just to clarify one thing the majority \nleader said, your unanimous consent request dealt with seven specific \nsubjects that you would like to address by amendment. The majority \nleader indicated that all seven of those were part of a bill that 44 \nRepublicans had cosponsored.\n  I would ask the minority leader, is that correct? Specifically, did \nthat bill that Republicans have cosponsored include LIHEAP, which is \none of the amendments, a nuclear amendment, which is another amendment, \nor an amendment dealing with the production in Alaska, specifically \nANWR?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, Madam President, I would say to my friend from \nArizona, of course not. Members of our conference, as we know because \nwe worked very hard on this, believe that the four provisions of the \nGas Price Reduction Act--offshore drilling, oil shale moratorium--I see \nthe Senator from Colorado here--battery-driven cars--I see the Senator \nfrom Tennessee here--and an important provision on speculation are a \ngood place to start.\n  We would like to have that vote. But there are other members of our \nconference--I see the Senator from Alaska here who feels very strongly \nmaybe this is a good time to debate and vote on ANWR or maybe a good \ntime to discuss the proposal about which the other side has been \ntalking about part of her State that is currently open that may or may \nnot end up being productive.\n  The fundamental point, I say to my friend from Arizona, is, everybody \nin the Republican conference believes, since this is the most important \nissue in the country, we ought to spend some time on it and try to get \nit right. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  I see my friend from Tennessee on his feet. Does he have a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wonder if the Republican leader \nwould answer a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, is it the intention of the Republican \nleader to cause the Senate to take up the issue of $4 gas prices and \nstay on it and debate it and amend it and come to a substantial result, \nincluding ways to increase supply and reduce demand, so we can say to \nthe American people we have done our job?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would say to my friend from \nTennessee that is precisely what we had hoped to do. And that is the \nreason I outlined the way the Senate dealt with the broad subject of \nenergy last year under a Democratic majority and 3 years ago under a \nRepublican majority.\n  If we want to make a law around here, the way you do it is you give \nboth sides an opportunity to amend and debate. That is not for the \npurpose of not going forward with a bill. That is for the purpose of \ngoing forward with a bill and getting a result. I think clearly I can \nsafely speak for every single member of the Republican conference: We \nwould like to get a result to make a difference.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I may ask a second question of the \nRepublican leader. Has the Republican leader not from the very \nbeginning said that the solution to $4 gasoline is both supply and \ndemand; that we want to find more and use less; that, yes, we want to \ndrill offshore, but we also want to make it commonplace to have plug-in \nelectric cars and trucks, as an example, and that the major difference \nbetween us is that we are willing to find more and use less and the \nother side is not?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from Tennessee, I \nthink I am hard pressed to think of a particular example of any \nconservation measure that virtually every Member of our conference is \nnot in favor of. Every Member of our conference has said, as the \nSenator from Tennessee has indicated, that we would like to both find \nmore and use less, and we are confident that we cannot have an \naccomplishment that actually makes a difference unless we do both.\n  So I think the Senator from Tennessee is entirely correct. Our goal \nhere is to find more and to use less and to actually make a law and \nmake a difference rather than trying to make an issue.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I may ask a last question of the \nRepublican leader. The Republican leader and I and many other Senators \nprobably took economics 101. When I took it, the law of supply and \ndemand had both supply and demand, finding more and using less.\n  I wonder if the Republican leader knows of any movement in academic \ncircles to repeal half of the law of supply and demand, and to say that \nthe law of supply and demand does not anymore include supply?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The only time I heard that suggested was by some of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle who think maybe you can only \ndo half of that. But I am unaware of any American people who believe \nthat. The American people get this. The reason this issue has jumped \nway up the charts is because they understand the law of supply and \ndemand. They understand we both need to find more and to use less.\n  And I do not understand the reluctance here. I really do not. In a \nCongress enjoying a 14-percent approval rating, I do not understand \nwhat my good friends on the other side are afraid of. What is the \nproblem? Why don't we join hands and do something?\n  Every one of our amendments may not pass; we do not know whether they \nwill. But what is the reluctance of the majority to tackle the No. 1 \nissue in the country? I am perplexed by the strategy. I do not know why \nwe should be afraid. We are all familiar with these issues. We wrestled \nwith many of them in 2007 when we passed an energy bill. We did it in \n2005 when we passed an energy bill. Most people think both of those \nbills made a positive difference for the country. It obviously is not \nenough.\n  If not now, when? When? Now is the perfect time to get started. And \nit is never a good answer to say if we do this or we do that it will \nnot make a difference tomorrow. Almost none of these things make a \ndifference tomorrow, unless collectively we do something that is so \napplauded by the rest of the world and by the markets that they think, \nmy goodness, maybe these Americans are serious about getting on top of \nthis problem and doing something about it.\n  So that is our goal, I would say to my good friend, the majority \nleader. There\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nis nothing tricky about it. There are no gimmicks involved. This is a \nserious effort and an overwhelming interest on our side to make a law--\na law that will make a difference, and to do it not tomorrow, not 3 \nweeks from now, not in November, but now. The way forward toward an \naccomplishment for our country is to get started. We have the \nopportunity to do that.\n  If my good friend on the other side would like to engage in further \ndiscussions off the floor about ways in which we can agree to sets of \namendments that are fair to both sides and go forward, we are happy to \ndo that. But we are relieved to be on the subject, and we think we \nought to stay on this subject because the American people expect it of \nus.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Republican leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator from New Hampshire for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, it seems to me that the Republican leader \nhas outlined the process for getting this bill completed. He has listed \nseven amendments which are reasonable and which are significant because \nthey involve--well, in the area of oil shale, over $2 trillion of \npotential reserves, in the area of offshore oil, literally years of \nreserves, and on the issue of nuclear power, a chance to produce a \nclean energy that does not pollute the environment and addresses the \nissue of clean energy.\n  I presume the Republican leader--certainly, one of those amendments \nmight be my amendment, and I would certainly be agreeable to a time \nlimit. Would the Senator agree that we on our side would be willing to \nagree to reasonable time limits for debate on each of these amendments \nso there could be an orderly process which would have a time certain \nfor completion of this bill sometime early next week?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I say to my friend from New \nHampshire, of course we would be happy to agree to time agreements on \nour amendments. We want to go forward. There is no effort to slow this \ndown. We want to make progress. Frequently, as my friend from New \nHampshire points out, the way you make progress when you offer an \namendment around here is, you agree to a time agreement. There is a \ncertain amount of risk involved because you do not know whether you are \ngoing to win or lose, but you move forward.\n  That, I assure my colleagues, is the way we handled the energy bill \nlast year, it is the way we handled the energy bill in 2005, and it is \nthe way to make a law and to make a difference for our country.\n  So I would say to my good friend, the majority leader, that is where \nwe hope we will end up, in a position where both sides can have their \nfair say on this important issue and just maybe come together and do \nsomething important for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend, the Republican leader, said \nthis is a good place to start. That is the problem with the minority. \nThey have a lot of good ideas to start but never finish anything. That \nis the way it has been. They have had 84 filibusters this year.\n  This is really kind of like the ``Twilight Zone.'' The Republicans \nare saying now that they want to drill in the Outer Continental Shelf. \nThe Republican nominee for President, John McCain, says that is \npsychological and won't help. Now, today, to show they are not tracking \nvery well with John McCain, they come and say they want to drill in \nANWR. Now, John McCain is opposed to that. He stated so publicly. So \nthey have two issues, one of which the Republican designee for \nPresident says is just psychological, but they want to have a vote on \nthat. They also want to start drilling in ANWR--something their \nRepublican nominee for President totally opposes.\n\n  My friend from Tennessee said: Don't we want to do something about \nthe $4 gas prices? Please, Madam President, let's not laugh out loud. \nWe have brought matters before this body in detail more than once to do \nsomething about gas prices long ago. The Presiding Officer played an \nessential part in one piece of legislation. It was called the Consumer \nFirst Energy Act. That matter was brought up in June of this year. It \nwas a good piece of legislation. It said we should tax the windfall \nprofits of these oil companies, which last year, by the way, made $250 \nbillion. It repeals the section for major oil and gas companies that \nwere using foreign tax credits on oil that they shouldn't have. It \nsuspends the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We had to \nforce the President to do that. That part of it was ultimately adopted. \nIt punished price gouging. The American people understand that.\n  So to say we haven't done anything on gas prices is not because we \nhaven't tried. Again, our Republican colleagues have said: Well, that \nis a good place to start, but we are not going to do anything about \nthat.\n  We also talked, even in that legislation, about excessive speculation \nin the oil markets. We also had another piece of legislation the \nAmerican people identified with which was recommended as part of our \nConsumer First Energy Act by Senator Kohl of Wisconsin and Republican \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania. Why not make OPEC--this huge \norganization which is in control of most of the oil in the world \ntoday--why not make them subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act. That is \nwhat a Democrat and Republican thought was important, and we put it in \nthis bill. So no one needs to talk about us not trying to do something \nabout gas prices. We have been trying for a long time.\n  We also believe the American people understand that global warming is \nhere. We tried to move to that. The Republicans said: No, we are ready \nto start, but that is a little tiny thing. We want to have an open \namendment process. Then, bang, a couple more cloture motions.\n  The goal of the Republicans is to stall, and that is what they are \ndoing, and they are pretty good at it. I asked the Democratic whip to \nmeet with his counterpart last week to see what we could do about \nhaving some amendments to move forward on this speculation bill. The \ndistinguished Republican whip told the Democratic whip they had 28 \namendments and they would probably have more.\n  This is not a serious effort to legislate; this is a serious effort \nto stop everything. They are willing to stop housing again. We are \ngoing to have to go through all of this process of housing, causing at \nleast 45,000 or 50,000 people in the next few days to get foreclosure \nnotices. That is part of what they are stalling on tonight. We know we \nare going to move to LIHEAP. LIHEAP is something important. We must do \nthat, because there are senior citizens around this country, disabled \npeople, who are having a difficult time in the summer, but winter makes \nit brutal. We want to move to that. They are stalling us on that. That \nis three more cloture motions we have had to file, so now I guess we \nwill be up to, by the end of this week, 87 filibusters.\n  I know there are a lot of Senators here who wish to speak. I think it \nwould be appropriate that we enter into some kind of order if people \nwant to speak here so it is not a jump ball.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, would the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to ask the majority leader if--I \ndon't question the sincerity of the Republican side or the minority \nleader--but did we not say to the Republican side that if this is a \ncritical, timely issue, can you gather together your Republican \nSenators--all 49--and come up with your package that could include all \nof the elements that are mentioned here, and did we not make the offer \nto the Republican side that that would be called to the floor for \ndebate and for a vote in a timely fashion?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the answer is yes. But now they have a \nnew deal. The new deal is they want to do some interesting things that \nhaven't been brought up before. They want to drill in ANWR, even though \nit was resoundingly defeated in the Senate a couple of years ago. Even \nthough McCain is opposed to it, they are in favor of it. They want to \ndo something that is psychological. Not only do they not want to move \nwith their package that we thought was what they wanted\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nto do--they introduced it, whatever the name of it is--now they want to \nsplit that off piece by piece and have one piece, two pieces, three \npieces, five pieces, whatever is in it, so they can stall some more.\n  So what I say to my friend is, yes, we were willing to have a vote on \ntheir package, and we would have our package. We are very proud of our \npackage.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the majority leader would yield through the Chair for \nanother question, if this issue is so critical and time is of the \nessence, why do they have 28 amendments plus? Why do they come to us \nand say we will start with 7; there may be more?\n  It would seem to me if time is of the essence, they would want us to \nmove in an orderly debate to two energy proposals--one on their side, \none on our side--have a debate, take a vote, and make sure it is done \nso we can adjourn as scheduled a week from Friday.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend it is obvious that the situation is they \nthink this is a tiny part of what we are doing. Speculation, which is \n20 to 50 percent of the cost of a barrel of oil, is a tiny part, and \nthey will skip that for now and go on to something else. Drilling? The \nMcCain special, the psychological cure for the problems of this \ncountry, they decided maybe they don't want to have a vote on that. \nMaybe what they will do is add on 27 other things.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if I could ask the majority leader \nthrough the Chair, as I understand it we have 9 days left--assuming \nthat there is not much to be achieved later today--9 days left before \nwe are supposed to adjourn. We are trying, before we adjourn for the \nAugust recess, to deal with several outstanding measures: the housing \nbill, which is now back over from the House of Representatives to try \nto deal with America's housing crisis; the LIHEAP bill, which the \nSenator has said will provide for the elderly and disabled, help with \ntheir air conditioning and heating bills; the tax extenders, \nan important part of our energy picture so that we have our Tax Code \nfriendly to those who want to promote solar power and wind power and \nsimilar renewable and sustainable sources; and, of course, we can't \noverlook the item that keeps us in through the weekend, the so-called \nCoburn package--relating to the Senator from Oklahoma--some 40 bills \ndealing with issues as serious as child pornography and missing \nchildren; these elements too.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, how is it \nconceivable we could have an open amendment process with an endless \nnumber of amendments, according to the Republican side, and possibly \ndeal with all of these important issues?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend through the Chair, you can't. I didn't \nmention--and I appreciate very much the distinguished Democratic whip \nmentioning this--also they have turned us down on alternative energy. \nThey voted that down, the extenders, which included a 6-year tax credit \nfor solar and all of those good things that Boone Pickens and others \nsaid we must move to.\n  In addition to turning us down on energy price relief, the Consumer \nFirst Energy Act--they turned us down on that--they turned us down on \nthe extenders. They do not want to legislate. They obviously aren't \nconcerned about the 85,000 people who are going to be given foreclosure \nnotices in the next few days. They obviously are not concerned about \nmoving forward on LIHEAP quickly. They obviously are not concerned \nabout setting up a registry for Lou Gehrig's Disease so people can find \nout how to cure that disease. They are not concerned about the \nChristopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act. Those are all being stalled \nbecause of this subterfuge of what is going on here.\n  Madam President, as I said, there are a number of people on the \nfloor. I know the Senator from New York has been waiting, and the \nSenator from Illinois has been staying here a while. I see now the \nSenator from Colorado. I am wondering if we can enter into some kind of \na consent agreement. The suggestion has been made that Senator \nVoinovich be recognized for 10 minutes, followed by Senator Clinton for \n15 minutes, and then we will alternate back and forth. I think it would \nbe appropriate if we did 10-minute timeframes, so I ask unanimous \nconsent for that to be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, Senator Voinovich \nwishes to have 20 minutes and Senator Allard wishes to have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. OK. The Senator from Ohio needs 20 minutes? We were going \nto have 10-minute blocks, but do you think you could do it in 15?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I probably won't use it. I would like to not have it \ncut off. That has happened too many times here.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Voinovich be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes, followed by Senator Clinton for up to \n20 minutes, and following that, we go in 15 minute-blocks. Senator \nAllard would be next recognized and someone on our side would be next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise to speak today about one of \nthe top issues facing our Nation: the skyrocketing price of gasoline, \nsomething both the majority and minority leader have been talking \nabout.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, our strength and identity have been \nmarked by moments that demanded great action in the face of grave \nthreats. We saw this in 1776 when our Founding Fathers declared their \nindependence from the oppressive hand of a mighty empire, and again in \n1961 when President Kennedy responded to the growing strength of the \nSoviet Union and their successful launch of Sputnik by announcing the \nApollo Project to put a man on the Moon in 10 years.\n  In 2008 we are faced with a grave threat. Today, across America, \npeople are hurting. If you are looking for the root of their pain, you \ndon't have to look any further than their home energy bill or their \nlocal gas station. It is not just our people who are in grave danger, \nit is our Nation as well.\n  While I know Americans are hurting from our addiction to oil, I am \nnot sure they fully realize the extent our national security--and, \nindeed, our very way of life--is threatened by our reliance on foreign \noil. Every year we send billions of dollars overseas for oil to pad the \ncoffers of many nations that do not have our best interests at heart, \nand some such as Venezuela, whose leader has threatened to cut off the \noil. In fact, in 2007, we spent more than $327 billion to import oil, \nand 60 percent of that--or nearly $200 billion--went to oil-exporting \nOPEC nations. In 2008, the amount we will spend to import oil is \nexpected to double to more than $600 billion. Now, let's put that into \nperspective. In 2008 we are going to spend $693 billion on our defense, \nand now we are sending $600 billion overseas to some folks who don't \nlike us.\n  There is no question that our dependence on foreign oil has serious \nnational security implications, and we don't talk about it enough. In \naddition to funding our enemies, as I explained, we cannot ignore the \nfact that much of our oil comes from and travels through the most \nvolatile regions of the world.\n  A couple of years ago I attended a series of war games hosted by the \nNational Defense University. I saw firsthand how our country's economy \ncould be brought to its knees if somebody wanted to cut off our oil. In \n2006, Hilliard Huntington, executive director of Stanford University's \nEnergy Modeling Forum, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that based on his model:\n\n       The odds of a foreign oil disruption happening over the \n     next 10 years are slightly higher than 80 percent.\n\n  Eighty percent.\n  He went on to testify that if global production were reduced by \nmerely 2.1 percent due to some event, it would have a more serious \neffect on oil prices and the economy than Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil is made even more troubling when you \nconsider our Nation's financial situation. Today, 51 percent of the \nprivately owned national debt is held by foreign creditors--mostly \nforeign central banks. That is up from 6 years ago. Foreign creditors \nprovided more than 70 percent of the funds that the United States has \nborrowed since 2001, according to the Department of the Treasury. Who \nare those creditors? The three largest are China, Japan, and the OPEC\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nnations. This is insane. It has to stop. We cannot afford to allow the \ncountries that control our oil and our debt to control our future. \nThink about that. The same people who have us right where they want us \nin terms of oil now almost have us right where they want us in terms of \nour debt. If they want to put the two together, they can strike a \nlethal blow to our economy and to the American people.\n  I am going to be brutally honest with folks. The future of our \ncountry I think is in jeopardy. We cannot continue to transfer our \nwealth overseas to this degree without expecting serious consequences. \nRather than addressing these national security concerns, we have been \nliving the life of Riley and have allowed the environmental movement to \nrun wild. They have gone and sued every which way to Sunday and all the \nwhile ignored our energy, economic, and national security interests.\n  We have let them get away with it. We have let them get away with it \nbecause oil was cheap and so Congress felt no urgency to act.\n  I have to tell you something. Oil is not cheap anymore. For 10 years, \nI have been a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nfor 10 years I have tried to coax the committee into harmonizing our \nenergy economy, environment, and security. The committee has refused to \ndo it. Now, as I predicted, the chickens have come home to roost. \nAmericans, today, demand action and that we come together in a \nbipartisan fashion to solve this crisis. I am glad we finally have come \nto an agreement to move forward and debate this issue on the floor. I \nhope we can continue to work together to address the wide range of \namendments that I believe could improve this bill.\n  I have to say, I didn't follow all of what our leaders were talking \nabout, in terms of how this is going to be handled. I wish to let \npeople know I have been involved in the debate on energy since I have \nbeen in the Senate. First, in 2003, we were on the floor for 6 weeks \nand didn't get anything done. Then we came back in 2004 and spent a \ngreat deal of time, and nothing happened. Then we came back in 2005, \nwith the Energy Policy Act, and spent 10 days on the floor and 19 \nrollcalls and 57 amendments.\n  I believe the American people want their Senators to debate this \nissue on the floor of the Senate, give us the right to make amendments, \nand let's vote up or down on them; let's go at it and have a robust \ndebate. Hopefully, after it is over, some consensus will come back, as \nwe did in 2005 and 2007, so people will feel we have, for the first \ntime, stopped bickering and tried to address our attention to something \nthat will make a difference in their lives.\n  As you know, oil is not easily found or substituted. It will remain \nan integral component to our economy in the shortrun. We must make \ninvestments today that will help us achieve our goals of tomorrow. I \nbelieve this is what we must do: Find more and use less. We must \nincrease our supply, reduce our demand through alternative energies, \nand conserve what we have. We must carefully avoid the smoke-screens \nthat cloud our path to real solutions.\n  Some people are saying the speculation bill is a smokescreen. There \nis legitimate debate about that issue, but that is not the only issue \nwe should be debating. Some smart people are saying that, including \nRobert Samuelson, who recently wrote:\n\n       Speculator-bashing is another exercise in scapegoating and \n     grandstanding.\n\n  Paul Krugman wrote in an op-ed:\n\n       The hyperventilation over oil-market speculation is \n     distracting us from the real issues.\n\n  That same issue also came up with Boone Pickens. I was at the hearing \nhe attended in the committee. I think we can all agree this is a \ncomplicated issue, with many moving parts. That is why we have to look \nat the issue comprehensively and find solutions to combat this crisis \nfrom all angles. In the end, we must not forget the bottom line is \nabout supply and demand.\n  Let's talk about supply. In order to stabilize our Nation's energy \nsupply, we must enact policies to increase the development of domestic \nfuels.\n  While these resources will not physically come online for a number of \nyears, moves to expand development will send a clear signal to the \nmarket that we are serious about meeting our future energy demands and \nimmediately begin to drive down the cost of oil because investors will \nknow that gas will not be worth as much in the future and will \ntherefore sell it off today, lowering the cost immediately.\n  The fact of the matter is we have more energy resources than any \nother area of the world. I chaired a committee a couple weeks ago and \nit was amazing to me. They showed a chart. We have more oil reserves \nthan any other place in the world. Most of that is in the shale oil out \nin the Western United States. Some say it is too expensive to get, over \n$100--we are not sure yet. Boone Pickens testified and said that in 10 \nyears, if we don't do so, the cost of oil could be $300 a barrel. The \nfact is we have to understand that the majority of our oil resources \nare locked up. Eighty-five percent of our offshore acreage and 65 \npercent of our onshore acreage is off the table.\n  It is interesting. I have been saying that if the President goes over \nto see King Abdallah and says: Give me some more oil, the King should \nsay: Why should I give you my oil? The supply is almost the same as the \ndemand and demand is growing. Why don't you go home, Mr. President, and \nuse the oil that you have in the United States of America? Why don't \nyou drill in the Outer Continental Shelf and move east in the Gulf of \nMexico? You have rigs down there right now. Yet with 4,000 of them \nduring Katrina, there wasn't any oil spill during that period of time. \nI understand you have some shale oil out in the West--800 billion \nbarrels of oil--that is available, and perhaps even 2 trillion, in \nterms of reserves. You have lots of coal, and you could use that to \ncreate oil. You have some friends in Canada who have 185 billion \nbarrels of oil in the tar sands, and someone in your Congress has made \nit almost impossible to bring the tar sands down from Canada, who are \nfriends, neighbors, and they share your values.\n  It is interesting; when we talked to Pickens about this, he said: \nWhen I was in Saudi Arabia and talked to these guys, you know what they \nsaid to me? Go after your own oil. You know, once your oil is gone, \nthat is a great resource. Go after yours.\n  In a nutshell, I think that we need to go on and do the very best we \ncan, in an environmentally sound way, to get at the oil we have \navailable to us as a country.\n  I was thinking about this. If, in 10 years, we had this shale oil out \nin the West, and it proved to be what everybody says it can be, instead \nof us being at the bottom of the barrel, we would be at the top. We \nmight not have to use it, but we would be able to look out around the \nworld and say: You know what, folks, we have a lot of oil. What you did \nto us, we could do to you if we wanted to.\n  But that is not the real answer. The real answer is what I call the \nsecond declaration of independence. In the second declaration of \nindependence, we would basically say we are going to be oil \nindependent. Tell your kids and grandchildren that. We are going to do \nit like President Kennedy did. Remember when the Russians sent Sputnik \nup and we didn't like it? President Kennedy said to the American people \nthat we are going to get this done in 10 years. By golly, we saw a man \nfrom Ohio land on the Moon.\n  I know this: We have wonderful, smart people in this country. One of \nthe ideas I have, in terms of an amendment, would be that if we did \nexploration or we lifted the moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf \nexploration, what we would do is take the lease money and put it into \nthe research we are going to have to do on batteries, which I think, \nultimately, are the ones, because you don't need an infrastructure with \nfuel cells, and even with Boone Pickens' oil or natural gas, you have \nto have a pump there. But with a plug-in vehicle, all you do is come \nhome at night and stick it in the plug and you are all set. You don't \nhave to worry about whether the gas station will have a pump to take \ncare of it.\n  The fact is we need more money to do this. The Department of Energy \nhas good programs, but they don't have the money to take care of it. We \ncan say to the American people--on those leases, by the way, we have $9 \nbillion this year, and that is a lot of money--we are going to let you \ngo out and explore,\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nand you are going to pay us for these leases. By the way, we are going \nto take that money and use it so we can become oil independent in this \ncountry. That sounds, probably, idealistic. But the fact is we have to \ndo something creative around here. We know we don't have a lot of \nmoney. The national debt is $9.4 trillion.\n  But somehow we have to come together and say we are going to do two \nthings: go after what we have available to us, and we are going to do \neverything we can to be independent from relying upon foreign sources \nof oil. We recognize this is not just a problem of high gasoline costs; \nthis is a problem about the national security of the United States of \nAmerica. This is more than just, well, $4 a gallon.\n  Two years ago, I went over to that National Defense war games. I \nwalked out of there, and I was concerned about what could happen to our \ncountry if somebody decided they are going to shut off our oil.\n  The problem today is, if you look at the demand for oil and the \nsupply, it is about equal. Boone Pickens said that in his testimony. We \nhave the supply about where the demand is and demand is going up and \nthe supply isn't there. So one of the things we have to do as a country \nis let's do more with our own. Let's find more. We can tell the \nAmerican people it will not happen overnight, but we are going to do \nthis so that down the road we are not going to be at someone's beck and \ncall or at their mercy. In addition, it is going to allow us to stop \nsending money overseas to countries that don't like us.\n  Can you imagine that we get 11 percent of our oil from Venezuela and \nChavez down there, who is talking about cutting off the oil and trying \nto get the South American countries to all organize against the United \nStates of America? This is a big deal.\n  It is finding more, using less. It is also doing everything we can do \nfor conservation. These are simple things. I have a 2000 Ford station \nwagon. It has a little dial there that I can tell how many miles I get \nper gallon. I have to tell you, in the last 6 months, I have been \npaying a lot more attention to that. I have found that if I drive at \nabout 57 miles per hour, I can get 2 to 3 more miles per gallon. I \ndon't get there as fast, but I am saving on gas. My daughter Betsy--\nevery time she needed something, she would jump in the car and go out \nand get it. Now she makes a list, and they only go out once. My son \nPeter now works 10 hours a day for 4 days a week instead of 5 days. \nThat saves gas. There is a lot that we as Americans can do to cut back \non the amount of oil we are now using.\n  I think it is time we all work together, in a bipartisan fashion, and \nharmonize our energy, our environmental needs, our economy, and \nnational security. Can you imagine how the American people would \nrejoice if they saw Republicans and Democrats come together and say we \nare going to work this out on their behalf? Our numbers are pretty bad. \nI can tell you--and I am sure the Chair understands this--I am out in \nOhio all the time. Do you know what I hear? Why can't you stop the \nbickering? Why are you so much more interested in partisan politics?\n  Some have heard me say this before. I was mayor of Cleveland, working \nwith 21 Democrats. I had to work with the most powerful Democratic \nleader they ever had in the city. We decided to work together on a \nbipartisan basis. Then I went down to Columbus as Governor, with the \nmost powerful speaker ever, Vernal Riffe, whom they built and named a \nbuilding for. They put up a bust of him there that I had to genuflect \nto before I got to my office. We decided to work together and not talk \nabout our differences. We decided to find the things that would bring \nus together.\n  Let's go to the environmental groups, let's go to the people \ninterested in the economy, let's go to the people who are interested in \nenergy, let's go to the people who are interested in our national \nsecurity and say: You know what, we have a symbiotic relationship, you \nenvironmentalists, you people over here; let's work together, let's do \nsomething special, let's restore people's faith in our system in that \nwe are capable, Republicans and Democrats, Americans, to come together \nand really do something significant for not only ourselves today but, \nmore importantly, for my children, and more important than that, \nposterity--my seven grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, there is obviously a lot of discussion \nand even frustration on the floor, certainly from our side of the \naisle. It appears as though there is not going to be a meeting of the \nminds on this important legislation.\n  It is deeply disturbing because as we have been speaking today, in my \nState of New York, a lot of people finished work, started driving home, \nlooked at their gas gauge, and realized they were going to have to stop \nand fill up either for tonight or for going to work tomorrow. They \nexperienced what people are experiencing across America: the shock of \nthe rising gas prices which in New York are now an average of $4.27 a \ngallon. That is more than $1 higher than a year ago. Every extra dollar \nper gallon costs the average family of four an extra $1,500 a year. \nThat is $1,500 that can't be saved for college or retirement. That is \n$1,500 that can't be used to buy groceries, clothes, or school \nsupplies. That is $1,500 that can't help pay for health care or house \npayments. That is $1,500 that the people I represent don't have. It not \njust lying around waiting to be used or spent on some luxury. It really \ngoes to the heart of whether people are going to be able to meet their \ndaily obligations.\n  Statewide in our State, every dollar that gas prices increase costs \nthe New York economy $6 billion in added expenses for our drivers. That \nis $6 billion that can't be used to grow local economies, to support \nlocal businesses or stimulate new jobs.\n  Our farmers are hurting as higher energy costs shrink profit margins, \neven with higher market prices. Our commuters and our truckers are \nhurting. Tourism is hurting. I am hearing from New Yorkers every day \nwho depend on tourism at local marinas, for example, where the money \nhas dried up.\n  Meanwhile, we are sending $1.7 billion a day out of our country, more \nthan $600 billion a year. We know where that money is going. It is \ngoing to places that are unstable, to governments that use our dollars \nagainst us, our allies, and our interests around the world.\n  Clearly, we need a short-term strategy and a long-term strategy. That \nshould be self-evident. In the short term, we have to lower these \nprices and get relief to the farmers and the truckers, the small \nbusinesses, the hard-working families. In the long term, what is \nrequired is nothing short of an energy revolution. But there is no way \nfor us to do that energy revolution unless we have the political will \nto begin acting now.\n  I believe this debate is too important to be sidetracked by slogans \nor proposals such as opening our coastal waters to drilling. So if the \nquestion is, as it should be, what can we do to help lower gas prices \nright now, drilling is the wrong answer. It will do nothing right now. \nIt is literally a shell game or an ExxonMobil game. It is designed to \nserve the political interests of vulnerable Republicans and the \nfinancial interests of profit-rich oil companies. Average Americans \nwill not see a dime. That is not just my opinion. The Bush \nadministration's own study found that drilling would not have an impact \nfor more than 20 years, and in 20 years, the impact on prices will be \ninsignificant.\n  If the question is, as it should be, what can we do as a nation to \nend our dependence on foreign oil and begin to harness clean, renewable \nenergy, drilling is the wrong answer again. Even if we drill for oil \noff our east and west coasts, the most oil we could generate, when the \nrigs come online in the year 2030, is 200,000 barrels a day. We import \n12.4 million barrels a day; 200,000 barrels is barely a drop in that \nbarrel.\n  I heard one of my colleagues, the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, speaking on the floor earlier today, say that 200,000 barrels \na day could be achieved right now by increasing the pressure in the \ntires of the cars and the trucks we drive.\n  So what are the answers? First, how do we help reduce gas prices \nright now? That is what my folks are asking me. They want relief now, \nnot next year or in 30 years but now.\n  I believe we can lower gas prices in the very near term by taking \nsmart,\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\npractical, sensible steps to address rampant oil speculation. We have \nall heard recent testimony from financial experts, oil industry \nexecutives, the airline industry, consumer advocates--virtually \neveryone has said that speculation in oil futures is driving up prices \nbeyond what supply and demand justifies. Some experts believe \nspeculation accounts for as much as 50 percent of the current price of \noil. Others argue it is less. But many experts still agree it is having \na significant impact.\n  I recognize there are companies that use oil and need to use futures \nmarkets to hedge against price spikes. All of us in this Chamber \nbelieve in free and open markets. But when speculation is allowed to \nrun roughshod over the economy, with little oversight and even less \ntransparency, when backroom deals line the pockets of speculators while \nsending gas prices soaring, literally taking money out of the pockets \nof consumers, then we have to do something. We have to ensure that our \nmarkets are honest, open, fair, transparent, and accountable. That is \nwhy I support granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission greater \nauthority to regulate trading in these markets.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to join in this effort. We could pass \na bill tomorrow and have it on the President's desk before the recess \nthat would immediately give agency watchdogs new tools to crack down on \nunfair, unbridled, unregulated speculation.\n  While we are relieving pressures on the markets as a whole, we need \nto target relief directly to people who are struggling. I am proud to \nsupport $2.5 billion in energy relief to low-income families in New \nYork and across America. It is shameful that after all the hand-\nwringing about gas prices and energy prices, Republicans in the Senate \nblocked this bill last week. We need to move ahead with this \nlegislation, and I hope we will do so before the August recess.\n  Second--and this question is tougher--how do we break the bonds of \nthe fossil fuel economy? I believe America will and it must embrace \nthis historic challenge because it is a historic opportunity. We can \ncreate at least 5 million new jobs, green jobs, we can tackle climate \nchange, and we can end our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Last year, we passed landmark legislation to increase fuel economy \nstandards for the first time in 30 years. That will save millions of \nbarrels of oil a day. It is an important step forward, but what we need \nis a giant leap.\n  I have proposed a $50 billion strategic energy fund paid for by \neliminating tax breaks for the oil companies and making sure they pay \ntheir fair share for drilling on public lands. The fund could be used \nto support the deployment of wind, solar, geothermal, biofuels, and \nother clean energy technologies available right now. The fund would \ninvest in new ideas and new research to encourage our best and \nbrightest to think outside the box and outside the tanks.\n\n  But that is just the beginning. Let's create the right tax incentives \nto promote renewable sources of electricity production. That is \nsomething on which Al Gore and T. Boone Pickens agree. If that is not \nconsensus, I don't know what is.\n  Unfortunately, Republican opposition in the Senate prevented the \npassage of energy tax reform, and the American economy is paying the \nprice. One study found that blocking these kinds of tax incentives will \ncost 116,000 U.S. jobs and nearly $19 billion in U.S. investment in 1 \nyear alone, while we fall further and further behind in the race to \nlead the world in clean energy technologies.\n  Let's accelerate the development and deployment of plug-in hybrid \nvehicles by investing in research and consumer tax credits. Electricity \nis generated nearly 100 percent from domestic sources, and we have \nenormous untapped renewable resources we can use to create electricity \nwithout contributing to climate change. A recent study showed that a \nvehicle powered by electricity releases one-third less global warming \npollution into the environment than a gas-powered vehicle even if the \nelectricity comes from mostly coal-fired powerplants. This will save \nthe American people money. According to one estimate, to travel as far \nas you would on $4-a-gallon gas, you only need $1 of electricity, and \nthat is a bargain.\n  We don't need to create a whole new infrastructure the way we would \nfor natural gas or hydrogen. A recent study by the Pacific Northwest \nNational Laboratory found that 70 percent of the 220 million cars, \nlight trucks, SUVs, and vans on the road today could be run on power \ndrawn from existing powerplants and grids. This is an important point. \nDrilling may produce 200,000 barrels of oil each day at most in 2030, \nbut if we used electricity to power our passenger cars by moving toward \nplug-in vehicles, we would save 6.5 million barrels of oil every single \nday, fully half of our oil imports. So let's move toward a stronger, \nsmarter, more flexible electricity grid that increasingly relies on \nwind, solar, and other renewables, while employing smart-grid \ntechnology to reduce peak demand and conserve energy.\n  These are solutions that will work. They are solutions that embrace \nthe challenge instead of ignoring it or postponing it, solutions that \nharness our creativity and talent that have the potential of creating 5 \nmillion new, good green-collar jobs. It is the calling of our time. It \nis, as one of my colleagues and friend on the other side said, the Moon \nshot. There isn't anything we can't do if we make our mind up to do it. \nThat is who we are. We are Americans. We solve problems. So enough of \nthe fatalism and the defeatism and more of that can-do spirit to tackle \nthis problem.\n  We know President Bush and Vice President Cheney have a different \napproach. The oil companies say drill, and the President and the Vice \nPresident say, how deep? I don't think that is the smartest, most \neffective answer, and I hope we will be able to work out a way forward \nbetween our two sides.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side have a very strong view, as we \ndo, but the American people are depending on us to choose a different \ncourse.\n  So let's cut through all of the talk, let's cut to the chase, let's \ntry to cut out the politics, and let's take those bold steps that will \nrelieve pressure now on gas prices at the pump and oil prices in the \nopen market, and let's lead our Nation to embrace the great next \nAmerican endeavor--a national effort to change the way we produce and \nuse energy. It will serve our economy, it will strengthen our security, \nand it will bring us together as a Nation. And we sorely need that.\n  I look forward to working with my friends on the other side to come \nup with solutions that will actually work now. Give us the opportunity \nto make it clear to the American people we can act, we can see results, \nand we can move forward together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, when I first ran for the Senate in 1996, \nmy position was that we needed to have a broad-based supply of energy \nfor the State of Colorado and that Colorado had the resources and the \ntechnology which could help contribute to the energy needs of this \ncountry. I said that because we have lots of renewable energy and we \nhave lots of natural resources.\n  NREL, a Federal research laboratory located in Golden, CO, does \nsplendid work and it is their sole purpose to move the technology and \nthe science of renewable energy to the marketplace. In addition, they \ndid some basic research. We also have universities in the State of \nColorado that have contributed a lot to helping develop the technology \nwe use in renewable energy.\n  We look at the resource side in the State of Colorado. We have \nabundant sources of wind. There is a wind area that goes through the \ncentral part of the United States, down through Montana, Wyoming, \nColorado, and hits parts of Nebraska and Oklahoma, then goes into \nTexas. We are known for that resource. Coloradans have been willing to \nutilize wind energy, and we see now wind generators developing and \ngrowing throughout the State of Colorado.\n  Our tourist boards brag about the fact that 97 percent of the days we \nhave in the State of Colorado you can see the Sun. So we have lots of \nsun in the State of Colorado. We have it at a higher altitude. It means \nyou can have some pretty efficient solar panels. I was one of the first \nones to use the new technology. We have had passive solar, but now we \nhave the more active solar, which is the solar panel.\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n  In Colorado, we have opportunity for biofuels. Agriculture is a \nstrong part of our economy in the State of Colorado.\n  We have geothermal. We have parts of the State of Colorado that \nprovide an opportunity to use the ground to heat or to even cool your \nhome or your business.\n  I know the environmental community doesn't like to recognize this \nrenewable source, but we have hydroelectric dams in Colorado because of \nour altitude and the steep drop we get through our streams. It is a \nvery practical source of energy within the State.\n  In addition to that, we have a rich source of natural resources that \ncome out of the ground. Obviously, there is oil and gas in the solid \nand liquid form. We have an abundant source of natural gas along the \nwestern slope of Colorado--probably one of the largest reserves of \nnatural gas in the world. And today we have many oil and gas companies \nthat are very active in the western part of Colorado to provide this \nvaluable resource.\n  We are a good source of uranium. So if we go to nuclear power, \nColorado is going to play a role in that.\n  We have coal. But it is not just plain coal, it is clean coal. It is \ncoal that frequently gets sold to communities in the East, which have \nsoft coal, which tends to be more polluting. So they come to buy \nColorado and Wyoming coal because it is hard and it will help them meet \nthe clean air requirements the Congress has passed.\n  We have oil shale, and it is a developing resource we have in the \nState of Colorado. It shows lots of promise. In fact, oil shale at one \ntime was in the State of Colorado but it was promoted purely by the \nFederal Government. Now, without taxpayer dollars going into it, the \nindustry said: Look, there is enough opportunity in oil shale that we \nare going to put in our resources. So we have companies in Colorado \nthat are putting in millions and millions of their own resources to \ndevelop this particular source of energy in the State of Colorado.\n  Of course, I have always felt that conservation was a viable solution \nthat everybody should look at, and Colorado is particularly sensitive \nto the need to conserve energy. I was one of the cofounders of the \nRenewable Energy Caucus here in the Senate and have encouraged Members \nto join that and get their staffs involved so we can better understand \nhow to develop renewable energy.\n  My position all along has been that we need to have a broad base of \nenergy not only to meet the needs of my State but to meet the needs of \nthis country. So when we get into this debate, I am flabbergasted that \nwe have Members in the Senate who feel we can only come up with one \nsolution to our energy problems. I think we need to come up with a \nmultitude of solutions for our energy, and that means we shouldn't take \nanything off the table and that all those sources of energy I mentioned \nfrom the State of Colorado are viable resources. We need to be sure we \nmake those resources available in order to meet the needs of this \ncountry in an environmentally sensitive way. And Coloradans, obviously, \ntake a lot of pride in their environment, so these technologies have \nbeen developed in the State of Colorado in a way that has minimal \nimpact on our environment.\n  I was very pleased when the minority leader stood up this evening and \nmentioned that oil shale should be an important part of our \nconsideration when looking for solutions to the energy problems we have \nin this country, where we have $4 a gallon gas at the pump.\n\n  I was struck also by the argument that 20 to 50 percent of our \nproblems with energy is speculation. That is contrary to testimony from \nexperts I have heard in committee. Now, I don't know where those \nexperts came from, but let me tell you about the experts I heard \ntestifying in committee. There was a witness representing the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. They deal with futures markets. They \nregulate the futures markets and they monitor the futures markets for \nthe very thing we are talking about here, which is manipulation of the \nmarkets, and manipulation of the market is a Federal crime. You can go \nto jail for that. So that is part of their mission.\n  We heard from the SEC--the Securities and Exchange Commission--\nexperts from their organization talking about whether there was \nmanipulation of the market. These are the experts we have who monitor \nwhat is going on.\n  We also heard from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  They all agreed on one thing: They did not see any indication in the \nfigures and the facts they had which suggested there was a manipulation \nof the market. They said: Yes, there is speculation, because you have \nto have some degree of speculation for the futures markets to happen \nand for the stock markets, and the Senator from New York made that \npoint in her comments a few minutes ago. But they also said we need to \nmonitor the situation closely, because we don't feel as though we have \ngathered all the facts, and I would agree with that. I think we do need \nto be very concerned in today's market about the possibility of \nmanipulation, but to say it is 20 to 50 percent of the problem? I don't \nbelieve that is going to hold water.\n  Our problem, in my view, is supply. We need to deal with issues where \nwe think we can increase supply. I was pleased the minority leader \nmentioned looking at increasing our supplies from offshore, on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, and from oil shale, and from conservation \nissues, such as electric cars. Also, we need to be sensitive about \nspeculation. These are issues we could bring together a consensus on \nthe Republican side. We have some people who are pushing hard for \nnuclear power and pushing hard for drilling in ANWR, but they didn't \ndevelop a consensus.\n  I am proud to be helping, to be a part of the solution, and I fail to \nsee how the package that has been produced by the Democratic side of \nthe aisle addresses the supply problem. Raising taxes on companies has \nan adverse impact on the market. It doesn't increase supplies. Dealing \nwith things such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has a minimal \nimpact on the total market and the total world supply. It is minimal. \nAfter we had our votes here on the strategic petroleum supply and \neverything, guess what. Prices continued to climb. We weren't able to \nhave any effect on that.\n  Price gouging? Obviously, we need to take a look at that. But one of \nthe things I have noticed that has made a difference is when this \nPresident said: Look, we need to take the moratorium off drilling in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. That action alone by the executive branch \nwas enough to make investors look out in the future and think that \nmaybe the price of oil and gas is going to go down. So now what we have \nbeen seeing since that announcement is the price of oil and gas is \ngoing down.\n  I am here today to actually address some of the myths regarding oil \nshale regulation moratoriums. The very first myth is that oil shale is \na myth. It is not. It is a reality. We have been spending years in the \nState of Colorado developing technologies to be able to, in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way, extract that valuable resource out of \nthe ground. It has incredible potential to help the United States \nduring a time of energy need. Oil shale in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming \ncould yield 800 billion barrels of oil for the global market. Some \nestimates have gone as high as 2 trillion, but we are looking at 8 to a \nlittle over 1 trillion that they think has a legitimate chance of being \nextracted out of the ground, and at a much lower price than we are \ngetting at today's prices on a barrel of oil. That is more than the \nproven reserves of Saudi Arabia and would clearly help drive down \nprices in America.\n  Other countries are developing their oil shale. It can be done in \nAustralia, China, Estonia, and Brazil. All these countries produce oil \nshale. The United States is behind these countries because we require \ncleaner, more efficient, and better regulated development. But we are \nprevented from even beginning to plan how we can utilize this resource \nby stopping the regulation process dead in its tracks.\n  Despite attempts to assign motives, proponents of oil shale do not \nsee it as a quick fix. I fully understand we are at the beginning \nstages in the process of utilizing and benefiting from our oil shale \nreserves. But I must point out that we won't even be able to use our \n800 billion barrels of oil potential as a slow fix if we don't get \nstarted, and we need to get started now.\n  Since December of last year, the Department of the Interior has been \nprevented by Congress from even issuing the proposed regulations under \nwhich\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\noil shale development could eventually move forward. Instigators of \nthis prohibition want to continue the delay for another year at least.\n  We have heard claims that the Department is under a frenzied rush to \norganize a fire sale of development leases. I think it is ridiculous to \nconsider the multiyear oil shale effort as frenzied. The recent efforts \nstarted in 2004, and included congressional debate and passage of the \n2005 Energy Act, years of planning and years of studies, research and \ndevelopment, and a draft environmental impact statement issued last \nDecember. This has not been a frenzied rush and there hasn't been any \nattempt to organize a fire sale.\n  When attempting to sensationalize this process, opponents never make \nit clear we are simply trying to lay the groundwork on how to offer \nthis resource for development. When those who are trying to stop oil \nshale say we are not ready to move forward with commercial oil shale \nleasing, and point out that Chevron believes a full-scale commercial \nleasing program should not proceed, I have to say: True, and completely \nirrelevant. In that vein, I heard my friend and colleague from Colorado \nearlier today read excerpts from the BLM draft oil shale regulation \nreport. Quote after quote seemed to suggest that oil shale requires \nmore work, but he did not mention that we aren't even trying to lease \nyet.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, a former Member of this body, said \nthis week it would be 2015 before we have a full-scale production. \nAssistant Secretary Allred said this week that ``commercial development \nof oil shale will not begin until technologically viable.''\n\n  So the point is we need to have the rules and regulations to get \nstarted. Then we can phase in for the development phase. But right now \nwe have stopped everything dead in its tracks. You can't even move \nforward because of the current policies of this Congress. The fact is \nthe moratorium is, at this point, stopping the way forward whereby \nindustry, local officials, affected communities, and the world market \nwould assess and prepare for the upcoming development of this massive \nresource.\n  We are not proposing a full-scale leasing program for this year or \nthis decade. We are not there yet, and the moratorium is not stopping a \nfull-scale commercial leasing program. The reality is it has stopped an \nadministrative process that will allow us to see how our energy \nresources can be best utilized.\n  Before I finish here, I feel I must point out how strange it is that \ndeveloping regulations for oil shale, a technology we have been \nexploring for decades, can be labeled as unproven and harmful by many \nof the same people who supported the absurdly complicated, wholly \nbureaucratic scheme of cap and trade for greenhouse gas emissions. This \nstraitjacket on the entire U.S. economy would cost billions and \nbillions of dollars and had no workable examples, antecedents, or \nprecedents. Yet allowing western land managers to move forward with the \nregulations for how to utilize oil shale is too dangerous?\n  Let me relate to my friends here on the floor an experience I had in \nthe Interior Committee as the top Republican. I worked with the \nchairman of the Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations. We had a bill \nput forward and we worked out our differences. It was ready to go--it \nwas yesterday. Then after our meeting, 4 or 5 hours later, maybe 3 \nhours later, I was notified that we were not going to have any more \nappropriations this year.\n\n  It was not Republicans who were stopping the process in the \ncommittee. It was not the Republicans on the House side who stopped the \nprocess over there when they tried to propose amendments in their \nAppropriations Committee to provide more supply.\n  This issue needs to come to the floor. We need to have open debate. \nWe need to have an opportunity to produce amendments to support supply. \nIt is not Republicans who are stopping the process. I can tell you from \npersonal experience as an appropriator that it was not Republicans who \nstopped that process in committee. That was a directive that came down \nfrom higher up.\n  I have to say here that what I see happening on the floor today is \nnothing more than an attempt to confuse the issue, to confuse the \nlisteners to this debate as to how important supply is to the welfare \nof this country. I think we need to drill more and we need to use less. \nThat would have been reflected in the Republican package of amendments \nwe talked about.\n  I encourage the Democratic leadership on the floor to rethink their \ncurrent policies because I think the American people want to see us \nmove forward. They want to see us put partisanship aside. They want to \nsee something done about what they are paying at the gas pump. They are \nfeeling the pain at $4 a gallon.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for granting me an opportunity to spout \nhere on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, on July 20, 1974, Turkish forces invaded \nCyprus. The hostilities that followed led to great destruction of life \nand property. Today, 34 years later, we pause to mourn those who lost \ntheir lives.\n  Sadly, thousands of Turkish troops are still in Cyprus. The island \nremains divided, with significant distrust between the two sides.\n  Since 1974, U.N. peacekeeping forces have had to maintain a buffer \nzone between the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots \nin the south.\n  But today we have renewed hope for a solution to the Cyprus problem. \nThe new peace process underway there offers the brightest opportunity \nwe have had in many years to reunite the island.\n  The election of the Greek Cypriot leader Christofias in February \nhelped usher in a new era of opportunity.\n  Along with his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Talat, the two sides are \nmaking progress to help the United Nations-led negotiations on the \nfuture of Cyprus succeed.\n  I commend both leaders for showing the political will needed to set \nthe stage for a resolution.\n  The leaders met for the first time on March 21 of this year. Soon \nafter, in a demonstration of goodwill on both sides, they agreed to \nopen a new crossing at Ledra Street in Nicosia.\n  The leaders are working together to develop a timeline for future \nnegotiations, including another meeting this Friday, on July 25. I urge \nboth parties to demonstrate their commitment to peace negotiations at \nthat time.\n  I hope the United Nations will continue to play a constructive role \nin supporting the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders as they find a way \nforward.\n  Cyprus's goal is to reunify the island as a bicommunal, bizonal \nfederation. Resolution of the Cyprus problem would untie so many other \nknots, with implications for Europe and beyond. I encourage both sides \nto use this moment of opportunity, and continue their important work \nwith the United Nations, to achieve this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7140-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7140-S7141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOURTH OF JULY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court \ncarefully crafted the Roe v. Wade decision to serve as the balanced \nfoundation on which the reproductive rights of women could rest. Now, \nin 2008, the Bush administration is making a late-stage power grab \nbased on a foundation of flawed ideology.\n  A flawed ideology that has the potential to harm millions of American \nwomen.\n  Today, I join many of my colleagues in telling this administration \nthat their ideology has no place in the health care system that \nAmerican women depend upon.\n  Last week, it came to my attention that the Department of Health and \nHuman Services is circulating a draft regulation that would jeopardize \nthe reproductive health of women and their fundamental freedom of \nchoice.\n  Studies show that the use of family planning reduces the probability \nof a woman having an abortion by 85 percent. But this rule could \nseverely limit a woman's access to these family planning resources by \nadopting an alarmingly broad definition for the term ``abortion.''\n  This definition would allow health care professionals to classify \ncontraceptives like birth control pills, intra-uterine devices, IUDs, \nand emergency contraceptives as ``abortions.'' Based on this \nclassification, health care professions could refuse access for women \nwho need these resources.\n  As such, this proposal would greatly increase the chances of women \nencountering hospital and clinic staff who would prevent them from \nreceiving the information they need to make thoughtful, personal \ndecisions about their health, and may even refuse to write \nprescriptions for basic birth control.\n  Fundamentally, this Bush administration proposal undermines \neverything we have worked to achieve in the last 35 years.\n  It could endanger access to birth control and upend the federal title \nX family planning program. In 2006 alone, title X provided family \nplanning services to approximately 5 million women and men through a \nnetwork of more than 4,400 community-based clinics.\n  It could endanger State laws and regulations like the one in my State \nthat require equitable coverage for contraceptives under insurance \nplans that cover other prescriptions.\n  And it could even endanger a sexual assault or rape victim's access \nto emergency contraception in a hospital emergency room. An \nunimaginable thought for the millions of American women every year who \nturn to emergency contraceptives following a traumatic event in their \nlives.\n  Seventy-six percent of voters strongly support doing everything we \ncan to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies through commonsense \nmeasures.\n  This is an assault on a common goal of preventing unintended \npregnancies and reducing the number of abortions in this country.\n  And it is unacceptable.\n  For the millions of women across this Nation, I strongly urge this \nadministration to reconsider their stance and put reproductive health \nabove partisan politics and ideology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7141-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7141-S7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERAN VOTING SUPPORT ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced Senate bill S. \n3308, the Veteran Voting Support Act of 2008, with Senator Kerry, and \nour cosponsors: Senators Reid, Obama, Schumer, Leahy, Clinton, Murray \nand Wyden.\n  This is a simple, straightforward bill that shows our veterans the \nrespect that they deserve. They have supported our nation, some at \ngreat risk and sacrifice. If the government is providing services, \nveterans should receive every opportunity to voice their vote.\n  More than a year ago, I learned of a controversy that emerged in \nCalifornia--where the Department of Veterans Affairs had been fighting \nsince 2004 to bar voter registration services at a VA facility. Over \nthe last 16 months, we have tried to encourage the VA to establish a \nfair, nonpartisan, standard policy that provides the best available \nsupport to veterans served by VA facilities.\n  The answers I received from the VA have been conflicting. First, the \nVA stated that they considered the possibility of following the \nNational Voter Registration Act--but then determined it would be too \ncostly. Given the only resources needed is a photocopy of a voter \nregistration form, I find that hard to believe.\n  Then this year, Senator Kerry and I had exchanged multiple letters on \nthis issue with the VA. The response then changed. VA officials \nasserted that they believed that providing support or allowing groups \nwould violate the Hatch Act.\n  The Hatch Act is a prohibition of partisan political activities \nconducted by Federal employees, on official time. It has not been \ninterpreted to include nonpartisan voter registration by the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, which interprets the Hatch Act. Furthermore, the \nveterans served by VA facilities are generally not Federal employees.\n  The VA then argued that nonpartisan voter registration services would \ncause ``disruptions to facility operations.''\n  That claim is even more dubious. Unless ``Rock the Vote'' comes to VA \nfacilities, voter registration drives are about as tame an activity as \nyou can get.\n  The circumstances in this situation raise great concern. Our country \nfaces issues of war and peace, challenges in foreign relations, and \nserious questions as to the treatment of our veteran population.\n  The most recent Census data we have--from a 2005 report--indicates \nthat more than 20 percent of our veterans are not registered to vote. \nThat means that almost 5 million veterans do not have an opportunity to \ncast their ballots.\n  The VA runs a massive program to assist our veterans to heal, as well \nas ensure that they thrive on their return from military service.\n  This is true whether the veteran is recently discharged for tours in \nIraq, or served in World War II.\n  A recent report characterized the VA's services as including ``a \n'safety net' for the many lower-income veterans who have come to depend \non it.''\n  The question has emerged: Will this make the right kind of impact? \nWill this cause more veterans to be registered? The VA serves large \nnumbers of veterans--in a variety of care facilities.\n  For example, the Veterans Health Administration operates 155 medical \ncenters, 135 nursing homes, 717 ambulatory care and clinic facilities; \n45 residential rehabilitation treatment programs, and 209 vet centers.\n  In total, there are 1,261 total facilities; where as many as 5 \nmillion veterans who are not registered to vote may use each year. That \nstrikes me as a critical need unmet.\n  And it is a rational step for the government to make.\n  The National Voter Registration Act requires at least as much--if not \nmore--from the States. Every State social service agency and motor \nvehicle agency is required to assist persons who use their agencies.\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\n  That is a mandate from the Federal Government to the States to \nregister voters.\n  In the law, the Federal Government may choose to assist people to \nregister to vote if the State requests NVRA designation and the agency \naccepts.\n  Immediately after the legislation was passed, then-President Clinton \nissued Executive Order 12926--which has not been rescinded by the \ncurrent administration. That Executive order calls on all Federal \nagencies, ``to the greatest extent practicable'' to provide both voter \nregistration information, and voter registration forms.\n  Some might claim that this legislation is premature--that under the \nscheme of the act, the State must request the Federal Government's \ninvolvement. Well, that has already occurred.\n  Several States, including my home State of California, under the \nleadership of Secretary Bowen, have asked that the VA designate the \nfacilities within their States.\n  All three have been refused by this Department.\n  Ten secretaries of State--from both parties--have requested that the \nVA reverse its directive. Still no change.\n  In the case of Connecticut, secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz defied \nthe VA's directive and attempted to gain entry to the West Haven VA \nfacility.\n  There, she intended on providing nonpartisan voter registration \nservices, as well as showing veterans how to use the new disabled-\naccess voting systems.\n  Guess what. She was turned away at the door because of this new \ndirective.\n  As she was standing outside the door to the VA facility, she met a \n91-year-old gentleman, a veteran of World War II. Secretary Bysiewicz \nasked him if he would like to be registered to vote, and he said that \nhe would.\n  After registering, he made the comment that ``I wanted to do this \nlast year--but there was no-one there to help me.'' That is wholly \nunacceptable.\n  When we hear of why so many veterans express pride in their service \nand their sacrifice, we hear the phrase ``protecting the American way \nof life'' again and again.\n  At the cornerstone of our democracy is that every eligible citizen \nshould be registered and receive their chance to cast their vote.\n  After many months of trying to work out a meaningful solution with \nthe Department, I believe it is time the VA provides veterans the \nsupport they deserve to register, cast their vote, and have that vote \ncounted.\n  This is why we are introduced the Veteran Voting Support Act of 2008. \nThis legislation would: Require the VA to make voter registration \nservices available at VA facilities in states that request it, in \naccordance with the National Voter Registration Act. These services \ninclude voter registration forms, answers to questions on registration \nissues and assistance with submitting voter registration forms. Those \nservices are available to veterans using VA facilities.\n  Require the VA to assist veterans at facilities to receive and fill \nout absentee ballots if they choose to vote by absentee.\n  Allow nonpartisan groups and election officials to provide \nnonpartisan voter information and registration services to veterans.\n  Require an annual report to Congress from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs on progress related to this legislation.\n  I hope that my colleagues are willing to support this effort to \nreverse an overly bureaucratic and irrational burden at the VA.\n  Passage of this bill would recognize the long history in our country \nof nonpartisan and civil rights groups that have helped register those \nwho have the greatest need for assistance.\n  And it respects election officials have long worked to register all \neligible voters and provide them with the information and tools to cast \na ballot.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in supporting S. 3308, the Veterans \nVoting Support Act of 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7142-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERANS PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, technology continues to affect both the \nstrengths and the vulnerabilities of Government. Advances over the past \ndecades in computer technology have enabled us to generate and access \nunprecedented amounts of data, and make information easily accessible \nto citizens as well as Government employees seeking to assist them. \nTechnology allows information to travel from one coast to the other in \nthe blink of an eye, offering the possibility that as technology \nimproves so will the efficiency of Government.\n  Unfortunately, the possibilities of the information age include an \nincreased risk of data theft.

As we \nlearned in 2006 with the theft of a Department of Veterans Affairs' \nlaptop, which put into question the security of the personal \ninformation of 26.5 million veterans, neither Government Departments \nnor the people who rely on them are immune to these new and changing \nrisks.\n  In response to the VA computer theft, I, along with a number of my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House, requested the Government \nAccountability Office to conduct a study to determine whether existing \nprivacy laws and guidance were adequate to protect the Federal \nGovernment's collection and use of personal information. Last month, \nGAO reported back to Congress, and recommended we consider revising \nexisting Federal privacy laws. Following a June 18, 2008, Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on this \nand other matters related to privacy security, I joined committee \nChairman Joe Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins in calling for \nchanges to modernize the Privacy Act.\n  The Privacy Act of 1974 is the foundation of the Federal Government's \nprivacy protection law. While this act provides a worthwhile basis for \nthe protection of privacy, it was written in a different time when the \nGovernment faced different challenges. Mr. President, 1974 does not \nseem that long ago, but it was well before the emergence of many \ncomputer technologies that have changed the demands of data security. \nAt that time, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were unknown, Apple and \nMicrosoft were little more than ideas, and neither laptops nor the \nInternet were part of the common American experience. The technological \nchanges that have occurred since 1974, while bringing new \nopportunities, have also brought new challenges to the security of our \nprivacy and safety of the personal information that is kept by the \nFederal Government. As technology changes, we need to continue to adapt \nthe framework of Federal data security laws, as we began to do in 2002 \nwith the E-Government Act.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I know the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs still has a long way to go towards \nestablishing and securing the personal information of veterans. VA and \nseveral other Departments received an ``F'' on this year's Federal \nInformation Security Management Act--FISMA--report card. I do not doubt \nthat VA recognizes this is a problem, and I am pleased by the \nDepartment's recent move to streamline its information technology \nmanagement structure. Still, good intentions provide little comfort or \nsecurity to a veteran whose identity is potentially placed at risk \nbecause VA failed to put adequate policies and procedures in place to \nprotect personal information. I expect VA to rapidly take the steps \nnecessary to achieve a passing FISMA grade, so that veterans can have \nconfidence in the Department's ability to protect their personal \ninformation. Technology should serve its intended purpose of helping, \nnot harming, those who rely on the efficiencies it provides. I also \nlook forward to Congress taking action to create privacy laws which \nmeet the demands of 21st century technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7142-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7142-S7143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          60TH ANNIVERSARY OF INTEGRATION OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we recognize the 60th anniversary of \none of the momentous steps forward for equality of opportunity in our \nNation's history. On July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman, signed \nExecutive Order 9981. That order read, in part:\n\n     there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all \n     persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, \n     religion or national origin.\n\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\n\n  While equality, as a concept, is deeply rooted in our Nation's \nfounding, equality in practice was exceedingly rare in our Nation's \narmed services before President Truman's action. His order reversed \nnearly 175 years of discrimination, segregation, and exclusion from the \narmed services based on race, dating back to the Continental Army \nduring the Revolutionary War.\n  The order benefited the armed services as well as the countless men \nand women--of all races--who have subsequently served in integrated \nunits. Further, the diversity of our servicemembers has contributed to \nits being the most capable, strongest military force that the world has \never known.\n  In an amici brief for the U.S. Supreme Court, former officers of the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps as well as civilian leaders and \nformer Secretaries of Defense agreed that integration of the military \nwas the result of ``a principled recognition that segregation is unjust \nand incompatible with American values,'' and further that the \nmilitary's ``efficient, effective deployment required integration.''\n  While we all appreciate President Truman's action today, appreciation \nwas not always widespread. The integration order was met with criticism \nfrom many who were accustomed to segregation. And, as 1948 was an \nelection year--Truman's first, after he succeeded President Roosevelt \nmany felt that Truman was all but giving away the election by \nfracturing his party. The doubters and critics make Truman's \nsteadfastness all the more noteworthy.\n  In the decades that followed 1948, the civil rights movement pushed \nthe entire Nation to make enormous strides towards ending segregation \nand integrating everything from schools to neighborhoods.\n  From the Emancipation Proclamation, to the integration of the armed \nservices, to Brown v. Board of Education, to the Civil Rights Acts, \nprogress towards racial equality in America has marched forward \nunceasingly. The integration of the armed services was one of the \nenormous and critical steps in that march.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7143-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7143-S7145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, In mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent that today's letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for your excellent newsletter and for listening \n     to your constituency. My story is as follows: We live in \n     Horseshoe Bend and I commute to Boise every day (M-F) for \n     work. We have a large family, and my wife constantly has a \n     need to take our van in to Boise for various family needs--\n     medical, sports, clothing, etc. My income has not kept up \n     with the rising gas prices, and it has made things very \n     difficult. I cannot get my work to let me telecommute; I have \n     chosen to drive a practical car, as economical as possible \n     (Toyota Corolla). My wife has tried to cut back her trips to \n     town to one or two days a week. This has often resulted in no \n     groceries in the house until she can make a run, or I can run \n     after work and miss family time at night. My oldest son, who \n     just turned 18, has started working in Boise the past few \n     months and, since he cannot afford the gas back and forth, \n     has been staying with friends as much as possible, which has \n     been stressful to both my wife and I, but having a job is \n     important to him. Even with all of our cutting back, our \n     family has to cough up about $400/month just for fuel and the \n     costs keep going up. We want Congress to quickly move to \n     begin developing our own fuel sources within the U.S., as \n     well as find ways to make alternative sources (like solar, \n     etc.) much more affordable for households to implement into \n     our lifestyles.\n       Thanks for listening!\n     Jonathan, Horseshoe Bend.\n                                  ____\n\n       We (my wife and I) are probably some of the fortunate few \n     that had the ability, even though we will be paying for it \n     for years) to convert from ``oil'' heat to natural gas with a \n     heat pump. This cost came at a very large price. We had been \n     helping our son, an honors student, with his college at \n     Eastern Washington, and now cannot do that due to having the \n     above mentioned bill to pay in addition to trying to stay \n     above selling out our home due to ever increasing costs that \n     a couple on retirement (I am a retired agent law enforcement, \n     25 year career) just cannot afford.\n       [We ask that Congress] get a grip on this problem. I, for \n     one, do not believe that this was just an unfortunate set of \n     circumstances, [as it seems that businesses with oil \n     interests are benefitting tremendously from the profits these \n     high prices have created.]\n     Dennis and Sandy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your interest in the thoughts from Idaho \n     citizens about the high fuel costs. I think that if a person \n     is still breathing, they are being affected by these price \n     increases. In our own family, we have made every effort to \n     cut down on our driving and making sure we combine our \n     activities to conserve. Maybe these are things we should have \n     been doing all along and I hope we continue to do. This year \n     we have decided to not take a family vacation because of the \n     high costs associated with traveling with a large family and \n     having to drive a large vehicle to accommodate all eight of \n     us. We also love to waterski and were planning on buying a \n     new boat; however, that, too, has been put on hold because it \n     would be too expensive to use it enough to warrant the \n     purchase price.\n       I see the biggest concern in our family with our two oldest \n     children who are raised and on their own. One has graduated \n     with a Master's degree in business and has chosen a teaching \n     profession, but she can barely make ends meet as it is. Now, \n     with the cost of fuel, she may lose her small, modest home or \n     be forced to take on a roommate in order to make up the \n     difference in the gas prices. Our other adult child is \n     working full time and going to school part time because he \n     needs the extra income to pay for fuel. This is affecting my \n     husband and me; however, I see it affecting the next \n     generation even more. The high cost of housing combined with \n     the high fuel costs and grocery costs is making it impossible \n     for many of them to just get by, let alone put any money away \n     in savings.\n       I wish I had all the answers, but I do not. I am trusting \n     in good people like you that I have voted for to help us as a \n     nation get back on our feet. Thank you for all you do. Please \n     keep listening to the citizens of Idaho. I know if we work \n     together then we can make positive changes for all of our \n     futures.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jackie, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not have a story to share. I just want to let you know \n     that I think increased drilling and refining should be down \n     the priority list. That is living in the past and pretending \n     the future will be different. It will not. In order to \n     protect the air that supports us, we should ride the horses \n     of alternative energy, efficiency, conservation and nuclear \n     energy.\n           Thank you,\n     Roger, Hailey.\n                                  ____\n\n       Higher fuel costs equate to higher food and material costs \n     which translate to a smaller disposable income for everyone. \n     It is like we all took a big cut in pay! I do not want our \n     country to end up as a gilded ``third-world'' nation with \n     meaningless currency. There is a person out there who made an \n     important clip on YouTube that every American should see: \n     YouTube--Joe, American Challenges the Presidential \n     Candidates--as this individual makes some valid points and \n     offers some course of solution to deal with our oil \n     dependency on countries who do not really like us except for \n     our money. Please watch it. Thanks.\n     Howard.\n                                  ____\n\n       I personally am appalled at the prices and how steadily \n     they have risen. I understand that there are some things such \n     as inflation and supply and demand; yet, what the oil \n     industry is doing falls under neither category. It, instead, \n     is falling under the category of monopoly, which I feel the \n     government has yet to do anything about. A few things I would \n     like to see in honest:\n       (1) Either for the government to stop subsidizing crude oil \n     and gasoline, and/or for a ceiling to be put upon profits \n     brought in. They claim, noting again, that it is supply and \n     demand, as well as problems in the Middle East. Only \n     approximately 20%, in a recent study, of our oil usage comes \n     from there, anyway. So why are the prices so high?\n       (2) Stop the push for attempts at subsidizing and pushing \n     for nuclear energies as there is an overwhelming stance \n     against them and you will never be able to pass anything soon \n     enough to fix the problem at hand. Also, in this category, I \n     feel that it is a pointless endeavor as there is no place to \n     place the waste [other than on site, and the citizens of \n     Idaho, and other states, will not stand for mere on-site \n     storage]. Yucca Mountain has no chance of opening in any \n     point in the near future [even if possible, it is already \n     filled over capacity from open plants at the\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\n     moment]; therefore it would have to be on-site.\n       [Both of the aforementioned are a waste of taxpayer dollars \n     to subsidize and make pushes for. Instead of spending \n     billions of dollars on a failing industry and something that \n     is not going to last much longer, and one where so much has \n     to be spent between construction, security, and pro-\n     nuclear advertisements, I propose the following.]\n       (3) Invest in ever-growing renewable energy sources. There \n     are many other players in this field that we can look to for \n     examples, as they have found and harnessed extraordinary \n     means that can provide for their base load energy needs. The \n     amount of money that the government has spent on renewable \n     energy pales drastically in contrast to the amount that is \n     spent needlessly in a failing industry. If that same amount \n     of money were to be applied to another for even but a year, \n     you could expect even greater leaps and bounds in production \n     and energy output. As conservative as Idaho is I propose that \n     WE as a state pursue this choice. Yes I understand that in \n     doing so Congress fears that it will lose backing from INL \n     and other proposed plants within the state, not to mention \n     the taxes that are brought in by such industry. Yet at the \n     same time with as much as we have to give them in tax breaks \n     and subsidies just as incentives places it on par with those \n     of renewable energies, as those would be eager to establish \n     and maintain plants without such things [therefore receiving \n     full taxes from those companies].\n       I appreciate your efforts to ask the opinions of the \n     citizens of this great state, and I hope and pray that you, \n     as well as the rest of Congress, heed them. Thank you for \n     your time and service.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       [I am very frustrated as it seems that Congress does not \n     solve the problems that confront our country. We need new \n     leadership.]\n     Roy.\n                                  ____\n\n       The high gasoline prices have prodded me to change my \n     driving habits and, by doing so, have saved on fuel costs. I \n     have done one simple thing. I just slowed down 5 miles per \n     hour. I drive a \\3/4\\-ton pickup truck, and that alone has \n     increased my fuel mileage 8%-12%. I emailed you to suggest \n     that you introduce a bill in the Senate to lower the speed \n     limit on all interstate highways, just like what was done in \n     the 70s. That alone would decrease gasoline usage \n     substantially.\n       Thank you for your ear.\n     Bob.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have had to dedicate 15% more of my budget to fuel costs \n     [for my commute to McCall]. I try to carpool in the months \n     where my schedule allows it. I work in fire dispatch on the \n     Payette National Forest, and most days from April to October, \n     I do not know when I am going home.\n       My deep belief is that digging for more oil is putting a \n     ``band-aid on a crack in the dam.'' Digging for more oil, \n     especially in the ANWR area, is horrific and not worth the \n     long-term damage that will be done for such a short-term \n     solution. I think the fuel cell technology is a very \n     promising route to put into research and development. There \n     are some stations in California that are wind and solar \n     powered. As I understand it, the more people using it, the \n     cheaper it gets. What would REALLY be ideal is to get a \n     converter for gasoline cars to switch to the fuel cell \n     technology.\n       Thanks for your time and caring about what I think!\n     Coral, New Meadows.\n                                  ____\n\n       I received your e-mail about the costs of energy going up \n     and up. I see that conversation is now a priority. I remember \n     when this administration laughed at the idea. Maybe you could \n     tell us what percentage of the oil from Alaska goes overseas. \n     Also, how much refined gas and diesel are shipped overseas \n     where the cost and profit are much greater. In all your years \n     in the Senate, what types of alternate energy other than \n     ethanol have you supported? Everything I read leads me to \n     believe than making corn-based ethanol uses about as much \n     energy as is produced. There are other crops (such as sugar \n     cane) and weeds that are much more energy-efficient to \n     produce. [Why has Congress only focused on mandates for] \n     corn-based ethanol?\n       Thank you for any response.\n     Steve.\n                                  ____\n\n       We own a small excavation business. We give our 22 \n     employees paid vacation, medical insurance, and six paid \n     holidays just to keep those good, trained employees, that we \n     have been employing, most we have had for 12-27 years. Our \n     industry in Boise right now is as close to the bottom of the \n     barrel as we have seen in 30 years in business. We have had \n     years where we struggled to keep those good employees and \n     keep them working to support their families. But when fuel \n     and heating costs are going out of control, skyrocketing as \n     they are, we are second guessing whether we can stay doing \n     what we love, and what we are good at. That would, in turn, \n     take away the livelihoods of each and every employee we have \n     and ourselves.\n       I am a woman-owned business, and in Idaho, they've even \n     removed the requirement for large General Contractors to use \n     a certain percentage of DBE or WBE's in their Federally-\n     funded contracts. As of this year, there are no requirements \n     to help the WBE or DBE and now most of the General \n     Contractors are self-performing that work. So we small \n     companies are being hit very hard from all directions. In \n     order to recoup these costs we have had to raise our prices, \n     which, in turn, hurts everyone else and does not help us in \n     the bidding world, either. We have bid 60 projects in the \n     past two months and got two very small jobs, and we have bid \n     many with only a small percentage over our costs. Those \n     receiving the bids are several hundreds and thousands under \n     our costs. This cannot go on much longer before many of us \n     are priced right out of the market and out of business. When \n     you own dump trucks, excavators, backhoes, etc. that use \n     diesel fuel, which happens to be the most expensive, it is \n     staggering. Our fuel costs have tripled over two years.\n       On a personal level, we rethink how and where we go. Both \n     my husband and I have no family here and must drive or fly to \n     visit them. Those trips are cut to one a year and maybe not \n     at all. I personally have always planned where I go to do \n     grocery shopping and plan my trip so I do not backtrack, and \n     use the best routes, utilizing the fuel to the best of my \n     ability. Even though that helps, with prices as they are, it \n     does not put a dent in it.\n       We definitely need help--getting these prices back to a \n     livable level. Those individuals who are retired and on fixed \n     incomes, which I am nearing in the next couple years, are \n     even more critically hit. My parents are in their 80s and \n     struggle all year, as they were born in the years where their \n     Social Security payments are minimal and Congress decided \n     would be too extensive to repair. My mother, who has worked \n     since she graduated from college all those years ago and up \n     until she was 75, receives $300/month in Social Security. \n     [That amount is not enough to live on.] With medicines they \n     absolutely need to survive at their age, they are left with \n     little or no money for fuel in their small budget. It is not \n     only fuel for vehicles, but it is the fuel for our homes and \n     businesses as well. It is also the products we purchase. Pipe \n     is a petroleum product and it is sky high right now. Like I \n     said, it is hitting us from all levels and angles.\n       This is very brief, but I felt I must speak up. If we do \n     not use our voices and sit back and do nothing, no one will \n     hear or understand our plight.\n       Thanks for asking and I hope Congress will listen!\n     Betty, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Forget the sob stories.

I am fortunate to be one of \n     those Idahoans (at least for now) who aren't feeling the \n     pinch of rising energy prices. However, in a democracy, I \n     believe that Americans deserve to have choices besides cars \n     for their transportation needs. And, especially in a time of \n     the increasing peril of climate change, I believe that having \n     access to public transport and promoting conservation are \n     critical in this conjuncture in time. I know that these ideas \n     may not be popular, but if we are going to continue to \n     survive as a species, we need to ask ourselves how much of a \n     sacrifice we are willing to make. I have grown up in Idaho, \n     and have left Idaho, but let me tell you (as I am sure you \n     know), it is a special place, and we need to do all that we \n     can to protect the beauty of this wonderful state.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carissa, McCall.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have a employee driving over 75 miles roundtrip from \n     outside Caldwell, where housing is affordable, to Boise.

Since my days of working with the Gray Panthers in Oregon, \nI have been aware of the special obligation that we have to both our \nyounger and older citizens who are in need of long-term care services. \nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 was a watershed in \nefforts to make life safer and more dignified for individuals living in \nlong-term care institutions.\n  Since 1987, the long-term care industry has continued to evolve in \nways that require another look at the state of long-term care. In a \nconstantly changing for-profit and nonprofit industry, Federal and \nState governments need better information about the organizations and \nstaff who provide care to residents of long-term care. Individuals, \nfamilies, and service providers also need good information about long-\nterm care to make informed decisions about their options.\n  Chairman Kohl, I laud you and your colleagues who have thoughtfully \nidentified current or emerging problems in long-term care. The Nursing \nHome Transparency and Improvement Act of 2008, S. 2641, makes important \nstrides in helping us to get more substantive information about nursing \nhome ownership and staffing. It strengthens the Nursing Home Compare \nWeb site and provides additional information for the general public. I \nam therefore pleased to become a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Senator Wyden. Given your long commitment to \naging and health issues, your support is especially important and \nmeaningful.\n  Mr. WYDEN. While I am pleased to support the legislation, I do have \nsome concerns about the bill as it is written and hope that we can work \ntogether to make some changes to the bill. It has been helpful for me \nto talk about the bill with the many fine people who operate nursing \nhomes in Oregon and others. And these folks have identified what I \nthink are legitimate concerns with the bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would appreciate hearing of those concerns, Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. There are two issues of particular concern where I hope we \nmay be able to get agreement on modifications. First, the bill calls \nfor increased civil monetary penalties and requires that they be placed \nin escrow in advance of adjudication of an alleged violation. This \nprovision could be especially burdensome to smaller nursing homes that \nalready operate close to the margin. I think it would be useful to \nreview the size of the proposed fines but especially the escrow \nprovision. Tying up thousands of dollars in escrow would be \nparticularly difficult for small nursing homes and especially unfair \nfor homes whose alleged violations were later found to be without \nmerit. I also believe it raises due process concerns in terms of \nimposing penalties before a matter has been finally settled.\n  Mr. KOHL. We will certainly review those provisions in light of your \nconcerns.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The other issue of concern in the legislation concerns the \nrequirement that every nursing home that is part of a group of nursing \nhomes with common ownership and annual revenues of $50 million or more \nbe subject to annual audits. Many of the nursing homes in Oregon are \nfamily-run businesses. A few of our Oregon owners operate groups of \nnursing homes that would meet the criterion for annual audits of each \nof their nursing homes. I am concerned that the cost of annual audits \nwould be financially burdensome for them and for small nursing home \nchain owners in other parts of the country.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the care with which you have reviewed the \nNursing Home Transparency Act. I will take under serious consideration \nthe issues that you have raised. Again, your cosponsorship of this \nlegislation is important in view of the many efforts you have made and \ncontinue to make to improve the lives of America's older citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7145-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JAN REINICKE\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at the end of August, Jan Reinicke \nwill retire after 10 years of distinguished service as executive \ndirector of the Iowa State Education Association. Jan began her career \nin the classroom, serving as a speech and English teacher in the Iowa \ntowns of Cincinnati, Coon Rapids, and Fort Dodge, earning the love of \nher students. Nearly four decades later, she concludes her career as \none of the most respected educator-leaders in my State of Iowa.\n  Jan previously served as a lobbyist on the ISEA staff from 1980 to \n1994, and as associate executive director from 1995 to 1998. At every \nstage, the key to her success has been that her roots have remained \nfirmly planted in the classroom, and her passion has been to enhance \nthe professionalism and stature of the teaching profession.\n  I have always loved what Lee Iacocca said about teachers. ``In a \ncompletely rational society,'' he said, ``the best of us would be \nteachers, and the rest would have to settle for something less.'' \nFortunately, in Iowa, so many of our best--individuals of intelligence \nand talent like Jan Reinicke--do go into teaching. But, unfortunately, \nthese idealistic and dedicated professionals do not always receive the \nsupport and compensation that they deserve.\n  That is why Jan has dedicated herself to lifting up the teaching \nprofession in my state. Thanks to her leadership and advocacy, the Iowa \nLegislature passed two major salary improvements for Iowa teachers.\n  In addition, Jan is a passionate believer that teachers and other \neducators should take charge of their own profession. To that end, she \nhas devoted herself to strengthening the Iowa State Education \nAssociation both as a union and as a professional association, more \neffectively advocating for teachers and other educators. Her vision led \nto the creation of teacher quality committees, giving teachers a larger \nvoice in professional development and in determining the course of \ntheir schools.\n  A wise person once said, ``Those who dare to teach must never cease \nto learn.'' Jan agrees wholeheartedly. This is why she led the charge \nto establish ISEA's Professional Development Academy, which provides \nrelicensing courses for teachers, as well as the opportunity to earn \ngraduate credit. Under Jan's leadership, the association also created \nthe Faculty Quality Plan to ensure that every student has access to \nquality teachers and a rigorous curriculum.\n  As a teacher, as an education lobbyist, and as the top executive at \nISEA, Jan Reinicke's bottom line has always been the same: ensuring a \nquality teacher in every classroom, and a quality public education for \nevery child.\n  There is an old saying that we make a living by what we get, but we \nmake a life by what we give. Jan Reinicke has always given generously \nto those around her as a teacher, mentor, and leader. She leaves a \nliving legacy in terms of an enhanced teaching profession in Iowa and a \nstrong, respected Iowa State Education Association.\n  I know that Jan Reinicke has many wonderful plans for retirement, and \nthat she intends to give of herself generously as a volunteer. I join \nher colleagues and friends across Iowa in thanking her for a job \nsuperbly done, and in wishing her a long and happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7145-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7145-S7146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING GIFFORD'S ICE CREAM\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with summer in full swing, I wish to \ncelebrate a small business from my home State of Maine that has been \nsatisfying our sweet tooth with delicious ice cream for several \ndecades. Gifford's Ice\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\nCream, a family-owned and operated firm with a long history of dairy \nfarming in central and western Maine, provides its customers with \ncreamy indulgences for all tastes.\n  A familiar sight in Maine, people come from all around to enjoy \nGifford's dozens of scrumptious, mouth-watering flavors. Serving Maine \nfor over 100 years in the dairy business, a span of five generations, \nGifford's began focusing its operations on summer treats in 1980, \nhaving previously supplied milk, cream, and other dairy products. \nPresently, Gifford's utilizes original family recipes to create more \nthan 100 tempting varieties of ice cream and frozen yogurts. Crafting \nits rich ice cream with premium ingredients, including fresh milk and \ncream from local dairy farmers, Gifford's consistently churns out top-\nquality ice cream for its customers.\n  While its main location is in Skowhegan, known as the heart of \nMaine's farm country, Gifford's has branched out to open ice cream \nstands in Auburn, Bangor, Farmington, and Waterville. Its ice cream is \nadditionally available at supermarkets and other locations throughout \nthe Northeast. Gifford's employs 25 people year-round, as well as an \nadditional 75 during the busy summer months.\n  Gifford's offers a wide array of flavors to choose from, including \nseasonal delights and new selections each year. From the staple vanilla \nand chocolate, to the eclectic orange pineapple and smurf cotton candy, \nGifford's covers all its bases. Furthermore, Gifford's has recently \nadded a number of frozen yogurt flavors, such as fudge overboard and \nstrawberry banana, as well as no fat/no sugar added options, sherbets, \nand sorbets. Best of all, Gifford's offers quintessential Maine-related \nflavors, such as Maine maple walnut, birch bark, black bear, wild \nblueberry, and even deer tracks and lobster tracks. And while most \neveryone enjoys a good ice cream on occasion, Gifford's hasn't \nforgotten our four-legged friends, offering them Dog Bone Sundaes, \ncomplete with a scoop of ice cream and a dog biscuit.\n  Throughout its illustrious history, Gifford's has garnered numerous \nawards, particularly for its ice cream. Among the recognitions are \nfirst place awards from the National Ice Cream Retailers Association \nfor its strawberry and chocolate ice creams, as well as ``World's Best \nVanilla'' at the World Dairy Expo in Madison, WI, in 2005 and ``World's \nBest Chocolate'' at last year's expo. The Skowhegan Area Chamber of \nCommerce also named Gifford's Ice Cream its Large Business of the Year \nearlier this year.\n  In 2002, Gifford's began Cones for Kids, a program that rewards \nchildren 14 and younger who excel in academics, advance in scouting, or \nmake a difference in their community. From earning an A on a reading \nquiz to volunteering at the neighborhood 4-H club, students can receive \na free ice cream cone by enriching their lives through a host of \npositive and engaging activities.\n  What has made Gifford's so successful both in the dairy business and \nat its ice cream stands is a passion for pleasing its customers. \nSetting out to create new flavors of ice cream every year, whether it \nbe apple pie or peanut butter caramel cookie dough, Gifford's has \ntransformed itself from a small dairy farm to Maine's largest \nstatewide, independent, family-owned ice cream company. I congratulate \npresident Roger Gifford, treasurer John Gifford, and everyone at \nGifford's Ice Cream for their tremendous success, and wish them well \nthis summer and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7146-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7146-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a treaty and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7146-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF EMERGENCY REGARDING EXPORT CONTROL \n REGULATIONS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 13222 DATED AUGUST \n                            17, 2001--PM 59\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban, Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to extend the deadline for \n     benefitting from the bonus depreciation until December 31, \n     2010, for all parishes in Louisiana which are included in the \n     Katrina and Rita GO Zones. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and to each member \n     of the Louisiana congressional delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-421. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     reauthorize the DNA backlog program; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 281\n\n       Whereas, the Debbie Smith DNA backlog grant program was \n     part of the Justice for All Act of 2004, Public Law No. 108-\n     405. This legislation assists in the reduction of DNA \n     backlogs and improvement of the utilization of DNA in the \n     criminal justice system in the state of Michigan and every \n     state throughout the nation; and\n       Whereas, DNA technology is increasingly vital to ensuring \n     accuracy and fairness in the criminal justice system. \n     Thousands of law enforcement investigations have been aided \n     nationwide because of DNA matches made through the FBI's \n     Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), bringing justice to \n     victims and removing criminals from the streets. Also, the \n     Innocence Project has used DNA in over 200 cases to exonerate \n     persons who were wrongfully convicted of crimes; and\n       Whereas, the state of Michigan and other states throughout \n     the nation have significantly expanded their DNA programs to \n     include a growing number of convicted or arrested felons to \n     match against unsolved crimes; and\n       Whereas, the demand for DNA testing in both violent and \n     nonviolent crimes has continued to increase as the \n     reliability of this evidence is proven. Many laboratories \n     still maintain DNA backlogs of six months or longer and are \n     unable to meet the growing demand for DNA testing despite \n     funding commitments from state and local governments; and\n       Whereas, the Debbie Smith DNA backlog grant program has \n     permitted state and local governments an opportunity to begin \n     to maximize the full potential of forensic DNA through \n     backlog reduction, but much work remains to be done: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to reauthorize the DNA \n     backlog program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7148-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BAUCUS, from the Committee on Finance, without \n     amendment:\n       S.J.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nmental and behavioral health services on college campuses; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN: Mr. President, this February, on Valentine's Day, a young\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nman walked into a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University and \nopened fire. Five students were killed and 17 were wounded before the \nshooter took his own life. Northern Illinois University was not the \nfirst college to experience this kind of tragedy. We all remember the \nhorrific events at Virginia Tech only months earlier--where 32 lives \nwere taken by a gunman. The magnitude of heartbreak for friends and \nfamilies and communities of those killed is hard to imagine. So, too, \nis the continuing trauma experienced by those who survived. These \ntragedies opened our eyes to a reality that needs attention.\n  Since February I have learned just how thin colleges and universities \nare stretched when it comes to providing counseling and other support \nservices to students, and I think we need to help them. So today I am \nintroducing the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which would \nestablish grant programs to help schools meet the rising need for \nmental health services on campus.\n  The ratio of counselors to students on campus is widening. Currently \nthere is only one counselor for every 2,000 students on our college \ncampuses. At some colleges, the situation is even more dismal. Studies \nshow that 10 percent of college students have contemplated suicide. Mr. \nPresident, 45 percent have felt so depressed that it was difficult to \nfunction. Colleges are also encountering students who 10 or 20 years \nago would not have been able to attend school due to mental illness, \nbut who can today because of advances in treatment of mental illness.\n  Taking care of mental health needs on our college campuses is \nsomewhat unique. Many mental illnesses start to manifest in this period \nwhen young people leave the security of home and regular medical care. \nThe responsibility for the students' well-being often shifts from \nparents to students, who aren't always completely prepared. The \ncolleges try to fill in the gaps, but with so few services and \ncounselors, we are beginning to recognize how many needs are \noverlooked. This is a very real problem, even for schools that have \nmade mental health services a dedicated priority.\n  Take Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. SIUC has eight full-\ntime counselors for 21,000 students. That is one counselor for every \n2,500 students. And there is another problem. Like many rural \ncommunities, Carbondale only has one community mental health agency. \nThat agency is overwhelmed by the mental health needs of the community \nand refuses to serve students from SIU. The campus counseling center is \nthe only mental health option for students. The eight hard-working \ncounselors at SIUC do their best under impossible conditions. They \ntriage students who come in seeking help so that the ones who might be \na threat to themselves or others are seen first. The waitlist of \nstudents seeking services has reached 45 students.\n  With so many students looking for help and so few counselors to see \nthem, the counseling center has to cut back on outreach. Without \noutreach, the chances diminish of finding students who need help but \ndon't ask for it. This is a serious problem. We know that the shooter \nat Virginia Tech exhibited many warning signs of a tortured mental \nstate. But faculty and students did not know how or where to express \ntheir concerns. Outreach efforts by campus counseling centers can help \neducate the community about warning signs to look for as well as how to \nintervene. Of the students who committed suicide across the country in \n2007, only 22 percent had received counseling on campus. That means \nthat of the 1,000 college students who took their own lives, 800 may \nnever have looked for help. How many of those young lives could have \nbeen saved if our college counseling centers had the resources they \nneeded to identify those students and help them? Our students deserve \nbetter.\n  The Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act would create a grant \nprogram to provide funding for colleges and universities to improve \ntheir mental health services. Colleges could use the funding to hire \npersonnel, increase outreach, and educate the campus community about \nmental health. The bill also would direct the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to develop a public, nation-wide campaign to education \ncampus communities about mental health.\n  Reflecting on the loss of his own son, the well known minister Rev. \nWilliam Sloan Coffin once said, ``When parents die, they take with them \na portion of the past. But when children die, they take away the future \nas well.'' I hope the bill I am introducing today will help prevent the \nunnecessary loss of more young lives and bright futures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2007 National Survey of Counseling Center Directors \n     found that the average ratio of counselors to students on \n     campus is nearly 1 to 2,000 and is often far higher on large \n     campuses. The International Association of Counseling \n     Services accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per \n     1,000 to 1,500 students.\n       (2) College counselors report that 8.5 percent of enrolled \n     students sought counseling in the past year, totaling an \n     estimated 1,600,000 students.\n       (3) Over 90 percent of counseling directors believe there \n     is an increase in the number of students coming to campus \n     with severe psychological problems. The majority of \n     counseling directors report concern that the demand for \n     services is growing without an increase in resources.\n       (4) A 2006 American College Health Association survey \n     revealed that 44 percent of students at colleges and \n     universities report having felt so depressed it was difficult \n     to function, and one out of every 11 students seriously \n     considered suicide within the past year.\n       (5) Research conducted from 1989 to 2002 found that \n     students seen for anxiety disorders doubled, for depression \n     tripled, and for serious suicidal intention tripled.\n       (6) Many students who need help never receive it. \n     Counseling directors report that of the students who \n     committed suicide on their campuses, only 22 percent were \n     current or former counseling center clients. Directors did \n     not know the previous psychiatric history of 60 percent of \n     these students.\n       (7) A survey conducted by the University of Idaho Student \n     Counseling Center (2000) found that 77 percent of students \n     who responded reported that they were more likely to stay in \n     school because of counseling and that their school \n     performance would have declined without counseling.\n       (8) A 6-year longitudinal study of college students found \n     that personal and emotional adjustment was an important \n     factor in retention and predicted attrition as well as or \n     better than academic adjustment (Gerdes & Mallinckrodt, \n     1994).\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPROVING MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ON COLLEGE \n                   CAMPUSES.\n\n       Title V of the Public Health Service Act is amended by \n     inserting after section 520E-2 (42 U.S.C. 290bb-36b) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 520E-3.

A bill amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure that \nvictims of public health emergencies have meaningful and immediate \naccess to medically necessary health care services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Today I am introducing the Public Health Emergency \nResponse Act. This bill authorizes a temporary health benefit during a \npublic emergency for people in that area who don't have health \ninsurance. The program makes it more likely that people who need \nhealthcare services will get them and ensures that the doctors and \nnurses who treat them will be compensated.\n  Since 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has had the \nauthority to declare public health emergencies so that government can \nprovide resources quickly to communities in need. That authority has \nbeen exercised very rarely--for 9-11; Hurricanes Wilma, Katrina, and \nRita; and the recent flooding in the Midwest. These public health \nemergencies--both man-made and natural disasters--ruined neighborhoods, \ndivided families, and weakened many spirits. But for every tragic \nemergency witnessed, we saw acts of remarkable selflessness and \nkindness.\n  One of the greatest examples of this generosity is in the efforts of \nlocal health care providers to meet the increased need for services. \nWhether it was the hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast, the debris in \ndowntown New York, or the waters in the Midwest, the need for medical \nservices was immediate and in some cases dramatic. The demand for \nmental health services also rose in response to the psychological \nstress and trauma caused by the destruction of homes, the loss of jobs, \nthe separation of families, and the death and devastation surrounding \nthose in the areas hit by these tragic events.\n  Despite the trauma of a disaster or the pain from an injury incurred \nduring a disaster, people who don't seek care not only leave themselves \nvulnerable to worsening health conditions, but they exacerbate the \nsituation on the ground. For those uninsured people who do access \nmedical care, the providers--typically those in areas immediately \nsurrounding the disaster area--are often left without any compensation.\n  During Hurricane Katrina, the Harris County hospital district in \nHouston assumed responsibility for the health care of 23,000 evacuees \nliving in the Reliant Astrodome. In Baton Rouge, hospitals struggled to \nmeet the health care needs of a population that doubled in size after \nabsorbing half a million evacuees. Health facilities and other public \ninfrastructure were stretched beyond their capacity as they faced the \nmultiple challenges of addressing the public health needs in the \ncounties or parishes directly affected; delivering needed health care \nto the displaced; and ensuring the continued delivery of health care \nservices to residents of the other areas.\n  Victims of public health emergencies should know that the government \nwill assist them in their time of need. This is why I am introducing \nthe Public Health Emergency Response Act.\n  The Public Health Emergency Response Act would make it easier for \nuninsured victims to seek treatment and would provide coverage to the \nhealth care professionals who are treating them. The bill would \nestablish a temporary emergency health benefit for people who are \nuninsured. The benefit could be triggered only when the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services declared a public health emergency and chose \nto activate the benefit. The benefit would last for up to 90 days, and \nthe Secretary could extend it once for another 90 days. Rather than put \nadditional stress on our public health programs like Medicare, Medicaid \nor SCHIP, the funding mechanism for the benefit is the Public Health \nEmergency Fund, a no-year fund established in 1983. Funds for emergency \nvictims' health coverage would be determined by Congressional \nappropriations. The bill will help save lives and ensure a functioning \nhealth care system for whatever lies ahead.\n  Most recently, we saw the entire Midwest reeling from weeks of \nflooding and tornadoes--from Minnesota to Kansas and everywhere in \nbetween--Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and, of course, Illinois. The \ndamage has been heartbreaking. We know from the great flood that \ndevastated the Midwest in 1993 and from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nthat the losses from this chain of weather-related disasters will be \nmore than our states and citizens alone can bare. We also know that, in \ntimes of crisis, Americans have always come together to help those in \nneed.\n  The Public Health Emergency Response Act carries on this tradition. \nThe bill allows Federal government to prepare for the next emergency. \nWe do not know what the next public health emergency will look like. It \nmay be a bioterrorist attack, a hurricane, or pandemic flu. We should \nact now to create the framework for emergency health coverage and \nreimbursement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Emergency \n     Response Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     has declared that a public health emergency existed \n     nationwide in response to the attacks of September 11th and \n     in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n       (2) In the event of a public health emergency, compliance \n     with recommendations to seek immediate care may be critical \n     to containing the spread of an infectious disease outbreak or \n     responding to a bioterror attack.\n       (3) Nearly sixteen percent of Americans lack health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (4) Fears of out-of-pocket expenses may cause individuals \n     to delay seeking medical attention during a public health \n     emergency.\n       (5) A public health emergency may disrupt health care \n     assistance programs for individuals with chronic conditions, \n     exacerbating the costs and risks to their health.\n       (6) The uninsured could place great financial strain on \n     healthcare providers during a public health emergency.\n       (7) The Department of Health and Human Services Pandemic \n     Influenza Plan projects that a pandemic influenza outbreak \n     could result in 45 million additional outpatient visits, with \n     865,000 to 9,900,000 individuals requiring hospitalization, \n     depending upon the severity of the pandemic.\n       (8) Hospitals in the United States could lose as much as \n     $3.9 billion in uncompensated care and cash flow losses in \n     the event of a severe pandemic.\n       (9) Under current statute, no dedicated mechanism exists to \n     reimburse providers for uncompensated care during a public \n     health emergency.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide temporary emergency healthcare coverage for \n     uninsured and certain otherwise qualified individuals in the \n     event of a public health emergency declared by the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services;\n       (2) to ensure that healthcare providers remain fiscally \n     solvent and are not overburdened by the cost of uncompensated \n     care during a public health emergency;\n       (3) to eliminate a primary disincentive for uninsured and \n     certain otherwise qualified individuals to promptly seek \n     medical care during a public health emergency; and\n       (4) to minimize delays in the provision of emergency \n     healthcare coverage by clarifying eligibility requirements \n     and the scope of such coverage and identifying the funding \n     mechanisms for emergency healthcare services.\n\n     SEC. 3. EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title III of the Public Health Service Act \n     is amended by inserting after section 319K the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 319K-1.

Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lois Capps,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Capps: The \n     undersigned organizations join in supporting your \n     introduction of the Public Health Emergency Response Act \n     (PHERA), legislation that would put a turn-key process into \n     place which would ensure that victims of a public health \n     emergency have immediate access to medically necessary \n     healthcare services and help ensure that we have a \n     functioning health care system.\n       A public health emergency, such as a natural disaster, \n     biologic attack or infectious disease outbreak, could strike \n     at any time. The September 11th attacks and Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita have underscored the need for rapid access \n     to healthcare services during and immediately following a \n     public health emergency. Following Hurricane Katrina, \n     Congress ultimately approved $2.1 billion for grants to \n     certain states to cover the Medicaid and SCHIP matching \n     requirements for individuals enrolled in these programs, and \n     the cost of uncompensated care for the uninsured. However, it \n     took six months for Congress to pass the Deficit Reduction \n     Act, which provided for these funds. This unnecessary delay \n     could have been prevented. PHERA would put into place ahead \n     of time a framework for providing reimbursement for \n     uncompensated care in the event of a major public health \n     emergency.\n       The temporary benefit established through this bill would \n     help remove a disincentive for uninsured individuals to \n     promptly seek medical care. Any delay in seeking care could \n     result in lives lost, particularly during an infectious \n     disease outbreak when immediate identification and isolation \n     are very important, and delay in seeking care could render \n     treatment ineffective. At a time when our health care system \n     could be overwhelmed with patients, it is vital that \n     reimbursement issues not dissuade providers from offering \n     care. A study by the Center for Biosecurity estimated that \n     U.S. hospitals could lose as much as $3.9 billion in \n     uncompensated care and cash flow losses in the event of a \n     severe pandemic. By helping to reduce the burden of \n     uncompensated care, PHERA would help ensure the solvency and \n     continuity and our health care system during a catastrophic \n     emergency.\n       Specifically, PHERA would provide a temporary emergency \n     health benefit for uninsured individuals and individuals \n     whose health insurance coverage is not actuarially equivalent \n     to benchmark coverage, in the event that the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services (HHS) declares that a public health \n     emergency exists and chooses to activate the benefit. It \n     would clarify who is eligible for this benefit, including \n     individuals displaced by a public health emergency, limit the \n     amount of time for which the benefit would last, and \n     stipulate what providers would be covered under this Act. It \n     would not use Medicare, Medicaid or SCHIP funding. The \n     funding mechanism would be the Public Health Emergency Fund, \n     a no-year fund available to the Secretary. The bill \n     authorizes funding for the administration of the fund, \n     together with a public education campaign on the availability \n     of the benefit, but further funding would not be necessary \n     until Congress appropriated funds in the event of a declared \n     public health emergency.\n       Past experiences have shown that Congress will step in to \n     help defray the costs of uncompensated care resulting from a \n     catastrophic emergency. Determining the scope of such \n     coverage ahead of time will help ensure the solvency of our \n     health care system and help eliminate a disincentive for \n     individuals to promptly seek care. PHERA would help ensure \n     that when tragedy strikes, time and lives are not lost as \n     Congress debates a course of action. It would create the \n     turn-key process ahead of time, thereby allowing for timely \n     care to individuals affected by a crisis.\n       We appreciate your leadership in introducing this \n     legislation and look forward to working with you on this and \n     other public health initiatives in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Red Cross.\n       Center for Biosecurity, University of Pittsburgh Medical \n     Center.\n       Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\n       Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n       Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n       National Association of Community Health Centers.\n       Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.\n       Trust for America's Health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3313.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victims of Polygamy \n     Assistance Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite the fact that polygamy has been illegal in the \n     United States for over 100 years, the practice of polygamy \n     involving underage marriages is growing. Sizable polygamist \n     communities exist in Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and are \n     expanding into other States.\n       (2) Polygamist communities are typically controlled by \n     organizations that engage in widespread and systematic \n     violations of State laws and the laws of the United States in \n     order to enrich their leaders and maintain control over their \n     members.\n       (3) The crimes perpetrated by these organizations include \n     child abuse, domestic violence, welfare fraud, tax evasion, \n     public corruption, witness tampering, and transporting \n     victims across State lines.\n       (4) Due to the systematic and sophisticated nature of these \n     crimes, State and local law enforcement agencies would \n     benefit from the assistance of the Federal Government as they \n     investigate and prosecute these organizations and their \n     leaders for violations of State law. In addition, violations \n     of Federal law associated with polygamy should be \n     investigated and prosecuted directly by Federal authorities.\n       (5) The work of State and Federal law enforcement agencies \n     to combat crimes by polygamist organizations would benefit \n     from enhanced collaboration and information-sharing among \n     such agencies.\n       (6) The establishment of a task force within the Department \n     of Justice to coordinate Federal efforts and collaborate with \n     State agencies would aid in the investigation and prosecution \n     of criminal activities of polygamist organizations in both \n     Federal and State courts.\n       (7) Polygamist organizations isolate, control, manipulate, \n     and threaten victims with retribution should they ever \n     abandon the organization. Individuals who choose to testify \n     against polygamist organizations in Federal or State court \n     have unique needs, including social services and witness \n     protection support, that warrant Federal assistance.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF A FEDERAL POLYGAMY TASK FORCE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established within the \n     Department of Justice a Federal Polygamy Task Force, which \n     shall consist of the Deputy Attorney General, the United \n     States attorneys from affected Federal judicial districts, \n     representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, and any officer of \n     the Federal Government whom the Deputy Attorney General \n     considers necessary to strengthen Federal law enforcement \n     activities and provide State and local law enforcement \n     officials the assistance they need to address the illegal \n     activity of one or more polygamist organizations.\n       (b) Purposes.--The Federal Polygamy Task Force established \n     under subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) formulate effective responses to the unique set of \n     crimes committed by polygamist organizations;\n       (2) establish partnerships with State and local law \n     enforcement agencies to share relevant information and \n     strengthen State and Federal efforts to combat crimes \n     perpetrated by polygamist organizations;\n       (3) assist States by providing strategies and support for \n     the protection of witnesses;\n       (4) track the criminal behavior of polygamist organizations \n     that cross State and international borders; and\n       (5) ensure that local officials charged with protecting the \n     public are not corrupted because of financial, family, or \n     membership ties to a polygamist organization.\n\n     SEC. 4.

And we have \na responsibility to start talking about policy solutions that will work \nto protect one of our most precious resources our oceans.\n  In addition to cultural, recreational, and aesthetic values, our \noceans provide great economic value and a way of life for millions of \npeople.\n  In Washington State alone, nearly 80 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, GDP, is produced in our coastal areas. Nationwide, the oceans \nand coastal areas generate more than $800 billion of trade each year, \ntens of billions of dollars in recreational opportunities annually, and \n$30 billion from commercial fisheries. The histories and the economies \nof coastal communities have, and always will, ebb and flow with the \ntide.\n  As such, the conservation of marine and coastal ecosystems, and the \nmajestic life they contain, should be a top priority for our Nation.\n  By introducing the National Ocean Protection Act today, Senator Boxer \nis taking an important step towards furthering the discussion on the \nmanagement and protection of our oceans, coastal areas, and Great Lakes \necosystems. I commend my colleague on her efforts.\n  As chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries \nand Coast Guard, I am currently reviewing several ocean governance \nproposals, but I fully support bringing these important issues into the \nspotlight of consideration. It is the only way we will come closer to \nestablishing a comprehensive solution that works.\n  This discussion is much needed and long overdue.\n  I look forward to continuing this dialog and encourage all of my \ncolleagues to join in moving these matters forward and making a renewed \ncommitment to the protection of our marine waters.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 3318. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for recognition of equality of physician work in all geographic \nareas and revisions to the practice expense geographic adjustment under \nthe Medicare physician fee schedule; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nMedicare Physician Payment Equity Act of 2008.\n  I stood before this body last December as we agreed to a short-term \nMedicare extension bill so that we would have the opportunity to \naddress other\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\npressing priorities in a bipartisan Medicare package this year. One of \nthe most significant issues I had hoped to address was the need to \nprovide more equitable payment for physicians in Iowa and other rural \nstates.\n  While the Medicare bill that Congress just enacted improves the \nsituation for physicians in the near-term by averting the SGR payment \ncuts scheduled to occur during the next 18 months, it does little to \nremedy the unjustifiable geographic disparities in physician payment \nthat exist. It is unfortunate that reforms to the geographic physician \npayment adjusters were not included in H.R. 6331. I have long supported \nmore equitable treatment of physicians in rural areas, and I have \npressed for reforms to the work and practice expense geographic \nadjustments in the Medicare physician fee schedule. However, much-\nneeded reforms such as the establishment of a practice expense floor \nare not in the Medicare bill that Congress enacted last week.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to remedy this \nproblem by providing more equitable treatment for physicians in rural \nareas. The bill reduces inequitable disparities in physician payment \nresulting from the Geographic Practice Cost Indices or adjusters, known \nas GPCls, by establishing a 1.0 floor for physician practice expense \nadjustments as of 2009 and by providing a national 1.0 geographic index \nfor physician work expense after the expiration of the existing 1.0 \nfloor in 2010.\n  Although geographic adjustments are intended to reflect actual cost \ndifferences in a given area compared to a national average of 1.0, the \nexisting, inaccurate formulas create significant disparities in \nphysician reimbursement that penalize, rather than equalize, physician \npayment in Iowa and other rural states. These geographic disparities \nlead to rural states experiencing significant difficulties in \nrecruiting and retaining physicians and other health care professionals \nbecause of their significantly lower reimbursement rates. This in turn \nleads to reduced beneficiary access to rural health care providers.\n  Here is a simple example that demonstrates the inequity of the \ncurrent GPCI formulas. Iowa is widely recognized as providing some of \nthe highest quality health care in the country, yet Iowa physicians \nreceive some of the lowest Medicare reimbursement of any physicians in \nthe country because of inequitable geographic adjustments. Medicare \nphysician payment is equal in all 89 Medicare payment localities until \nthe geographic adjusters, or GPCls, are applied. After the GPCI \nadjustments, however, Medicare reimbursement for some physician \nservices in Iowa is at least 30 percent lower than payment for the same \nservice in other parts of the country, and it is fundamentally unfair. \nCongress needs to reduce these unwarranted payment variations and \nrealign Medicare incentives to reward physicians' quality instead of \ntheir geography.\n  Sadly, the inequitable geographic formulas which make these \nadjustments have merely exacerbated the problems of rural access to \nhealth care. Rural America today has far fewer physicians per capita \nthan urban areas do. According to the National Rural Health \nAssociation, only about 10 percent of physicians practice in rural \nareas although nearly a quarter of the U.S. population lives there. \nAnother grave concern is the lack of specialists in rural areas: only \nabout 40 specialists exist per 100,000 in rural areas compared to more \nthan three times as many--134 per 100,000--in urban areas. The evidence \nis clear that the existing geographic adjusters have been a dismal \nfailure in promoting an adequate number of physicians in Iowa and other \nrural states. More severe physician shortages will occur in the future \nif we do not make essential changes to these formulas now.\n  The Medicare Physician Payment Equity Act revises the formulas used \nto determine geographic work and practice expense adjustments. The \nphysician work formula currently used by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to estimate physician wages measures geographic \ndifferences in the earnings of six categories of professionals \n(lawyers, engineers, and others), rather than differences in \nphysicians' earnings. In addition, the data that are used are based on \noutdated proxy data from the 2000 census. This bill recognizes that \nphysician work for a service requires the same skill and training \nregardless of the geographic area, and should be similarly valued, and \nit establishes a national index of 1.0 for physician work beginning in \n2010.\n  The practice expense formula used by CMS is inaccurate, outdated, and \ndoes not represent the actual office rent or employee wage costs for \nphysicians in many areas. The office rent component uses Department of \nHousing and Urban Development residential apartment rental data from \n2000 which does not accurately reflect physician office rent. The \nemployee wage component comes from 2000 census data on clerical \nworkers, nurses, and medical technicians which does not take into \naccount any of the more highly compensated workers such as physician \nassistants, office administrators, and other specialists employed in \nphysician practices today. The Medicare Physician Payment Equity Act \nprovides for a more appropriate recognition of the geographic \ndifferences in employee wages and office rents by reducing the impact \nof this index to reflect more accurately the differences in physician \npractice costs, as of 2010. We must act now to help recruit and retain \nrural physicians to ensure that beneficiaries in Iowa and other rural \nareas will continue to have access to health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to address the \ngrowing problem of health care shortages in rural America by providing \nmore equitable payment for physicians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, the \nIndian Tribal Justice Act, the Indian Tribal Justice Technical and \nLegal Assistance Act of 2000, and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to improve the prosecution of, and response to, \ncrimes in Indian country, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I have overseen five hearings this Congress that confirm a \nlongstanding and life threatening public safety crisis on many of our \nNation's American Indian reservations.\n  One of the primary causes for violent crime is the disjointed system \nof justice in Indian country that is broken at its core. The current \nsystem limits the authority of Tribes to fight crime, and requires \ntribal communities to rely completely on the United States to \ninvestigate and prosecute violent crimes occurring on reservations.\n  This is a system that the United States created. With this \nresponsibility, comes a legal obligation to provide for the public \nsafety on Indian lands. Unfortunately, we are not meeting our \nobligation.\n  Between 2004 and 2007, the United States has declined to pursue an \naverage of 62 percent of reservation criminal cases referred for \nprosecution. This means that 75 percent of adult and child sex crimes \nand 50 percent of homicides on Indian lands went unpunished in those \nfour years.\n  This is an inherent flaw in the system. The system vests the \nprosecution of reservation crimes in the federal courts which are often \nlocated hundreds of miles away from the crime scene, the evidence, and \nthe witnesses needed to prosecute these difficult cases.\n  The results of this system include an epidemic of domestic and sexual \nviolence against American Indian and Alaska Native women. The \nDepartment of Justice reports that 34 percent of Native women will be \nraped in their lifetimes. This past February, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention reported that 39 percent of Native women will be \nsubject to domestic violence. These rates are more than twice the \nnational average.\n  This broken system of justice has also drawn the unwanted attention \nof criminals to Indian lands. In recent years, reservations have been \ntargeted as safe havens for criminal activity. One Federal prosecutor \nsaid that Indian lands are being used as pipelines by drug \norganizations to funnel their poison to tribal and nearby communities. \nThese drugs eventually reach larger metropolitan areas.\n  To address this crisis, I am pleased to announce the introduction of \nthe Tribal Law and Order Act of 2008 with the support of my colleagues \nCommittee Vice Chairwoman Murkowski, and Senators Biden, Domenici, \nBaucus, Bingaman, Lieberman, Kyl, Johnson, Smith, Cantwell, Thune, and \nTester.\n  This bill seeks to take initial steps at mending this broken system \nby arming tribal justice officials with tools to protect their \ncommunities.\n  The bill would expand on a program to enable tribal police to enforce \nviolations of Federal laws on Indian lands.\n  The bill would also provide police greater access to vital criminal \nhistory information.\n  Further, the bill would enable tribal courts to sentence offenders up \nto 3 years in prison for violations of tribal law, an increase from the \ncurrent limit of 1 year.\n  Title I of the bill would provide for greater consultation and \ncoordination between federal law enforcement officials, tribal leaders, \nand community members. Increased communication and coordination at all \nlevels of government responsible for crime on Indian lands is vital to \ncombating this public safety emergency.\n  To increase coordination of prosecutions, the bill would require U.S. \nAttorneys to file declination reports and maintain data when refusing \nto pursue a case. Maintaining consistent data on declinations will \nenable Congress to direct funding where the additional resources are \nneeded.\n  This bill was developed over the past 18 months in consultation with \ntribal leaders, tribal, federal and state law enforcement officials, \nand many others.\n  I want to again thank my colleagues for their support of this \nlegislation, and urge the Senate to act to meet our public safety \nobligations to all tribal communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has distinct legal, treaty, and trust \n     obligations to provide for the public safety of tribal \n     communities;\n       (2) several States have been delegated or have accepted \n     responsibility to provide for the public safety of tribal \n     communities within the borders of the States;\n       (3) Congress and the President have acknowledged that--\n       (A) tribal law enforcement officers are often the first \n     responders to crimes on Indian reservations; and\n       (B) tribal justice systems are ultimately the most \n     appropriate institutions for maintaining law and order in \n     tribal communities;\n       (4) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement \n     officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, \n     which reflects less than \\1/2\\ of the law enforcement \n     presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;\n       (5) on many Indian reservations, law enforcement officers \n     respond to distress or emergency calls without backup and \n     travel to remote locations without adequate radio \n     communication or access to national crime information \n     database systems;\n       (6) the majority of tribal detention facilities were \n     constructed decades before the date of enactment of this Act \n     and must be or will soon need to be replaced, creating a \n     multibillion-dollar backlog in facility needs;\n       (7) a number of Indian country offenders face no \n     consequences for minor crimes, and many such offenders are \n     released due to severe overcrowding in existing detention \n     facilities;\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\n       (8) tribal courts--\n       (A) are the primary arbiters of criminal and civil justice \n     for actions arising in Indian country; but\n       (B) have been historically underfunded;\n       (9) tribal courts have no criminal jurisdiction over non-\n     Indian persons, and the sentencing authority of tribal courts \n     is limited to sentences of not more than 1 year of \n     imprisonment for Indian offenders, forcing tribal communities \n     to rely solely on the Federal Government and certain State \n     governments for the prosecution of--\n       (A) misdemeanors committed by non-Indian persons; and\n       (B) all felony crimes in Indian country;\n       (10) a significant percentage of cases referred to Federal \n     agencies for prosecution of crimes allegedly occurring in \n     tribal communities are declined to be prosecuted;\n       (11) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in \n     Indian country--\n       (A) has a significant negative impact on the ability to \n     provide public safety to Indian communities; and\n       (B) has been increasingly exploited by criminals;\n       (12) the violent crime rate in Indian country is--\n       (A) nearly twice the national average; and\n       (B) more than 20 times the national average on some Indian \n     reservations;\n       (13)(A) domestic and sexual violence against Indian and \n     Alaska Native women has reached epidemic proportions;\n       (B) 34 percent of Indian and Alaska Native women will be \n     raped in their lifetimes; and\n       (C) 39 percent of Indian and Alaska Native women will be \n     subject to domestic violence;\n       (14) the lack of police presence and resources in Indian \n     country has resulted in significant delays in responding to \n     victims' calls for assistance, which adversely affects the \n     collection of evidence needed to prosecute crimes, \n     particularly crimes of domestic and sexual violence;\n       (15) alcohol and drug abuse plays a role in more than 80 \n     percent of crimes committed in tribal communities;\n       (16) the rate of methamphetamine addiction in tribal \n     communities is 3 times the national average;\n       (17) the Department of Justice has reported that drug \n     organizations have increasingly targeted Indian country to \n     produce and distribute methamphetamine, citing the limited \n     law enforcement presence and jurisdictional confusion as \n     reasons for the increased activity;\n       (18) tribal communities face significant increases in \n     instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child \n     abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on \n     Indian reservations;\n       (19)(A) criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is complex, \n     and responsibility for Indian country law enforcement is \n     shared among Federal, tribal, and State authorities; and\n       (B) that complexity requires a high degree of commitment \n     and cooperation from Federal and State officials that can be \n     difficult to establish;\n       (20) agreements for cooperation among certified tribal and \n     State law enforcement officers have proven to improve law \n     enforcement in tribal communities; and\n       (21) crime data is a fundamental tool of law enforcement, \n     but for decades the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the \n     Department of Justice have not been able to coordinate or \n     consistently report crime and prosecution rates in tribal \n     communities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, \n     tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes \n     committed in tribal communities;\n       (2) to increase coordination and communication among \n     Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;\n       (3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, \n     resources, and information necessary to safely and \n     effectively provide for the safety of the public in tribal \n     communities;\n       (4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in tribal \n     communities and to combat violence against Indian and Alaska \n     Native women;\n       (5) to address and prevent drug trafficking and reduce \n     rates of alcohol and drug addiction in Indian country; and\n       (6) to increase and standardize the collection of criminal \n     data and the sharing of criminal history information among \n     Federal, State, and tribal officials responsible for \n     responding to and investigating crimes in tribal communities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 45. A joint resolution expressing the consent and approval \nof Congress to an inter-state compact regarding water resources in the \nGreat Lakes--St. Lawrence River Basin; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1831, the great chronicler of early \nAmerica, Alexis de Tocqueville, explored the Great Lakes. As he passed \nthrough Lake Huron, he observed of the empty, undeveloped expanse: \n``This lake without sails, this shore which does not yet show any trace \nof the passage of man, this eternal forest which borders it; all that, \nI assure you, is not grand in poetry only; it's the most extraordinary \nspectacle that I have seen in my life.''\n  Nearly 2 centuries later, the Great Lakes remain one of the most \nextraordinary spectacles in the world. The sheer size of the Great \nLakes is impressed upon anyone who has stood on their shores, or who \nhas seen the outline of the Michigan mitten, which the Great Lakes make \none of the most distinctive shapes and recognizable shapes on maps or \nsatellite photographs of the earth. Beyond their awe-inspiring \nappearance and enormity, the Great Lakes help fuel an economic engine \nthat stretches from Minnesota to New York, producing some of our \nnations most celebrated and relied-upon goods and agricultural \nproducts.\n  This morning, my colleagues and I are introducing a joint resolution \nto ratify an historic agreement to manage Great Lakes water, the Great \nLakes Water Resources Compact. While the existing Water Resources \nDevelopment Act law provides sufficient protection and authority to \nprevent diversions, the Great Lakes Compact will provide an effective \nmeans for Great Lakes states jointly to safeguard water for future \ngenerations. The compact will ban new diversions from the Basin with \ncertain limited exceptions, and those exceptions would be regulated. \nFurther, the compact keeps the authority to govern our water in the \nhands of the Great Lake States.\n  The compact states that ``the protection of the integrity of the \nGreat Lakes Ecosystem shall be the overarching principle for reviewing \nproposals.'' For the first time, water conservation goals will be \ndeveloped to deal with any water diversion proposals.\n  Beyond that, the compact would specifically address withdrawals and \ndiversions of both ground and surface water. This would represent an \nimprovement over existing law because there are differing opinions on \nwhether the current law addresses ground water diversions.\n  Additionally, because the compact would provide a scientific method \nfor determining whether to allow a proposal to divert water from the \nGreat Lakes, it makes our efforts to protect the lakes more clearly \ncompliant with international trade agreements.\n  This agreement has been in the making for close to decade, following \nthe mistaken issuance of a permit for bulk water diversion by the \nProvince of Ontario. In the 2000 WRDA, Congress directed the governors \nto negotiate a water management policy, and in 2005, the eight Great \nLakes Governors and two Canadian Premiers came to an agreement.\n  I have heard that some people believe that there is a water bottle \n``loophole.'' The compact prohibits water in a container larger than \n5.7 gallons to be diverted outside the Great Lakes basin. Though the \ncompact would not prohibit water withdrawals in containers less than \n5.7 gallons, individual states would retain their authority to regulate \nbottled water in any size container.\n  I believe that the Great Lakes Compact is beneficial and will provide \ngreater protections for the Great Lakes than the status quo. However, \nas is explicitly stated in this joint resolution, the Great Lakes Water \nCompact does not imply that it is necessary for Congress to pass the \ncompact in order for the Lakes to be protected from diversions. WRDA \ngives each Great Lakes governor veto power over certain types of \ndiversions by any Great Lakes state. While this authority is clear, \nadditional safeguards and standards will be helpful in the years ahead.\n  Tocqueville further observed during his journey in Lake Huron, \n``Nature has done everything here. A fertile soil, and outlets like to \nwhich there are no others in the world.'' Nature has, indeed, given us \nso much in the Great Lakes. We need to take this important step to pass \nthe Great Lakes Water Compact so as to make sure that we conserve this \nprecious resource as best we can, ensuring sensible use now so that \nfuture generations can benefit from the Great Lakes as we do. I support \npassage, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the Joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Res. 620\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD''), one \n     of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in \n     the United States, is a severe, dominantly inherited disease \n     that has a devastating impact, in both human and economic \n     terms, on people of all ages, and affects equally people of \n     all races, sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and \n     income levels;\n       Whereas this devastating disease comes in 2 hereditary \n     forms, with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease \n     (ADPKD) affecting 1 in 500 worldwide, including 600,000 PKD \n     patients in the United States, according to prevalence \n     estimates by the National Institutes of Health;\n       Whereas families in which 1 or both parents have ADPKD have \n     a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to each of \n     their children;\n       Whereas autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease \n     (ARPKD), a rarer form of PKD, affects 1 in 20,000 live births \n     and too often leads to death early in life;\n       Whereas parents who carry the gene for ARPKD pass on the \n     disease to 25 percent of the children the parents conceive;\n       Whereas, in addition to patients directly affected by PKD, \n     countless friends, loved ones, family members, colleagues, \n     and caregivers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and \n     financial burdens that polycystic kidney disease causes;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     treatment or cure, is the leading genetic cause of kidney \n     failure in the United States and the fourth leading cause \n     overall;\n       Whereas the vast majority of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients reach kidney failure at an average age of 53, \n     causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the ``baby boomers'', \n     continues to age;\n       Whereas end stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to that cost by an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 annually for dialysis, kidney transplantation, \n     and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidney and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal organ systems and \n     instills in patients a fear of an unknown future with a life-\n     threatening genetic disease and apprehension over possible \n     genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to live in denial and forego regular visits to \n     their physicians or to avoid following good health management \n     which would help avoid more severe complications when kidney \n     failure occurs;\n       Whereas people who have chronic, life-threatening diseases \n     like polycystic kidney disease have a predisposition to \n     depression and the resulting consequences of depression due \n     to their anxiety over pain, suffering, and premature death;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States \n     desire to see treatments and cures for disease and would like \n     to see results from investments in research conducted by the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) and from such initiatives \n     as the NIH Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a verifiable example \n     of how collaboration, technological innovation, scientific \n     momentum, and public-private partnerships can generate \n     therapeutic interventions that directly benefit polycystic \n     kidney disease sufferers, save billions of Federal dollars \n     under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, \n     kidney transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related \n     therapies, and make available several thousand openings on \n     the kidney transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide who \n     are dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering \n     public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease, educating polycystic kidney disease patients and \n     their families about the disease to improve their treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas these volunteers engage in an annual national \n     awareness event held during the third week of September, and \n     such a week would be an appropriate time to recognize \n     National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 14-20, 2008, as \n     ``National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support National Polycystic Kidney \n     Disease Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities, to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney \n     disease, and to foster understanding of the impact of the \n     disease on patients and their families.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hatch to \nintroduce a resolution to increase awareness of Polycystic Kidney \nDisease, PKD, a common and life threatening genetic illness.\n  Over 600,000 people have been diagnosed with PKD nationwide. There is \nno treatment or cure for this devastating disease. Families and friends \nstruggle to fight PKD and provide unwavering support to their suffering \nloved ones.\n  But there is hope. The PKD Foundation has led the fight for increased \nresearch and patient education. Recent studies have led to the \ndiscovery of the genes that cause PKD as well as promising clinical \ndrug trials for treatment. More needs to be done, however, and the \ngovernment wants to help.\n  In order to increase public awareness of this fatal disease, I \npropose that September 14th through the 20th be designated as National \nPolycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week. This week coincides with the \nannual walk for PKD which takes place every September. In Wisconsin, \nwhere over 10,000 patients are living with the disease, residents \ngather across the state to take part in this very special walk.\n  Increasing awareness will help all those affected by Polycystic \nKidney Disease, and I hope my colleagues will support this important \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Herb Kohl, in introducing a resolution to designate \nSeptember 14-20, 2008, as National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness \nWeek. Approximately 600,000 Americans and more than 12 million people \nworldwide suffer from polycystic kidney disease or PKD. Through this \nresolution, we hope to raise awareness of this disease that is \nrelatively unknown but affects so many people.\n  PKD is one of the most common life-threatening genetic diseases \nimpacting America today. According to the PKD Foundation, the disease \nafflicts more people than Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, muscular \ndystrophy and sickle cell anemia combined.\n  The two major forms of PKD are autosomal dominant PKD--also called \n``adult PKD'' because it customarily causes symptoms in adulthood--and \nautosomal recessive PKD, a rare form that usually causes symptoms in \ninfancy and early childhood. Babies born with this latter type of PKD \noften do not live longer than the first month of life. About half of \nautosomal dominant PKD patients eventually develop kidney failure and \nrequire dialysis or a kidney transplant. PKD is the fourth leading \ncause of kidney failure, and it is the leading genetic cause of kidney \nfailure.\n  PKD is characterized by the growth of fluid-filled cysts on the \nnephrons of the kidneys. A polycystic kidney can have thousands of \nthese cysts growing on it. In time, the cysts separate from the \nnephrons and continue to enlarge--and the kidneys enlarge along with \nthe cysts. A normal, healthy kidney is about the size of a fist; but, \nin fully developed cases of autosomal dominant PKD, a cyst-filled \nkidney can grow to the size of a football or larger and weigh as much \nas 20 to 30 pounds. This leads to decreased kidney function and kidney \nfailure.\n  PKD also can cause cysts in the liver and problems in other organs, \nsuch as blood vessels in the brain and heart. High blood pressure is \ncommon and develops in most patients by age 20 or 30, and brain \naneurysm is a common cause of death in PKD patients.\n  There is no cure for PKD, only minimal treatments such as medicine to \ncontrol high blood pressure, or medicine and surgery to reduce pain, \nand antibiotics for infections. More severe cases of PKD require more \nintense treatment options such as dialysis for failing kidneys or a \nkidney transplant.\n  There may be no cure, but there is hope. According to the National \nInstitute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National \nInstitutes of Health, scientists have begun to identify what triggers \nformation of PKD cysts. And advances in genetics have expanded \nunderstanding of the abnormal genes responsible for both\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nforms of PKD. Recent clinical studies of autosomal dominant PKD are \nexploring new imaging methods for tracking progression of cystic kidney \ndisease. Today, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, is helping scientists \ndesign better clinical trials for new treatments of adult PKD.\n  There is also hope in awareness and education, which offer patients \nopportunities to discuss and learn about their disease, provide more \nresources for research and treatment options for PKD, and lead to more \nevents to heighten visibility and aid in fundraising. As I said \nearlier, not many people know about the disease, even in my home State \nof Utah where PKD rates are three times the national average.\n  To promote greater understanding of this destructive genetic disease, \nSenator Kohl and I have introduced this resolution to designate a \nNational Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/23/senate-section/article/S7179-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 621--HONORING AND COMMEMORATING THE SELFLESS ACTS OF \nHEROISM DISPLAYED BY THE LATE DETECTIVE JOHN MICHAEL GIBSON AND PRIVATE \n FIRST CLASS JACOB JOSEPH CHESTNUT OF THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE \nON JULY 24, 1998, AND EXPRESSING THE GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION OF THE \n  SENATE FOR THE PROFESSIONALISM AND DEDICATION OF THE UNITED STATES \n                             CAPITOL POLICE\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, \nMr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, \nMr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nDeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nEnsign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nSalazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
