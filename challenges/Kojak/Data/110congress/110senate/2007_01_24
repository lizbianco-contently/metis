Mr. President, last night in the State of the Union \nAddress, President Bush, for the seventh year running, raised the issue \nof energy. I am glad he did because I think everybody across America \nunderstands we are in a dangerous position. We are entirely dependent \nupon imports from foreign countries when it comes to our energy needs \nand our economy.\n  It is true that we produce our own oil and gas in this country, but \nwe don't produce enough to fuel our economy. So we find ourselves \nbuying oil from countries far and wide across the globe. We find \nourselves in positions where we are compromised sometimes by that \ndependence. Many of us have felt that the President's first goal or \ntask should be to establish the reduction of our dependence upon \nforeign oil. I think that is a worthy goal and one I wish the President \nhad quantified last night a little more specifically than he did.\n  The reason, of course, is if we can find a way to reduce dependence \nupon foreign oil, for example, we might have several positive impacts: \nfirst, not entangling ourselves in the foreign policy goals of \ncountries we don't share many values with; second, it is good for our \nsecurity interests to have sources of fuel that are reliable closer to \nhome; third, of course, we are dealing with an environmental issue \nhere. The more gasoline we burn to move a mile or two miles down the \nroad, the more emissions and the more global warming; the more global \nwarming, the more climate change and a disastrous environmental impact.\n  So many of us believe that though the President continues to refer to \nthe problem, he has never quite moved us as we would like in the \ndirection of a solution.\n  Last night, he said two things that were more encouraging. As I said, \nthis is the seventh year the President has brought up the issue. He \nmade a famous statement last year about America's addiction to oil. In \nthe ensuing 12 months, we did little or nothing in Washington to \naddress that addiction.\n  Assuming the same addiction today, the President said we should move \ntoward alternative fuels, which I heartily support, not just biofuels, \nsuch as ethanol and biodiesel, but other alternative fuels that could \nmake a big difference in the way we drive our cars, heat our homes, and \nfuel our businesses.\n  The second issue the President talked about, which is long overdue, \nis addressing the CAFE standards. These, of course, were standards \ncreated in 1975 by Congress. At the time, we knew we had a problem. The \nproblem was obvious--that we had too much dependence on foreign oil and \nprices were going up. By today's standards, they were not going up that \nhigh, but by the standards of those days they were.\n  In addition, the cars and trucks we were driving were inefficient. In \nfact, the average miles per gallon in 1975 for cars and trucks was \nabout 13, 14 miles per gallon. At that point, Congress worked up the \ncourage, with the cooperation of the President, to set a new goal and \nsaid that in 10 years, we will virtually double the fuel efficiency of \nthe cars and trucks in America.\n  The negotiations got underway, and they decided to exempt trucks--we \nwill go after cars and we will go after the fleet average of cars.\n  It worked. In a span of 10 years, we went from 13 or 14 miles a \ngallon average mileage to 27, 28 miles a gallon. So we clearly showed \nthat when given incentives and mandates, the automobile manufacturers \ncould respond with a product that was more fuel efficient.\n  What happened after 1985, after we hit the 27, 28 miles a gallon \naverage? We did nothing. For 21 straight years, we did nothing. What \nhappened in addition, that little loophole we created for trucks, \nletting them off the hook, the SUVs drove right through it. They \nproduced these big, heavy vehicles that became extremely popular with \nAmericans. They classified them as trucks, and they had no requirements \nto be fuel efficient. So the overall use of gasoline continued to \nincrease, and the overall efficiency of the cars and trucks we drive \nwent down as more and more SUVs and trucks were built that were exempt \nfrom the CAFE standards. Twenty-one years passed and things got \nprogressively worse as we imported more and more fuel--dramatically \nmore and more fuel--to burn in cars and trucks that were significantly \nmore inefficient than those we had in 1985.\n  I have tried, on the floor of this Senate, three different times to \nreimpose CAFE standards on cars and trucks, to close loopholes and to \nmove us back in the direction of more efficient cars and trucks, and I \nfailed every time. Maybe things have changed. I credit a lot of people \nfor this new debate.\n  What troubled me last night was the President, I felt, acknowledged \nthe energy issue but gave scant attention to the environmental aspect. \nIt is true that most of us understand we are going through a climate \nchange in America. If you have seen Al Gore's documentary ``An \nInconvenient Truth,'' he documents and brings the facts forward to make \nthe argument that this climate change is changing the world we live in \non a permanent basis.\n  I recently returned from an official trip with my colleagues to South \nAmerica, where leaders in that region of the world said, when asked, \nthey saw ample evidence of climate change--glacier melt and changes in \nthings they thought would never change. We have seen it in America. We \nhave seen it in the weather we find in different regions of our \ncountry, the extremes which we have witnessed and experienced.\n  My point is I hope we can take the President's invitation in his \nspeech last night to the next level. I hope we can start talking about \nan energy policy that does make sense. The starting point ought to be a \nrealistic goal for reducing our dependence on foreign oil. We ought to \nunderstand, if we can move forward with more efficient cars and trucks, \ngive consumers in America more choices, that they will, given those \nchoices, make the right choice, time and again.\n  Sadly, the production of these fuel-efficient cars has been led by \nforeign manufacturers and not by the United States. That has to come to \nan end.\n  I might say, although I support biofuels, ethanol, and biodiesel, \nalthough I believe flexible fuel vehicles are sensible for people to \nown and drive, it is not enough, and we shouldn't delude ourselves into \nbelieving it is enough. We need to move toward those hybrid vehicles \nthat truly burn less fuel and move people in America to the places they \nneed to go. We can do that, but we need to move in a sensible way.\n\n  Let me give two examples. There are two companies in my State of \nIllinois. One is Firefly. Firefly is a spinoff of Caterpillar Tractor \ncompany. It is an independent company that is trying to design a new \nbattery for cars and trucks. The lead-acid battery, which most use \ntoday, is ancient and heavy and inefficient and in extreme temperatures \ndoesn't work well. They are investing in research to find a new battery \nthat is lighter and has a longer life. I don't know if theirs will be \nthe breakthrough technology, but we need to encourage companies such as \nFirefly to develop the new batteries that can lead to better hybrid \ncars and more fuel efficiency.\n  Secondly, one of the biggest problems we have with fuel efficiency is \nthe weight of the vehicle. If we can reduce the weight of the vehicle \nwithout compromising safety, we can get more fuel efficiency. I happen \nto have another company in Illinois--I am certainly proud of my State \nand what we do; these happen to be two companies relevant to the \ndiscussion--this company in Illinois has now a new titanium alloy that \ncan be derived at a much lower cost.\n  Titanium holds the promise of being stronger than steel and lighter \nthan aluminum. So this could be the answer to a car chassis that is \nsafe and lighter. Combining those two items might offer a prospect for \na vehicle in the future which would be much more fuel efficient.\n  Why aren't we promoting companies such as those companies? If we \ntruly\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nwant to reach energy independence and energy inefficiency, we need to \nmove beyond where we are today. We need to move the discussion. We need \nto say to automobile manufacturers that it isn't good enough to keep \nproducing those SUVs and trucks, fuel-inefficient vehicles, and giving \nconsumers fewer choices. It isn't enough to always come in second to \nthe Japanese, when it comes to production of newer and forward looking \ntechnology. It isn't enough to let the airline and airplane industry \nlook for these new alloys and new batteries and ignore their need for \nour automobile industry as well.\n  The President has pointed us in the right direction. I hope that now \nhe will join us. We need to cooperate. We need to work together, \nRepublicans and Democrats--give some ground, if necessary, but keep our \neye on that goal to clean up this environment for our kids, reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, push the kind of technology and innovation \nthat will create great new American companies with great new American \njobs that pay a decent income to those who work there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, in each State of the Union Address that \nPresident Bush has given to our country over the last 6 years, he has \ntalked about the importance of energy independence for our Nation.\n  In 2001, he said loudly and clearly that we as America ``must become \nmore energy independent.''\n  In 2002, he said:\n\n       We need to encourage conservation, promote technology, and \n     build infrastructure.\n\n  And again last year, most of us remember the President loudly and \nclearly telling the people of America, the people of this world, that \nAmerica is addicted to oil and we need to do something about it.\n  I was pleased last night that the President revisited an issue he had \ntalked about before--our energy independence. In my view, this is a \nsignature issue for all of us in the 21st century. Encompassed in this \nissue of energy security for our Nation, we see the national security \nof America because today the way we approach the energy issue, where we \nnow import 70 percent of our oil from foreign countries, we end up \nfunding both ends of the war on terror. We do it when we put gasoline \nin our tanks in America and it ends up funding Iran and Iran ends up \nbuying the rockets for Hezbollah that rain over Israel and funds the \n10,000 members of the Hezbollah militia. That is crazy. So our national \nsecurity requires us to move forward with energy independence.\n  As far as our economic independence at home, we saw what happened \nwhen gasoline went up over $3 a gallon, when farmers and ranchers were \nsuffering, having to pay $3.50 a gallon for diesel to fill up their \ntractors, their combines, and their trucks. We know the economic \nsecurity of our country depends on having a steady supply of energy.\n  Finally, the environmental security of our country, knowing what \nglobal warming is doing to the North Pole and to the climate changes \nall around the world, is something we need to get our hands around. We \nneed to deal with the energy issue in an effective way.\n  So I was pleased that the President of the United States last night \ncame before the Congress and the Nation and said we needed to do some \nmore work on energy. He said we needed to more than double, we need to \nquintuple the renewable fuel standard, which hopefully will get us to \nthe 35 million gallons per day in 10 years. And he said we need to \nreduce the gasoline we are currently using in this country in 10 years \nby 20 percent.\n  At the end of the day, what we do on energy will depend on how we \ntake those concepts and how we, with the President, walk the talk \ntoward getting us to energy independence.\n  When we look back on what has happened in the last 6 years in the \nUnited States, the opposite has happened. Instead of becoming less \ndependent on foreign sources of oil, we have become more dependent on \nforeign sources of oil. So the rhetoric simply has not matched the \ndeeds. We need to make sure the words that were spoken last night are \nmatched by the deeds of the administration in terms of the budget, the \nleadership of the Department of Energy in investing in technology, in \nthe National Renewable Energy Lab, and moving forward with an \naggressive agenda on renewable energy and new technologies.\n  I wish to illustrate two points that tell the history of what has \nhappened over the last 6 years in Washington. First, with respect to \nrenewable energy investments, if one takes a look at this chart, 2001 \nto 2006, one would think, as we were on this trajectory of getting \nourselves energy independent, that this red line would show us \nincreasing investments in renewable energy in America. And yet the \nexact opposite has happened.\n  We started in 2001 investing about $350 million a year into renewable \nenergy. By the time we got to 2006, we were at about $375 million. So \nwe actually dropped about $25 million in what we were investing in \nrenewable energies. This is not walking the talk as we embrace the \nfuture of renewable energy.\n  I would like to illustrate what we have done with efficiency. We talk \nabout energy independence. We know it is a complex issue, but frankly, \nas my good friend from Tennessee and others know, it is not as complex \nas some of the other issues we face in America today. It certainly is \nnot as complex, in my mind, as the health care issue which dogs the \nbusinesses and families of America every day because we know how we can \nget to energy independence.\n  If the country of Brazil, a Third World country, could declare itself \nto be energy independent, why not the most powerful Nation on Earth, \nthe Nation with the greatest technology? Why couldn't we have done the \nsame thing? The answer to that is that we have not had a sustained \ncommitment to get us to energy independence.\n  If we look at the low-hanging fruit with respect to energy \nefficiency, we again see the story of our walking away from embracing a \ntrue ethic of energy independence. If we look at the investments that \nhave been made from 2001 to 2006, we see a dramatic decline, again, in \nterms of what we are doing with energy efficiency. That is not the way \nto go. It is the wrong way to go because the experts and scientists at \nthe Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Lab tell us \nthat we waste about 62 percent of the energy we consume. We waste 62 \npercent of the energy that we consume. So if we can become much more \nefficient with respect to how we use energy, we can help deal with this \nissue of energy dependence, which is essentially strangling our economy \nand strangling our national security.\n  As I react to the President's State of the Union Address, I am \ndelighted with the fact that he has given us this challenge. Now we \nneed to work as a Congress and have the administration work with us so \nwe are able to put the resources and the ideas on the table to come up \nwith what is truly a bipartisan package that will help us move forward \nwith the kind of energy independence that is achievable.\n  In my view, we can be even bolder and go beyond what the President \nhas said. There is a group of Senators in this Chamber--some 25 of us, \nhalf Republicans, half Democrats--that last year sponsored legislation \ncalled 2025. This year it has another number. We talk about alternative \nfuels and how we incentivize moving forward with alternative fuels. We \nhave in the Senate as well incentives for higher efficiencies and how \nwe use oil. Our goal in that legislation is to reduce the consumption \nin the imports of oil in a very dramatic fashion by the year 2016 and \nthen beyond, by the year 2026. It is a bipartisan agenda.\n\n  At the end of the day, and in conclusion, we have an opportunity to \nwork together as a Senate, as a Congress, by bringing Republicans and \nDemocrats together to achieve true energy independence and surpass even \nthe President's vision of what we can do. When you think about Senators \nsuch as Sessions and Brownback and then on the Democratic side Bayh and \nLieberman, a whole host of us who are involved in the set America free \nagenda, it is an important opportunity we have to move forward. But, at \nthe end of the day, the way we will achieve this milestone of energy \nindependence for our country, which is so essential, is by making sure \nthe administration itself, the President of the United States,\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\nwalks the talk in terms of what we can do to achieve this goal of \nenergy independence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about two things this \nmorning: No. 1, the President's State of the Union Address last night, \nand No. 2, Senator Gregg's proposal to reduce wasteful spending.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Colorado, who has been \na leader on renewable energy and energy independence. I want to point \nthis out. The President last night did his job. It was a truly \nPresidential speech, in my opinion. I used to work in the White House, \nand a wise man there told me: Lamar, our job here on the White House \nstaff is to consider everything that comes to the White House as \nimportant. We need to push those things out and reserve for the \nPresident those things which are truly Presidential.\n  The President talked about truly Presidential issues last night, and \nhe did what Presidents are supposed to do. He did not give us a laundry \nlist. He talked about Iraq, terrorism, energy independence, and health \ncare costs. He said: Pick up immigration and deal with it. He said \nreduce the budget in 5 years. He gave us a strategy in each case, he \ntried to persuade us that he is right, and then he handed the ball to \nus.\n  We are independent of the President. We have a Democratic Congress, \nclosely divided, and a Republican President, so I don't think we can \ncriticize the President. I think we should applaud the President and \nsay: Mr. President, you did your job. You identified the issues, you \ngave us a strategy, and you handed the ball to us.\n  The biggest news last night, it seemed to me, was on energy \nindependence and health care costs. Starting with energy independence, \nthe President said let's set a goal to reduce our use of gasoline 20 \npercent in 10 years. That is a big, serious proposal. This country uses \n25 percent of all the energy in the world. If we reduce our use of \ngasoline by 20 percent in 10 years, it will help clean the air, it will \nhelp reduce dependence on foreign oil, it will create a big market for \nagricultural products in this country to help create biodiesel \nalternative fuels, and it will force innovation in such things as \nelectric batteries.\n  The President's proposals will require a change in the so-called fuel \nefficiency CAFE standards. It will require these new technologies. It \nis a big step, and it is the kind of thing that Democrats as well as \nRepublicans can take, improve, and pass. We don't need to be saying to \nthe President: Mr. President, you walk the walk. He talked. Now it is \nup to us to act.\n  The same with health care. His proposal on health care is a big, \nserious proposal. There is probably no subject Tennesseans talk to me \nabout more in their daily lives than: How do I pay for my health care \ncosts? The President had an answer last night. He said: For 80 percent \nof working Americans, I will give you an average of $3,600 in savings \nfrom your taxes which you can spend to buy yourself health care \ninsurance. That means if you are a family of four, making $60,000 a \nyear, you might have $4,000 or $5,000 in tax savings to use to pay for \nhealth care costs.\n  Now, 20 percent of us would pay a little more for health care. Mine \nwould go up. But 80 percent of all of us who work would get significant \nsavings to pay for health care insurance. This would help us afford it. \nThis would help more people who do not have it pay for it. This would \nhelp hospitals whose emergency rooms fill up with people who cannot pay \nfor health care. It is a big, serious proposal.\n  The President has done his job. It is up to us now to have a hearing, \nimprove it, and enact it.\n  I salute the President for doing his job last night with what I felt \nwas a truly Presidential speech. Much of it was about Iraq. Iraq is \nbeing talked about today in many different bodies, but much of it is \nabout what is happening at home. If we take up immigration and don't \nstop until we are finished, if we balance the budget in 5 years, if we \nreduce the amount of oil we are using by 20 percent in 10 years, if we \ngive 80 percent of working Americans several thousand dollars to help \npay for health care insurance, that will be a great big step forward. \nSo it is up to us, now, to pick up the ball and run with it. He has \nhanded it to us. Let's go. Let's talk about it. Let's do it. If we have \na better idea, fine; if not, let's just pass his proposal.\n\n  Second, I wish to speak for just a moment about the proposal of \nSenator Gregg that would give the President a new tool for cutting \nwasteful spending. I believe it should have been enacted with our \nreforms last week on lobby reform because it would help rein in \nwasteful spending and earmark abuse. But I commend Senator McConnell \nand Senator Gregg, and I thank Senator Reid for working it out so we \ncan have a vote on this important amendment.\n  We need to get our fiscal house in order. Yesterday, 25 of us \nattended a breakfast. The Chair and I were there. It wasn't a breakfast \nwhere we talked about how Democrats could beat Republicans and vice \nversa; we talked about how we can put our fiscal house in order. The \nPresiding Officer had some very good ideas to express, but the whole 40 \nminutes was about the unsustainable growth of Federal spending here, \nespecially in the entitlement area. There are several things we need to \ndo about it, but this amendment by Senator Gregg is one. It is not the \nsame thing as a line-item veto, but it goes in that direction.\n  I would support amending the Constitution to give the President a \nline-item veto. I don't think that is in derogation of our authority to \nappropriate. The Supreme Court thinks it does that, so we have to \nrespect that. But this is a little different way to let the President \nhave a way of letting us take a second look at appropriations we passed \nwhich may not have been wise.\n  Under current law, the President has the power, for example, to \npropose cuts in spending after appropriations bills have been passed by \nCongress. Then we can pass those cuts in the same form and send them \nback or we can ignore them. So the idea would be, under the Gregg \namendment, that the President could submit four packages of rescission \nproposals each year. We couldn't ignore the proposals. We would have to \nvote on them in a short period of time, if any Member wanted us to. If \nthe majority of the Senate and the House agreed with the President's \nrecommendations for cutting spending, then the spending or targeted tax \nbreaks would get cut and the money would be used to reduce the deficit. \nBut if a simple majority of either House disagreed, then the cuts would \nnot go into effect.\n  It is pretty much the same amendment Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd \noffered in 1995, which was supported by 21 of my Democratic colleagues \nwho are still serving in the Senate. It is not the same thing as the \ntraditional line-item veto, but it is an opportunity to put the \nspotlight on wasteful spending.\n  Senator Gregg went one step further to make his amendment more \nclosely reflect the Daschle-Byrd proposal. Senator Gregg's amendment \nallows us in the Congress, if the President makes a rescission \nproposal, to strike out an individual part of his proposal. There are \nplenty of forces here in this city for increasing spending. There are \nnot enough forces that push to reduce spending. The Gregg proposal \nwould be one tool the President and the Congress can use to reduce \nspending.\n  I know when I was Governor I had this authority and 43 Governors \ncurrently have the line-item veto. In Tennessee, it is not much of a \nline-item veto because the Governor's veto can be overridden by a \nmajority of the legislature. But just because I had the veto and the \nfact that I might have used it, and occasionally did use it, helped me \nput the spotlight on wasteful spending and gave the legislature a\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nchance to reconsider or think twice about what they might do.\n  As a new member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I can assure \nmy colleagues, I don't take lightly proposals to alter the Congress's \npower of the purse. For Congress to appropriate is as natural as for \nJohnny Cash to sing or for the President to nominate Supreme Court \nJustices. But I don't think this interferes with that because both the \nSenate and House must vote to adopt the President's proposed cuts; \nsecond, we can strike portions of his proposed cuts; and third, the \npower to do all this would sunset after 4 years, giving us in the \nCongress a chance to evaluate how well it is working.\n  There are some other things I think we can do. A biennial budget \nwould help. Passing a 2-year budget, so we can focus all of the first \nyear on the budget and all the next year on oversight over programs to \nhelp them work better, avoid duplication, and get rid of some \nprograms--all of that would help control spending. We also ought to \nhave a commission on accountability and review of Federal agencies, \nwhich would help reorganize duplicative and unnecessary programs.\n  I am honored to sponsor the Gregg second look at waste amendment \nbecause it gives the President and the Congress one tool to reduce \nwasteful spending at a time when we urgently need to do that and the \ncountry knows that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business at \nthis time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1007-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1007-S1008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SECOND LOOK AT WASTE\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from Tennessee \nfor his support at this second look at waste amendment which I have \noffered. The Senator's arguments, as always, are extraordinarily cogent \nand logical. He makes the point--which I think is very valid, as a \nformer Governor who had the line-item veto, which is a much stronger \nauthority than what we have in this amendment--that this is important, \nmanaging the fiscal house, to making sure that items which get into \nlegislation as a result of being put in arbitrarily by some individual \nMember of Congress but which are not subject to the light of day in the \ntraditional way--by being brought across the floor as individual items \nbut, rather, are put into major pieces of legislation, sometimes \nrepresenting hundreds of billions of dollars in spending--that those \nitems can be reviewed again and get a vote as to their credibility and \nas to their appropriateness and whether they represent something on \nwhich American tax dollars should be spent.\n  This proposal, this fast-track rescission, which is what it really \nis, is not a partisan proposal. In fact, as proposed in my amendment, \nsecond look at waste, it would actually be primarily under the control \nof the next President. It has a 4-year window of activity and then it \nis sunsetted. By the time it would get into law, should it pass the \nSenate and then pass the House, it is likely that this President will \nonly have, probably, a year and a half to use this authority, and then \nthe next President, whoever that President may be--maybe a Republican, \nmaybe a Democrat--will have the authority to use this rescission \nability for 2\\1/2\\ years. So it is not partisan.\n  Second, it was drafted, as the Senator from Tennessee noted, \nbasically to mirror a proposal that was put forward by Senator \nDaschle. In fact, I have called this amendment daughter of Daschle. It \nis essentially the Daschle amendment as offered back in 1995, which was \ncosponsored by Senator Byrd. There are only two major changes--well, \nthree major changes, and I have already said to those who have asked me \nthat I am willing to adjust those changes to bring it even more in line \nwith Daschle.\n\n  One of the changes in this bill from the Daschle bill was that the \nPresident would have 300 days to send up his rescission notice. Some \npeople have expressed concern that that gives the President the ability \nto use that rescission notice as a club over people's heads. The reason \nwe gave the President 300 days in this amendment was we had reduced the \nnumber of rescission notices in the Daschle amendment. There were \npotentially 13 rescission actions available to the President, and in \nthis amendment, there are only 4 available to the President. Therefore, \nin the Daschle amendment, it was required that the rescission notice be \nsent up soon after the bill was signed. But, of course, with 13 \ndifferent opportunities, it could go on all year long. We felt that \nsince we were reducing it to four, we should give the President more \nleeway as to when he sent up those rescission notices.\n  But I can understand the argument. In fact, I accept the argument \nthat maybe that is too much authority in the sense it gives the \nPresident too much leverage over the Congress. So when, I hope--I am \nusing the term ``when''--when this amendment comes forward in an \namendable form, I will offer an amendment to reduce the 300 days back \nto 30 days. So the President would have to send up his rescission \nnotices within 30 days of it being signed, or at least asking us to \ntake a second look at it, and that should adjust that problem and bring \nit directly in line, pretty much in line with what the Daschle \namendment was originally.\n  The other area which was different from the Daschle amendment is the \nissue that deals with mandatory spending. Some people have said new \nmandatory spending--not existing programs, not existing veterans \nprograms or farm programs or Medicare or Medicaid, but if there is a \nnew mandatory program, that can also be subjected to the President \nasking for a second look at it. It has been argued by some on the other \nside that this would undermine the ability to reach a comprehensive \nsettlement on entitlement reform. That is really a straw argument. That \nargument has no legs.\n  The practical matter is, if a President reaches an agreement with the \nCongress on something as extraordinarily important as major entitlement \nreform, part of that agreement is going to be that the President signed \noff on it. So this argument of, well, but the President might come back \nand change it later on with a rescission notice really has no legs. It \nis just being made for the purpose of giving comfort to folks who \nbelieve they want to vote against this amendment. If people want to \nvote against it, that is their right. But don't use that as an excuse.\n  What this amendment essentially does is it allows the Congress to \nfulfill its obligation to make sure that money which is sent by our \ntaxpayers is spent effectively, honestly, appropriately, and without \nwaste. And, it gives the executive branch a role in asking the question \nof Congress: Did you really mean to spend this money?\n  I have to say, I have been here for a while--14 years in the Senate--\nand I have seen a lot of bills come across this floor which were fairly \nlarge, and when I took a look at them after I maybe had voted for it, I \nrealized there were some things in them that I wished weren't in them. \nI didn't happen to vote for the highway bill which had the bridge to \nnowhere--the famous highway bill. But had I voted for it, I think I \nwould have wanted to take a second look at some of the projects in that \nbill.\n  The same is true of a lot of our appropriations bills when we get to \nthe end of the year and we haven't gotten our appropriations process \ncompleted effectively, so we lump 3 or 4 different appropriations \nbills, sometimes 5 or 6, occasionally 10, appropriations bills into 1 \nand we call it an Omnibus appropriations bill. Those bills tend to get \nitems in them which have received no scrutiny, which are simply the \nresult of an earmark for the purpose of accomplishing something which \nsome Member of the Senate or the House feels is appropriate but which \none suspects, if the entire House or the Senate were to take a look at, \nwe would say: Well, better to put that money toward reducing the \ndeficit than toward spending the money in this specific area.\n  So this bill is, as I have said and as the Senator from Tennessee so \neloquently said, a second look at waste. The purpose is to give us, the \nCongress, another tool to manage waste.\n  Now, I wish it had come up last week because, quite honestly, I \nthought it was much more appropriate to last week's debate when we were \ndebating earmarks and when about 50 percent of the debate time was \nspent on earmarks\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\nbecause that is what it is really about. But it has now been put on \nthis bill as a result of an agreement I reached with the Senator from \nNevada, the majority leader. I respected his position. I admire his \nleadership. I didn't want to create a situation where the lobbying bill \ngot tied up forever over this issue, and the Senator from West Virginia \nsaid he would do that if I kept this amendment on the lobbying bill. So \nI agreed to put the amendment off and bring it forward at this time. \nSo, hopefully, no one, when we get to this issue of cloture, is going \nto vote against cloture on the theory that it is not appropriate to \nthis bill because, as I said earlier, I think people are stopped from \nmaking that position. It is a technical legal term that basically says, \nout of fairness: You can't make that case because, basically, the \nreason this amendment is on this bill is because I was asked to put it \non this bill by the majority leader. Therefore, that is why we are \ngoing forward at this time.\n  So this is going to be the opportunity for Members of the Senate to \nvote on whether they believe a tool which will significantly improve \nour capacity to manage earmarks, to manage waste, is going to have a \nchance to be passed. It is a tool which has been offered by myself but \nwhich was actually offered by Senator Daschle and which was actually \nvoted for by 37 members of the Democratic Party at that time, 20 of \nwhom are still serving in the Senate. So it does seem to me that it is \nnot unreasonable to ask that we take it up and pass it at this time and \nmove it forward.\n  When we get to the cloture debate, I will have more to say on the \nmatter, but I did want to come down and express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Tennessee for supporting the amendment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from New \nHampshire would allow me to ask him a question or two.\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire was \nGovernor, as I was, and my sense of this amendment is that it \nunderstands human nature pretty well. Is it not the Senator's \nexperience as Governor, and as a member of the Appropriations Committee \nfor a long time, that sometimes items slip through, and that the idea \nhere would be for the President to be able to just send it back to \nCongress and say: Don't you want to take a second look at this before \nyou actually spend taxpayers' money? Is that not the general idea that \nis expressed by this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his question. He is absolutely \nright. The essence of his question is that the power is retained with \nthe legislative branch. This is not a line-item veto. This is not a \nveto. This is just the President saying to us, the legislators who have \nthe power of the purse, take another look at this, which is why Senator \nByrd supported it the last time it was on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If the President sends a package of proposals back and \nasks: Do you really want to spend this money, and if a majority of the \nSenate decides that it did, and a majority of the House decides that it \ndidn't, what happens then?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, answering the Senator through the Chair, then the \nmoney gets spent. If either House does not agree with the rescission, \nthen the rescission fails. So the power of the legislative branch is \nretained, which is its constitutional authority, to spend money as it \ndeems appropriate, and the President has no capacity to override that \nunder this bill. All he has is the capacity to say to the legislative \nbranch: Do you think you want to do this? If either House says, yes, we \ndo, then the money is spent.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. One final question, Mr. President. Does the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire believe that Federal spending is one of the most \ndifficult challenges we have here and is a matter that will need a \nbipartisan approach? And that we need to employ all the reasonable \ntools that we can to try to bring Federal spending under control? \nOtherwise, we are going to create a massive crisis for our children and \nour grandchildren, and this proposal would be one such reasonable tool.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his question, which \nmay have been rhetorical, and certainly I agree with that. To put this \nin context, we have to remember we are going to spend close to $3 \ntrillion--we probably will spend $3 trillion this year in the \nappropriating accounts and in our budgets. There is no way we can \nmanage all that efficiently, but certainly every tool that we can get \nthat helps us manage it efficiently we should have. This is just \nanother tool in the tool box to make sure we don't waste the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I rise to talk about a portion of the \nPresident's address last night that I think is extremely important. I \nhave heard from many of my colleagues in this body and on the talk \nshows that there are serious concerns about the war in Iraq. Primarily, \nthey are saying we need to change our strategy; we shouldn't be \ninvolved in a civil war. We should be involving the Iraqis themselves \nin taking care of the civil war. We ought to be providing more--we \nought to ensure the Iraqi Government cuts the Sunnis in on the oil \nrevenues and makes them full economic partners. We need to bring in the \nfriendly neighbors in the region, those countries that want to see a \npeaceful and stable Iraq, and we ought to be following the Baker-\nHamilton report.\n  As I listened to the President's speech last night, that is precisely \nwhat he did. This is a new strategy we have in Iraq. We have heard in \nour open Intelligence Committee hearings that now, for the first time, \nwe believe Prime Minister al-Maliki and his Sunni and Kurdish fellow \nelected leaders believe they can take over and restore order in that \ncountry, and they are willing to crack down on the Shia death squads, \nsuch as Muqtada al-Sadr. We have seen reports of that in the media. \nThey report that the neighboring countries are willing now to come in \nand help with reconstruction, provide job opportunities for young \nunemployed men to keep them from becoming insurgents or terrorists, and \nthis, they say, is our best chance.\n  Frankly, for Prime Minister al-Maliki and his government, this is \nprobably their last chance. This is an opportunity where al-Maliki \nsaid: If you will provide some additional support as we go in, get our \ntroops up to speed and clear and hold Baghdad, we will take over the \ncountry.\n  That is what we need to do to bring a successful conclusion to this \nwar and to draw out our military. We are probably going to have our \nmilitary in the region for a long time because, as the President said, \nthis is a generational war against radical Islam and the terror they \nbring.\n  I wanted to just briefly note a comment. Last night we heard that the \nmilitary is against the war. Well, there may be some in the military \nwho are against the war, but I can tell my colleagues, I have spent a \nlot of time listening to Missouri soldiers and marines, people who have \nbeen on the ground. I have gotten reports from them continually. I have \nseen newspaper reports about the people who have come back, the \nsoldiers who have come back.\n  For example, one woman has written a book. She served with the Army's \n101st Airborne. She lost her husband in the war. She says:\n\n       It is hard to stay positive about Iraq because of what you \n     see on the news. But I was able to be there and I know what a \n     difference we are making there.\n\n  Others, such as 1SG Stephanie Leonard, was moved to tears, saying \nthat they are heroes for helping the Iraqi people. She said:\n\n       It is not a 24-hour war. We want things to be in a hurry. \n     As soon as the Iraqi police are able to secure their own \n     country, that is when the window begins to open.\n\n  These are just some of the many comments I have seen in print in \nMissouri and heard people express. They want to see us win. They know \nthey are doing the job. They believe the liberal national media has \npainted a very unflattering and untrue picture, and that is why our \ntroops think they are not getting a fair shake.\n  But in that context, in the context of what the President did, let's \ntalk about\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\nthe resolutions which are being discussed. If the President is on the \ntrack to respond to all of the ideas about how we ought to change our \ndirection in Iraq--and I believe he is--what will the resolutions do?\n  Well, proponents of the resolutions say they want to support the \ntroops, but the resolutions don't do that. Clearly, I believe there is \nan agreement now that we are not going to try to use the congressional \npower of the purse to cut off funding and force an immediate withdrawal \nfrom Iraq because that would be madness. The Director of National \nIntelligence told our committee:\n\n       Precipitous withdrawal could lead to a collapse of the \n     government of that country and a collapse of their security \n     forces because we simply don't think they are ready to take \n     over, to assume full control of their fiscal \n     responsibilities.\n\n  To simply withdraw now would have catastrophic effects, and that is a \nquite widely held view inside of Iraq itself. If we were to cut off \nfunds, the CIA Director said it would lead, No. 1, to increased killing \nof Iraqi civilians.\n  No. 2, the establishment by al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden of the \nbase of operations for their war to establish a worldwide caliphate \nbeginning in the Middle East, taking over the areas of Iraq which would \nbe out of control and would bring people in from other countries in a \npossible civil war.\n  If we remember, that is what happened in Vietnam. When Congress cut \noff the purse, we saw our allies slaughtered in Vietnam, and some 2 to \n2.5 million people in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were killed. A \npossible slaughter of people in the Middle East who have supported us \nwould ensue.\n  General Maples, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told \nour committee 2 weeks ago:\n\n        . . . A failure in Iraq would empower the jihadist \n     movement. It would give that base of operations from which \n     the jihadist movement would extend. And it's consistent with \n     the goals of Al Qaida in Iraq to establish that Islamic \n     state, and then to expand it into the caliphate. I also think \n     that there, of course, will be very significant regional \n     impacts both in terms of stability to other countries--\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak an additional 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The time for morning business has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Missouri is asking for 4 additional \nminutes?\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for 4 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection to the Senator proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. It will \nbe charged against the minority side.\n  Mr. BOND. General Maples also told the Senate Intelligence Committee \nthat a withdrawal from Iraq could leave Iraq's vast oil reserves in the \nhands of jihadists. We can imagine what trouble that would lead to.\n  If we are not using our power to cut off the funds and force a hasty \nwithdrawal, what are we doing? Are we telling the 21,000 brave men and \nwomen who are going to Iraq we are uncomfortable with the dangerous \nmission they are about to undertake but not offering any alternative? I \nam sure they will find that very encouraging. They will be delighted to \nknow we don't like what they are doing but they will have to do it \nanyhow.\n  If the goal of the resolution is to let the American people know we \nare uncomfortable with the situation in Iraq, I guess that makes for \ngood politics. But, personally, I think it is wrong and irresponsible. \nIt is irresponsible because if we approve this resolution, the whole \nworld will be listening, including the worst actors in Iraq. We will be \ntelling the Sunni terror cells and the Shia militias that America's \npolitical will is wavering.\n  If the members of al-Qaida in Iraq are finding themselves discouraged \nby the United States military's relentless pursuit, I am sure they will \ntake comfort from these political gestures. If the Iraqis who support \nand encourage the Shia death squads are feeling the heat of United \nStates-led and supported operations and are contemplating a compromise \nthat might bring sectarian killing to an end, I am sure they will take \ncomfort from the political gesture to hold on a little longer.\n  One of the keys to a successful counterinsurgency campaign is to wear \ndown the enemy's resolve. This resolution will do the opposite. It will \nencourage Sunni terrorists and Shia death squads, letting them know if \nthey hang on longer, the United States will not have the political will \nto outlast them.\n  One of the ironies of the resolution is that it condemns a \nrecommendation that comes from a group the Senate requested in \nlegislation. The Iraq Study Group's report recommended that the Iraqi \ngovernment:\n\n        . . . accelerate assuming responsibility for Iraqi \n     security by increasing the number and quality of Iraqi Army \n     brigades. While this process is underway, and to facilitate \n     it, the United States should significantly increase the \n     number of U.S. military personnel, including combat troops, \n     imbedded in and supporting Iraqi Army units. As these actions \n     proceed, U.S. combat forces could begin to move out of Iraq.\n\n  So let me make sure I have this right. The Senate demanded the \nlegislation. The Iraq Study Group put together recommendations. The \nstudy group came forward and made recommendations and the President had \nthe temerity to accept some of them, and now we are going to vote out a \nresolution condemning them for accepting those recommendations?\n  General Petraeus said this week to the Committee on Armed Services \nthat he needs the 21,000 troops to get the job done. Are we telling him \nwe don't think we should have those troops?\n  I have to confess, even as a Senator, I can't tell you exactly what \nwe are trying to say in these resolutions. Are we expressing concern \nand discomfort with the situation in Iraq? I can't imagine how that \nwould help. But more importantly, I can imagine lots of ways in which \nit will not help.\n  Look at the confusion within our Government in 1993 when the military \nhad concerns about congressional intentions over our involvement in \nSomalia and how they prevented a request for armor that could have \nsaved the lives of American soldiers. It is not a perfect analogy, of \ncourse, but I think it offers an important warning of the danger of \nmixed message like the one we will send with this resolution.\n\n  Our commander on the ground in Somalia in 1993, General Montgomery, \nrequested a small unit of tanks and armored vehicles, as a quick \nreaction force in case our troops got bogged down or surrounded in the \ndense urban sprawl of Mogadishu, as they eventually did.\n  Les Aspin, the Secretary of Defense at the time, denied the \ncommander's request. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that \n``Congressional concerns about U.S. military involvement in Somalia \nwere a factor in his decision to deny General Montgomery's request for \narmor.''\n  General Montgomery also told the Armed Services Committee that he \nwould have used that armor in October 1993 ``Blackhawk Down'' incident \nto rescue our troops who were bogged down in urban combat with Somali \nmilitia men. General Montgomery said that if he had that armor, ``we \nwould have gotten there faster. We would have taken fewer casualties.''\n  My fear is that, in addition to the message this resolution will send \nto our enemies about our lack of resolve, it will also send a wrong and \nconfusing message to our military commanders.\n  Just like we did in Somalia in 1993, we are pretty much saying that \nwhile the President should not pull our military out of Iraq, they \nshouldn't bother asking for what they need to get the job done and \nprotect themselves while they are there.\n  General Petraeus raised this very same issue in his testimony this \nweek in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said that he \nworried about what message this resolution. would send to his soldiers \nand himself.\n  If we are going to leave our troops in Iraq, as we should, we should \nalso give them everything they need to protect themselves and get their \njob done. Just as importantly, we should not leave them with the \nmistaken impression that they shouldn't bother to ask for what they \nneed.\n  Congress cannot, and should not micromanage the war in Iraq--the \ntroops in the field like to call that the 8,000 mile screwdriver. If \nany Senator wants to propose legislation to compel a withdrawal from \nIraq, so be it, and let's vote on the matter.\n  If not, let's stop trying to micromanage by resolution, suggestion \nand\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\ngesture, put away the 8,000 mile screwdriver, and give the President's \nplan a chance to succeed.\n  The Deputy Director of National Intelligence, Tom Fingar, told the \nSenate Intelligence Committee this week that gains in stability in Iraq \ncould open a window for gains in sectarian reconciliation. I agree, and \nwe have to give the President's plan a chance to succeed if we want to \nopen that window.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have two pertinent articles \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 12, 2005]\n\n              Bronze Star Winner Sees Fruit of Her Efforts\n\n                        (By Mary Delach Leonard)\n\n       Last January, Sgt. 1st Class Stephanie Leonard was moved to \n     tears as she watched news reports of the national elections \n     in Iraq.\n       ``When I saw people running around with their ink-colored \n     fingers, I cried. I knew it was worth it. And I realized \n     something important: Without soldiers and without people who \n     support their soldiers, that day would have never come,'' she \n     said.\n       ``People overuse the word hero, but I felt like a hero that \n     day.''\n       Leonard, 43, of Normandy, served in Iraq two years ago, \n     shortly after the start of the war. She was assigned to the \n     135th Military History Detachment of the Missouri National \n     Guard, and her job was to gather stories of war. Her three-\n     soldier unit crisscrossed the Sunni Triangle from April to \n     August 2003 interviewing and photographing members of the \n     Third Corps Support Command.\n       The information they gathered will eventually be stored at \n     the Center for Military History in Washington.\n       ``Believe it or not, the military really does like to learn \n     from its successes and failures, and this is one way we can \n     do that,'' Leonard says.\n       She performed her duty so well, she was awarded the Bronze \n     Star for meritorious service; she was the first female \n     soldier of the Missouri Guard to earn the honor.\n       Leonard says people are always curious about the medal and \n     are often surprised to discover that the Bronze Star is \n     awarded not only for valor but, as in her case, for doing an \n     outstanding job.\n       ``It was all about the mission,'' she said.\n\n\n                          Women are in combat\n\n       Leonard is manager of information technology at Aramark in \n     St. Louis--she calls herself a computer geek--and says that \n     her life is pretty well back to normal. But she is concerned \n     for her friends in Guard units currently serving in Iraq. She \n     is aware that Americans are growing impatient and that some \n     politicians have called for a timetable to begin withdrawing \n     U.S. troops.\n       ``It's not a 24-hour war, and, as Americans, we want things \n     in a hurry,'' she said. ``We have to be patient. As soon as \n     the Iraqi police are able to secure their own country, then \n     that's when the window begins to open.''\n       On the day Leonard was interviewed for this story, the news \n     was grim: Six American troops had been killed and 13 injured \n     during a suicide attack on a convoy in Fallujah. The \n     headlines focused on the fact that four of the dead were \n     female Marines, and that 11 of the injured were also women. \n     Some political commentators questioned the assignments of \n     women in Iraq.\n       Although Pentagon policy excludes women from ground combat \n     units, they are allowed to serve in support units, such as \n     transportation, engineers and military police.\n       ``If women are in support roles everywhere in Iraq, then \n     women are in combat,'' Leonard said.\n       Some people are bothered by the thought of women kicking in \n     doors or assuming the role of the aggressor, she said.\n       ``But we have female firefighters and women police \n     officers, and they are trained to kick in doors.''\n       Loss of life is tragic, whether male or female, Leonard \n     said.\n       ``Bullets don't differentiate.''\n       Although her unit traveled in unsecured combat zones in \n     Iraq, Leonard said she never felt as though male soldiers \n     treated her differently or tried to protect her.\n       ``I think I was more protective of them,'' she said. ``They \n     knew I could take care of myself.''\n\n\n                             Making choices\n\n       Since returning from Iraq, Leonard has been invited to \n     speak about her experiences before various civic groups. \n     Recently, she addressed Junior ROTC students at Beaumont High \n     School. She told them that life is all about options, choices \n     and decisions.\n       ``As you get older, choices don't get easier; they get \n     harder,'' she said.\n       Leonard points to her own life as an example. She joined \n     the National Guard 16 years ago after graduating from St. \n     Louis University because she wanted a challenge. She found \n     one in Iraq.\n       She said she embraced the U.S. mission in Iraq because, as \n     she traveled the countryside, she discovered how bad \n     conditions were for the people.\n       Leonard said she has thought about returning to Iraq--she \n     thinks she could make a contribution--but she would do so \n     reluctantly because of her family. She is particularly \n     concerned about her mother who took it hard when her youngest \n     child went to war.\n       Recently, Leonard has been thinking a lot about her time in \n     Iraq because she has been answering a detailed questionnaire \n     from the National Guard about her service.\n       ``It's a real shock to the system,'' she said. ``It can \n     bring up all sorts of memories.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Apr. 2, 2006]\n\n                         The Heart of a Soldier\n\n\n Missouri veteran of Iraq war reflects on life, love and grief in her \n                                new book\n\n                        (By Mary Delach Leonard)\n\n       Kate Blaise is back home in northeastern Missouri, an \n     hour's drive from just about anywhere and a lifetime away \n     from the desert of northern Iraq, where she served for a year \n     with the Army's 10lst Airborne Division.\n       These days, her life is an open book, told in candid detail \n     in her recently published autobiography ``The Heart of a \n     Soldier: A True Story of Love, War and Sacrifice.'' But the \n     residents of Macon, her hometown of 5,500, already knew the \n     basic plot line:\n       How the former Kate Decker, who grew up wanting to join the \n     Army, completed ROTC training in college and then rose to the \n     rank of captain.\n       How, as a logistics officer, she convoyed across Iraq \n     during the opening days of the war.\n       How she married her high school sweetheart, Mike Blaise, \n     who would become a chief warrant officer with the 101st He \n     was a pilot who loved flying Kiowa helicopters and who saw \n     his share of combat.\n       How they served together in Iraq and how she made it home \n     safely--but he did not.\n       ``Some people tell me that they know how it ends, and yet \n     they hope for a different ending,'' Blaise says.\n       An ending where a Kiowa won't crash in the desert on a \n     dark, windy January night in 2004, the eve of her unit's \n     departure for home.\n       Others have told her that although they didn't know her \n     husband, they feel like they do after reading her story.\n       ``That's why I wrote the book,'' she says simply.\n\n\n                            A story to tell\n\n       Since the book's publication in January, Blaise, who just \n     turned 30, has gracefully accepted her new role as author, \n     along with all of the trimmings--public appearances and media \n     interviews.\n       On this spring morning, she was in neighboring Atlanta, a \n     town of about 500 people, to speak at Atlanta C-3, a well-\n     used brick complex that houses all of the district's 220 \n     students, from kindergarten through high school.\n       Mike Blaise attended this school through eighth grade, \n     until his family moved to Macon.\n       ``Your teachers asked me to come today to speak about \n     attitude. I had the attitude that nobody was going to tell me \n     that I couldn't do what I wanted to accomplish,'' Blaise told \n     the students who lined the wooden bleachers of the \n     gymnasium--third-graders to her left, high schoolers to \n     her right.\n       ``Life takes a lot of turns you don't expect. Bad stuff \n     happens. I've lived the life I've somewhat planned. I did \n     join the Army. I also wrote a book. And I certainly never \n     thought I would write a book.''\n       Dressed in khakis and an olive green Harley-Davidson shirt, \n     Blaise stood before the microphone looking at ease, although \n     she admitted to being nervous about speaking in public. So \n     she made herself more comfortable, perching on a table where \n     she would later sign copies of her book.\n       The students listened respectfully, their hands waving in \n     the air when she asked if they had questions. The third-\n     graders wanted to know what it was like in Iraq. So she \n     talked about the gritty sand, camel spiders and heat that can \n     reach beyond 120 degrees.\n       The high schoolers wanted to know whether she still \n     believes in the war. And, on this issue, she stands as solid \n     as a storm cellar during a tornado.\n       ``It's hard to stay positive about Iraq because of what you \n     see on the news, but I was able to be there, and I know what \n     a difference we are making there,'' she says firmly. ``The \n     main thing is that we gave the Iraqi people the power to make \n     their own decisions.''\n       Though much of this was serious talk, she kept the mood \n     light, particularly when the questions had to do with her \n     writing.\n       ``I don't have to worry about my dad finding out about \n     anything I've done--I've written a book,'' she said with a \n     smile.\n       Getting published was the result of a series of right-\n     place-at-the-right-time moments, starting when a women's \n     golfing magazine asked her to write about a makeshift course \n     at her Army base in Iraq.\n       ``I am blessed,'' she says. ``I didn't have to work nearly \n     as hard as most authors have to work.''\n       But the material for her story--the living of it--was hard-\n     earned and paid for in full.\n\n\n                             a time to heal\n\n       After leaving the Army, Blaise came home to heal.\n       She grew up on Crestview Street in a newer section of \n     Macon, the seat of Macon County, about 150 miles from St. \n     Louis. Not\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\n     far from her old neighborhood, Blaise found her perfect \n     house, though it needed some fixing, too.\n       Her father, Steve Decker, a former civil engineer for the \n     state, lives nearby on a 250-acre farm that has been in the \n     Decker family for generations.\n       Blaise has slowly remodeled the house, painting the rooms \n     in deep, rich colors, and the kitchen a cheery 1950s red and \n     white. Walls hold framed photos with military themes--she is \n     an avid student of military history--and photos of Mike \n     Blaise. His Air Cavalry hat is in the living room, resting \n     atop the triangular case that holds his medals and the \n     American flag that draped his casket.\n       It was in this home that Blaise came to terms with her \n     loss. For the better part of a year, she spent hours in her \n     office, writing chapters and e-mailing them to Dana White, a \n     writer-editor in New York, who co-authored her book.\n       She says the toughest part wasn't writing about the night \n     in Iraq when she was told of her husband's helicopter \n     accident.\n       ``It's easy to be sad about the sad things,'' she says. \n     ``It was the happy parts that were the hardest. They made me \n     miss him more.''\n       The Mike Blaise she loved was a big guy who took her deer \n     hunting and made her laugh and liked to sing country songs in \n     karaoke bars.\n       The book is, in fact, full of happy times, a tribute to \n     growing up in small-town America.\n       She tells tales on her younger brother and three older \n     sisters--in particular her sister Lindsey, who served in Iraq \n     with the Missouri National Guard.\n       Blaise writes that her mother's injury in a car accident \n     was the day that changed everything for her. Marie Decker \n     survived but now lives in a long-term care facility.\n       The book is also a tribute to the tenacity of women who \n     have found homes and carved out careers in the predominantly \n     male world of the military. Blaise has little patience with \n     recent political skirmishes that would have limited the roles \n     of servicewomen in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       ``This genie is out of the bottle, and no amount of coaxing \n     will get her back in,'' she says in her book.\n       But mostly, the book is a tribute to the life and love of a \n     devoted couple who struggled to maintain their marriage \n     through long separations and their share of disappointments. \n     She says her late husband would have insisted on such \n     honesty.\n       ``Mike would have been uncomfortable being glorified,'' she \n     says.\n       She still has Scout, the dog the Blaises adopted while \n     serving in Korea. He is a prize, with his baby-seal face and \n     Yodalike ears, a black and white softie who warily eyes \n     strangers and barks at the Amish buggies that pass by their \n     house on U.S. Highway 36.\n       Though writing the book was an emotional ordeal, it also \n     helped her come to grips with her sadness, she says.\n       ``The day I finished writing, I felt an overwhelming sense \n     of peace,'' she says.\n\n\n                            the next chapter\n\n       Blaise jokes that some people in Macon feared she was \n     writing a tell-all. And, in effect, that's what she did--she \n     told it all, as it related to her life.\n       ``I think her experience growing up was all of our \n     experiences. Nothing could shock us,'' said Sharon \n     Pennington, who teaches business and computer classes at \n     Atlanta and remembers Mike Blaise as a shy youngster, two \n     years younger than she is.\n       Kathy Baker, the school superintendent's secretary, was \n     first in line to have Blaise autograph her book.\n       ``I haven't read it. I can't,'' said Baker, her eyes \n     growing moist. ``It's too close.''\n       Baker knows many of Blaise's relatives, including Mike's \n     grandfather, Virgil, whom everyone called Grampy. He died \n     while the Blaises were still in Iraq, and Mike Blaise is \n     buried next to him in Shelby Memorial Cemetery.\n       Blaise says she's not really sure what she will do with the \n     rest of her life. She says she would consider writing another \n     book, perhaps about grief, which she knows a lot about. \n     Though people gave her books on grief, she found them less \n     than helpful with their flowery sentiments. Her book would be \n     more real.\n       ``It's hard to grieve,'' she says. ``It sucks, and it's \n     going to suck for a long time.''\n       In the meantime, Blaise has joined the Missouri National \n     Guard's 175th Military Police, based in Columbia, because \n     being in the military remains important to her.\n       ``It's the one thing that I do that's for the greater \n     good,'' she says.\n       When the unit was sent to New Orleans after Hurricane \n     Katrina, she found the deployment satisfying in a new way.\n       ``I had never done anything that helped Americans,'' Blaise \n     said.\n       Blaise recently got engaged to a helicopter pilot who knew \n     her late husband in flight school. Ironically, it was Mike \n     Blaise's affection for his Harley-Davidson motorcycle that \n     brought this new love into her life. They met while riding \n     their Harleys to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South \n     Dakota, fulfilling a wish that Mike had made to attend the \n     event after the war.\n       Blaise says she wasn't looking for romance, and neither was \n     her fiancee. It was an unexpected gift, another of those \n     life's blessings she often talks about.\n       ``Knowing that Mike knew him somehow eases the guilt,'' she \n     says. ``God doesn't always agree with what you set for \n     yourself. ``\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1011-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But \nthe fundamental issue we have before the Senate is the issue of an \nincrease in the minimum wage--an increase in the minimum wage which has \nnot taken place over the period of the last 10 years, and which I am \nvery hopeful we will get strong bipartisan support for.\n  If you look over the history of the minimum wage, the nine different \ntimes we have raised the minimum wage, we have had bipartisan support \nfor that increase. It has only been in the very recent years that \nRepublican leadership has led the fight against it. We now have new \nleadership in the\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nHouse and the Senate and the Democratic leadership that brought this \nmatter forward. We offer an open hand to our Republican friends to \nsupport this program, which is so important to so many working \nfamilies.\n  From our earliest days, we have been a nation of strong values--\nparticularly fairness and opportunity and concern for our fellow \ncitizens. While we are a country of individualists, we have always \nrecognized that America is strongest when we all prosper together. One \nof the earliest governing documents in our history, the Mayflower \nCompact, talked about laws that would support ``the general good.'' \nLater, in the preamble to our Constitution, we pledged that our \nGovernment would ``promote the general welfare.''\n  That is our proud history. Our Nation has thrived because we have \nmade a commitment to shared prosperity. The vote we will cast today is \na measure of our commitment to these values.\n  Minimum wage workers have been waiting for a raise for 10 long and \ndifficult years. They have worked more than one job. They have saved \nevery penny they can for the future of their children. They have \ndecided each day what food they can afford and what bills they can pay.\n  Americans understand fairness, and they know this is unfair. They \nhave called on us time and again to raise the minimum wage, but time \nand again--year after year--this Congress has turned its back on \nworking families.\n  It is wrong that hard-working men and women cannot afford to put food \non the table or heat their homes. It is wrong that our productivity \nsoars, but our lowest paid workers fall further and further behind. And \nit would be wrong to demand a price of more and more tax breaks before \nthese hard-working families get the raise they have earned.\n  Congress has voted itself a raise eight times over the past 10 years, \nwhile minimum wage workers have received nothing. Congress never \ndemanded a price for increasing its wages. So why should we demand a \nprice for giving minimum wage workers a raise? What is good enough for \nCongress surely is good enough for American workers. I say Congress \nshould do unto others what it has done for itself. And we have not just \nbeen doing for ourselves. Over the last 10 years, we have done a whole \nlot for corporate America. We have given them $276 billion in corporate \ntax breaks. We have done a lot for the wealthiest Americans, who have \nseen their incomes skyrocket with generous tax giveaways. Why can't we \ndo one thing for minimum wage workers? No strings attached, no \ngiveaways for the powerful--why can't we do this one simple thing \nbecause it is the right thing to do?\n  Minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity. They do some of \nthe most difficult back-breaking jobs in our society. They clean our \noffices. They serve our food. They take care of our children in \npreschools, and care for our elderly in nursing homes. They deserve a \nfair wage that respects the dignity of their work, and they should not \nhave to live in poverty.\n  President Kennedy once said:\n\n       If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it \n     cannot save the few who are rich.\n\n  We are a rich nation, but unless we do more to help the poorest \nAmericans, we will not be able to save ourselves.\n  We have an opportunity today to take one bold step toward solving the \nproblem of poverty in this great Nation. Today--right now--we can pass \nthe House bill and send it to the President. We can raise the minimum \nwage and give 13 million hard-working people hope for a brighter \nfuture.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join me in \nvoting for minimum wage workers today. This should not be a partisan \nissue. It is about standing behind our values. It is long past time to \ndo the right thing and give minimum wage workers a raise.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I see the floor manager from our side, \nSenator Gregg, on the floor. I talked to him about yielding me 10 \nminutes from our time. I ask if that is still acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 101\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk specifically about the second-look-at-\nwasteful-spending amendment which is pending and that we will vote on \nhere in a few moments. I hope to come back later today, perhaps, and \ntalk more generally about the minimum wage bill that is pending, the \nunderlying bill, and talk about how I hope our goal would be to train \nand educate American workers to fill good, high-paying jobs that \ncurrently go wanting for lack of a trained workforce. I would hope we \nwould spend at least as much of our efforts on training them, providing \nthem the alternatives to earn those higher, good wages as we spend \nfocusing on the 2.5 percent of the workforce who actually earn the \nminimum wage--generally people who are starting into the workforce: \nteenagers, part-time workers, and the like--and how, notwithstanding \nour best of intentions, some of our actions here, by Government \nactually setting a minimum wage, may actually put some of them out of \nwork.\n  But I would focus on the second-look-at-wasteful-spending amendment \nand challenge our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in a good \nway.\n  Since we have come back after the election, and we have this new \n110th Congress, we have heard a lot of very appropriate commentary on \nboth sides of the aisle about the importance of our working together in \norder to solve some of the Nation's most serious problems. The \nPresident talked about that last night. One of the areas the President \nspoke about last night in his State of the Union Message--and I hear an \nawful lot about from my constituents--is concern about wasteful \nspending.\n  Indeed, a lot of what we did on a bipartisan basis this last week on \nlobbying and ethics reform was to turn the bright light of public \nscrutiny on the earmark process--special appropriations stuck in bills \nthat frequently benefit individuals and groups--to turn the bright \nlight on those, offer greater transparency, so the public can know how \ntheir tax dollars are being spent and, hopefully, people understanding \nthat whatever they do will be exposed to public scrutiny, they will \nmake sure their conduct in doing so conforms with the highest ethical \nstandards they have a right to expect from us.\n  But the fact is that Presidents on both sides of the aisle--President \nClinton, when he was President; now President Bush--have sought the \nauthority of the line-item veto or, in this instance, what we are \ntalking about is the so-called enhanced rescission. It is a process \nwhere the President, once an appropriations bill is sent over to him, \nhighlights a concern he or she has about an appropriations bill, and \nsends it back over to the Congress to reconsider.\n  This is a way to provide the kind of laser-like focus we need to have \non wasteful spending projects that occasionally--some might say more \nthan occasionally--creep into our Federal appropriations process.\n  In the spirit of bipartisanism that I think the American people would \nlike to see when confronting some of our biggest challenges, my hope \nwould be that Members of this Congress--Members of this Senate--on a \nbipartisan basis, would support the very kind of bill this represents, \nand that they were advocating for when Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nleader, offered and sponsored with the support of at least 21 Democrats \nwhen President Clinton was in office.\n  I hold up a chart. I showed this yesterday, but I think it is worth \nlooking at again. This chart is a comparison of the Daschle and Gregg \nexpedited rescission amendments. You can see in all respects the \nDaschle amendment--here, again, Tom Daschle, the Senator from South \nDakota, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, offered an amendment \nwhich in all respects, except two--I will talk about that in a minute--\nis the same as Senator Gregg is proposing, the so-called second-look-\nat-wasteful-spending amendment.\n  The only two ways they differ is that the Gregg amendment does permit \nrescission of new mandatory spending. If you look at the places where \nmoney is being spent fastest in the Federal budget, it is in mandatory \nor entitlement\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nprograms, which are going up at the rate of 8 percent or more a year, \non autopilot. I applaud Senator Gregg for including a provision that \npermits rescission of new mandatory spending programs.\n  But that and permitting four rescission packages annually, those are \nthe two areas where the Gregg amendment differs, albeit in a relatively \nminor way, from what Senator Daschle proposed in 1995.\n  You will see on this next chart, here is a list of the current Senate \nDemocrats who supported the Daschle amendment in 1995. My hope would \nbe, with this little refresher for our colleagues who actually \nsupported this good policy back in 1995, that they would see fit to \nvote to close off debate and to actually have an up-or-down vote on the \nGregg amendment.\n  As I said, if it was good policy in 1995, supported by these good \nDemocratic colleagues, I think they would agree--I would hope they \nwould agree--it is a good policy in 2007 or, if it is not, I would hope \nthey would come to the floor and explain their change of heart because \nI think it would represent a change in position.\n  So this amendment goes to the heart of what I hear people express \ntheir concerns about most as I travel back in my State and as I read \nand listen to people's concerns, as expressed through the media, that \nFederal spending and our failure to be good trustees of the Federal tax \ndollar is one of their biggest concerns, along, obviously, with \nnational security issues such as the war in Iraq. The other issue I \nhear a lot about--the President talked about it last night--is \nimmigration reform.\n  Mr. President, I see the budget chairman on the floor, and I know he \nand Senator Gregg have committed to work on a bipartisan basis to try \nto deal with not just these issues, such as earmarks that abuse the \npublic trust, and which somehow slip into our appropriations process, \nbut to look at the larger picture and try to figure out how we can \nsustain some of the most important programs the American people have \ncome to rely upon, things such as Social Security and Medicare, and \nthat we not continue to spend in a way that imposes a financial burden \nfor those programs on our children and grandchildren. That raises a \nprofound moral issue that I believe we must confront.\n  So I do appreciate the efforts that are being made to try to deal \nwith some of our hardest problems. I think there is a great opportunity \nprovided here. Some might find this a little surprising for me to say \nbeing a Republican, but I think divided Government provides an \nopportunity for this body to do some very big and important and \nsignificant things. I do not think politics has to be a zero-sum game \nwhere Democrats win and Republicans lose, or Republicans win and \nDemocrats lose in the public policymaking process. I think we can all \nwin, and in so doing the American people can win, if we will simply \ncome together in a commonsense, result-oriented sort of way and try to \nsolve some of these problems.\n  I think Senator Gregg's amendment picks up on the wisdom of Senator \nDaschle's amendment back in 1995. And I frankly would be perplexed if \nwe were unable to get the kind of bipartisan support to close off \ndebate, to have an up-or-down vote on the floor, and demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that, you know what, we heard the message on November \n7, and you know what, we get it. We understand what you were telling \nus. You wanted us to work together, and we are working together to try \nto solve some of our Nation's biggest problems.\n\n  We reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls 13 \nminutes, the Senator from Massachusetts controls 7\\1/2\\ minutes, and \nthe Republicans control 11 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I ask the Chair to inform me when I \nhave consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for his remarks about \nSenator Gregg and me and our proposal to try to work on the overall \nmajor challenges facing us, which are long-term fiscal imbalances that \nare especially affected by the entitlement programs and the baby boom \ngeneration and the existing structural deficit we confront. We are \nengaged in a good-faith effort to try to address these long-term \nchallenges. We were at breakfast together yesterday discussing those. I \nappreciate the Senator from Texas mentioning that.\n  With respect to this specific proposal, I don't think it merits our \nsupport. In fact, it is a very serious mistake to go in this direction. \nThis amendment is actually dangerous. I say that with great respect to \nthe former chairman of the Budget Committee who has offered the \namendment. I believe it is dangerous because this transfers power in a \nway the Founding Fathers did not envision and would not have supported. \nThe power of the purse resides in the Congress of the United States \nbecause the Founding Fathers recognized that putting too much power in \nthe hands of one person was a dangerous matter.\n  Here are the things that are wrong with this line-item veto proposal. \nI will go on to address the big differences between the Daschle \nproposal and this one, but here is what is wrong with this line-item \nveto proposal: It represents an abdication of congressional \nresponsibility; it shifts too much power to the executive branch, with \nvery little impact on the deficit; it provides the President up to a \nyear to submit rescission requests; requires Congress to vote within 10 \ndays; provides no opportunity for extended debate; and allows the \nPresident to cancel new mandatory spending passed by Congress, such as \nthose dealing with Social Security, Medicare, veterans, and \nagriculture. That is breathtaking power. In fact, we could have this \nnegotiation that the Senator from Texas was referencing between \nDemocrats and Republicans on what has to be done to the long-term \ncircumstance with Social Security and Medicare, we could reach a \nbipartisan conclusion, and then the President would have the unilateral \npower to come back and cherry-pick those provisions he didn't like. No \nPresident should be given that power.\n  Let's talk about the line-item veto. This is what USA Today said in \nan editorial last year: It is a convenient distraction.\n\n       The vast bulk of the deficit is not the result of self-\n     aggrandizing line items, infuriating as they are. The deficit \n     is primarily caused by unwillingness to make hard choices on \n     benefit programs or to levy the taxes to pay for the true \n     costs of government.\n\n  This is an article from the Roanoke Times last year:\n\n       [T]he President already has the only tool he needs: The \n     veto.\n\n  He has veto power. He can veto any one of these spending bills.\n\n       He has chosen not to veto a single one. That Bush has \n     declined to challenge Congress in five-plus years is his \n     choice. The White House no doubt sees reviving this debate as \n     a means of distracting people from the missteps, \n     miscalculations, mistruths and mistakes that have dogged Bush \n     and sent his approval rating south.\n       The current problems are not systemic; they are \n     ideological. A line-item veto will not magically grant \n     lawmakers fiscal discipline and economic sense.\n\n  On the question of whether this has any effect on the deficit, this \nis the Acting CBO Director last year before the Congress, his \ntestimony:\n\n       Such tools, however, cannot establish fiscal discipline \n     unless there is political consensus to do so . . . In the \n     absence of that consensus, the proposed changes to the \n     rescission process . . . are unlikely to greatly affect the \n     budget's bottom line.\n\n  This is from CQ, Congressional Quarterly, again of last year:\n\n       Passage of [the line item veto] legislation would be ``a \n     political victory that would not address long-term problems \n     posed by growing entitlement programs,'' Gregg said.\n\n  Senator Gregg himself said this would be ``a political victory that \nwould not address long-term problems posed by growing entitlement \nprograms.''\n  He also said this last year in a separate publication:\n\n       Senator Gregg said it would have ``very little impact on \n     the budget deficit.''\n\n  He is right. The impact it would have is to transfer enormous power \nto the President. I am not just talking about this President, I am \ntalking about any future President.\n\n  This is what George Will, a conservative commentator, said:\n\n       It would aggravate an imbalance in our constitutional \n     system that has been growing\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n     for seven decades: The expansion of executive power at the \n     expense of the legislature.\n\n  Here is what an American Enterprise Institute scholar said about the \nline-item veto last year:\n\n       The larger reality is that this proposal gives the \n     President a great additional mischief making capability, to \n     pluck out items to punish lawmakers he doesn't like, or to \n     threaten individual lawmakers to get votes on other things, \n     without having any noticeable impact on budget growth or \n     restraint.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       More broadly, it simply shows the lack of institutional \n     integrity and patriotism by the majority in Congress. They \n     have lots of ways to put the responsibility on budget \n     restraint where it belongs--on themselves. Instead, they \n     willingly, even eagerly, try to turn their most basic power \n     over to the President. Shameful, just shameful.\n\n  On the question of the previous Daschle proposal, the suggestion that \nthey are the same is not true. They are fundamentally different. The \ncontext is totally different as well. The Daschle amendment was offered \nin juxtaposition to another line-item veto proposal that was clearly \nunconstitutional--in fact, was judged to be so by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. So the Daschle proposal was an attempt to defeat a proposal \nwhich was clearly unconstitutional and which has been subsequently \njudged unconstitutional.\n  But the further claim that the Gregg proposal before us now and the \nDaschle proposal are the same is clearly not correct. Let me ask three \nquestions and give answers with respect to how the two differ.\n  Can the President propose to rescind new mandatory items such as \nSocial Security and Medicare reforms? Under the Gregg proposal, yes; \nunder the Daschle proposal, no. That is a profound difference. Can you \nimagine if we were to reach an accommodation and agreement on long-term \ndifferences on these mandatory programs--Medicare, Social Security, \nagriculture, veterans--and then the President has the unilateral \nability to go change it? I don't think so. That is not a direction we \nshould take if we are going to have good-faith negotiation.\n  No. 2, can the President propose rescissions from multiple bills in \none rescissions package? Under the Gregg proposal, the answer to that \nquestion is yes. Under the Daschle proposal, the answer was no. Why \ndoes that matter? The President could take something that was very \nunpopular--for example, the bridge to nowhere--remember that? We had \nthe debate last year about the bridge to nowhere. A handful of us voted \nagainst that bridge to nowhere, by the way. I voted against it. The \nPresident could have taken that proposal and combined it with a \nproposal that was important to an individual Member and that might have \ngreat merit, and he could combine the two and kill the one with the \nother.\n  Let's be blunt. The President would have the ability to call a Member \nor have his staff call a Member and say: Look, I have a very \ncontroversial judge up there. I need your vote. And by the way, I am \nconsidering a project in your State that is critically important to \nyou. I am going to have to line-item veto that. But I might be \npersuaded not to if I could have your support on this other matter. \nThat is exactly what the Founding Fathers were concerned about--handing \nthat kind of power to a President, that kind of power over an \nindividual Member. That is a dangerous notion. It has been ruled \nunconstitutional in the past. I believe this would be ruled \nunconstitutional.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I, too, would like to speak on the line-\nitem veto amendment. This body has made a lot of progress in being much \nmore transparent in how we spend America's money. We can see, if we \nlook back over the last couple of weeks, that America appreciates what \nwe have tried to do to take these earmarks or these pet projects or \ndesignated spending, whatever we call it, and make it available for \nevery American to see. We could tell from our e-mails and letters and \nthe reports in the media that this was something which made Congress \nlook as if we were genuinely trying to be much more open and honest \nabout how we spend America's money. The amendment before us now, what \nwe refer to as the line-item veto or line-item rescission, would \nactually make this whole process much more accountable.\n  I was interested in hearing my colleague make his point that the \nPresident could take one good item and put it with a really bad item \nand send it over to us and force us to make a decision. But let's think \nabout what the President's options are now. We can send thousands of \nearmarks over in a bill to the President, and he only has two choices--\nto take it or leave it, to take the whole thing or veto the whole \nthing--and work that has been done here and in the House for months \neither has to be accepted in total or thrown out in total. That doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  I will use the exact argument my colleague did. We should not be able \nto package all this good with all this bad and try to force it down the \nPresident's throat without the ability to have the checks and balances, \nthe discussions that are needed so the American people can see we have \nthoroughly vetted these ideas and we are spending their money wisely.\n  This line-item rescission package I support because this Congress \nneeds the interaction with the President and the working relationship \nthat would be caused by this particular bill. It allows the President, \nno more than four times a year, to go through our spending bills and to \nsend those things back which he thinks are not national priorities. \nThis is not real complicated. He does not veto what we send him; he \njust gets a recommendation in the process. And since his agencies in \nthe executive branch are charged with carrying this out and spending \nthis money, the President needs to be engaged in the process in more \nthan a take-it-or-leave-it type of relationship. So no more than four \ntimes a year, the President can put together those things which he \nthinks are not national priorities and send them to the Congress. And \nall this bill does is guarantee that they get a vote.\n  If the President tries to use this against individual Members, I know \nthis body well enough to know that we are not going to pass his \nrequest.\n  Any President that tries to do that for political purposes will find \nhis rescission package, or that his recommendations to Congress will be \ndispensed with very quickly.\n  This is important not only for this President but for many Presidents \nin the future. We know as Senators and Congressmen that over the next \nseveral decades this country is going to be faced with incredible \nfiscal crises. We have no idea how we are going to pay for Medicare and \nMedicaid in the future or Social Security. It is going to become more \nimportant every year that we cut wasteful spending and that we work \nwith the President and with the House to do everything we can to cut \nthose things that are not necessary.\n  In many bills--and we know it happens--many items, earmarks, are \nvoted on for political reasons, and it is a good idea to allow the \nPresident to package those things and send them back to us so that we \ncan vote on them and move them out if they are not national priorities.\n  This is not dissimilar at all to the BRAC process we created to \neliminate unnecessary military bases. We found that Congressmen and \nSenators were not going to vote on an individual basis to eliminate a \nbase in one State because we knew that then the Congressmen or Senators \ncould vote to eliminate one in our State. It was a political dilemma \nthat caused us for years to leave bases open that should have been \nclosed.\n  It is the same with Federal programs and spending year after year. \nOne project might be in my State and one in another Senator's State. \nNone of us are willing to step up and eliminate projects one at a time. \nWe cannot vote on them that way. This line-item rescission opportunity \nis for the President to take those things that we know are not national \npriorities, put them in a package, and send them back over for us to \nvote on. We should not lose this opportunity.\n  We need the President working with the Congress to eliminate wasteful \nspending--not this year or next year but for decades to come. This may \nbe our only opportunity in a long time to make it happen. We have made \ntremendous progress on identifying the problems with corruption, \nwasteful spending, identifying earmarks, and all this\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\ndoes is allow us to take it a step further and make sure we have the \nchecks and balances from Congress and the executive branch to eliminate \nthose things we know should not be in there and the President knows \nshould not be in there.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the amendment offered by \nour colleague, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. I \nsupport the concept of what is called a ``line item veto,'' more \naccurately described as an expedited Presidential rescission. But the \nproposal offered today has some fundamental flaws that prevent me from \nvoting for it.\n  There are a number of problems with the amendment before us, but let \nme call the body's attention to two of these flaws. First, the proposal \ngoes far beyond the supposed target of this newly proposed authority; \nnamely, unauthorized earmarks. When the line item veto is discussed, \ninvariably it is the unauthorized earmark that is held up as the \nprincipal rationale justifying this new Presidential authority, and \nrightly so. The explosion in unauthorized earmarks over the last decade \nand more is a strong argument in favor of providing the President with \nadditional authority in this area. But the amendment before us goes far \nbeyond targeting earmarks. The Gregg amendment would allow the \nPresident to use the proposed expedited rescission authority to \neliminate new provisions of programs like Medicare and Social Security, \nhardly measures that anyone would consider an earmark.\n  Second, the proposal has too great a potential for political gaming. \nThe amendment allows the President to wait a full year after initial \nenactment before submitting an expedited rescission. If we are going to \ncraft new Presidential authority in this area, the goal ought to be to \neliminate the potential wasteful spending, and to do so in a \nstraightforward manner. There is no good reason for significant delay. \nPermitting the President to wait a year before submitting a proposed \nrescission opens the door for inappropriate use of potential \nrescissions as a political hammer to hold over individual Members.\n  Mr. President, as I noted earlier, I support granting the President \nsome additional authority in this area, but we need to be especially \ncareful in crafting that authority. The Gregg amendment, however well \nintended, needs substantial improvement, and until that is done, I will \noppose it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the line-\nitem veto. This misguided proposal will hurt the communities we are \nhere to represent. It will strip them of the voice they have today in \nCongress through each of us, and it will hand even more legislative \npower to the executive branch.\n  As I saw in my own experiences, both here in the Senate and in the \nWashington State Legislature, a line-item veto is subject to abuse, \npressure and horse-trading, and it violates the delicate balance of \npower that the Founders so carefully designed.\n  Now I recognize that the idea sounds attractive. It suggests that we \ncould cut spending and control the deficit without having to make any \ntough choices. Well, like a lot of ideas that sound good at first, once \nyou look into it, the painful impact becomes clear.\n  More importantly, I think all of us need to do the hard work of \ncrafting responsible budgets. We need to legislate and govern and take \nthe needs of the country and our States into consideration. We need to \nmake the tough decisions--not pass the buck to the White House.\n  I oppose the line-item veto today for the same reasons I opposed it \nin the 1990s. I voted against this gimmick when Congress handed that \npower to a Democratic President. And today I fight another attempt to \nhand that same power to a Republican President.\n  For me, it is not about the party of the Chief Executive; it is about \nmaking sure that the constituents I represent have a voice in the \nbudget decisions that affect their lives. The line-item veto is the \nwrong approach for three reasons.\n  First, it would cede a tremendous amount of power from Congress to \nthe executive branch. The Constitution is very clear that Congress has \nthe power of the purse. The Framers of our Constitution carefully \ndivided the powers of our Government between the three branches.\n  When Congress tried this before, it was ruled unconstitutional. This \ntime around, the sponsors have tweaked the bill to try to address those \nconcerns, but the underlying problem still remains. We should not be \nhanding our legislative power over to the executive branch. I made that \nargument in 1995--and it is even truer today. We have seen the Bush \nadministration aggressively try to expand Presidential power and limit \ncongressional input and oversight. We should stand our ground as the \nFounders intended--not surrender our constitutional authority to the \nexecutive branch.\n  Second, the line item veto would hurt the constituents we represent. \nThey rely on us to fight for their needs and priorities. Through the \nbudget and appropriations process, we work to meet the needs in our \nlocal communities--needs that the administration would ignore. If we \ngive up our ability to fight for our communities, our constituents will \nlose their voice because I can tell you, the communities we represent \nwill not get fair consideration from a budget official sitting in \nWashington, DC.\n  Last week, a group of constituents came to see me about a local road \nthat needs to be improved. The changes they are seeking will improve \nsafety, support economic development, and provide access to critically \nneeded housing. I represent that community, so I know firsthand those \nimprovements are needed. That community has me fighting for them and \npushing for their needs. The administration is not going to do that. \nThey are not going to send someone from Washington, DC to check out the \nroad and see that it is unsafe. In fact, these constituents had just \ncome from a meeting with an administration official who basically told \nthem that, in regard to the continuing resolution, ``Good luck, we will \nbe making the decisions this year.''\n  That is just wrong. If we hand this power to the administration, we \nwill surrender our voices, and our constituents will lose their voices \nin advocating for their communities. The families I represent know that \nif they have a problem, they can come and talk to me. But if you tell \nthem that they have to track down someone at OMB and convince them to \ncare about their local needs, our communities will suffer.\n  I came to the Senate to represent the people of my home State of \nWashington. They elected me to be their voice on a wide array of issues \naffecting everything from their safety to their health, education, and \neconomic well-being. I am not going to transfer my ability to fight for \nthe people of Washington State to this or any other President. That is \nwhat this bill proposal would do, and I strongly oppose it.\n  Third, experience has shown that the line-item veto is subject to \nabuse and may be applied unfairly by an administration. I have \nexperience with line-item veto authority. I served in my State \nlegislature and saw firsthand the kind of horse-trading that can occur \nwhen the Executive has this power.\n  When President Clinton exercised the line-item veto in 1997, we saw \nserious problems in the way it was applied. The White House put forward \nstandards for deciding which projects would be targeted. But then it \nattacked projects that actually met the standards. In 1997, I stood \nhere on the Senate floor and detailed the mistakes the Clinton \nadministration made in unfairly targeting projects for elimination. I \ndon't want to see a repeat of those mistakes.\n  Mr. President, crafting a responsible budget takes hard work. It \nrequires tough choices. There is no gimmick or trick that will make the \nhard decisions go away. Handing our power and our constituents' power \nover to the White House certainly won't do it. So I say, rather than \nspending our time on a distraction, let's work on a real budget and on \nthe real and difficult choices that are before us.\n  Let's do the job that voters sent us here to do--without gimmicks and \nwithout trampling the Constitution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in crafting our delicate system of \nchecks and balances, our Founding Fathers vested in Congress what is \ncommonly referred to as the ``power of the purse''--control over \nraising revenue and appropriating funds. While the virtue of Congress \nabdicating some of its\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\nbudget responsibility to the president is a subject of worthwhile \ndebate, the construct of Senator Gregg's Second Look at Wasteful \nSpending Act of 2007 does little to return much needed fiscal \ndiscipline to our budget process. And while I support efforts to rein \nin our spending and to solve our Nation's budget woes, Senator Gregg's \namendment would create a system far too susceptible to abuse.\n  The Gregg amendment's weakness is in its construction. Up to four \ntimes a year, the President could package his or her proposed \nrescissions in any manner he or she chooses, selecting and combining \nprovisions from any number of bills. Among the Gregg amendment's most \nsignificant flaws are the timetables it imposes. The amendment would \ngive the President up to 1 full year after enactment of a provision to \nsubmit a rescission request. Even in the event that Congress rejects \nthe President's request, the legislation still gives the President the \npower to defy the congressional vote and withhold spending for a \nprogram for up to 45 days. This formulation would effectively allow a \nPresident to hold hostage spending measures and force congressional \nvotes on new bundles of spending provisions, injecting chaos into our \nbudget process and wreaking havoc in countless other ways.\n  There is no debate that we need to curb our spending. The Bush \nadministration has run up a record debt and an unprecedented deficit, \nendangering our Nation's long-term financial health and our children's \nfuture. Unfortunately, as noted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, Senator Gregg's amendment does little to return much needed \nfiscal discipline to our budget process. I am open to considering a \ndifferent proposal, keeping in mind that what we need is measured \nreform coupled with strong leadership that will exercise fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Gregg and \nSenator McConnell's ``Second Look at Wasteful Spending'' amendment. \nWhile I would prefer that this issue be addressed on a separate bill, I \nunderstand the procedural reasons behind why my colleague from New \nHampshire is offering this amendment to the minimum wage package. I am \ntreating this amendment as separate from the rest of the minimum wage \ndebate and I hope my colleagues will do the same. I am pleased, \nhowever, that the Senate is able to debate this important issue on the \nfloor.\n  This amendment is a responsible step towards spending accountability. \nIt provides for a greater level of accountability which is critical to \nenhance the fiscal well-being of the country. Senator Gregg's proposal \nallows both Congress and the President the opportunity to seriously \nreconsider both mandatory and discretionary spending. By allowing the \nPresident to single out wasteful spending and giving Congress the final \nsay through vote on a rescission package, this amendment will help \neliminate waste, rather than perpetuate the current out of control \nspending habits.\n  By forcing Congress to take another look at spending, this amendment \ngives the President the ability to send up to four rescission packages \na year. Congress then has up to 8 days to act on the President's \nproposal through a fast track process. However, a simple majority of \nboth Houses of Congress must approve before any of the rescission \npackage can become law. Finally, any savings from the rescissions must \ngo to deficit reduction.\n  I believe that ``A Second Look at Wasteful Spending'' is a simple, \nclear-cut proposal that stands within the parameters of the U.S. \nConstitution. This amendment includes the same principles of fiscal \nresponsibility that have received bipartisan support since the passage \nof a comprehensive veto in 1992, and strongly echo the Daschle-Byrd \nproposal of 1995. Here is a chance for both Republicans and Democrats \nto help restrain frivolous spending.\n  I emphasize the gravity of fiscal responsibility because it sets the \nstandard for the success or failure of our Nation. We need to take \naction now to avert an even larger economic crisis in the future. ``A \nSecond Look at Wasteful Spending'' is a step in the right direction, \nthough there is more work to be done. Many of my colleagues in this \nChamber have supported this concept in the past, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Gregg amendment.\n  As I stated in my maiden speech in 1997, the American people continue \nto demand an end to runaway spending. We need to show the American \npeople that we are responsible. I said those words about the balanced \nbudget amendment in 1997, and they also hold true for this amendment \ntoday. By adopting the ``Second Look at Wasteful Spending,'' we would \nshow that Congress is willing to take a much needed step toward fiscal \nrestraint.\n  I stand in full support of this amendment and am proud to be a \ncosponsor. This outstanding amendment is worthy of your consideration \nand support.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Gregg and \nothers in supporting this fiscally responsible amendment to provide the \nPresident authority to perform rescissions to legislation passed by \nCongress. Congress would then be required to review the President's \nrecommendation within 8 days and affirm or reject the recommendation. \nAdditionally, this amendment correctly requires the money from \nrescissions to be put toward deficit reduction.\n  Congress has grappled with the issue of providing the President with \nline-item veto or rescission authority since the original law was \noverturned by the Supreme Court in 1998. In the last Congress, there \nwere at least eight bills introduced, including one I authored, \nattempting to provide the President with the authority to review and \nreject objectionable sections of legislation passed by Congress. It is \nmy hope that during the 110th Congress we will provide the President \nwith this important tool to combat porkbarrel spending and to reduce \nthe deficit.\n  Just last night, President Bush delivered the annual State of the \nUnion Address in which he stressed the need to impose spending \ndiscipline here in Washington by cutting the number earmarks. He is not \nthe only President to address the country about the need to curtail \nwasteful porkbarrel spending.\n  In 1988, during his final State of the Union Address, President \nRonald Reagan discussed the growth of earmarks and asked for line-item \nveto authority for future Presidents. On that evening, President Reagan \ncarried with him three pieces of legislation: an appropriations bill \nthat was 1,053 pages long and weighed 14 pounds; a budget \nreconciliation bill that was 1,186 pages long and weighed 15 pounds; \nand a continuing resolution that was 1,057 pages long and weighed 14 \npounds.\n  In reference to the continuing resolution, President Reagan chided \nCongress, stating, ``Most of you in this Chamber didn't know what was \nin this catch-all bill and report.'' President Reagan then explained \nthat millions of dollars for items such as cranberry research, \nblueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of \nwild flowers were included in the continuing resolution ``tucked away \nbehind a little comma here and there.''\n  In 1987, Ronald Reagan vetoed a highway bill because it had 157 \nearmarks. In the last Congress, a highway bill with 6,371 special \nprojects costing the taxpayers $24 billion was enacted, despite my \nstrong opposition. Those and other earmarks passed by Congress included \n$50 million for an indoor rainforest, $500,000 for a teapot museum, \n$350,000 for an Inner Harmony Foundation and Wellness Center, and $223 \nmillion for a ``Bridge to Nowhere.''\n  Unfortunately, this earmarking has not been limited to the highway \nbill. Nothing can compare to the out of control earmarking that has \noccurred in the annual appropriations measures during recent years. \nAccording to data gathered by Congressional Research Service, there \nwere 4,126 earmarks in 1994. In 2005, there were 15,877--an increase of \nnearly 400 percent. There was a little good news in 2006, solely due to \nthe fact that the Labor-HHS appropriations bill was approved almost \nentirely free of earmarks--an amazing feat given that there were over \n3,000 earmarks the prior year in that bill. Despite this first \nreduction in 12 years, it doesn't change the fact that 2004, 2005, and \n2006 produced the greatest number of earmarks in history.\n  Now, let's consider the level of funding associated with those \nearmarks. The amount of earmarked funding increased from $23.2 billion \nin 1994 to $64 billion in fiscal year 2006. Remarkably, it rose by 34 \npercent from 2005 to 2006, even though the number of earmarks\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\ndecreased. Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000 and more than \ntripled in the last 10 years. This is wrong and disgraceful, and we \nurgently need to curtail this seemingly out of control porkbarreling \npractice that has become the norm around here.\n  President Reagan would be deeply disturbed to know that almost 20 \nyears later, the size of spending bills has gotten much, much larger as \nwe put more money toward porkbarrel projects. These earmarks have \nallowed the national debt to grow from over $5 trillion when President \nReagan left office in January 1989 to over $8 trillion today. These \nstatistics demonstrate clearly that the need for rescission authority \nis much greater than when President Reagan was in office.\n  President Reagan said to Congress during his 1988 State of the Union \nAddress, ``Let's help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the \nPresident a tool that, though I will not get to use, is one I know \nfuture Presidents of either party must have. Give the President . . . \nthe right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the \nwaste, and enforce budget discipline.'' This amendment would do just \nthat. It would provide the President authority to identify wasteful \nitems of spending and move to eliminate them from the Federal budget. \nThis would be a significant and, unfortunately, all too rare move in \nWashington, DC, toward fiscal discipline.\n  Rescission authority alone is not the solution to the fiscal crisis \nwe face in our Nation's Capitol. We also desperately need to reform our \nearmarking process and our lobbying practices and the legislation the \nSenate passed last week makes a number of positive improvements in \nthose areas. But above all, we must remember that it is ultimately \nCongress's responsibility to control spending. However, granting the \nPresident line-item veto authority would go a long way toward restoring \ncredibility to a system ravaged by congressional waste and special \ninterest pork.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gregg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the time status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 7\\1/2\\ minutes; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Chair inform me how much time is \nleft on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and three-quarter minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator from Massachusetts like to go first?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to wait. I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on \nthis matter. I think this is a well-intentioned amendment, but it does \nvirtually nothing about the deficit. What it does do is transfer power \nfrom the Congress of the United States to the White House. What it will \nset up, I say to my colleagues, with this President perhaps, and with \nsome future President for certain, is a circumstance in which the \nPresident will be able to leverage Members of this body on completely \nunrelated issues because of his unchecked power to line-item veto \nprovisions in appropriations bills.\n  That is a profound mistake for this body. The Founding Fathers set up \nthis separation of power very carefully. They put the power of the \npurse in the Congress. They did that because they were concerned about \nthe extraordinary power that the Kings had in Europe. They never wanted \nto replicate that here.\n  Mr. President, that is exactly the formula that has helped America be \nthe preeminent power in the world--the strongest economic power and the \nstrongest military power. We should not alter that relationship by \ngranting this increased power to this President or any future \nPresident.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwould give me the courtesy of closing the debate since it is my \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought it was about our debate on the \nminimum wage, but that is fine. I have 7\\1/2\\, and the Senator has how \nmuch?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes, \nand the other side has a little over 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when I \nhave a minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We are at a very important moment for millions of \nworking families in this country. It has been 10 long years since we \nhave seen an increase in the minimum wage. During that period of time, \nI don't think anybody in this body could really understand the kind of \npain and sacrifice these families have experienced and the kind of \nanxiety they have had every day, wondering if they are going to be able \nto provide for themselves and their families, and particularly for \ntheir children.\n  I welcome the fact that it was our Democratic leaders who have this \nnow before the Senate. We had a majority in the Senate for an increase, \nbut we had the opposition of Republican leadership in the Senate and \nalso in the White House. But now we have had 80 Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives voting for a stripped-down bill. That is a \nreflection of the bipartisanship we used to have.\n  We have seen historically where we had both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents who fought for an increase, including Presidents Roosevelt, \nTruman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, the first \nPresident Bush, and Bill Clinton. That is the roster of American \nPresidents in the postwar period. But we have had the strong opposition \nof this President and the Republicans. Its impact has been devastating \non families.\n  If you look at what has happened to families, you will find out that \nthe purchasing power of the minimum wage over the period of these \nrecent years has just collapsed--almost to the lowest point it has ever \nbeen in terms of purchasing power. Look into the sixties, seventies, \nand the 1980s. With the Democrats in power, with the help of some \nRepublicans, we helped keep it up. It was at the poverty level and it \ncollapsed in recent years and we are trying to get it up to $7.25. That \nis still not adequate; nonetheless, it will make a big difference to \nworking families, the 41 million Americans--28 percent--who work more \nthan 40 hours a week. Nearly one in six workers work more than 50 hours \na week. People are working longer and harder than ever before.\n  If you look at what is happening in the industrial nations, look at \nthe United States, we have increased more than any other industrial \nnation in the world. What happened? The wages of the poorest of the \npoor who are out there working 40 hours a week have collapsed, and what \nhappened? They have been working longer and harder than ever before.\n  What has been happening? They increased productivity for the American \neconomy. Look at the past, where you had productivity and the minimum \nwage related year after year. But not now. We have seen the explosion \nof productivity, but do you think any of that has been passed on to \nhard-working people? Absolutely not. We are not going to let those who \nincreased the productivity of the American economy share in it. That \nhas not been the case.\n  We also see the continued loss of workers. What has happened on the \nother side? Who has gotten the increase in the productivity. Imagine \nwho: corporate profits grew 65 percent more over this period of time. \nThey are the ones who have taken the benefit of the productivity. It \nused to be shared between the workers and corporations. Not anymore. \nThey have been the ones who have opposed the increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  We have seen what happened, as I pointed out, when we had \nproductivity related to the minimum wage. We saw that the minimum wage \nwas at the poverty level, and now we have seen it virtually collapse. \nWhat has been the\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\nimpact on the American families? We have now seen that 4.1 million more \nAmerican families have gone into poverty since 5 years ago. And, \nnaturally, we have seen an increased number of children who have gone \ninto poverty; 1.2 million more children have gone into poverty over the \nlast 5 years, with no raise in the minimum wage.\n\n  Increased numbers of families are struggling and working hard, \nworking longer and harder than in any other industrial nation in the \nworld, and still they cannot get out of poverty. As a result, we find \nthis extraordinary achievement in the United States of America, and we \nhave the highest poverty rate of children of any industrialized nation \nin the world. The list goes on.\n  We can see this is reflected in the increased number of individuals \nwho are suffering in terms of hunger in our country. You can go to food \nbanks in my city of Boston--and we have food banks throughout \nMassachusetts and you hear the same thing. We are having to give more \nassistance to families who are working, and more and more of those are \nchildren living in poverty. It doesn't have to be this way. We are not \ngoing to answer all of the problems of poverty with this increase. We \nare telling hard-working Americans who work hard and take pride and \nproduce that we in the Congress at this time are going to give you a \nvery modest raise. They are entitled to it. It is saying to proud men \nand women who are doing a decent job that we recognize that and we \nbelieve in a society where people move along together.\n  This is going to make a difference to children in our society because \nso many children are the children of individuals who work hard and are \nworking at minimum wage. It will make a difference to women because the \ngreat majority of people who benefit from the minimum wage are women. \nSo it will benefit women, and it will benefit children, and those \npeople who go into the entry level, men and women of color who are \ngetting a job. This is a family issue, a values issue, an American \nissue, and it is a fairness issue.\n  That is why we want to have a strong vote here with the bare bill \nthat sends a very clear message: $7.25 an hour for working families is \nnot too much in the richest country in the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for allowing me to \nproceed in this manner. I think people listening may get confused. In \nour discussions, the Senator from Massachusetts is addressing the \nsecond cloture vote. I am addressing the first one. The second one \naddresses the issue of minimum wage. I am talking about the second look \nat the waste amendment, or enhanced rescission amendment, which is the \nfirst cloture vote.\n  This is not a line-item veto. That pejorative is being thrown at it \nby people who think the line-item veto is inappropriate and transfers \ntoo much power to the President. That was settled in the 1990s when \nPresident Clinton was given it, and then it was ruled unconstitutional. \nThis is the daughter of Daschle amendment. It is essentially rescission \nlanguage that allows us to take a second look at waste and \nmismanagement that may occur as a result of earmarks being put in \nomnibus bills.\n  We talk around here about earmarks and the inappropriateness of some \nof them. This is another opportunity for us to look at inappropriate \nearmarks and to eliminate waste as a result of that. It tracks very \nclosely the Daschle language.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned three areas where it differs \nfrom the Daschle language. I don't think any of those three areas are \nsubstantive.\n  The first was on the issue of entitlements. Of course, entitlements \nhave to be on the table. The argument that for some reason a global \nagreement on entitlements is going to be undermined by this opportunity \nto take a second look at wasteful spending is a total straw dog. No \nsuch global agreement would be reached unless this language was also \naddressed and the question of the President's power was addressed.\n  Secondly, the idea that a packaging of rescissions will put undue \npressure on Members to vote for a bad rescission in favor of a good \nrescission because they will be put together is totally specious or \ninaccurate because of the fact that the motion to strike is retained so \nthat packages can be broken up.\n  As I said earlier, I am going to take the 300 days, if we get this to \nthe amendment process, and move it back to 30 days, so that is not an \nissue either.\n  This is a question of how we better manage the taxpayers' dollars. It \nis that simple. There is no reason why we should allow inappropriate \nspending to be buried in omnibus bills, as mentioned by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, and then never have an opportunity to go back and \ntake a look at that inappropriate spending.\n  It is such a logical idea that it was voted for by 37 Members of the \nDemocratic Party the last time it was on the floor, 20 of whom still \nserve in the Senate. Individuals who voted for essentially this exact \nproposal--not exact, but it is so close it is hard to differentiate--\nare still serving in the Senate.\n  I hope those individuals will vote for cloture so that we can move on \nand do this very significant piece of reform.\n  Is it going to dramatically affect the deficit? I have said it isn't. \nWhat it is going to do is give us an opportunity to effectively address \nwaste mismanagement and inappropriate earmarks that will help the \ndeficit because I put the money toward the deficit. I acknowledge it is \nnot going to be dramatic sums, but it is better management of the \nAmerican taxpayers' money, and that is our goal.\n  It is not unconstitutional. It does not have a constitutional issue \nwith it. It has been addressed. In fact, it is a proposal that is so \nreasonable in the area of constitutionality that Senator Byrd, the last \ntime this proposal was put forward, said:\n\n       I have no problem with giving the President another \n     opportunity to select from appropriation bills certain items \n     which he feels, for his reasons, whatever they may be, they \n     may be political or for whatever reasons, I have no problem \n     with his sending them to the two Houses and our giving him a \n     vote.\n\n  He is being reasonable. It is a reasonable approach. The idea is \nsimply to allow the President to say to us: Listen, I looked at this \nbill; it is spending $400 billion or $500 billion. There is some money \nin here that I don't think should be spent. Why don't you take a \nanother look at this, Congress, and if either House says no, we are \ngoing to spend that money, they can spend it, or if either House \nstrikes an item, it gets struck and it is not part of the rescission \npackage.\n  This is good management. It has been voted out of this Senate before. \nI hope it will be voted out again.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is up.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I guess I will end my statement and ask \npeople to vote for cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     Gregg amendment No. 101 to the substitute amendment to H.R. \n     2, a bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \n     provide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n         Harry Reid, Mitch McConnell, Judd Gregg, Craig Thomas, \n           John E. Sununu, James Inhofe, Jon Kyl, Johnny Isakson, \n           Tom Coburn, Mike Crapo, Wayne Allard, Lamar Alexander, \n           John Cornyn, Jim Bunning, John Ensign, David Vitter, \n           Bob Corker.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). By unanimous consent, the \nmandatory quorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 101, offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, an amendment to provide Congress a second look at wasteful \nspending by establishing enhanced rescission authority under fast-track \nprocedures, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider and table that vote.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that prior to this vote there be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, what is the issue now that is before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate before the \nvote on the cloture motion on H.R. 2, a bill to amend the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938 to provide for an increase in the Federal minimum \nwage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Madam President, we have the opportunity for the first time in 10 \nyears to pass an increase in the minimum wage that will affect a \nmillion of our fellow citizens. The workers who work for the minimum \nwage are people of dignity. They take pride in their work. They work \nhard and try to do a job.\n  This is a women's issue because the great majority of those who work \nand receive the minimum wage are women. It is a children's issue \nbecause so many of those women have children. Therefore, it is a family \nissue, it is a value issue, and it is a civil rights issue, because so \nmany of those who enter with the minimum wage are men and women of \ncolor. Most of all, it is a fairness issue. In the United States of \nAmerica, we understand fairness. With the strongest economy in the \nworld, for men and women who are going to play by the rules, work 40 \nhours a week, they should not live in poverty in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Vote yea on this amendment and we will make a downpayment in bringing \nchildren, women, and others out of poverty in this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, for those who have been listening for the \nlast 2 days, the argument has not been about whether we would raise the \nminimum wage. There seems to be agreement to raise the minimum wage. \nThe difficulty has been how do we take care of some of the impact to \nsmall business that will result.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, has mentioned that the \nlast time we passed the minimum wage, there was a small business tax \npackage in it. That somewhat set a little different level for doing \nthis kind of action. Incidentally, it was Senator Simpson from Wyoming \nwho headed up that effort at that time.\n  This bill could have happened earlier if we had some assurance that \nthere was going to be this tax package. I congratulate the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, for the \nway they have worked together and the way their committee worked \ntogether to put together a tax package that will benefit small business \nand reduce some of the impacts of the increase in minimum wage. The \nminority just needs some kind of a sense that will be a part of the \nbill, and we can move forward with the whole thing. We are trying to \nmake sure we don't put the mom-and-pop businesses and their employees \nout of work and their services lost to the community.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to submit a letter from the \nCoalition For Job Opportunities supporting it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Coalition for Job Opportunities,\n\n                                                 January 23, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As members of the Coalition for Job \n     Opportunities (COJO), we are writing in opposition to the \n     cloture motion filed on H.R. 2 which calls for a federal \n     minimum wage increase to $7.25/hour without any offsetting \n     small business tax provisions. We are very concerned that \n     this 41% increase to the starting wage would severely impact \n     small businesses and cost our economy jobs. While no package \n     of small business measures can completely mitigate the \n     negative impact of a wage hike, we are supportive of the \n     small business tax package approved unanimously in committee \n     last week and believe it must be included with the wage \n     proposal before the Senate.\n       A mandated wage hike of this magnitude will cause many \n     small employers to make difficult staffing decisions, in \n     terms of eliminating current positions and postponing plans \n     to create new ones. Due to the last minimum wage increase, \n     our economy experienced significant job losses across \n     multiple sectors.\n       Many small businesses operate under a very small profit \n     margin, and a 41% mandated wage hike would have a severe \n     impact on employers at a time they are experiencing other \n     difficult cost challenges. Small employers continue to face \n     steady double-digit health care premium increases, and rising \n     energy costs have also had an impact. Just this month, it was \n     reported that commercial electricity prices have risen nearly \n     10% during the first 10 months of 2006.\n       We urge you to strongly consider the vital role that small \n     employers play in our economy as job providers. An increase \n     in the starting wage will stifle job creation, directly \n     affecting employment opportunities for low-skilled, entry \n     level workers. We therefore urge you to oppose this mandated \n     wage increase and to allow market forces to create and \n     sustain more jobs.\n           Sincerely,\n         National Restaurant Association, National Federation of \n           Independent Business, National Retail Federation, \n           National Association of Convenience Stores, American \n           Hotel and Lodging Association, American Beverage \n           Licensees, Bowling Proprietors' Association of America, \n           Coalition of Licensed Beverage Associations, Food \n           Marketing Institute, International Association of \n           Amusement Parks and Attractions, International \n           Foodservice Distributors Association, International \n           Franchise Association, International Pizza Hut \n           Franchise Holders Association, Kentucky Fried Chicken \n           Franchisee Association, National Association of Chain \n           Drug Stores, National Association of Theatre Owners, \n           National Club Association, National Council of \n           Agricultural Employers, National Council of Chain \n           Restaurants, National Franchisee Association, National \n           Grocers Association, Printing Industries of America, \n           Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, Society of \n           American Florists, Tire Industry Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, as the \n     nation's leading voice for over 2 million Hispanic-owned \n     businesses and over 200 chambers nationwide, urges your \n     support for providing significant small business tax relief \n     as a key component of S. 2, the Minimum Wage Act of 2007.\n       Small and disadvantaged businesses create 75 percent of new \n     U.S. jobs annually, but they are also responsible for the \n     majority of job losses each year. These important statistics \n     demonstrate why we must provide assistance to these \n     struggling businesses. According to the Small Business \n     Administration, 590,000 new businesses were established in \n     1998, and 565,000 of them employed fewer than 20 workers. \n     However, 541,000 firms went\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\n     out of business that year, and more than 94 percent of them \n     had 20 workers or less. Small businesses already encounter a \n     growing number of rising costs for doing business such as \n     double digit health care premium increases and increased \n     energy costs.\n       As an organization that understands and represents the \n     interests and concerns of Hispanic-owned businesses, we urge \n     you to provide a comprehensive response that includes small \n     business tax relief as an integral part of this legislation. \n     We look forward to working with you to achieve this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David C.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n     Sen. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: \n     On behalf of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), the nation's leading small-business advocacy group, I \n     am writing to urge you to include critical small-business \n     relief as part of any minimum-wage legislation that passes \n     the U.S. Senate.\n       During Senate consideration of H.R. 2, a bill that raises \n     the minimum wage by $2.10, please be mindful that small-\n     business owners oppose the wage hike because it would leave \n     them with fewer choices in how they compensate their \n     employees and when they decide to hire new ones. Wage hikes \n     historically have had a negative impact on certain industries \n     that offer the most entry-level jobs--including restaurants, \n     grocery, and retail stores--many of which are run by small-\n     business owners.\n       We were encouraged that the Senate Finance Committee took \n     an important step in this debate by passing the Small \n     Business and Work Opportunity Act of 2007. This bill contains \n     growth-oriented tax relief that allows small businesses to \n     invest and stay competitive. We hope that you can continue in \n     this direction during debate on the floor.\n       In addition, should you decide to consider any additional \n     revenue offsets, I hope you will be mindful of the \n     consequences of any tax increases on small businesses. While \n     revenue offsets may serve to restrain fiscal spending, any \n     other possible burdens on small businesses--in addition to \n     the wage hike--will be harmful to the continued growth of \n     this very important industry.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue, and we look \n     forward to working with you as the 110th Congress moves \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                                 January 23, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association and the 935,000 restaurant locations nationwide, \n     we are writing in opposition to cloture on H.R. 2 the \n     underlying minimum wage bill which does not include the small \n     business tax package unanimously approved in committee last \n     week. Our association cannot support a wage increase given \n     its impact on jobs in our industry, and we strongly believe \n     that any minimum wage increase must include small business \n     tax relief in order to mitigate the negative impact of a \n     mandated wage hike. The cloture vote on the underlying \n     ``clean'' minimum wage bill will be considered a ``key vote'' \n     by the National Restaurant Association.\n       Restaurants are acutely impacted by an increase to the \n     starting wage, and it is important to protect the jobs our \n     industry provides. Nearly half of all adults have worked in \n     the restaurant industry at some point during their lives, and \n     32 percent of adults got their first job experience in a \n     restaurant. For many, restaurant jobs lead to management and \n     ownership opportunities: 8 out of 10 salaried employees have \n     started as hourly employees.\n       The restaurant industry plays a critical role in providing \n     jobs to the U.S. economy. By the year 2017, we are expected \n     to create an additional 2 million positions. If we are to \n     fulfill this expectation, we urge you to include relief \n     targeted to those industries that pay the starting wage.\n       We urge you to oppose cloture on the underlying base \n     minimum wage bill (H.R. 2). The cloture vote on H.R. 2 will \n     be treated as a key vote by the National Restaurant \n     Association.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steven C. Anderson,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                         John Gay,\n      Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask my colleagues to vote no on cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     5, H.R. 2, providing for an increase in the Federal minimum \n     wage.\n         Ted Kennedy, Barbara A.

We would like to get this set up so we \ncan start voting on amendments. Vote on a Democrat amendment, a \nRepublican amendment or vice versa. Let's move on.\n  Some of these votes are not pleasant.

Let me say to my good friend, the majority leader, \nthere are two Senators, Senator Allard and Senator Smith, in the \nChamber prepared to offer amendments now.\n  I concur with him.

My amendment would make permanent \nexisting education tax benefits that are set to expire in the near \nfuture.\n  I am a big supporter of the Republican progrowth tax policies that \nhave been implemented over the past few years. These policies have had \na tremendous impact on our economy. Since August 2003, more than 7.2 \nmillion jobs have been created.\n  Our unemployment rate remains low at 4.5 percent, which is well below \nthe 5.1 percent average rate for 2005, and below the average of each of \nthe past four decades.\n  And thanks to our strong economic growth, tax revenues continue to \npour in. Tax receipts in December were $18 billion higher than a year \nearlier.\n  My amendment focuses on an important component of the Bush tax cuts--\neducation tax benefits. This amendment would make permanent a number of \nimportant tax provisions that make it easier for Americans to save for \ncollege and pay for their children's education expenses.\n  Educating our citizens is critical if we want to remain competitive \nin the global economy. But as tuition costs continue to escalate, it \nhas become more and more difficult for American families to cover these \nexpenses on their own.\n  The education tax benefits that have been enacted over the past few \nyears will help American families meet these obligations. Therefore, it \nis important that we don't let these tax benefits expire.\n  My amendment would make permanent the deduction for qualified tuition \nand related expenses which is set to expire at the end of 2007. The \n2001 tax act created this new deduction which allows middle-income \nAmericans to take a deduction for higher education expenses of up to \n$4,000.\n  In 2004, over 4.5 million American families took advantage of this \ndeduction. And in my home state of Oregon, almost 65,000 families used \nthe deduction.\n  In addition, if certain requirements are satisfied, an employee can \nexclude from gross income up to $5,250 annually of educational \nassistance provided by an employer. This exclusion applies to both \ngraduate and undergraduate courses.\n  Because of this favorable tax treatment, many employers provide their \nemployees with educational assistance. However, the exclusion will not \nbe available after December 31, 2010. My amendment would make this \nprovision permanent.\n  Coverdell education savings accounts are an important tool for \nAmericans to save for future education expenses. The 2001 tax act made \na number of reforms to enhance these accounts. For example, it \nincreased the annual contribution limit to $2,000 from $500 and \nexpanded the definition of qualified expenses to include elementary and \nsecondary school expenses.\n  However, like the exclusion for employer provided educational \nassistance, these enhancements expire after 2010. My amendment would \nmake these enhancements permanent.\n  Finally, the recently enacted tax extenders package extended the \ndeduction for educator expenses through 2007. This provision provides a \n$250 per year above-the-line deduction for teachers for expenses paid \nfor supplies, such as books and computer equipment.\n  Teaching is one of the most important professions in our society. And \nthis provision provides teachers with a little help in purchasing the \nsupplies they need to be good teachers.\n  In Oregon, over 33,000 teachers benefited from this deduction in \n2003. And my amendment would make this provision permanent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 116 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment numbered 116 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 116.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 116\n\n  (Purpose: To afford States the rights and flexibility to determine \n                             minimum wage)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following:\n       (c) State Flexibility.--Section 6 of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(h) State Flexibility.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, an employer shall not be required \n     to pay an employee a wage that is greater than the minimum \n     wage provided for by the law of the State in which the \n     employee is employed and not less than the minimum wage in \n     effect in that State on January 1, 2007.''.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \nsupport amendment No. 116, which I will discuss.\n  This amendment allows States the rights and flexibility to determine \na minimum wage that works for them. Every State has its own \nmicroeconomy, and the voters and legislatures in those areas have \ndecided what works best.\n  This is reflected in a map I have for demonstration purposes, \nreflecting the number of States in green that have higher wage rates \nthan the minimum Federal rate. It reflects in blue the States with wage \nrates the same as the Federal rate. We have American Samoa, which has a \nspecial minimum wage rate, and States with no minimum wage rate, which \nare very few, by the way. They rely on the Federal, in that case, where \nthey do not have one. And States with a minimum wage rate lower than \nthe Federal, again, the State is preempted.\n  I rise to point out that the merits of increasing the Federal minimum \nwage, for better or for worse, for days on end--there is no debate on \nthe cost of living, and wages greatly differ from State to state.\n  In its current form, the bill attempts to blindly blanket the Nation \nwith a new Federal minimum wage without\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nregard to unique economic conditions of each individual State. \nEffective on January 1 of this year, my own home State of Colorado \nincreased its wage from $5.15 an hour to $6.85 an hour. But they went \nfurther than that. This new wage will adjust annually with inflation as \nmeasured by the Consumer Price Index in my own State--in this case, the \nState of Colorado.\n  During the course of the 109th Congress, the Senate considered a \nrange of different minimum wage proposes. I evaluated each on a case-\nby-case basis. As a former small business owner, I recognize the \nfinancial challenges many families face, both those who are employed by \nthe small business, as well as those struggling to keep their small \nbusiness working. I also recognize the importance of small business to \nour Nation's economy and the chilling effect that increasing operating \ncosts can have on the growth and ability to create jobs.\n  In my small business, for example, I hired a large percentage of \nemployees whose first job was working for me. I was able to incorporate \nthem into my business because, in some cases, because of their lack of \njob experience, I was willing to bring them in at a relatively low \nwage, give them an opportunity to improve themselves, which usually \ndidn't take long--a month, 2 or maybe 3 months--and then begin to \nincrease their wages as they increased their performance. This helped \nfor morale in the business, and they felt like they were treated \nfairly. And it worked out very well.\n  We ran into problems when I was forced to raise the minimum wage, and \nI had to look at those employees in my small business who were full-\ntime employees and expand the responsibilities of what my expectations \nwere during their time of employment, at the expense of part-timers, \nand I laid off a few part-timers in the process, until I was able to \ngrow the business a little more and I was able to begin to bring on \nsome of the part-time employees again.\n  That is my personal experience and that reflects my view on \nincreasing the minimum wage and why I think it has an adverse effect, \nparticularly on those trying to move into the workforce. I have long \nbeen a supporter of legislation to help small businesses, and I do not \nwish to overburden our small businesses. Last year, I supported Senator \nEnzi's small business health plan legislation to give small business \nand their employees relief from health care costs. I supported this \nbill as a way to help small business and will continue to support such \ngood ideas in the future.\n  In my view, in order to stimulate economic growth and create better \npaying jobs, Congress should implement programs aimed at reducing taxes \nand Government regulations on small business. Less Government \nintervention, at all levels, enables the private sector to attract, \nrecruit, and retain the best possible employees and reward increased \nproductivity and responsibility with higher compensation.\n  Although I believe the market is capable of setting wages, States are \nbetter equipped than the Federal Government to determine what is a fair \nand equitable standard wage for their workforce because of their own \neconomy within that State.\n  As my chart shows, letting States take the lead on this issue is \nworking. According to the Department of Labor, as of January 1, 2007, \nthe majority of States have opted to increase the minimum wage over the \nfederally mandated $5.15 an hour.\n  According to the Economic Policy Institute, 28 States plus the \nDistrict of Columbia have minimum wages above the Federal level in \n2007. Washington State has the highest minimum wage at $7.93 an hour. \nSeveral States, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Oregon, have \nraised their minimum wage beyond $7.50 an hour.\n  If we are going to do this and do this right, we should be cautious \nin Federally mandating a one-size-fits-all minimum wage. We should \nallow States to take into consideration the needs of their economy. We \nshould give States the rights and flexibility to set their own minimum \nwage. Costs of living and wages vary dramatically State to State. What \nis right for Wyoming is not necessarily what is right for \nMassachusetts. Imposing dramatic increases to the minimum wage on \nStates poses a threat to local economies. States are better positioned \nthan the Federal Government to set a wage that works best for their \nworkforce. Whether the need is above or below the proposed $2.10 \nincrease, State officials should have the right to decide. Local \nlegislators are in touch with the business community and I think better \nrepresent the needs of the local labor markets. Allowing the minimum \nwage to be set by State legislatures is a better alternative to a \nFederal mandate. My amendment simply affirms the traditional definition \nof States rights and allows respective State legislatures the \nflexibility to determine employee pay benefits.\n  Let's allow the States to have a say and decide what is right for \nthem. They are the closest to the people. Let's give States the right \nand flexibility to regulate minimum wage. A one-size-fits-all unfunded \nFederal mandate is not the answer to protecting America's economic \nsecurity. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment \nwhich gives States the flexibility to determine what is best for their \ncitizens.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 104 to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, if the distinguished Senator from \nColorado is finished, I ask unanimous consent to set aside his \namendment and call up an amendment I offer with Senator Smith and \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Boxer and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. \n     Smith, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 104 to amendment No. 100.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n                       Determination Act of 2000)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EXTENSION OF SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY \n                   SELF-DETERMINATION ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secure Rural Schools and Community \n     Self-Determination Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 500 note; Public \n     Law 106-393) is amended in sections 101(a), 102(b)(2), \n     103(b)(1), 203(a)(1), 207(a), 208, 303, and 401 by striking \n     ``2006'' each place it appears and inserting ``2007''.\n       (b) Termination of Authority.--\n       (1) Special projects on federal lands.--Section 208 of the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of \n     2000 (16 U.S.C. 500 note; Public Law 106-393) is amended in \n     the second sentence by striking ``2007'' and inserting \n     ``2008''.\n       (2) County projects.--Section 303 of the Secure Rural \n     Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (16 \n     U.S.C. 500 note; Public Law 106-393) is amended in the second \n     sentence by striking ``2007'' and inserting ``2008''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in much of our country that is dependent \non natural resources, there is a world of hurt today. There are \ntremendous concerns in many of our rural communities about how we are \ngoing to finance their schools and roads. In my State, more than 50 \npercent of the land is owned by the Federal Government. So we are not \nin a position to pay for schools and roads and essential services the \nway much of the rest of the country does because there, through \ntransactions that occur on private property, they are able to generate \nthe funds they need to pay for essential services.\n  When Senator Smith and I go home, we are faced with a very different \nsituation. Because a law I wrote a number of years ago with Mr. Craig, \nthe distinguished Senator from Idaho, expired at the end of the year, \nwe are seeing a number of our local communities face Draconian cuts in \nessential services.\n  The layoff announcements are going on right now as local districts \nand local communities come together and wrestle with how they are going \nto make the difficult choices with respect to funding essential \nservices. Cuts in excess of 70 percent of discretionary funding are \ngoing to cripple one of our counties in rural Oregon, southern Oregon, \nDouglas County, which currently receives about 43 percent of its annual\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nbudget from the law I authored with Senator Craig.\n  Another of our counties, Jackson County, again in southern Oregon, is \nprepared to shut down all of its libraries. That will be coming up very \nshortly.\n  In Curry County, they are looking at the prospect of laying off all \nnonessential workers, including patrol officers, some of whom would be \nleft to perform only the mandated corrections duties. By June, 20 \npercent of the county workforce in Curry County will have been cut. So \nit is not clear with these cuts whether the county will even be able to \ncontinue to be a county, as it will not be able to provide a minimum \nlevel of services.\n  Road department levels are going to be reduced in areas such as \nJosephine County and Linn County.\n  I am going to be having community meetings this weekend on the Oregon \ncoast.\n  Tillamook County is looking at layoffs in the sheriff's department \nand cuts to its road maintenance, jeopardizing roads that are critical \nto getting sawlogs to the mills and having family-wage jobs for workers \nin my State.\n  Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer join me in this. There are \nstories like this from across the country. Over 700 counties in 39 \nStates have received critical funding from the county payments program. \nThe fact is, in a State such as ours, where the Federal Government owns \nmore than 50 percent of the land in many of these small communities \nwith tiny populations, they are not going to be able to make it without \nthese funds that are a lifeline in terms of law enforcement and schools \nand essential road and transportation services.\n  This is my top priority--my top priority--for my State in this \nsession, to try to make sure these funds are reauthorized. In this \nparticular amendment, Senator Smith and Senator Boxer and Senator \nFeinstein and I want to reauthorize the program for 1 year. But I am \nalso introducing legislation for a long-term reauthorization because I \nthink we ought to get these counties off the roller coaster once and \nfor all.\n  This is based on an approach that was adopted many years ago with \nStates that had widespread Federal ownership getting funds that related \nto timber receipts. As a result of the environmental laws, those \nreceipts went down, and we needed this law to ensure that those \ncounties would survive.\n  So the county payments legislation is supported by a diverse \ncoalition, including the National Association of Counties and a number \nof labor organizations.\n  If Senators, particularly in rural communities, look now--as I have \nbeen in townhall meetings and other kinds of gatherings--at how we are \ngoing to support schools and roads and basic local government, I would \nonly say that without this program, this will hit local communities \nlike a wrecking ball. It is something that should not be abided by this \nSenate.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon, my partner in this and many other \nissues, standing, and I would like to yield at this time. After Senator \nSmith has completed his remarks, I will wrap up very briefly. I would \nalso note that Senator Reed was here earlier, and I was not aware that \nhe was in the queue as well, and I want him to be able to speak soon in \na way that is convenient for him.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank my colleague, Mr. President.\n  I join Senator Wyden in saying this is my No. 1 priority as well. It \nis an emergency. It is not a natural disaster, but it is related to \nnatural resources. It is a disaster that has been in the making through \nthe course of a decade and more of Congresses, courts, and, obviously, \nthe effort of the Clinton administration to reduce timber harvest on \npublic lands in the Pacific Northwest. That has created a circumstance \nin the Pacific Northwest that Senator Wyden and I seek to address. We \ndo so because it is such an emergency. We have to look for every \nopportunity, every train that is leaving the station, to bring this to \nthe attention of Congress and to get it to President Bush, who has said \nhe will sign an extension.\n  For the benefit of the record, let me indicate some of the history of \nthis issue. All of this was done with the best of intentions as it \nrelates to natural resources and the management of public lands. It was \ndone to benefit the spotted owl, threatened species under the \nEndangered Species Act. I should add that after 15 years of negligible \nharvest on public lands, the owl is still not recovering and its \nhabitat is being incinerated by catastrophic wildfire.\n  Whether tacit or intentional, those management decisions have caused \nsevere costs that are borne on the backs of those who can least afford \nit. These people and communities need relief as much as those burdened \nby other disasters, such as hurricanes or tidal waves.\n  The timber war has had many casualties. It has been a catastrophe for \nrural communities. County governments, colleagues, receive a share of \ntimber receipts from Federal lands--25 percent from the Forest Service \nand 50 percent from BLM. The State Senator Wyden and I represent is \nmore than 50 percent owned by the Federal Government. What you have, \ntherefore, is timber-locked communities.\n  For generations, these timber receipts have provided funds to offset \nthe fact that local communities cannot tax the Federal Government. It \nmakes up the vast majority of their funds to operate their counties, \ntheir schools, public safety. When timber harvest evaporated, so did \ncounty budgets.\n  In 1999, my colleague from Oregon, Senator Craig from Idaho, myself, \nand others came to this floor to describe what was happening to rural \nOregon. Schools went to 4 days a week. They dropped sports and \nextracurricular activities and curtailed other programs. Communities \nwere forced to make heartbreaking decisions over whether to cut social \nservice programs or school funding or to sharply reduce sheriffs' \npatrols and close jails.\n  Fortunately, Congress created a safety net in the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. This provided \nfunding to counties based on historic rather than current timber \nharvest levels, and it kept them afloat until the Federal timber \nprogram stabilized--a stabilization for which we are still awaiting.\n  I realize other States may think Oregon receives too much assistance \nunder this program; however, I would ask, what other Federal disaster \nassistance is not allocated based on the intensity and location of the \ndisaster? You go where the problem exists. Between 1987 and 2002, \nFederal timber harvest in Oregon dropped 96 percent. That is an annual \nshortfall of enough wood to build over 235,000 homes.\n  Without a county payment safety net, here is an example of what my \ncounty commissioners are facing. Curry County, located on the southern \nOregon coast, has an annual general fund of $7.7 million. The safety \nnet accounts for over $4 million of that $7 million. The county is not \nlegally able to raise property taxes, but it is constitutionally bound \nto fund administrative and law enforcement functions. Curry County has \n11,000 homes. To replace the safety net funding with new property \ntaxes, it would need over 35,000 new homes valued at $345,000 each. \nThat is not going to happen. With only 22,000 residents and 1.43 \npercent of its land available for development, this is simply an \nimpossibility.\n  But the safety net is not just about Oregon counties. In the life of \nthe legislation, California received $308 million; Idaho, $102 million; \nMontana, $63.4 million.\n  That program expired on our watch 4 months ago. Now rural counties \nacross the Nation are dangling on an economic tightrope without a \nsafety net to catch them. My colleague from Oregon and I have left no \nstone unturned to find money for an extension. Those efforts have been \nunsuccessful. We stand here with our timber-dependent counties at the \nmercy, once more, of the Federal Government. If we do not extend the \nsafety net, many counties in my State stand to lose nearly 70 percent \nof their general and road funds.\n  Preparations are already underway to close public libraries, pink \nslips to thousands of county employees will soon be in the mail, vital \nsearch-and-rescue operations will be curtailed. The Nation has seen \nthese search-and-rescue operations go tragically in several cases \nrecently on national TV.\n  Oregon has lived with devastating Federal mandates on our forests, \nbut\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\nwe cannot live with an instant evisceration of our public services. \nThat cannot be the rural legacy of this Congress.\n  My colleague from Oregon and I have filed this amendment to the \nminimum wage bill to provide a 1-year extension of the safety net. It \nis only fitting that as we consider raising wages for workers in the \nprivate sector, we address the very future of jobs and services in the \npublic sector.\n  We are also introducing legislation for a full reauthorization, and \nwe will make every attempt at every opportunity in this Congress to \nturn back the tide that is quickly approaching rural communities and \ncounties across the Nation. We can prevent this natural disaster, a \nnatural disaster that has a human component. I join with my colleague \nto express our determination and thank him for his leadership, his \nauthorship of this in the first instance, and of our mutual \ndetermination for the sake of our State to right this wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his comments and his \nthoughtfulness. Before I make my concluding remarks on our amendment, I \nask unanimous consent for Senator Jack Reed to speak after I have \nconcluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. To wrap up briefly, Senator Smith has stated it well. I am \nvery honored to represent Oregon in the Senate. I have been able to get \ninto a host of issues that I think are important, particularly as a \nmember of the Finance Committee, to fix health care and fix the out-of-\nwhack American tax system. I serve on the Intelligence Committee. But \nSenator Smith and I have said this is our most important issue for our \nState for this session because, without this funding, there is a real \nquestion about whether these local communities can hang on. They simply \nhave no other options. You are not going to be able to go to a small \nresource-dependent community in eastern Oregon and set up a \nbiotechnology company in the next few weeks. It is not going to happen. \nI support those kinds of industries and economic development, as does \nmy colleague. It has been a big part of our bipartisan agenda. But we \nare talking about survival for these rural communities. This will be \nour top priority for this session.\n  This has also made a great contribution in terms of bringing together \npeople of differing views on natural resources. As part of the \nlegislation that I authored with Senator Craig a number of years ago--\nas Senator Smith has noted--we set up resource advisory committees so \nthat you now have folks in the timber industry talking to \nenvironmentalists who in the past were, for the most part, spending \ntheir days in the courthouses suing each other. Now they are working \ntogether to cooperate through the legislation that we have put in \nplace. This has been recognized as a wildly successful natural \nresources law, bringing about cooperation that, prior to this law going \ninto effect, was seen virtually nowhere.\n  It is a stable, consistent source of funding for communities that \nhave nowhere else to turn, affecting communities in 39 States, but it \nis also a program that has brought together a unique kind of \ncooperation between people in the natural resources area who in the \npast would spend an awful lot of time running what I call a lawyers \nfull employment program, essentially suing each other in the Federal \ncourthouse.\n  We are going to be back on the floor for whatever number of times it \ntakes to get this program reauthorized and take these rural communities \noff this roller coaster. They ought to be able to know that they can \nsurvive, and they can survive as they have over many years through a \nprogram that was tied to the unique consideration that the Federal \nGovernment owns most of our land. That is what this is all about. This \nis different than how people may pay for schools and roads and \nessential services in parts of the eastern United States where there is \nlittle Federal ownership.\n  We ask that the Senate not ignore the plight of rural America, \nparticularly the rural West, as we continue forward with the \nlegislative calendar.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 104 Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bipartisan amendment be withdrawn. \nWe will be back another day. But I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment I have offered be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wyden for arranging for my \ntime. I rise to address my strong support for the increase in the \nminimum wage that we are debating today in this Chamber. Minimum wage \nworkers deserve this long overdue raise. The minimum wage, which today \nstands at $5.15 per hour under Federal law, hasn't increased since \n1997. Since then, inflation has entirely eroded that pay raise. In the \nmeantime, the pay of CEOs of large corporations has increased to an \naverage of $10.5 billion per year, about 369 times the average wages of \na worker and 821 times the average wage of a minimum wage worker. That \ndiscrepancy, that disparity, that growing bifurcation between the very \nwell compensated and struggling families in America cannot be tolerated \nany longer.\n  This legislation would raise the minimum wage to $7.25 over the next \n2 years. This measure is important because workers have been left out \nof the economic growth that we have seen so far in this limited \nrecovery that we are experiencing. Strong productivity growth has \ntranslated into higher profits for businesses, not more take-home pay \nfor workers. And this is not just the low, entry-level workers. This is \nvery far up the income range for working Americans. The stagnation of \nearnings in the face of soaring prices for health care, education, and \nfood is squeezing the ability of families to meet their demands, of \nproviding opportunities for the children. In fact, for the first time \nin my lifetime, I am beginning to sense that so many people are worried \nwhether their children will be able to enjoy the same level of progress \nof income, of housing that they have, a fact that they took for \ngranted.\n  No one who works full time should have to live in poverty, but the \ncurrent minimum wage is not enough to bring even a single parent with \none child over the poverty line, even if the parent works full time 52 \nweeks a year. That should never be the case in this country.\n  Five million more Americans have fallen into poverty since President \nBush took office; 37 million Americans are now living in poverty, \nincluding 13 million children. And we know what the effects of poverty \non children are. It impedes their ability to succeed in school. It \ndeprives them of some of the experiences that we think are essential \nfor their progress. Ultimately, it impairs their ability to contribute \nto this country as workers but, more importantly, as citizens, to fully \nparticipate, to bear the responsibilities of this great country. An \nunacceptably low minimum wage is a key factor in the problem of poverty \nin our country. This measure would go right to that problem in a very \nefficient way.\n  People who are working deserve to be rewarded for their work, deserve \nto be out of poverty. Congress is failing to catch up with reality. \nMany States have taken it upon themselves to raise their minimum wage. \nDuring the election this past November, six States passed ballot \ninitiatives--not just a legislative effort but the voice of the people \nof those States--to raise the minimum wage. Today 29 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have minimum wages above the Federal level, \nanywhere from $6.15 per hour to $7.93 per hour. In addition, the States \nof Washington, Oregon, Vermont, and Florida have gone so far as to \nindex the minimum wage to the rate of inflation, allowing workers to \nshare in the benefits of a growing economy.\n  Raising the minimum wage will make a real difference for working \nfamilies, putting an additional $4,400 per year in their pockets. \nAlmost two-thirds of those who would benefit are adult workers, more \nthan a third of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families. More \nthan 6 million children would benefit from this raise that their \nparents would receive.\n  One of the fundamental principles of our country and our economy is \nthat people should be able to support their families by their efforts, \nby their labors, by their works. That is when the\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\neconomy is working well. That is the reality. Here we have a situation \nwhere there are people working two jobs sometimes, working 40 and 50 \nhours a week, who still don't have sufficient income to meet the \ndemands of the family. Here in this country we should at least be able \nto guarantee to someone that if they are working that hard, they should \nat least be able to support their family out of poverty. That is at the \ncore of what we are trying to do today.\n  While the minimum wage has remained stagnant--because it is not just \na question of how much a family earns; it is also a question of how \nmuch they must pay to support the basic demands of life--we have seen, \nfor example, health insurance premiums increase 87 percent since 2000 \nalone. How does one afford health care if your wages don't go up? These \npremiums now average roughly $11,000 per year, and that is more than \nthe annual wages of a full-time minimum wage worker. Clearly, they are \nnot going to be buying health insurance policies. And, by the way, I \ndon't think they are going to be able to take advantage of the \nPresident's proposal for a tax deduction because, simply, they are not \nable to buy the health insurance in the first place, nor are they able \nto wait a year to get a tax deduction on a tax liability that is \nprobably close to zero, if not, in fact, zero.\n  Additionally, if you look at college tuition, another aspect of \nfamily life which is part of the American dream, the notion, again, \nthat you can go ahead and ensure or help at least your children to do \nbetter, to go to college, one of the things that recent economic \nstudies have shown is that because we do not have the full access and \naffordability of college, the class structure is becoming more rigid. \nBack in the 1950s and 1960s, if you were predicting the income of a son \nbased on his father's income, the correlation was somewhere at 20, 30, \n40 percent. Today it is 60 percent. If you are a wealthy parent, you \nwill probably have wealthy children. But the reverse is also true; if \nyou are a low-income worker, the chances of your son or daughter rising \nto the top in this economy are much less than they were 40 and 50 years \nago. Horatio Alger is not alive and well in America today as he once \nwas.\n  This economy has to be more representative of giving people a chance \nto move up. The key to that, or one of the significant keys, is access \nto higher education. We have to do more. One thing at least we can do, \nif the prices of higher education are rising so much, is certainly to \nat least raise wages and raise the minimum wage.\n  Every day the minimum wage is not increased it continues to leave \nworkers behind because inflation continues unabated at levels that are \nmodest in terms of historical comparisons, but it still is eating away \nat that existing minimum wage. Today the real value of the minimum wage \nis more than $4 below what it was in 1968. Think of that. In 1968, we \ncould afford to pay much higher wages to those people engaged in \nminimum wage work, and it didn't upset our economy. To have the \npurchasing power that it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be \nmore than $9.37 an hour, not $5.15 as it is today, or even $7.25. If we \ncould do it in 1968, why can't we do it today?\n  History also suggests that raising the minimum wage does not have a \nnegative impact on jobs. You will hear a lot of people say this is \ngoing to distort the employment numbers, and it is going to inhibit \nemployment.\n  In the 4 years after the last minimum wage increase passed in 1997, \nthe economy experienced the strongest growth in over three decades. We \nhave not seen that kind of growth since the late nineties or during \nthis administration. But following the last increase, nearly 12 million \nnew jobs were added, at a pace of about 248,000 a month. In contrast, \nin the most recent 4-year period, the minimum wage has remained \nstagnant and only a small fraction of that number of jobs has been \ncreated. Because of the increase in productivity, because of the fact \nthat workers are more effective, they should be able to be compensated \nmore. That is not happening as it should.\n  Working families are struggling to meet their most basic needs, and a \nfair increase in the wage floor is the right direction to take for this \nCongress. I am disappointed that our most recent efforts to clearly and \nsimply raise the minimum wage are being linked to other provisions. \nAmerican families deserve the much needed boost that this raise will \nprovide. They deserve to hear a clear signal from this Senate that we \nare on their side, they are not an afterthought to be added to other \nprovisions.\n  Mr. President, this is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to work as \nquickly as possible to pass the minimum wage increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud today to rise in support of \nthe working men and women of this country. I am proud to speak for an \nidea whose time has long since come: Our lowest paid workers--people \nwho drive this economy--deserve a raise. I will be proud to vote for a \nbill that gives them a raise, a bill that increases the minimum wage \nfrom $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour.\n  This raise is years overdue. Right now, the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage is at its lowest level in more than half a century, since \nDwight Eisenhower was President and Bill Haley and the Comets topped \nthe charts. The value of the current wage is 30 percent lower than it \nwas 25 years ago.\n  I know a little something about earning minimum wage. I have had a \nnumber of minimum wage-type jobs--as a carhop, a highway worker, and as \na pie cutter. If there are other pie cutters in the Senate, I would \nlike to meet them. Of course, I was also a waitress to help pay for \nschool. My career as a waitress came to an abrupt end when I spilled 12 \nice teas on one customer. That is when I decided to go to law school. \nBut I can tell you that job taught me how important it is for our \nleaders to look out for minimum wage workers.\n  Today, nearly 15 million American workers--more than 10 percent of \nthe workforce--are counting on us to help them get a fairer wage. \nAlmost 7 million of them would directly benefit because their hourly \npay is below $7.25 an hour. Another 8 million with wages slightly above \nthis level would also get a much needed boost.\n  In my State, Minnesota, more than 200,000 people are waiting for \nCongress to do its job.\n  Lifting the minimum wage is the fair thing to do. Working class \nfamilies are getting left behind, even as corporations see record \nprofits and corporate executives and the superwealthy see record \nsalaries. If the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as the \nsalary increases for CEOs, the rate would now be more than $23 an hour.\n  This is not just about kids working at fast food places, though they \ncertainly deserve a better deal, too. Eighty percent of workers who \nwould benefit from this bill are age 20 or older. More than half work \nfull time. More than a third are their family's sole earners.\n  The bill we are debating today provides real relief to these workers \nand their families. Even as the purchasing power of the minimum wage \nhas gone down, costs for working families have gone up, and they are \nstill rising. Health care costs in our State have gone up 80 percent in \nthe last 6 years. College tuition at the University of Minnesota has \ngone up 80 percent in the past 7 years. It is getting tougher to afford \na house and to go to school. And gas prices are always a concern.\n  Wherever I go in Minnesota, I see people struggling with the brutal \ncombination of declining real wages and increasing costs. At the lunch \ncounters, gas stations, in the big cities, and at county fairs they \ntalk about the need for help. This is the time for us to give them that \nhelp.\n  Lifting the minimum wage is also the principled thing to do. A raise \nmeans more money to these working families, and it sends a signal that \nwe, as a community, value hard work and we insist on a fair deal for \nall Americans. That is a signal that the old leadership in Washington \nfailed to send. With this bipartisan bill, we can tell our workers that \nwe stand for the hard-working people of America.\n  Lifting the minimum wage is also the smart thing to do. It will \ndecrease poverty, increase family buying power, and strengthen the \nconsumer base in our communities. Some like to say that a minimum wage \nincrease kills\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\njobs. People have consistently made this argument when the minimum wage \nis debated. They have consistently been wrong. States that have raised \ntheir own minimum wages have not seen job losses, and many have \nactually outperformed the rest of the country in job creation.\n  A raise would not only have positive economic effects, it will also \nhave positive social effects. As a prosecutor, I saw firsthand how \ncrime took over communities where people could not make ends meet. When \npeople struggled, even after working hard, they often turned to drugs \nor violence or both. I learned how good jobs that pay fair wages can be \nthe best crime-fighting tool.\n  Lifting the minimum wage is the fair, principled, and smart thing to \ndo across the board. But it will also have a particularly powerful \neffect on women. Women make up less than half of the workforce, but \nthey make up roughly 60 percent of those who will directly gain from \nthis raise. More than 40 percent of these working women have full-time \njobs.\n  Three million working mothers will see a benefit from this \nlegislation, including hundreds of thousands of single moms. Many of \nthese women work in demanding retail and hospitality jobs--waitresses, \nstore clerks, hotel maids-- where they are on their feet or running \naround all day.\n\n  Despite their hard work, they have an almost impossible time making \nends meet. They struggle to afford health care or college tuition for \ntheir kids or even basics such as gas and groceries. I am in awe of \nthese women. I am a working mother and wife, and I have worked at \nminimum wage, but I have never had to do both at the same time. Today, \nyou can do something for them.\n  The challenges of working in the hospitality industry raise the final \nissue I would like to talk about today--the so-called tip credit.\n  Under current Federal law, tipped employees, including waitresses, \nbellhops, and maids, are entitled to a Federal minimum wage of only \n$2.13 an hour. They have to make up the difference between $2.13 and \nthe real minimum wage with their tips.\n  States have always been allowed to change this rule. My State, \nMinnesota, similar to several others, has done that. The people of \nMinnesota decided that tipped workers should receive the same minimum \nwage as all other workers. That is now the law of Minnesota and six \nother States. Tipped workers earn the State minimum wage and pay taxes \non both their wages and their tips.\n  Last year, the old Congress tried to take away Minnesota's right to \nenforce this law. The minimum wage bill proposed back then would have \npreempted State law and would have caused Minnesota's tipped wage \nworkers' wages to immediately fall by about $4 per hour.\n  Thankfully, this provision didn't become law. Unfortunately, some \npeople in Congress have talked about trying it again this year. They \nare seeking to pass a provision that limits Minnesota's future right to \nfix a fair wage for tipped workers. They think Washington knows better \nthan the people of Minnesota what our State's wage policy should be.\n  I oppose these efforts. For one thing, the people of Minnesota had \ngood reasons when they eliminated the tip penalty. They saw that tips \nare uncertain income, given at the discretion of the consumer. They \nrecognize the hard work and long hours that tipped employees put in. \nThey determined that customers give tips to reward service, not to \ndirectly pay the wages of the people who serve them. They wanted the \nState wage law to reflect these facts.\n  The people of Minnesota know about women such as Marie Hanson of \nRochester. I have spoken with Marie, and her story is the best argument \nI can think of for making sure our tipped workers get fair wages. Marie \nhas been a waitress at the Cahler Grand Grill in Rochester for many \nyears. She has put two kids through school on her waitress salary, and \nnow she is looking to save for her own retirement. If her wages are \ncut, or if she had been paid lower wages these past few years, her \nalready difficult task of raising kids and making ends meet would have \nbecome impossible. For too long, Congress has favored corporations and \nbillionaires who stash money in tax shelters in the Cayman Islands. Now \nit is time for Congress to pay attention to women such as Marie Hanson.\n  Against this backdrop, Washington should not undo the will of the \npeople of Minnesota. States have always had the sovereign right to set \ntheir own wage policy above a Federal floor and for good reason. We all \nknow that States understand the unique conditions and challenges they \nface in a way that Washington never can. And many States, including \nmine, have crafted their own minimum wage laws that are stronger and \nfairer than the current Federal law.\n  That is how it should be. If we take away Minnesota's right to \ndetermine wages for tipped workers, what is next? Will the people who \nare pushing this proposal seek to stop States from setting their own \nhigher minimum wages? Will they subvert the will of the people in more \nthan 25 States that have stronger laws than the Federal law?\n  People who would require Minnesota and like States to impose a tip \npenalty say they are doing it to help small businesses in these States \ncompete against small businesses in neighboring States. But the exact \nsame argument can be made of a Federal law forbidding all States from \nsetting higher minimum wages. Is that the next step? I don't think so.\n  As somebody who visited all 87 counties in Minnesota last year, I \nunderstand very well the importance of small businesses to our \ncommunities. I wish to make sure that small businesses remain a vibrant \ndriver of our economy. I know that the tip penalty concerns of small \nbusinesses in Minnesota, especially those in towns bordering other \nStates, are real and they should not be ignored. But they are not best \nresolved here; they are best resolved much closer to home, in the State \ncapital. Washington cannot possibly understand, let alone balance, all \nof the competing concerns that arise in this aspect of State wage \npolicy. St Paul, MN, can. That is how it has always worked, and it \nshould continue to work this way.\n  This is not to say that there are not small business issues common to \nall States that this Congress can address. I have talked with small \nbusiness owners in Rochester and Duluth and Wilmer about the challenges \nthey face, including high health care costs. I see the value of giving \nsome relief and some incentives to small businesses trying to thrive. \nBut Congress should not stop States from protecting tipped workers.\n  With all of this in mind, I urge this Chamber to fight for working \nfamilies and especially the working women of this country. I urge this \nChamber to pass a long-overdue minimum wage increase that doesn't deny \nor limit States historical right to pursue their own wage policy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:28 p.m., recessed until \n1:36 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer \n(Mr. Menendez).\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland for--how much time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. For 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. For 5 minutes, or whatever time she desires, without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished \nchairman of\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\nthe Appropriations Committee for so courteously yielding me these 5 \nminutes. I know he is eager to bring his own thoughts to the Senate \nfloor, and we, of course, are always mesmerized when Senator Byrd \nspeaks.\n  I rise as an enthusiastic cosponsor of the fair minimum wage \nlegislation. Right now, it pays $5.15 an hour. If you add that all up, \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that comes out to $10,700 a year. \nThat is $6,000 below the national poverty line. That is a phrase we \nthrow around glibly, easily, and in a very facile way. When we use the \nterm poverty line--I remember when it was invented by a wonderful woman \nat the Social Security Administration, Molly Orshansky. When we were \ntruly fighting a war against poverty, she said: What is the line \nbetween being able to live a decent, sufficient life? She set it at \nthat time, 40 years ago, at $3,000. Now the national poverty line is \n$16,060 for a family of three. That means bare minimum necessities to \nlive in the United States of America. It doesn't allow for school \ntrips. It doesn't allow for vacations. It is certainly not a latte-\ndrinking, Volvo-driving minimum wage.\n  On top of asking the people who work at this, we are now saying: It \nis OK if a full-time job in the United States of America means full-\ntime poverty. Where are our guts? Where is our grit? Where is our \nreward for saying that hard work is worth it? That is what we are \nsaying now. Hard work should be worth it.\n  Now we are raising the minimum wage, and I salute the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his steadfast advocacy on this issue and for speaking \nup on how this is a woman's issue. There is a lot of hand-wringing over \nthis raise, and I don't know why, because even when we raise it to what \nthe Senate is proposing, to $7.25 an hour over a 2-year period, it \nstill means workers will earn $15,080 a year. We are still going to be \nbelow the national poverty line. I would raise it more.\n  There are those who say: Let the market forces work. You bet, let the \nmarket forces work. But at the same time know that this has to be a \nminimum fair wage.\n  I am very distressed about the fact of the impact this has on women. \nIf ever there was a woman's issue, wow, it is the minimum wage. Women \nare especially hurt by Congress's failure to raise the minimum wage. \nForget that we don't increase equal pay for equal work, and we still \nmake 75 cents for every dollar men make. Forget that we don't even \nenforce the wage laws that are on the books. But if we do recall, what \nmy colleagues need to know is two-thirds of all of the minimum wage \nworkers in America are women--two-thirds--meaning a full-time job, \nfull-time poverty. Women account for full-time workers in the lowest \npaid jobs: maids and housekeepers, food servers and, most of all, \nchildcare workers. What does that mean?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Of course, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could ask the Senator--I know we are on a short \ntime and perhaps the Senator from West Virginia would yield us 3 more \nminutes? Would the Senator do that?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield as much time as the Senators may \ndesire.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank, as always, my friend and colleague. But on this \npoint the Senator from Maryland makes about the lowest paying jobs, the \nlowest paying jobs in America are predominantly filled by women is the \npoint the Senator was making. We find 87 percent of maids are women; \nfood servers, 66 percent; cashiers, 75 percent; and childcare, the \npoint the Senator was making, is 93 percent.\n\n  The point the Senator has so eloquently made is that women have an \ninterest in raising the minimum wage because of the enormous impact it \nhas on women generally. I hope the Senator in her time will comment \nabout the impact on the children of these women.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, other Senate \nwomen will be coming to the Senate today on this issue.\n  The Senator is absolutely right, raising the minimum wage will impact \nwomen. Our data analysis says 7 million women will benefit from the \nproposed increase in the minimum wage; 7 million women will take one \nmore step out of poverty. We need to remember that many of these women \nare also single moms and get a double whammy. Not only are they working \nin a full-time job that guarantees full-time poverty, but often they \ndon't get their child support.\n  We are asking them to raise their children below the poverty line in \nthe United States of America. Then we diddle and dawdle and ditz around \nin terms of helping them collect their child support, yet we want them \nto give full-time energy to being a mom. We ask them for more parental \ninvolvement. These mothers want to have more parental involvement, but \nthere has to be more Senate involvement getting these women out of \npoverty. Getting these women out of poverty will not come only from \nraising the minimum wage, but it is a very important step forward.\n  We want to ensure that if you work in the United States of America, \nit should be worth it. No. 2, when you do work and get paid, again, you \nwere not below the poverty line.\n  The impact on families is astounding. If a family is poor, they will \nnot have enough to eat. Nutrition plays a big role in child development \nand learning ability. You are not going to feel warm, you will not feel \nsafe, you are not going to feel secure, and you also are going to \nwonder about this country regarding rewarding work.\n  The women of the United States of America deserve better. For those \nwomen doing well, we want to do right by those who aren't. A childcare \nworker right now working in Baltimore, working on the Eastern Shore, in \nthe western Maryland mountains, or in Bethesda is working as hard as \nthose working in the Senate or those downtown at law firms. We want to \nsay to the women of the United States of America, we are on your side.\n  We want to make sure we pass this minimum wage. And to 7 million \nwomen, we hope you will sleep better and be able to live better because \nof what we are doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have, may I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no limit on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 39 \nare located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 44 of the United States Code, to provide for \n  the suspension of fines under certain circumstances for first-time \n            paperwork violations by small business concerns)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SUSPENSION OF FINES FOR FIRST-TIME PAPERWORK \n                   VIOLATIONS BY SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.\n\n       Section 3506 of title 44, United States Code (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Paperwork Reduction Act''), is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) Small Businesses.--\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\n       ``(1) Small business concern.--In this subsection, the term \n     `small business concern' means a business concern that meets \n     the requirements of section 3(a) of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 632(a)) and the regulations promulgated under that \n     section.\n       ``(2) In general.--In the case of a first-time violation by \n     a small business concern of a requirement regarding the \n     collection of information by an agency, the head of that \n     agency shall not impose a civil fine on the small business \n     concern unless the head of the agency determines that--\n       ``(A) the violation has the potential to cause serious harm \n     to the public interest;\n       ``(B) failure to impose a civil fine would impede or \n     interfere with the detection of criminal activity;\n       ``(C) the violation is a violation of an internal revenue \n     law or a law concerning the assessment or collection of any \n     tax, debt, revenue, or receipt;\n       ``(D) the violation was not corrected on or before the date \n     that is 6 months after the date of receipt by the small \n     business concern of notification of the violation in writing \n     from the agency; or\n       ``(E) except as provided in paragraph (3), the violation \n     presents a danger to the public health or safety.\n       ``(3) Danger to public health or safety.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In any case in which the head of an \n     agency determines under paragraph (2)(E) that a violation \n     presents a danger to the public health or safety, the head of \n     the agency may, notwithstanding paragraph (2)(E), determine \n     not to impose a civil fine on the small business concern if \n     the violation is corrected not later than 24 hours after \n     receipt by the small business owner of notification of the \n     violation in writing.\n       ``(B) Considerations.--In determining whether to provide a \n     small business concern with 24 hours to correct a violation \n     under subparagraph (A), the head of an agency shall take into \n     account all of the facts and circumstances regarding the \n     violation, including--\n       ``(i) the nature and seriousness of the violation, \n     including whether the violation is technical or inadvertent \n     or involves willful or criminal conduct;\n       ``(ii) whether the small business concern has made a good \n     faith effort to comply with applicable laws and to remedy the \n     violation within the shortest practicable period of time; and\n       ``(iii) whether the small business concern has obtained a \n     significant economic benefit from the violation.\n       ``(C) Notice to congress.--In any case in which the head of \n     an agency imposes a civil fine on a small business concern \n     for a violation that presents a danger to the public health \n     or safety and does not provide the small business concern \n     with 24 hours to correct the violation under subparagraph \n     (A), the head of that agency shall notify Congress regarding \n     that determination not later than the date that is 60 days \n     after the date that the civil fine is imposed by that agency.\n       ``(4) Limited to first-time violations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--This subsection shall not apply to any \n     violation by a small business concern of a requirement \n     regarding collection of information by an agency if that \n     small business concern previously violated any requirement \n     regarding collection of information by that agency.\n       ``(B) Other agencies.--For purposes of making a \n     determination under subparagraph (A), the head of an agency \n     shall not take into account any violation of a requirement \n     regarding collection of information by another agency.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment No. \n110. It is very simple, very straightforward, very basic, but also very \nimportant. It is to reduce, in a meaningful way, the excessive \npaperwork burden facing small businesses.\n  As I begin, I also want to thank Senator Voinovich for cosponsoring \nthis amendment. As have I, he has long been at work on this issue and \nhas offered great leadership. I thank him for joining with me in this \neffort.\n  Businesses face enormous hurdles and obstacles and challenges, \nparticularly small business. Unfortunately, one of them has become the \nenormous paperwork burden created by all levels of government. A small \nbusiness in Louisiana, depending on the nature and location of the \nbusiness, has to deal with myriad Federal agencies. Just off the top of \nmy head, these include the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Coast \nGuard, SBA, Labor, Commerce, IRS, and Customs, to name a few. That \ndoesn't include--and my amendment doesn't pertain to--all of the State \nagencies with which they similarly have to deal and file paperwork \nbecause of regulations from local entities at the governmental level.\n  The compounded effect of this is enormous. All of those requirements, \npaperwork and others, can be absolutely suffocating. There has been \nsome quantification of this enormous compliance cost. In September \n2005, the SBA Office of Advocacy released a study that gave us a \nglimpse into this. It said businesses with fewer than 20 employees \nspend more than $7,600 per employee just to comply with Federal \nregulations. That is a staggering cost. To a truly small business that \ndoesn't have a vice president in charge of compliance, doesn't have a \nteam of lawyers or a team of paper filers in the back office to take \ncare of it, that is a real burden. It distracts the principals of the \nbusiness from doing what they set out to do, the main focus and mission \nof the business.\n  All too often, the way those regulations and requirements are \nadministered is in the tone of a ``gotcha'' game, fining small \nbusinesses for paperwork violations just to say ``gotcha,'' just for \nthe sake of doing it, of issuing those violations and in some cases of \ngaining revenue for the department of government. All of that is wrong, \nand we need to change it.\n  Nobody here--myself included--is arguing that we don't need a \nlegitimate layer of regulation to protect and promote health and \nsafety, the environment, worker safety, et cetera. Nobody is arguing \nagainst that. That is not what we are talking about. What we are \ntalking about today is an amendment I offer on the minimum wage bill \nwhich includes provisions I introduced separately as the Small Business \nPaperwork Relief Act of 2007. I thank Mr. Neugebauer of Texas in the \nHouse for introducing identical companion legislation, as we both did \nin the last Congress. Again, this is basic, straightforward, simple, \nbut very important to small business.\n  This is exactly how it would work. It would direct Federal agencies \nnot to impose civil fines for a first-time violation of their agency's \npaperwork requirements by a small business unless the head of the \nagency determines the following: the violation has the potential to \ncause serious harm to the public interest; not issuing a fine may \nimpair criminal investigations; the violation is a violation of \nInternal Revenue law; the violation is not corrected within 6 months; \nor the violation presents a danger to public health or safety. In \naddition, the amendment says that fines can be waived in the case of a \nviolation that could potentially present a danger, if the violation is \ncorrected within 24 hours of the small business receiving notification \nof the violation. It is important that the first list of those \npossibilities are mandatory. An agency can't issue civil fines for a \nfirst-time violation unless one of those things happens. But the second \npart of it--fines can be waived unless corrected within 24 hours--is \ndiscretionary. A fine doesn't have to be waived in that instance by the \nappropriate Federal regulatory agency.\n  This is very constrained, very limited, very common sense. Again, the \nmost important part of the provision is, it is first-time violations. \nIt is a small business. It is civil penalties only. We are not talking \ncriminal. We are not talking a big business with a big compliance \nsection. We are not talking a mandatory waiving of fines for health and \nsafety violations where it goes to public health.\n  This is not only a reasonable thing to do, it is long overdue \nconsidering the enormous compliance costs I alluded to before--$7,600 \nper worker for a small business of 20 employees or less--just to take \ncare of Federal requirements. That doesn't count State or local. We are \nonly dealing with Federal because we are the Federal legislature.\n  This bill is particularly relevant to my home following the \ndevastation of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. The small business base in \nLouisiana was devastated by those horrific events. In many areas, small \nbusinesses are starting from scratch, and the whole community of small \nbusinesses is starting from scratch as it begins to recover from that \ndestruction. Particularly in that context, they need this sort of \nreasonable relief--limited, focused civil fines only, first-time \nviolations only, small business only, only mandatory waiver when it \ndoesn't involve a threat to public health and safety, all of the very \nstrenuous and carefully outlined requirements I set out.\n  I hope everybody in this Chamber can come together to support this \ncommonsense proposal. In a broader vein, I hope this is a part--not the \nonly element but a part--of our coming together to pass a minimum wage \nincrease with small business regulatory\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\nand other relief. We should not do one or the other in this context; we \nshould do both. That is the reasonable bipartisan compromise which I \nhope we are moving to on the Senate floor--yes, a minimum wage \nincrease; yes, real and meaningful regulatory and other relief for \nsmall business such as the commonsense paperwork reduction act.\n  In addition, I hope that small business relief involves relief in an \narea that is most important to small business and so many millions of \nAmericans; that is, the ability to access and afford health insurance. \nWe will have amendments about that as well.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to support this modest commonsense \nbut important measure. I urge all Members of the Senate to come \ntogether to support a minimum wage increase with real relief for small \nbusiness, whether it is dealing with paperwork, whether it is affording \nor accessing health care insurance--all of those important things small \nbusinesses face while continuing to be the engine of job creation, the \nbackbone of our Louisiana and American economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, America's workers deserve a raise, and \nthat is why I rise in strong support of S. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act \nof 2007. America's workers have helped our country make tremendous \ngains in productivity and economic growth, and they deserve to share in \nthe prosperity they have created. I am very proud to represent a State \nthat has a high minimum wage, and I want to share some of the lessons \nwe have learned about providing a living wage in the State of \nWashington.\n  We need to do the right thing and pass a clean minimum wage bill now, \nwithout any of the antiworker amendments that may be offered on the \nother side. As we have heard, it has been almost 10 years since this \nCongress last raised the minimum wage. During that time, the real value \nof that wage has fallen by more than 21 percent. At the same time, the \ncosts of health care, energy, and housing have all gone up \nsignificantly. As a result, many of our middle-class workers have been \nsqueezed. I can only imagine the challenges minimum wage workers face \nevery day while trying to maintain their families and their dignity on \n$10,000 a year. We can be proud that America's businesses have \nprospered over the last decade, thanks to a 31-percent increase in \nworker productivity and a huge 47-percent increase in profits. Now it \nis time for the least paid of America's workers to share in those \ngains.\n  During this debate, we have heard the usual claims that raising the \nminimum wage hurts businesses. In my State, that has not been the \nexperience. Washington State, in fact, has the highest minimum wage in \nthe country. We are living proof that a livable minimum wage is good \nfor our State economy, good for small businesses, and it is good for \nour citizens. In 2006, our State's average unemployment rate was 4.9 \npercent, the lowest since 1999. We created 79,000 new jobs. Our poverty \nrate is 11.9 percent, which is lower than the national average. And our \nmedian household income stands at $49,000, much higher than the \nnational average.\n  Our State minimum wage, which is indexed to inflation, has helped \nmake for good labor productivity and a healthy economy. We have heard \nfrom my esteemed colleague, Senator Kennedy, chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, that States with higher minimum wages create more small \nbusinesses and more jobs. Last year, the Fiscal Policy Institute \nreported that States with a higher minimum wage created nearly 10 \npercent more jobs and 5 percent more small businesses. A May 2006 \nGallup Poll found that 86 percent of small business owners thought that \nraising the minimum wage did not affect their businesses. I could cite \nstatistics like that all day, but I think the best evidence is really \nwhat continues to happen in my State compared with a neighboring State \nthat has a much lower minimum wage.\n  Washington State's minimum wage is $7.39 an hour. Right next door to \nus, Idaho has a minimum wage at the Federal level of $5.15 per hour. \nSince 1998, when our voters in Washington State passed our minimum wage \nlaw, Washington employers have been flooded with job applicants from \nIdaho. Now Washington companies can pick the best qualified workers \nfrom the entire region. On January 11, the New York Times reported that \nWashington State businesses have seen great benefits, while Idaho \nbusinesses have not.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this New York Times article by \nTimothy Egan in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This article quotes Don Brunell, president of the \nAssociation of Washington Business. He says that raising the Federal \nminimum wage is ``almost a no-brainer.'' Washington's strong economy is \nproof that even with the highest minimum wage in the United States, as \nMr. Brunell put it--and he is president of the Association of \nWashington Business--``Washington is a great place to do business.''\n  Some people predicted that small businesses would be hurt in my \nState. But instead, as the article notes, they have prospered beyond \ntheir expectations. So we have a lot of opportunity to do good here, \nnot just for our workers but for our businesses and for our economy. \nBut to do the most good, we have to pass a clean bill, one that is free \nfrom unrelated tax provisions and one that rejects antiworker \namendments.\n  Historically, Congress has not found it necessary to pair a minimum \nwage increase with a package of tax giveaways. In fact, since 1936, \nCongress has raised the minimum wage nine times. But only once has such \nan increase been paired with a tax rollback. We should pass a clean \nbill that gives workers the raise they are long overdue.\n  In addition, we should not let this bill be used to weaken the rights \nof American workers. As the chairman of the HELP Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Workplace Safety, I am troubled by a number of the \namendments being floated now by our Republican colleagues, proposals to \nattack the 40-hour workweek, to take away workers' overtime, and to \nforce a pay cut on workers who earn their living from tips. There is \nalso a deeply flawed proposal that would change the treatment of \nprofessional employer organizations under the Tax Code.\n  This week, while we try to raise the wages of one group of workers, \nwe have to fend off the Republican attacks on working families and \ntheir right to earn overtime. We all know how the demands of work and \nfamily pull two-career parents away from their loved ones all too \noften. For parents getting their kids to and from school and to \nafterschool activity is not easy, especially when you are forced to \nwork uncertain hours. The uncertainty of having to work, say, 50 to 60 \nhours this week and then 20 or 30 hours next week will put incredible \nstrains on many of our overburdened families.\n  Taking away their workplace rights and their ability to collect \novertime would be a cruel and unwarranted double hit on America's \nworking families. The Senate should, once again, reject the Republican \ncomp time and 40-hour work week proposals, because they would force a \npay cut on millions of middle-class workers. We know, for those workers \nwho are eligible, overtime can amount to as much as 25 percent of their \nyearly income. We should not undermine the ability of working parents \nto balance their lives and share in the American dream.\n  The Republican comp time proposal would force our workers to take \ncomp time instead of pay. On top of that pay cut, workers would be at \nthe mercy of their employer when it came to asking to use that \naccumulated comp time. We all know that comp time often disappears \nunder employer pressures of deadlines and other productivity needs.\n  I believe it is important that this Congress protect the rights of \nthese hard-working families from an erosion of their quality of life \nand their ability to spend time with their families. We have to stop \nthese attacks on working families and start moving in the right \ndirection, like expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  I hope we also work to protect our workers who rely on tips. As we \nhave heard from my female colleagues on this floor already, nearly two-\nthirds of\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\nour minimum wage workers in this country are women. Many of them are \nsingle parents. Raising the minimum wage can give them a small measure \nof economic security and the ability to better support their families. \nMany of these low-wage workers are service workers, people such as \nhairdressers, maids, and waitresses. Many in Washington State rely on \ntips as a significant part of their livelihood. We should not support \namendments that would undermine the tips our workers rely on. In my \nState of Washington, that would mean a pay cut of some $12,000 annually \nfor over 120,000 of our tipped workers.\n  Finally, I want to say I am very concerned about the proposed tax \nchanges for professional employer organizations. I fear that this \nchange could undermine the fiscal stability of our State unemployment \ninsurance and worker compensation fund. It would also put more burdens \non our employers who are already playing by the rules.\n  Further, it would reduce worker health and safety protections by \nundermining incentives for companies to maintain safe and healthy \nworkplaces. By the way, it could also provide an opening for those \nseeking to change the well-established rules of the employer-employee \nrelationship under the Fair Labor Standards Act. I believe there should \nbe serious thought and debate in the Congress before we make such \nfundamental changes in our labor laws.\n  In conclusion, we can do this right by passing a clean bill that \nfinally gives American workers the raise they have earned. Over the \nlast 8 years, Washington State has proven that a minimum wage increase \nis good for our State's economy and helps our economic development. It \nincreases small business ownership and, of course, it helps our workers \nmaintain their quality of life.\n  I join my colleagues to urge a vote in favor of this bill to increase \nthe minimum wage so that we can finally, and importantly, give our low-\nincome workers the raise they so richly deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 11, 2007]\n\n        For $7.93 an Hour, It's Worth a Trip Across a State Line\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       Liberty Lake, Wa. Jan. 9.--Just eight miles separate this \n     town on the Washington side of the state border from Post \n     Falls on the Idaho side. But the towns are nearly $3 an hour \n     apart in the required minimum wage. Washington pays the \n     highest in the nation, just under $8 an hour, and Idaho has \n     among the lowest, matching 21 states that have not raised the \n     hourly wage beyond the federal minimum of $5.15.\n       Nearly a decade ago, when voters in Washington approved a \n     measure that would give the state's lowest-paid workers a \n     raise nearly every year, many business leaders predicted that \n     small towns on this side of the state line would suffer.\n       But instead of shriveling up, small-business owners in \n     Washington say they have prospered far beyond their \n     expectations. In fact, as a significant increase in the \n     national minimum wage heads toward law, businesses here at \n     the dividing line between two economies--a real-life \n     laboratory for the debate--have found that raising prices to \n     compensate for higher wages does not necessarily lead to \n     losses in jobs and profits.\n       Idaho teenagers cross the state line to work in fast-food \n     restaurants in Washington, where the minimum wage is 54 \n     percent higher. That has forced businesses in Idaho to raise \n     their wages to compete.\n       Business owners say they have had to increase prices \n     somewhat to keep up. But both states are among the nation's \n     leaders in the growth of jobs and personal income, suggesting \n     that an increase in the minimum wage has not hurt the overall \n     economy.\n       ``We're paying the highest wage we've ever had to pay, and \n     our business is still up more than 11 percent over last \n     year,'' said Tom Singleton, who manages a Papa Murphy's \n     takeout pizza store here, with 13 employees.\n       His store is flooded with job applicants from Idaho, Mr. \n     Singleton said. Like other business managers in Washington, \n     he said he had less turnover because the jobs paid more.\n       By contrast, an Idaho restaurant owner, Rob Elder, said he \n     paid more than the minimum wage because he could not find \n     anyone to work for the Idaho minimum at his Post Falls \n     restaurant, the Hot Rod Cafe.\n       ``At $5.15 an hour, I get zero applicants--or maybe a guy \n     with one leg who wouldn't pass a drug test and wouldn't show \n     up on Saturday night because he wants to get drunk with his \n     buddies,'' Mr. Elder said.\n       For years, economists have debated the effect that raising \n     the minimum wage would have on business. While the federal \n     minimum wage has not gone up for 10 years, 29 states have \n     raised their wage beyond the federal minimum.\n       These increases, according to critics like Brendan Flanagan \n     of the National Restaurant Association, are a burden on the \n     small, mostly family-run businesses in fast food and \n     agriculture that employ workers at the lowest end of the pay \n     scale.\n       ``We see the political momentum for this,'' said Mr. \n     Flanagan, a vice president at the association, ``but we \n     cannot ignore what our members are telling us, which is that \n     it will lead to job losses.''\n       But the state's major business lobby, the Association of \n     Washington Business, is no longer fighting the minimum-wage \n     law, which is adjusted every year in line with the consumer \n     price index.\n       ``You don't see us screaming out loud about this,'' said \n     Don Brunell, president of the trade group, which represents \n     6,300 members.\n       ``It's almost a no-brainer,'' Mr. Brunell said, that the \n     federal minimum should go higher. Association officials say \n     they would like to see some flexibility for rural and small-\n     town businesses, however.\n       Washington's robust economy, which added nearly 90,000 jobs \n     last year, is proof that even with the country's highest \n     minimum wage, ``this is a great place to do business,'' Mr. \n     Brunell said.\n       During a recession five years ago, the same group had \n     argued that Washington's high minimum wage law would send \n     businesses fleeing to Idaho. The group sent out a news \n     release with a criticism of the law from John Fazzari, who \n     owns a family-run pizza business in Clarkston, Wash., just \n     minutes from the Idaho town of Lewiston.\n       But now Mr. Fazzari says business has never been better, \n     and he has no desire to move to Idaho.\n       ``To tell you the truth, my business is fantastic,'' he \n     said in an interview. ``I've never done as much business in \n     my life.''\n       Mr. Fazzari employs 42 people at his pizza parlor. New \n     workers make the Washington minimum, $7.93 an hour, but \n     veteran employees make more. To compensate for the required \n     annual increase in the minimum wage, Mr. Fazzari said he \n     raises prices slightly. But he said most customers barely \n     notice.\n       He sells more pizza, he said, because he has a better \n     product, and because his customers are loyal.\n       ``If you look 10 years down the road, we will probably have \n     no minimum wage jobs on this side of the border, and lots of \n     higher-income jobs,'' Mr. Fazzari said.\n       Job figures from both states tend to support his point. \n     While Idaho leads the nation in new job growth, it has a far \n     higher percentage of minimum-wage jobs than Washington. \n     Minimum-wage positions make up just 2.4 percent of the jobs \n     in Washington, while about 13 percent of the jobs in Idaho \n     pay at or less than the proposed federal minimum wage, \n     according to a study done for the state last year.\n       Part of the difference could be accounted for by a lower \n     cost of living in Idaho and the higher percentage of \n     technology, manufacturing and government jobs in Washington, \n     economists say. Still, it is hard to find a teenager in Idaho \n     who lives anywhere near Washington who is willing to work for \n     $5.15 an hour.\n       ``Are you kidding? There are so many jobs nearby that pay \n     way more than minimum wage,'' said Jennifer Stadtfeldt, who \n     is 17 and lives in Coeur d'Alene, which is just a few minutes \n     from Washington. She pointed out that Taco Bell, McDonald's \n     and other fast-food outlets in her town were posting signs \n     trying to entice entry-level workers with a starting pay of \n     $7 an hour.\n       The House today passed a bill increasing the minimum wage, \n     and about 13 million workers would see a pay raise if the \n     Senate and President Bush approve it. Mr. Bush has said he \n     would approve the wage increase so long as concerns of small-\n     business owners were taken into account; the Senate has not \n     yet taken up the bill.\n       Several studies have concluded that modest changes in the \n     minimum wage have little effect on employment. A study two \n     months ago by an economist at Washington State University \n     seemed to back the experience of Clarkston and other border \n     towns in Washington. The economist, David Holland, said job \n     loss was minimal when higher wages were forced on all \n     businesses. About 97 percent of all minimum-wage workers were \n     better off when wages went up, he wrote.\n       But other business groups argue that an increase would hurt \n     consumers and workers at the low end.\n       In a survey released on the eve of the November elections--\n     in which voters in six states considered raising their \n     minimum wages--the National Restaurant Association said \n     restaurants expected to raise their prices and eliminate some \n     jobs if the voters approved the measures. The initiatives all \n     passed.\n       Here on this border, business owners have found small ways \n     to raise their prices, and customers say they have barely \n     noticed.\n       ``We used to have a coupon, $3 off on any family-size \n     pizza, and we changed that to $2 off,'' said Mr. Singleton, \n     of Papa Murphy's. ``I haven't heard a single complaint.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last November, the American people sent an \nunmistakable and incredibly important message to their elected leaders. \nThey didn't ask for it, they demanded a change of course in Iraq. The \nAmerican people understand that the current strategy is not working. \nThey have demanded that we honor the extraordinary effort of our troops \nby providing a strategy for Iraq that is actually worthy of their \nsacrifice. They don't consider more of the same--additional troops \nessentially doing what they have been doing before--they don't consider \nthat anything other than an escalation of our military involvement, \nlinked to the same mistakes and same illusions of the past. They don't \nconsider that an acceptable strategy.\n  This new Congress comes here with a mandate, as well as a moral \nobligation, to find not just a new way forward in Iraq but the right \nway forward. That is what we owe the families; that is what we owe \nthose fighting forces.\n  It is clear the administration's litany of mistakes has made an \nincredibly difficult task that much harder and has reduced what we can \nreasonably expect to accomplish. As the saying goes around here, we are \nwhere we are. The mistakes of the past do not change the fact that \nCongress bears some responsibility for getting us into this war and, \ntherefore, must take responsibility for getting us out.\n  That responsibility starts by having a real bipartisan dialog on \nwhere we go from here. I believe we are finally at the point where that \ncan happen. We all agree about the nobility of the service of our \ntroops. We all agree about the incredible bravery of the men and women \nof our Armed Forces who put their lives on the line every single day in \nIraq. We all want to see a stable Iraq. We all know Iraqis want to see \nit, too. We all agree on the need to preserve our vital national \nsecurity interests in the region, and we all agree on the importance of \npreventing the violence in Iraq from spreading into a broader regional \nconflict. We all understand the need to prevent Iraq from becoming a \nsafe haven for al-Qaida and like-minded terrorists. We all understand \nthe potential of regional chaos and of failed states spreading one to \nthe other.\n  In order to understand, however, where we go from here, we have to \nremind ourselves of the real nature of this conflict. It is not enough \nto sort of find some safe haven in rhetoric that points out all of the \ndownsides but continues to pursue a policy that, in fact, increases \nthose downsides, invites those downsides, actually makes matters worse.\n  The civil war we are in the middle of now didn't begin when we went \nthere. It had been tamped down, quashed by a dictatorship and by \nhistory. Before I went back to visit the Middle East, I had the chance \nto read a book by Vali Nasr, called ``The Shia Revival,'' in which he \ntraces the history of Shiaism and what is happening in the Middle East \ntoday. What we learned from that is instructive and critical to \ndetermining whether troops will make a difference on how we resolve \nwhat is happening in Iraq today.\n  When the Prophet Mohammed died, Ali, who was his cousin and stepson \nand virtual son, was passed over at that time to be the caliph. In \nfact, three people were chosen in between him. Ultimately, he did \nbecome the caliph, but that was the beginning of the difference of the \nseparation, if you will, within Islam. That became far more pronounced \nabout 1,300 years ago, around 680, when the grandson of Ali was \nslaughtered in the desert along with 72 of his followers--72, a number \nthat comes back to haunt us today, because that was indeed an event in \nKarballah in 682 that defined martyrdom, which we see played to by the \nextreme religious efforts that are taking place today in the Middle \nEast.\n  Why do I mention this today? Because that is where the great Shia-\nSunni divide began. Ali and his followers were beheaded in the desert, \ntheir bodies left to rot in the sun. Their heads were posted, first in \nNajaf, and later in Damascus. That began to instill a depth of both \nanger and suppression that has gone on all of these centuries.\n  The fact is that we, through our invasion and our election, have \ngiven the Shia at the ballot box what they never could achieve all of \nthose years, and the Sunni, who have continually been the dominant, \nmore secular faction that managed the affairs of state, are suddenly \nfinding themselves in the minority; many believe they were born to the \nright to rule and are determined to restore it. This is the civil \nconflict we have put ourselves in the middle of, with American troops \nwho don't speak the language going door to door and house to house, \nattempting to somehow make sense of an alien environment they have been \nplunged into--from California, Kansas, Missouri, Massachusetts, and all \nof our States. We are doing precisely what Secretary Rumsfeld said we \nwould not do--putting our troops in the middle of a civil war.\n  On my recent trip to the Middle East, I heard grave concerns \nexpressed by Sunni leaders, Mubarak and others, about the Shia \nresurgence and Iran's growing influence in the region. Indeed, Iran's \ninfluence has grown, and we are partly responsible, if not \nsignificantly responsible, for that growth. We need to stand up for our \nallies in the region, our Sunni friends, yes. But we can and must do it \nin a way that doesn't exacerbate the Sunni-Shia rift in the region. \nThat is why we have to ask more of our Sunni allies when it comes to \npressuring the Sunnis in Iraq to accept that, with this turn of events \ncalled an election, they will no longer--absent a revolution, which \nsome are planning on--be running the country, and that they must lay \ndown their arms and join the political process.\n  We must make clear that countries such as Saudi Arabia can and must \ndo more to crack down on support for those Sunni insurgents coming into \nIraq from their country. We dare not forget that it is the Sunni \ninsurgents who are killing many of our troops. Most of those troops \nhave died in Anbar Province. We have a right to demand more from the \nSunni neighbors to quell that insurgency. We must encourage those Sunni \nneighbors to step up in terms of providing debt relief and \nreconstruction assistance, and we must make clear that threatening to \nintervene in Iraq in a way that is perceived as being on behalf of the \nSunni minority only serves to exacerbate the Sunni-Shia complexity, the \ntension that is causing so much of the violence today.\n  Now here in Washington, a combination of events on the ground and the \nNovember election results are beginning to produce a bipartisan resolve \nto genuinely change course. Many on both sides of the aisle now agree \nthat the administration's plan to escalate the war in Iraq by sending \nin some 21,500 additional troops would represent a tragic mistake. It \nwon't end the violence; it won't provide security; it won't turn back \nthe clock and avoid the civil war that is in fact already underway; it \nwon't deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda; it won't \nrein in the militias who are viewed as the protectors of the general \npopulation. It will simply postpone the political solution that is the \nonly solution in Iraq, while further damaging our prestige and \ncredibility in the region. Unfortunately, it will also expose our \ntroops to unnecessary death and injury.\n  Our generals understand this. General Abizaid said clearly in his \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee that more U.S. troops \nwill not\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\nsolve the security problem. In fact, he said they would only slow the \nprocess of getting Iraqi security forces to take more responsibility. \nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously oppose this escalation. In fact, \naccording to recent news reports, the Pentagon warned that any short-\nterm mission may only set up the United States for bigger problems when \nit ends.\n  A short-term mission could give an enormous edge to virtually all the \narmed factions in Iraq, including al-Qaida's foreign fighters, Sunni \ninsurgents and Sunni and Shiite militias, without giving an enduring \nboost to the U.S. military mission or the Iraqi Army. And it is not \njust the advice of his military commanders in Iraq the President is \nignoring, it is the bipartisan counsel of the Iraq Study Group \nappointed for the very purpose of defining a new course.\n  Mr. President, what kind of arrogance so willfully kicks to the curb \nthe work product of two former Secretaries of State, Republicans, a \nformer Attorney General and Chief of Staff, Republican, a former \nSenator and member of the leadership, Republican, and a group of \nmoderates, a former Secretary of Defense, and others respected for the \nmoderation of their views on foreign policy and security issues? What \nkind of arrogance avoids almost all of those recommendations and moves \nin a different direction?\n  Rather than change course, this administration chose to ignore the \ngenerals. In fact, it chose to change the generals. The folly of this \nescalation is so clear that we have a bipartisan responsibility to do \neverything in our power to say no.\n  I ask my colleagues: Is there one colleague here who believes that \n21,500 troops is going to pacify Iraq? Is there a colleague here who \nbelieves that 100,000 troops will pacify Iraq? It is not enough for \nCongress simply to go on record opposing the President's reckless plan. \nThat is why I support the resolution submitted by my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, that requires a new congressional authorization, which is \nappropriate because the prior authorization only applies to the weapons \nof mass destruction and to the threat that Iraq poses to us based on \nthe presence of Saddam Hussein. This is a new Iraq, and it is an Iraq \nwith a civil war, and the Congress of the United States has a \nresponsibility and a moral obligation to make certain that if our \ntroops from each of our States are going to fight and die, we stand up \nand be counted as to what the force structure is to be, as to what \ntheir mission should be because this administration has proven \nunwilling to get it right.\n  Stopping this escalation, however, is not enough. I believe Congress \nhas to provide a responsible exit strategy that preserves our interests \nin the region, preserves our ability to continue to protect the \nsecurity of the United States, and honors the sacrifice our troops have \nmade. I believe those are tests we need to pass.\n  Six months ago in the Senate, we stood against appeals to politics \nand pride and demanded a date to bring our troops home, to make Iraqis \nstand up for Iraq and fight a more effective war on terror. But while \nwe lost that rollcall, I still believe it was the right policy to put \nin place, to demand benchmarks, to demand accountability, and to \nleverage action.\n  That is why I will again introduce legislation, slightly different \nthis time, in order to try to offer a comprehensive strategy for \nachieving a political solution. I believe the strategy I will set forth \nis the best way forward for America and for Iraq. We have to find a way \nto end this misguided war and bring our troops home, and the \nlegislation, while protecting all the interests I described, I believe \ncan do that.\n  I believe the Iraq Study Group's recommendations can form the basis \nfor finding a bipartisan way forward. Many of those proposals, which \nare consistent with proposals that some in the Senate have long \nadvocated, are incorporated in the legislation I will offer, including \nlaunching a major diplomatic initiative, enforcing a series of \nbenchmarks for meeting key political objectives, shifting the military \nmission to training Iraqi security forces and conducting targeted \ncounterterrorism operations, maintaining an over-the-horizon presence \nto protect our interests supported by a concerted effort to disarm, \ndemobilize, and reintegrate the militias which must be undertaken by \nIraqis.\n  This legislation includes an additional provision that is a critical \ncomponent of the strategy. I know a lot of colleagues were nervous \nabout setting a date. Fewer are as nervous today. But I believe there \nis a way to require the President to set that date, negotiate that \nexit, a way to do it constitutionally and also within the context of \nthe reauthorization.\n  I think that is not an arbitrary deadline. In fact, the Iraq Study \nGroup report effectively sets a goal of withdrawing U.S. combat forces \nfrom Iraq by the first quarter of 2008, or within approximately 1 year. \nThis date was based on the timeframe for transferring responsibility to \nIraqi security forces set forth by General Casey and on the schedule \nagreed upon with the Iraqi Government itself for achieving key \npolitical security objectives.\n  The President even said that under that new strategy, responsibility \nfor security would be transferred to Iraqis before the end of this \nyear. That is how unarbitrary it is. The President has said it, our \ngenerals have said it, the Iraq Study Group has said it.\n  I wish to repeat this because it is important because it is \ncontinually distorted. We all want success, but we have to examine the \nrealities of the road to success. An effort that combines diplomacy \nwith smart deployment of our troops is the only road to success.\n  I ask my colleagues: Where is the diplomacy? Many of us can remember, \nunder a Republican President, Henry Kissinger shuttling back and forth \nday and night working to bring an end to the Vietnam war. Many of us \ncan remember Jim Baker, at the beginning of the decade in the nineties, \nwhen he took 15 trips to Syria alone, and on the final trip got \nPresident Asad to actually agree to support what we were doing. That is \ndiplomacy.\n  We don't have that kind of diplomacy. We lack even a special envoy \nthere day to day, hour to hour, leveraging the Arab League, leveraging \nthe United Nations, working with the U.N. Perm Five, working with the \nneighboring countries, doing the kinds of significant, heavy diplomatic \nlifting our sons and daughters who are dying deserve.\n  As our combat troop levels wind down, we can have sufficient forces \nto confront the Sunni insurgency. We can still continue to prosecute \nal-Qaida, but our core security interests--the security interests of \npreventing another terrorist attack on our country--those interests lie \nwhere our troops can still play a positive role in confronting Sunni \ninsurgents and their al-Qaida allies. That will happen when we focus on \nAl Anbar Province, not Baghdad.\n  It is time for Iraqis to assume responsibility for their country, and \nthat is not just a statement. It has been 4 years, 300,000 troops are \ntrained. When I talk with the military people, they don't tell me \ntraining is the problem. They tell me motivation is the problem. Those \n300,000 troops are not prepared to die for an Iraq yet, and they are \nmostly local militia and/or local tribe affiliated, which is their true \nallegiance at this point in time.\n\n  We need a timetable which forces Iraqi politicians to confront this \nreality. Americans should not be dying because Iraqi politicians refuse \nto compromise and come together. If they are not willing to do it today \nwith thousands of people dying around them, with this kind of sectarian \nviolence, what will make them more willing to do that in a year? They \nare using the security blanket of American presence in order to avoid \nmaking those compromises, and we need to understand that and get about \nthe business of leveraging the compromise that is the only solution to \nwhat is happening in Iraq.\n  I believe a deadline will actually help provide the Iraqis with the \nmotivation and the pressure to step up and take control. General \nAbizaid made it clear that is essential to our strategy. The key to \nproviding the motivation is making sure they, in fact, begin to take \ncontrol and begin to define their own future.\n  As we give the Iraqis more control over their own destiny, we also \nhave to hold them accountable for the fundamentals of leading their \ncountry on the construction, as well as the basic resolution, the \npolitical differences within the oil revenues, the federalism\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nissue, which are the two great stumbling blocks fundamental to a \nresolution.\n  Why the President didn't make the condition of providing additional \nsecurity and putting additional Americans online, why he didn't make \ntheir resolution of those issues a precondition is beyond me. But \nAmerican forces are now going to be put at greater risk, more kids at \nharm, without the fundamentals that are essential and that are \ncompletely out of the power of any squad or company or battalion to be \nable to resolve.\n  When Prime Minister Maliki took power in May, General Casey and \nAmbassador Khalilzad said the new Government had 6 months to make the \npolitical compromises necessary to win public confidence and unify the \ncountry--6 months last May. They were right. And yet with no real \ndeadline to force the Government's hand, that period passed without any \nmeaningful action, and we are now seeing the disastrous results.\n  To ensure history does not repeat itself, we need to put those \nbenchmarks in place, and we need to have those benchmarks agreed upon. \nThat is the least, again, we can ask on behalf of our troops.\n  I, also, believe a deadline is essential to getting Iraq's neighbors \nto face up to the realities of the security needs of the region. If we \nare going to be concerned about Iran, it should not be surreptitiously \nbased on them using us. It should be all of us together defining a new \nsecurity arrangement for the region. General Zinni has talked about \nthat many times. He is one of the most respected hands in that region.\n  In addition, our own intelligence agencies tell us that the war in \nIraq is fanning the flames of jihad, and we have to stop serving as an \nal-Qaida recruitment tool. When are we going to take that seriously in \nthe Senate? We spent a lot of time and energy to reorganize the \nintelligence community. We supposedly have the best intelligence now, \nand that intelligence in the conglomerate is telling us that this \ncurrent policy is putting America at greater risk because we are \ncreating more terrorists, fanning the flames of unrest in the region, \nand creating a recruitment tool for al-Qaida in that region.\n  We can see the results. Hamas is more powerful now. Hezbollah and \nNasrallah are more powerful today. Iran is more powerful today. Syria \nis more than willing to play with Iran than care about what the \nconcerns might be of the rest of the region.\n  We have gone backward because of this policy. How can this \nadministration stand up and say to us that we have to fear the security \ninterests of the future, when the security interests of the present are \nmoving in the wrong direction?\n  Afghanistan, where the diversion of resources to Iraq has already \nallowed the Taliban to rise again, is increasing as a threat to those \nlong-term security interests. Osama bin Laden roams free while a \nregenerated al-Qaida continues to plot attacks on American interests, \nand the flourishing opium trade has turned the country into a virtual \nnarcostate, funding insurgents and warlords and threatening the \nviability of the Karzai Government.\n  Now our generals in Afghanistan are warning, in the darkest possible \nterms, that the Taliban is poised to launch a major new offensive in \nAfghanistan, and they have issued an urgent appeal for more U.S. troops \nto fight back. Instead of sending 20,000 troops over to Iraq, we ought \nto be listening to our military commanders and give them the few \nthousand more troops they desperately need to deal with the Taliban in \nAfghanistan.\n  On the broader regional front, we clearly need to come to grips with \nthe need to engage Iran in a way that not only deters Iran from nuclear \nand other military adventurism, but does not create another disastrous \nwar that is not in our national security interest. I want to take one \nmoment before closing to speak to that point.\n  I am hardly the only one in the Senate who is concerned about a \nterrible byproduct of the administration's escalation plan for Iraq. \nThat byproduct could be movement towards a calculated military conflict \nwith Iran, which would further destabilize the Middle East, fan the \nflames of intra-Muslim and Muslim-Western violence. In fact, many \nAmericans are increasingly concerned that the administration's rhetoric \nregarding Iran sounds eerily familiar.\n  Congress must make it absolutely certain that we do not make the same \nmistake we made in rushing to war with Iraq, starting by making it \nclear President Bush does not have the authority to engage Iran \nmilitarily, excepting, of course, an immediate attack on our troops or \na definable and palpable emergency. He does not have the authority to \nengage them without express congressional authorization.\n  Looking at recent developments, it is not hard to see why people are \nconcerned. In the President's speech introducing his new Iraq strategy, \nhe issued a thinly veiled threat that sounded as though the \nadministration was at least contemplating military operations on the \nIranian side of the border. In the last few weeks we have arrested \nIranian nationals in two separate incidents in Iraq. The initial \noperations against Shiite militias in Baghdad at a minimum are bound to \nexacerbate tensions with Iran even further, and we recently sent \nanother aircraft carrier to the region, ratcheting up our aggressive \nposture.\n  Taken alone, individually, there is a certain logic to each of those \nactions. Taken on the whole, however, they have created an impression \nin the region, and as we all know impressions are what ultimately push \nleaders to make judgments about threat and to make determinations about \ntheir own actions. The impression in the region is that we have taken \nthe side of the Sunnis in the conflict with Iraq. Whether that is true \nor not, we must never forget that in the Middle East especially, \nperception is reality. If we are seen to be favoring the Sunnis, we run \nthe risk of alienating the Shiite majority that will ultimately be \nrunning Iraq--that is the reality--and inflaming extremism throughout \nthe region. It is essential that we remain evenhanded in our own \nactions as well as our words in our efforts to bring stability to Iraq.\n  There is another reason, as the Iraqi Study Group suggested, we \nshould engage Iran and Syria. Leadership means talking to countries who \nare not our friends. President Kennedy reminded us: Never fear to \nnegotiate but never negotiate out of fear. We need to engage directly \nwhen our vital national security interests are at stake. We have done \nit all through our history. Richard Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to \nChina. President Reagan went to meet with Miguel Gorbachev and came to \nan agreement on arms after defining the ``evil empire.'' The \nconversation that I had recently in the Middle East with Senator Dodd, \nwhen we traveled there together with President Asad of Syria, led us to \nbelieve that a dialog could, in fact, be constructed in working toward \na goal that we share with Syria: creating a stable, secular, Arab Iraq. \nThat is at least what President Asad said he would like. It seems to \nme, given the morass we are in, it is worth putting that to the test.\n  We cannot turn back the clock and reverse the decisions that brought \nus to this pass in Iraq and the Middle East. We cannot achieve the kind \nof clear and simple victory the administration promised the American \npeople so often even as the conditions in Iraq grew worse and worse. \nBut we can avoid an outright defeat. We can avoid creating the chaos we \nsay we want to avoid. We can avoid a victory for our adversaries by \nidentifying specifically what we can and cannot accomplish in Iraq.\n  With a new Congress comes a new responsibility: to get this policy \nright. That starts with preventing the President from going forward \nwith this senseless escalation. And it has to end with finding an exit \nstrategy that preserves our core interests in Iraq, in the region, and \nthroughout the world.\n  I look forward to having a real debate. I hope we can find that way.\n  I might mention, when Senator Dodd and I were about to helicopter out \nof Baghdad, we were at Landing Zone Washington, which is right in the \nGreen Zone. Many Senators are familiar with it. In the darkness of \nnight, as we were leaving, a young man came up to us to talk to us and \nhe identified himself as an officer in the Army. He was going home for \nleave and was hitching a ride on the helicopter to go home. He went \nhome, visited his 14-\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\nmonth-old daughter and, I think, his 4-year-old son, if I am correct. \nHis name was Brian Freeman and he was intelligent and thoughtful and \nbright and he talked about his future and talked with us animatedly \nabout what was going on in Iraq and how he disagreed with what he was \nbeing asked to do and how others did. He went home, and we just learned \nthat this Friday he was killed. So he went back. He did his duty as so \nmany have.\n  I know when I returned from war, almost 40 years ago now, I stood up \nand spoke from my heart and my gut about what I thought was wrong. To \nthis day that has been controversial in some quarters, but I am proud \nthat I told the truth. And that truth has been documented again and \nagain from Army training manuals to books that have been written to the \nstatements of our own Secretary of Defense at that time, Robert \nMcNamara. But, before I finish, I want to make it clear that that is my \nmotivation in talking about this war now and this predicament that so \nmany of these soldiers find themselves in.\n  I asked the question in 1971: How do you ask a man to be the last man \nto die for a mistake? Although I knew going into public service I \nwanted to be in a place where I could have an impact should there be a \nchoice of war in the future, but I never thought that I would be \nreliving the need to ask that question again.\n  We are there. Most of our colleagues understand this is a mistake. \nMost of our colleagues understand that 21,000 troops is not going to \npacify Iraq. So all of us have a deep-rooted obligation, a deep moral \nobligation to ask ourselves what we can do to further the interests of \nour Nation and honor the sacrifices of those troops themselves. I think \nit is to get this policy right. I hope the President will truly listen \nto us in these next days because we want to work in good faith to do \nthat.\n  Before I finish, I want to add a note, both personal and political. \nTwo years ago I sought the Presidency to lead us on a different course. \nI am proud of the campaign we ran, proud of the fact that 3 years ago I \nsaid that Iraq was the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong \ntime; proud that we defined energy independence and made it, for the \nfirst time, part of the Presidential race; proud of a health care plan \nthat we laid out that to this moment remains viable and waiting to be \nused in order to lower the health care costs for our fellow Americans.\n  We came close, certainly close enough, to be tempted to try again. \nThere are powerful reasons to want to continue that fight now. But I \nhave concluded this is not the time for me to mount a Presidential \ncampaign. It is time to put my energy to work as part of the majority \nin the Senate to do all I can to end this war and strengthen our \nsecurity and our ability to fight the real war on terror.\n\n  The people of Massachusetts have given me an incredible privilege to \nserve, and I intend to work here to change a policy in Iraq that \nthreatens all that I have cared about and fought for since I came home \nfrom Vietnam.\n  The fact is, what happens here in the next 2 years may irrevocably \nshape or terribly distort the administration of whichever candidate is \nnext elected President. Decisions are being taken and put into effect \ntoday and in the days to come that may leave to the next President a \nwider war, a war even more painful, more difficult, more prolonged than \nthe war we already have.\n  Iraq, if we Senators force a change of course, may yet bring \nstability and an exit with American security intact or it may bring our \nefforts in the region to a failure that we will all recognize as a \ncatastrophe.\n  I don't want the next President to find that he or she has inherited \na nation still divided and a policy destined to end as Vietnam did, in \na bitter or sad legacy. I intend to devote all my efforts and energies \nover the next 2 years, not to the race for the Presidency for myself \nbut for doing whatever I can to ensure that the next President can take \nthe oath with a reasonable prospect of success for him or her--for the \nUnited States. And I intend to speak the truth as I find it without \nregard for political correctness or partisan advantage, to advise my \ncolleagues and my fellow citizens to the best of my ability and \njudgment, and to support every action the Senate may reasonably and \nconstitutionally take to guide and direct the ship of state.\n  This mission, this responsibility, is something all of us must \naccept, and as someone who made the mistake of voting for the \nresolution that gave the President the authority to go to war, I feel \nthe weight of a personal responsibility to act, to devote time and \nenergy to the national dialog in an effort to limit this war and bring \nour participation to a conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know how difficult of a decision this \nis for Senator Kerry to make. And today, I say to the people of the \ncountry how proud all of us in Massachusetts are of John Kerry, and his \noutstanding service in the United States Senate for our State and for \nour country. Throughout his career, he has been a true hero in every \nsense of the word.\n  He has been my colleague since 1984, and I have deeply valued the \nopportunity to work side-by-side with him, but most of all I'm proud to \ncall him my friend. Over the years, Vicki and I have grown so close to \nJohn and his wonderful wife Teresa and his loving daughters Vanessa and \nAlexandra. They are a special family, and their friendship is one we \ncherish.\n  We heard just a few moments ago why he was able to galvanize the \ncountry, and earn such tremendous support, in the 2004 Presidential \ncampaign. The eloquence, the passion, the insight, the knowledge of \nhistory, and awareness of public events--these qualities we saw on \ndisplay just moments ago in this Chamber--these are the qualities that \ncharacterize and define the career of John Kerry.\n  Now John has decided to continue to devote his passion, his interest, \nand his energies toward bringing our troops home from Iraq safely, and \nhow fortunate they are to know that he will devote all of his energies \nto that cause over the next months--hopefully not years. All of us in \nMassachusetts look forward to his continued service in the United \nStates Senate for years to come and to his voice and his vote working \nhere for the working people of Massachusetts, for their jobs, for their \nhealth care, for the education of their children, for the betterment of \ntheir environment, and for their hope for a better quality of life. \nHe's been there for us in the past on so many of these critical \nconcerns, and we take comfort in knowing he'll be there for all of us \nin the future as well.\n  I know this has been a difficult time for John. I congratulate him on \nan outstanding presentation this afternoon, and for his courage and \ndetermination. I congratulate him for continuing to want to make a very \nimportant difference on the overarching and overriding issue of our \ntime, and that is how we can remedy this catastrophic mistake of Iraq \nand bring our servicemen home safely.\n  I'm grateful to be able to call John Kerry my colleague and friend, \nand look forward to working with him for years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune in my lifetime, \nmy adult life, to see people for whom I have developed a tremendous \nrespect and admiration, and certainly one of those people is John \nKerry. Why? Why would I say that about John Kerry? Why would I say that \nas I have traveled through life he is one of those people who has meant \nso much to me in being a role model for the things that I do and the \nthings that I think the American people should focus on?\n  He has a tremendous educational background--Yale, Boston College. He \nwas a prosecutor. He was a war hero. A war hero--multiple awards, \nfighting in the jungles of Vietnam, for heroism. We saw someone last \nnight stand in the House Chamber whom the President directed, who \nreceived the Silver Star, and that is wonderful. We all looked at him \nwith admiration. John Kerry has had a Silver Star, multiple Purple \nHearts--I repeat, multiple awards for bravery. He is a political \nactivist, someone who at great sacrifice decided to do gallant things \nafter his heroic efforts in Vietnam. He came home and continued being a \nhero politically. The people of Massachusetts elected him to Lieutenant \nGovernor, a job I also had,\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nand I have some understanding about that job. He came to Congress the \nyear I did. In 1982, we both came here. He is a cancer survivor. His \nwife is one of the most remarkable people I have ever met. Teresa Heinz \nis a real fighter in her own way. I knew her before the Presidential \nelection, but I got to know her very well during the Presidential \nelection, and I like her so much.\n\n  John Kerry was my nominee for President of the United States. I \nworked hard for John Kerry. I believed in John Kerry. I believed John \nKerry would change the direction of this country and the world. I still \nbelieve that. John Kerry came within a few votes of being President of \nthe United States in one of the dirtiest, most negative, unfair \ncampaigns I have ever witnessed. I am not going to go into all the \nthings they did to John Kerry other than to say that to try to take \naway from this man, his gallantry as a warfighter, was beyond the pale, \nbut they did it.\n  John Kerry and I have shared heartache together. We have done it \nrecently. I will always have admiration and respect for John Kerry. The \nmere fact that he announced he is not running for President speaks well \nof this gallant man, this heroic man, because he could run for \nPresident. He has money in the bank, so to speak. He knows people all \nover America. He has the best e-mail addresses in the country. He has \nchosen that this is not the time. But I will continue to look to John \nKerry for his leadership in foreign affairs. He is a man who knows this \nworld. Listen to the speech he just gave on the conflict in Iraq, a \ntextbook address about the ills of the present status of what we are \ndoing in Iraq. He will approach whatever he does with a sense of \nmorality. He will proceed to be one of the leaders, as he has been for \ndecades, on the environment. He has a book coming out soon with his \nwife, and I am sure it will lay out things he has believed in for so \nlong, such as health care. He is the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  So I say to John Kerry: I love you, John Kerry. I am so sorry things \ndidn't work out for our country, but that doesn't take away from the \nfact that I will always care about you greatly and remember the times \nwe have spent together. We have a lot more to do for Massachusetts, \nNevada, and the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues here on the floor \nfor allowing me to offer these amendments. I know the leadership on the \nother side is anxious to end debate on this bill and move on to other \nthings, so I will keep any remarks as brief as possible. I would be \nhappy to work with the managers of the bill, the Senators from \nMassachusetts and Wyoming, to work out additional time for debate if \nthat is necessary.\n  The minimum wage is a debate about fairness. Many Americans see a \nminimum wage as a fundamental right and something that should be \nincreased to keep up with rising costs. Many economists see it \ndifferently. They understand it is only an entry wage and that with on-\nthe-job training, most people do not stay at the minimum wage for very \nlong. Economists also understand that very few people in America \nactually earn the minimum wage which is currently at $5.15 per hour. \nThose who do are mostly teenagers, part-time workers, second earners in \na home, or workers with very limited skills.\n  Nevertheless, this debate has become a measure of how much we care \nfor workers, and that is what this debate should be about. If we are \ngoing to be serious about helping Americans earn higher wages and \nhelping them keep more of what they earn, we must consider additional \nmeasures to ensure American prosperity.\n  That is why I am offering these amendments today. They will not only \nensure fairness for workers, they will also help protect small \nbusinesses that employ them. Americans realize that if we pass laws \nhere in Washington that are aimed at helping workers but end up \neliminating their jobs, we have done more harm than good.\n  My first amendment, No. 158, would raise the effective minimum wage \nin each State by $2.10 per hour. Now, I know most people listening \nbelieve that is what this amendment does, but far from it. Without this \namendment, the underlying legislation will partially exempt minimum \nwage workers in high-cost States that already have State minimum wage \nrates greater than $5.15 per hour, and it will completely exempt \nminimum wage workers in the highest cost States that have State minimum \nwage rates greater than $7.25. Many States--actually, 29 States--have \nalready recognized that their cost of living is much higher than other \nStates, and these States have passed their own minimum wage increases. \nSo the cost of living all around the country is quite different.\n  If you look at some high-cost cities and States, such as Boston, MA, \nfor instance--35 percent higher cost of living than the national \naverage--and contrast that with Alabama, Mobile, AL--it is minus 11 \npercent of the national average--you have a large swing in the cost of \nliving. Effectively, what we have is while Massachusetts now has a \nminimum wage of $7.50 an hour, that does not do a worker as much good \nin Massachusetts as $5.15 does for a worker in Alabama; the cost of \nliving is significantly different.\n  As we look around the country, we see the highest cost States are \nMassachusetts and Connecticut and Vermont and New York. You can go over \nto Illinois at 17 percent. We get down in the Southern States, and we \nsee minus 10 percent of the national average in Texas or minus 11 in \nArkansas or minus 12 in Oklahoma. The States and the cost of living \nacross our country are very different. Thankfully, a number of States--\n29 of them--have recognized that and raised their minimum wage.\n  But if we are going to make a promise to American workers that we are \ngoing to raise their salary, particularly minimum wage workers, then I \nbelieve we should do it for all workers. We should look at how this \nunderlying bill is really going to affect workers. The blue States here \nare States that get a small increase or less than 10 cents from this \n$2.10 we are talking about.\n  A few minutes ago, the Senator from Washington State was giving a \npassionate plea that minimum wage workers get an increase, but \nWashington State minimum wage workers will get no increase from this \nbill. The same for Oregon and California. Our dear colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, is one of the most passionate advocates \nof increasing the minimum wage. Yet this bill we are going to pass \ntoday will not give one minimum wage worker in Massachusetts an \nincrease. They get nothing. All of the blue States, the high-cost \nStates where an increase is the most important--Vermont, Massachusetts, \nConnecticut, Rhode Island--they get no increase. Illinois gets less \nthan 10 cents from the $2.10 increase. So the blue States where workers \nreally could use an additional increase, particularly minimum wage \nworkers, get little or nothing.\n  When we look at the white States, these are the States which don't \nget the whole $2.10 increase. The red States are the only States where \nthe whole $2.10 increase will actually go to minimum wage workers.\n  So in effect, we are making a lot of false promises here today. A lot \nof the debate, the most passionate debate, is coming from Senators who \nrepresent States which will get little or nothing from this minimum \nwage increase.\n  I believe we should do what the States do and recognize that the cost \nof living is different. My amendment is very simple. It says: Let's \nmake all of the States the same color. Let's make them red or blue. But \nevery minimum wage worker in this country should get a $2.10 increase, \nand that is what my amendment would do. It would be fair to all \nworkers.\n  That first amendment was actually my first and second amendment. We \nhave two versions of that, Nos. 158 and 159.\n  My third amendment, No. 155, would expand access to affordable health \ncare to millions of Americans. It would do three things. And we do need \nto keep in mind that one of the biggest costs for workers, particularly \nthose working at the minimum wage level, is health care. Very few have \nhealth insurance. Many are part-time workers. This amendment would do \nthree things:\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\nFirst, it would allow workers to purchase less expensive coverage \nanywhere in the country. It would also allow them to use the funds in \ntheir health savings accounts to pay for their health insurance policy, \nand it would allow them to roll over, or keep, $500 in unspent benefits \nin their flexible spending accounts. Many Federal employees now have \nflexible spending accounts, and they are starting to realize that even \nthough it is their own money, the way this law is set up, if they don't \nspend it all, they lose what is left at the end of the year. This \namendment would fix that.\n  If Congress is serious about helping American workers, it must do \nsomething to address the rising costs of health care. By allowing \nAmericans to purchase health coverage across State lines, they would \ngain access to less expensive health plans.\n  My fourth amendment would pick up on part of the other amendment and \nfocus specifically on flexible spending accounts, allowing workers to \nkeep up the $500 that is unspent in those accounts at the end of the \nyear so they do not have to spend it on something they do not need or \nactually lose it. Again, it is their money. We should not take it from \nthem.\n  My fifth amendment is tax deferment for high-growth small business \ncompanies. Most of the jobs in this country are actually created by \nsmall companies that are growing at a 10-percent rate or higher. We \nhave identified--and this is something we have been working on for \nyears--what is called a capital funding gap that prevents a lot of \nsmall businesses from getting the capital they need to continue their \ngrowth. Actually, if you go back to the 107th Congress, I worked on \nthis when I was on the House side with Senator Kerry and Senator Snowe \nwho introduced this same legislation to help small businesses keep some \nof their cash in order to grow their business. It simply allows them to \ndefer Federal taxes if they are plowing it into the growth of their \ncompanies. This is very relevant to low-income workers because many \nlow-income workers, even minimum wage workers, work for small \nbusinesses that are growing.\n  This would help those companies grow by deferring taxes. They have to \npay all this money back with interest, but it allows them to continue \nto grow, using their own cash flow.\n  My sixth amendment, No. 159, is an important amendment for a lot of \nhourly workers who are union members. It prevents labor unions from \nusing members' union dues to lobby Congress without prior separate and \nwritten consent of that member. Union dues, like taxes, are compulsory \nfor union workers. This is the same amendment I offered to the lobby \nreform legislation, but since it was not given consideration, I am \noffering it again. This is not only an ethics and lobbying issue but a \nfairness issue for millions of union members in America. If they were \nnot forced to pay for things they do not support, they could save a lot \nof money with lower union dues.\n  My seventh amendment is updating the small business minimum wage \nexemption. The last time this exemption was raised, the minimum wage \nwas $3.35. This simply allows small companies not to pay the minimum \nwage, particularly those offering other benefits--tips or health \nbenefits--and gives an exemption. Right now, it is only $500,000 a \nyear. We raise that to $1 million with this amendment, allowing the \nsmall businesses some flexibility in hiring teenagers and other workers \nat the trainee level.\n  The last amendment, my eighth amendment, and the final amendment, \nrepeals flextime benefits for Federal employees after 1 year if \ncomparable benefits are not extended to private sector workers. A lot \nof people who are opposed to this flextime idea don't point out in the \nSenate that all Federal workers have this flextime benefit. Most will \nsay it is truly a benefit. So it gets back to an issue of fairness. \nThis amendment simply says if we do not apply this same benefit to all \nAmerican workers in the private sector, we should not grant it to \nFederal workers. Americans are tired of us giving special benefits to \nFederal workers that are not offered in the private sector.\n  In conclusion, I thank the managers of this bill, again, for allowing \nme to offer these amendments. I am happy to work out other items and \ndebate them individually, if that is necessary.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to share some general thoughts \nabout workers in America, the salaries they get paid, the money they \ntake home, and some of the problems relative to that. I will not be \noffering any amendments at this point. I think there are some others \nwho will be down in a little bit who are scheduled to be on the floor \nat this time but have not arrived.\n  I will note I would like to have a vote on an amendment I have \noffered, which is an amendment that will say that if an employer hires \na person illegally in the country, contrary to the law, the fine will \nno longer be as little as $250 but will be raised to a fine sufficient \nto deter that business from carrying on that activity: $5,000 and up.\n  But I want to take a moment now to share some thoughts of a very \nserious nature about what we are dealing with. This bill that is on the \nfloor today would raise the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an \nhour. I am uneasy with Government dictating a contract between two \nprivate persons. But I have supported minimum wage increases on a \nnumber of occasions, and I think we will see one pass this time in some \nfashion. I hope it will be passed in a manner that I will be able to \nsupport final passage.\n  But I share the concern of a lot of people who support this \nlegislation; and that concern is, the incomes and the salaries of lower \nwage workers have not kept up with the salaries of higher income \nworkers. I know the free marketeers argue that later on wages will \nincrease for low-income workers, but I am not satisfied with that \nargument. The economy is doing very well. Bonuses and salaries for top-\nwage people have surged. We have not seen sufficient increases in \nsalaries for lower income workers.\n  I am going to share some numbers with this body that I believe will \nput a finger on the real problem. It is not that George Bush does not \nwant people to have salaries. George Bush and Members of this Senate \nhave supported policies that, without their knowledge, perhaps, are \nhaving an adverse impact on wages. Maybe there are a lot of reasons we \nare having an adverse impact on wages, but I am going to talk about \none.\n  We can be certain that illegal immigration is suppressing workers' \nwages. Significant economic evidence indicates the presence of large \namounts of illegal labor in low-skilled job sectors--that is low-income \nworkers--is depressing the wages of American workers. Harvard \neconomists George Borjas and Lawrence Katz--Professor Borjas has \nwritten a fabulous book on immigration, ``Heaven's Door.'' I am sure my \nfriend Senator Kennedy knows of Harvard. He needs to introduce himself \nto Professor Borjas, I would suggest. Harvard economists George Borjas \nand Lawrence Katz estimate that the influx of low-skilled, low-wage \nimmigration from 1980 to 2000 has resulted in a 3-percent decrease in \nwages for the average American worker--not just low-income workers. The \naverage American worker has seen a 3-percent decline in his wages, and \nit has cut wages for native-born high school dropouts--those are the \npeople most often being paid near minimum wage; the poorest 10 percent \nof the workforce--by 8 percent.\n  That is a lot. The 3 percent amounts to, assuming they made $10 an \nhour, $12 a week or $600 a year. For the poorer worker, the 8 percent \namounts to more than $1,200 a year in income. Now, that is $100 a month \nextra money they could be paid, but they are not being paid because of \nthe large influx of illegal workers or immigrant workers into the \ncountry.\n  According to Alan Tonelson, another expert, a research fellow at the \nU.S. Business and Industry Council Educational Foundation--this is his \nquote--\n\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\n\n       [T]he most important statistics available show conclusively \n     that, far from easing shortages, illegal immigrants are \n     adding to labor gluts in America. Specifically, wages in \n     sectors highly dependent on illegals, when adjusted for \n     inflation, are either stagnant or have actually fallen.\n\n  Wages have gone down, not even gone up a little bit. They have gone \ndown. Think about it.\n  Tonelson is referring to Labor Department data and information from \nthe Pew Hispanic Center that--Mr. Tonelson says--``provide compelling \nevidence illegal immigrants have been used deliberately to force down \nwages.''\n  For example, he cites data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \nfor the following information.\n  Madam President, I see Senator Salazar is here. And, as I indicated, \nI say to Senator Salazar, I will yield. I will wrap up briefly and \nyield to you because I know you were previously approved to speak next.\n  As I was saying, for example, Tonelson cites data from the U.S. \nBureau of Labor Statistics for the following information: Inflation-\nadjusted wages for the broad food and services and drinking \nestablishments category--that is the Labor Department category--between \nthe years 2000 and 2005 fell 1.65 percent. Pew estimates that illegal \nimmigrants comprise 17 percent of food preparation workers, 20 percent \nof cooks, and 23 percent of dishwashers.\n  So they say: Well, you cannot get people to work and be cooks and \ndishwashers in restaurants. You cannot get them. Well, if they were \npaid a little better wage, maybe they could get them. Instead of \ncutting wages from 2000 to 2005, maybe some people would be willing to \nwork.\n  He goes on to note: Inflation-adjusted wages for the food \nmanufacturing industry--the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that illegal \nimmigrants comprise 14 percent of that workforce--fell 2.24 percent \nfrom 2000 to 2005.\n  He also goes on to note: Inflation-adjusted wages for hotel workers--\nthe Pew Hispanic Center estimates that illegal immigrants make up 10 \npercent of that workforce--fell 1 percent from 2000 to 2005.\n  So, Madam President, I will wrap up at this point but will talk about \nit some more later. We need to create a lawful immigration system that \ndoes allow workers to come to our country, but the number and skill \nsets they bring ought to be such that they do not aversely impact to a \nsignificant degree the wages of American citizens. How more basic can \nit be than that, see? I am afraid we need to confront that.\n  So my amendment is just one important step I will ask for a vote on \nthat will allow workers to come legally, but if they come illegally, \nthe employers who hire them can be punished to a degree more \ncommensurate with the seriousness of the offense.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair. I see my good friend from \nColorado, former attorney general. We worked together on a number of \nissues. I will be proud to yield to him at this time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank my friend from Alabama. And at \nthe outset, before I make a comment about the matter that is pending \nbefore the Senate today, I want to also commend him for his work on \nenergy independence. I think it demonstrates how we are able in this \nbody to bring together Republicans and conservatives, Democrats and \nprogressives, on what is one of the signature issues of our time. I \nvery much look forward to working with him, as well as with my other \ncolleagues on this very important agenda in this 110th Congress.\n  Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the Reid \nsubstitute amendment that is a very important matter that is now before \nthis body. I applaud the leadership of the floor managers, Senator \nKennedy and Senator Enzi. I very much look forward to a successful \nconclusion of this legislation.\n  The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 would raise the Federal minimum \nwage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour over a period of 2 years. I am \nproud to be a supporter and a cosponsor of this measure which will help \nlift millions of Americans into a better way of life.\n  The Federal minimum wage was first established through the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938. At that time, the Federal Government set the \nFederal minimum wage at 25 cents an hour, which would amount to $3.22 \nan hour in today's dollars. Since then, Congress has used its wisdom \nand increased the minimum wage eight times under both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations.\n  Unfortunately, American workers have now had to wait 10 years since \nthe last increase--the longest that workers have gone without an \nincrease in the entire history our Nation has had a minimum wage law.\n  American workers, in my view, have waited long enough for their \nraise. The minimum wage is not just about fairness. It is also about \neconomic necessity. While Congress has neglected to raise the minimum \nwage, the cost of living has continued to skyrocket. Since we last \nraised the minimum wage, take the following examples on the escalation \nof the cost of living: Gas prices have increased by 36 percent. Health \ninsurance rates have gone up by 33 percent. College tuition rates have \ngone up by 35 percent. And housing costs have gone up by 38 percent. \nThere have been all of those increases during all of that time, and the \nminimum wage for Americans has gone unchanged.\n  Without any increase in their wages, these rising costs will force \nmany minimum wage workers to make very difficult choices. Sometimes \nthey must ask themselves: Should they pay the rent or buy groceries? \nShould they pay the heating bill or buy diapers? Some of the very \nbasic, essential questions of life have to be answered by some of these \nminimum wage workers every day.\n  Indeed, desperate times often have called for desperate measures. Our \ninaction here in Washington has spurred a number of different States, \nincluding my State of Colorado, to take action on their own. In \nNovember, the people of my State voted to increase the State's minimum \nwage by a very substantial margin. Twenty-eight other States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have also taken action to raise wages above the \nFederal minimum of $5.15 an hour.\n  In my view, unless we act as a Congress, what will end up happening \nis we will continue to see a hodgepodge of minimum wage increases in \nthe 50 States of our Nation. I think it would be much preferable to \nbusiness as well as to the people of America to have a Federal minimum \nwage that applies across the entire country.\n  The House of Representatives has already acted quickly on this \nlegislation. It is simple and straightforward. It is now time for the \nSenate to act, and for this long overdue increase to finally become \nlaw.\n  Make no mistake, we all know this legislation will make a significant \ndifference in the lives of working families. The increase will directly \nimpact 13 million Americans and nearly 6 million children.\n  Do you hear that, Madam President? It will impact 13 million \nAmericans and nearly 6 million children who would see their parents' \nearnings increase.\n  In Colorado, raising the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would \ndirectly raise the pay of 87,000 workers and benefit 251,000 workers \noverall.\n  This increase will mean an additional $4,400 in annual wages. That \nmoney is money that could be used for a number of great \nessentials: Almost 2 years of childcare, more than full tuition for a \ncommunity college degree, a year and a half of heat and electricity, \nmore than a year of groceries, and more than 8 months of rent.\n\n  I support doing everything we can to help these workers. As we help \nthese workers, I also believe we must do everything we can to help the \nsmall businesses of America. That is why I am supporting the Reid \nsubstitute amendment that has the targeted tax relief to help small \nbusinesses thrive.\n  Having had a history of working as a small business person for a long \ntime, I know the struggle small businesses engage in every day. I also \nknow that it is small businesses that are the engine of most of the job \ncreation in America today. That is true whether it is in Colorado or in \nthe States of Wyoming or Massachusetts. Small businesses are, in fact, \nthe backbone of job creation. In my State alone, we have 500,000 small \nbusinesses. And 98 percent of the businesses that hire workers in \nColorado are, in fact, small businesses. These\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nbusinesses create jobs. They fuel our economy. They provide the \nlivelihood for millions of workers, many of them low-wage earners. We \nmust ensure that these small businesses continue to serve this vital \npurpose.\n  In my first hearing as a new member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nunder the leadership of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, we \nheard from small business owners who testified that an increase in the \nminimum wage would, in some cases, force them to consider whether to \neliminate some workers or cut back the hours of others. They also \ntestified that some of the costs of the increase could be defrayed \nthrough specific tax incentives to help them meet the expenses \nassociated with improving and expanding their businesses through \nconstruction and renovation and tax credits to help them hire more low-\nwage workers.\n  Last week I introduced legislation called the Business RAISE Act to \nhelp small businesses with business tax relief. My bill contains some \nof the tax incentives we heard about in the Finance Committee hearing. \nSpecifically, my legislation, now incorporated into the Reid \nsubstitute, would allow 15 year depreciation periods for restaurant \nimprovements, new restaurant construction, and improvements to business \nproperty that is owned as opposed to leased. That simply makes economic \nsense. When you buy equipment or build a restaurant, you know that a \n39-year depreciation does not reflect economic reality. You know that \nthose changes that have to be made will have to be made in 5 or 10 \nyears. So allowing these items to be expensed over a 15-year period \nwill be a great incentive and of great assistance to small businesses \nand restaurants to do what they have to do to improve their businesses.\n  I also have proposed--and it has been included in the Reid substitute \namendment--the expansion of the eligibility for the work opportunity \ntax credit to all disabled veterans. This legislation would expand the \neligibility for the work opportunity tax credit to all disabled \nveterans. In these days of Afghanistan and Iraqi veteran forces \nreturning back to our Nation with the kinds of injuries that many of \nthem have sustained and some of the disabilities they have to suffer \nthrough, it is important for us as a nation to do everything we can to \nprovide them with an opportunity. These work opportunity tax credits \nthat would apply to all disabled veterans in America would be part of \nour Nation's promise to make sure we are taking care of the veterans of \nAmerica.\n  I am proud to have worked with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, \nwith Republicans and Democratic Senators in the Finance Committee, to \nhave many of these provisions included in the legislation that was \nreported unanimously out of committee. Those recommendations have now \nbeen included in the Reid substitute amendment which is currently \npending. But we could have dealt with these issues separately. The \npolitical reality is that we will do two good things at the same time. \nWe will raise the minimum wage for Americans, which has been on hold \nfor far too long, and we will provide incentives to allow small \nbusinesses to continue to thrive with the tax incentives we are \ncreating in this legislation. Toward that end, I am hopeful that this \nbody of Senators will move quickly and expeditiously in approving the \nprovisions of the Reid substitute amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For the information of our Members, we will have a \nconsent agreement offered in a short while. It is the intention of \nSenator Enzi and myself to have two votes, one on the Sununu-Kerry \namendment on small business and one on Feingold, which is the ``Buy \nAmerican'' amendment. We will have voice votes on those two items and \nthen rollcall votes on an Allard amendment and a rollcall vote on a \nDeMint amendment in the range of 5 o'clock, for the benefit of our \ncolleagues. We will offer a consent agreement shortly to that effect. \nBut for the information of our colleagues, that is the intention. We \nare making good progress on other amendments as well.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, since the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n1938, Congress has required employers to pay a minimum wage. Congress \nenacted the current general minimum wage of $5.15 an hour in 1996. That \nworks out to be about $10,712 a year. Currently, about 2 million \nworkers get paid the Federal minimum wage or less.\n  A decade has passed since the last increase. That marks the longest \nperiod in history without an adjustment to the minimum wage. During \nthat time, a majority of States have enacted minimum wages higher than \nthe current Federal level. This includes my home State of Montana.\n  Montanans recognized that the minimum wage must be increased. I am \nproud that in November our State voted to raise that State's minimum \nwage from $5.15 an hour to $6.15 an hour. It was a step in the right \ndirection.\n  An increase in the minimum wage would affect millions more than those \nwho earn minimum wage because many workers earn slightly more than \nminimum wage and may also see an increase.\n  Some worry that an increase in the minimum wage will burden small \nbusinesses. Small businesses create jobs, economic opportunity, and \ntechnological innovation.\n  Smaller businesses employ a disproportionate share of workers earning \nthe minimum wage. Representatives of small businesses have, therefore, \nargued that any increase should be accompanied by tax incentives \ntargeted for small businesses in order to lower their costs.\n  There are about 23 million small businesses in our country. \nBusinesses with fewer than 500 employees represent more than 99.9 \npercent of all American businesses. They pay nearly half the total \nAmerican private payroll. They have generated 60 to 80 percent of the \nnew jobs annually over the last decade, and they employ 41 percent of \nhigh-tech workers.\n  Small business is particularly important in rural States such as \nMontana. Rural communities generally do not have large employers. Rural \nfamilies rely on small businesses for jobs.\n  The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over taxes. The committee held \na hearing on January 10 of this year entitled ``Tax Incentives for \nBusinesses in Response to a Minimum Wage Increase.'' The committee \nheard from a variety of witnesses, including labor economists, small \nbusiness owners, and tax experts.\n  Following that hearing, the committee held a markup on January 17. \nThe committee considered an original bill called the Small Business and \nWork Opportunity Act of 2007. That bill is a revenue-neutral bill \ncontaining a number of tax incentives for small businesses and \nbusinesses that hire minimum wage workers. The committee favorably \nreported that bill by unanimous voice vote, and the majority leader \nincluded that bill in its entirety in his amendment to the bill before \nus today.\n  The substitute would help business owners to afford new equipment and \nproperty for their businesses by extending section 179 expensing for \nanother year.\n  In order to carry out day-to-day activities, small business owners \nare often required to invest significant amounts of money in \ndepreciable property, such as machinery. While these large purchases \nare necessary to operate a business, they generally require \ndepreciation across a number of years. But depreciation requires \nadditional bookkeeping. Section 179 expensing allows for immediate 100 \npercent deduction of the cost of most personal property purchased for \nuse in a business. In\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\n2007, small business owners could deduct up to $112,000 of equipment \nexpenses.\n  When small business owners are able to expense equipment, they no \nlonger have to keep depreciation records on that equipment. So \nextending section 179 expensing would ease small business bookkeeping \nburdens.\n  The substitute would allow small business owners to quickly recover \nthe cost of improvements to their establishments through extension and \nexpansion of the 15-year straight line appreciation period for \nleaseholds and restaurant improvements.\n  Allowing retailers and restaurants to use a 15-year straight line \ndepreciation period means that when an entrepreneur opens a business \nand remodels the property, that investment could be recovered over a \nperiod of time more closely reflecting wear and tear. It used to be 39 \nyears.\n  In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act shortened the cost recovery \nof certain leasehold improvements and restaurant property for 39 years \nto 15 years for the remainder of 2004 and 2005. The Tax Relief and \nHealth Care Act of 2006 extended this provision to the end of 2007.\n  At the Finance Committee minimum wage hearing held January 10, small \nbusiness owners testified that a shorter 15-year recovery period for \nrestaurant and building leasehold property reflects the true economic \nlife of the improvements. And they testified that businesses put more \nmoney into their operations if they know they can recover their \nimprovement costs over 15 years instead of 39.\n  The substitute would extend the 15-year recovery period for leasehold \nand restaurant improvements and would also broaden the provision to \nallow retail owners and new restaurants to take advantage of this \nshortened depreciation period.\n  These are changes that Senator Conrad, Senator Kerry, Senator Snowe, \nand Senator Kyl have championed.\n  The substitute would simplify the way that small businesses keep \nrecords for tax purposes. The cash method of accounting is often the \neasiest method of accounting. Allowing small business to use the cash \nmethod reduces the administrative and tax compliance burden of these \nbusinesses. The substitute would let more businesses take advantage of \nthis method. Businesses with gross receipts up to $10 million would be \nable to use the cash method.\n  The substitute would also help businesses provide jobs for workers \nwho have experienced barriers to entering the workforce by extending \nand expanding the work opportunity tax credit.\n  WOTC, otherwise known as the work opportunity tax credit, encourages \nbusiness to hire workers who might not otherwise find work. These \nemployers teach workers new skills and how to be a good employee. The \nworkers serve our food, sell us goods, paint our houses, and provide \ncare to our sick and elderly.\n  WOTC, the work opportunity tax credit, has been remarkably \nsuccessful. By reducing expenditures on public assistance, WOTC is \nhighly cost effective. The business community is highly supportive of \nthese credits. Especially industries such as retail and restaurants \nthat hire many low-skilled workers find it useful.\n\n  The substitute would extend WOTC for 5 years, and the substitute \nwould expand the credit to make it available to employers who hire \nveterans disabled after 9/11, something I think is very important for \nus to do.\n  As of July 2006, nearly 20,000 members of our Armed Forces were \nwounded in action in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring \nFreedom. Many of these soldiers are now permanently disabled and do not \nknow what they are going to do once they return home. We need to help \nthese young men and women, and a modest tax incentive to get them back \nin the workforce is a good place to start.\n  This is an issue the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, championed.\n  I think we should make WOTC permanent. Senator Snowe and I introduced \na bill to do just that. But to accommodate other Senators' priorities, \nthe committee agreed to a 5-year extension in the bill that is now \nincluded in the substitute.\n  The substitute helps small businesses by modifying S corporation \nrules. These modifications reduce the effect of what some call the \nsting tax; that is, these modifications improve the viability of \ncommunity banks.\n  These are changes that Senator Lincoln and Senator Hatch have \nchampioned.\n  These are all important ways to help small businesses succeed. These \nprovisions will spur investment and, thus, create jobs. They will \nprovide greater opportunity for workers looking for a job. They all \nenjoy strong support.\n  Senator Grassley, members of the Finance Committee, and I have worked \nto develop a balanced package, and I believe we have done just that.\n  The language included in the substitute is a responsible package that \nwill ensure the continued growth and success of small businesses. And \nwe have also paid for it. Most of the offsets are proposals the Senate \nhas supported several times before. The offsets include a proposal to \nend future tax benefits for abusive sale-in-lease-out tax shelters, \nknown as SILOs. These deals are foreign tax-exempt entities to generate \nsham tax deductions.\n  Even after Congress shut these deals down in 2004, some taxpayers \ncontinue to take excessive, unwarranted depreciation deductions on \nGerman sewer systems and the like. The Internal Revenue Service says it \nhas 1,500 of these deals under audit involving billions--yes, \nbillions--of dollars. At a minimum, it is time to shut these foreign \ndeals down. There are domestic deals, too, but this provision only \naffects foreign deals.\n  Another offset doubles fines, penalties, and interest on taxes owed \nas a result of using certain abusive offshore financial arrangements to \navoid paying taxes. Taxpayers will hide their money from the IRS \nthrough offshore credit cards and other shady financial arrangements \nneed to get the message that this Congress is serious about ending \nthese abuses.\n  The substitute closes a corporate loophole used by companies that \nreinvented themselves as foreign corporations to avoid paying taxes in \nour country. In March 2002, Senator Grassley and I made it clear to \nthose who put profits ahead of patriotism did so at their own peril. \nThe substitute would treat those who moved offshore after that date \nlike a U.S. company, and the substitute would make those companies pay \nU.S. taxes.\n  Further, under the substitute, companies that paid to settle \nGovernment investigations or that paid punitive damages ordered by the \ncourts will be prohibited from taking tax deductions for those \npayments.\n  Deducting these amounts can reduce the true cost of these settling by \nas much as a third. Deducting these amounts would effectively shift the \ntax burden onto the backs of other taxpayers who pay what they \nrightfully owe. Those deductions should, therefore, be prohibited.\n  The hard-working American taxpayers we are trying to help in this \nsubstitute should not have to pay more taxes because some taxpayers are \nabusing the tax system through tax shelters. They also should not have \nto bear the burden of civil settlements and punitive damages paid by \ncompanies that engage in questionable behavior.\n  Another offset would limit the annual amount of nonqualified deferred \ncompensation for corporate executives. Rank-and-file workers generally \nhave to pay taxes on their compensation when they earn it. The \nexception is deferred compensation provided through qualified \nretirement plans with statutory limits on contributions and benefits. A \n401(k) is the best example.\n  Management, on the other hand, has no limit on the amount that can be \ndeferred to nonqualified arrangements--no limit. The substitute sets \nthe annual limit at the lesser of 100 percent of taxable compensation \nor $1 million.\n  These are sound changes. I urge my colleagues to support the \nsubstitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 116\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I want to take a moment to explain my \namendment No. 116. This amendment gives the States the rights and the \nflexibility to determine a minimum wage that works best for them. My \nprovision does not allow States to go any lower than the minimum wage \nthey currently operate within their State.\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n  This is an important amendment for small business, an important \namendment as far as the States are concerned because cost of living and \nwages vary dramatically from State to State. A one-size-fits-all \nfederally imposed minimum wage does not take into account the economic \nrealities that exist in each State.\n  The States are already fulfilling their responsibilities of \nregulating wages. Currently, 28 States and DC have minimum wage rates \nabove the Federal level. Because the minimum wage varies by State, this \nlegislation threatens to impose a 41-percent increase on some States \nand a 0-percent increase on others.\n  Let's give the States the right and flexibility to regulate minimum \nwage. State legislatures are closer to the people and are better \nsituated than the Federal Government to set a minimum wage. A one-size-\nfits-all solution under Federal mandate is not the answer to protecting \nAmerica's economic security.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment that \ngives the States the flexibility to determine what is best for its own \ncitizens.\n  When it is appropriate, Madam President, I will call for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:10 \np.m. today the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to Allard amendment \nNo. 116, and that the time until 5:10 p.m. be equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form, with no second-degree amendments in order \nto the amendment prior to the vote; further, that upon disposition of \nthe Allard amendment, the Senate then resume Sununu amendment No. 112 \nand that Kerry amendment No. 187 to the Sununu amendment be considered \nand agreed to, the Sununu amendment, as amended, be agreed to, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; provided, that the Senate \nthen consider Feingold amendment No. 127 and that the amendment be \nmodified with the language at the desk, and that it be agreed to, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 128 to Amendment No. 100\n\n      (Purpose: To direct the Administrator of the Small Business \n   Administration to establish a pilot program to provide regulatory \n    compliance assistance to small business concerns, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 128 and ask that it be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 128 to amendment No. \n     100.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask that the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, the Feingold amendment is an amendment that has been \naccepted by the Senate on a number of different occasions. It provides \ninformation-reporting on the buying of American goods. This is an \neffort to increase and support American workers. It has been accepted. \nWe welcome that amendment.\n  The other amendment which my friend and colleague will speak to, \nSenators Kerry, Snowe, and Sununu, I strongly support. This deals with \nthe women's business center amendment. Our friends on the Small \nBusiness Committee have worked long and hard on this. It is a very \ninteresting, innovative, and creative program that has created \nthousands of jobs and millions of dollars in wages, and it deserves \nfavorable consideration. My colleague will speak to that in just a few \nmoments.\n  On the Allard amendment, Members should understand what the effect of \nthe Allard amendment is, and that is effectively to repeal the minimum \nwage for any States among the 50 States. That effectively is what the \nAllard amendment does. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding, any employer should not be required to pay \n     an employee the wage that is greater than the minimum wage \n     provided by law of the State in which the employee is \n     employed, and not less than the minimum wage in effect in \n     that State.\n\n  So effectively it eliminates the minimum wage.\n  It is true we have had the minimum wage at $5.15 an hour. The \nunderlying bill raises it to $7.25, with a very modest tax offset. \nHopefully we will have an opportunity to vote on that.\n  It is true that the existing minimum wage is $5.15 an hour and a \nnumber of States have gone above this, but the concept of the minimum \nwage was that it was going to be a minimum payment, a minimum standard. \nWhat was accepted at the time of the minimum wage is that in this \ncountry, we didn't want to accelerate a rush to the bottom so that we \nwould have competition in the various States to pay the lowest possible \nwages--sweat labor--in order to try to attract industries into those \nparticular States, but to provide a minimum standard. Hopefully it was \ngoing to be a living standard for workers who worked 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks of the year.\n  I respect the Senator from Colorado, his view on this issue, but if \nwe accepted the amendment of the Senator, it would effectively \neliminate the minimum wage as we know it.\n  I think the reason for the minimum wage, as we have tried to point \nout during the course of this debate in discussion, was to establish a \nbasic floor as a standard for payment for individuals who worked long \nand hard in some of the most difficult jobs in this country. We have \neliminated child labor. We have established laws with regard to \novertime. We have tried to be not only the strongest economy in the \nworld but one that is going to respect workers and workers' rights and \nworkers' interests and workers' families. The minimum wage does not do \nso at the present time, but many of us will continue to battle to try \nto make sure it does. The Allard amendment brings us all in the \nopposite direction.\n  If I have any time left, I will reserve it. I know the Senator from \nColorado will use his time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reiterate, my amendment gives \nflexibility to States to set their own minimum wage. What is an \nappropriate minimum wage level for one State does not apply for \nanother, and has different potential effects on the ability for \neconomic growth in that State. When you vote for my amendment, you are \nvoting for State flexibility. The States are already fulfilling their \nresponsibilities of regulating wages. My amendment does not allow the \nStates to set a minimum wage lower than their current operating minimum \nwage as of January 1, 2007.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for the Allard amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if there are no further speakers--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield a couple of minutes. I understand we \nhave 3 or 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I understand we just have a few minutes. A few minutes \nago, we thought we would be voting on one of the DeMint amendments, and \nwe are still not sure if that is going to happen.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, I find that there is strong \nsupport. We are just having difficulty getting a final time to be able \nto slot it in at this particular time. I am very hopeful we will be \nable to have that sometime in the very near future, and I will keep in \nclose touch with the Senator. I thank him for his cooperation. I hope \nwe will be able to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 158\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will take a couple of moments to \nreexplain the amendment just in case we get to vote on it tonight or \nearly in the morning.\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n  We just heard Senator Allard talk about the need for State \nflexibility because of the different costs of living, the different \neconomies, the different situations. In the United States today, we \nhave 29 States that have set a minimum wage higher than the Federal \nminimum wage. That action really reflects the cost of living in \ndifferent parts of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remainder of the time is controlled by the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Senator from South Carolina seeks time? I yield time \nto the Senator.\n  Mr. DeMINT. We will talk until the next vote, how about that? What \ntime is the next vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next vote is in 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator from South Carolina will yield, Senator \nEnzi would also like to speak briefly on this amendment, if you will \nallow him at least a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Two minutes.\n  Senator Allard has made a good case for the need for States to have \nflexibility to adapt the minimum wage to their particular State's cost \nof living. That is one option.\n  The amendment I have is quite different. It recognizes that we do \nhave very different costs of living, such as in Massachusetts, Boston \nis 35 percent above the national average cost of living. If you go \nsouth to Mobile, AL, it is 11 percent less than the average cost of \nliving. So the current $5.15 minimum wage which is in Alabama actually \nhas more buying power than the $7.50 minimum wage which is now in \neffect in Massachusetts.\n  We are proposing that we be fair with this Federal minimum wage \nincrease. The Senator from Massachusetts knows that, despite his \npassion for low-income workers and raising the minimum wage for \nworkers, workers in 29 States will not get the full benefit. In fact, \nworkers in Massachusetts will get no raise at all. Workers in \nWashington, Oregon, or California will get no raise, as will the \nminimum wage workers in Vermont or Connecticut or Rhode Island. All the \nStates here in blue, the highest cost of living States in our country, \nwill get either no increase or less than a 10-cent increase from this \n$2.10. The States in the white get some increase but, again, not the \nfull increase. Really, most of the States that would get the full $2.10 \nincrease are low-cost-of-living States around our country, again where \nthe cost of living is more in tune with the $5.15 minimum wage.\n  Frankly, I would like every worker to be making a lot more money, and \nthere are a lot of other things we can do to make that happen. But if \nwe are going to have a Federal minimum wage, let it reflect the cost of \nliving in every State. Let's give every minimum wage worker in this \ncountry a raise when we pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 1 minute under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Minnesota \nearlier today, Ms. Klobuchar, and thought she had some very convincing \ncomments regarding the tip credit. In conjunction with that, she \nsuggested that States ought to be able to do what they want to do. That \nis what this bill does.\n  Even if one accepts the idea that the minimum wage should be used as \na tool of economic policy, it is quite obviously a tool that should be \nused with precision, not indiscriminately wielded like a sledge hammer.\n  State and local economies are vastly different, however, one-size-\nfits-all Federal legislation totally dismisses those important \ndifferences. It also misses the point that states are in a far better \nposition to determine what is best for their local economies. Federal \n``solutions'' often ignore local and regional experience and judgment, \nor worse still, just arrogantly cast it aside.\n  There is just no room for debate over the fact that there is a vast \ndifference from State to State in terms of the cost of living, the cost \nof doing business, and the purchasing power of a dollar. A nationally \nbased minimum wage adjustment simply ignores these important \ndifferences. It discriminates against both employees and employers \nbased solely upon where they choose to live and work or to establish \ntheir businesses.\n  Proponents of an across-the-board Federal minimum wage increase might \nbe able to ignore these realities and claim that somehow the Federal \nGovernment was ``forced'' to act because States ``refused'' to do so. \nUnfortunately for those who make this argument, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  State legislatures have been, and continue to be extremely active in \nconsidering minimum wage legislation that is appropriately tailored to \nthe economic realities of their respective States. Consider that 6 \nstates this year have passed ballot initiatives raising their State's \nminimum wage law, and 29 States now have minimum wage rates higher than \nthe current Federal level. I urge my colleagues to consider that States \nand localities may have a better idea of what their appropriate minimum \nwage level should be than the Federal Government. When the Federal \nlevel does not fit, States and localities act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I recognize that all or nearly all time \nunder control has expired, but I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on an amendment on which the chairman and ranking member have \ncome to agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 112\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, Senator Kerry spoke earlier about the \nimportance of women's business centers. I offered an amendment at the \nbeginning of the debate a couple of days ago that would ensure \ncontinuation of funding for some of the high-performing women's \nbusiness centers across the country, one of them being in Portsmouth, \nNH, a small facility that manages to serve 1,300 women. It covers \nMaine, covers northeastern Massachusetts, as well as clients across New \nHampshire. Senator Kerry and Senator Snowe offered a modification to \nthe amendment which we have agreed to accept, I think. I hope that is \ngoing to be passed on a voice vote and then my amendment with his \nimprovements will be voted on by voice.\n  I thank Chairman Kennedy, Senator Kerry, Ranking Member Enzi, and my \ndear friend from Maine, Senator Snowe for working with me to ensure \nthat this can get done in a timely way. This continuation of funding \nwill make a difference for, of course, dozens of business centers, but \nthat translates into thousands of women entrepreneurs across the \ncountry. Those small firms in New Hampshire and across the country are \nthe ones that really drive economic growth. I appreciate the work they \nhave done, Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 116\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is consumed.

RENEWAL GRANTS FOR WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 656) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Continued Funding for Centers.--\n       ``(1) In general.--A nonprofit organization described in \n     paragraph (2) shall be eligible to receive, subject to \n     paragraph (3), a 3-year grant under this subsection.\n       ``(2) Applicability.--A nonprofit organization described in \n     this paragraph is a nonprofit organization that has received \n     funding under subsection (b) or (l).\n       ``(3) Application and approval criteria.--\n       ``(A) Criteria.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the \n     Administrator shall develop and publish criteria for the \n     consideration and approval of applications by nonprofit \n     organizations under this subsection.\n       ``(B) Contents.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection, the conditions for participation in the grant \n     program under this subsection shall be the same as the \n     conditions for participation in the program under subsection \n     (l), as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       ``(C) Notification.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the deadline to submit applications for each fiscal year, \n     the Administrator shall approve or deny any application under \n     this subsection and notify the applicant for each such \n     application.\n       ``(4) Award of grants.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, the Administrator shall make a grant for the \n     Federal share of the cost of activities described in the \n     application to each applicant approved under this subsection.\n       ``(B) Amount.--A grant under this subsection shall be for \n     not more than $150,000, for each year of that grant.\n       ``(C) Federal share.--The Federal share under this \n     subsection shall be not more than 50 percent.\n       ``(D) Priority.--In allocating funds made available for \n     grants under this section, the Administrator shall give \n     applications under this subsection or subsection (l) priority \n     over first-time applications under subsection (b).\n       ``(5) Renewal.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Administrator may renew a grant \n     under this subsection for additional 3-year periods, if the \n     nonprofit organization submits an application for such \n     renewal at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such \n     information as the Administrator may establish.\n       ``(B) Unlimited renewals.--There shall be no limitation on \n     the number of times a grant may be renewed under subparagraph \n     (A).\n       ``(n) Privacy Requirements.--\n       ``(1) In general.--A women's business center may not \n     disclose the name, address, or telephone number of any \n     individual or small business concern receiving assistance \n     under this section without the consent of such individual or \n     small business concern, unless--\n       ``(A) the Administrator is ordered to make such a \n     disclosure by a court in any civil or criminal enforcement \n     action initiated by a Federal or State agency; or\n       ``(B) the Administrator considers such a disclosure to be \n     necessary for the purpose of conducting a financial audit of \n     a women's business center, but a disclosure under this \n     subparagraph shall be limited to the information necessary \n     for such audit.\n       ``(2) Administration use of information.--This subsection \n     shall not--\n       ``(A) restrict Administration access to program activity \n     data; or\n       ``(B) prevent the Administration from using client \n     information (other than the information described in \n     subparagraph (A)) to conduct client surveys.\n       ``(3) Regulations.--The Administrator shall issue \n     regulations to establish standards for requiring disclosures \n     during a financial audit under paragraph (1)(B).''.\n       (b) Repeal.--Section 29(l) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 656(l)) is repealed effective October 1 of the first \n     full fiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Transitional Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, a grant or cooperative agreement that was awarded \n     under subsection (l) of section 29 of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 656), on or before the day before the date \n     described in subsection (b) of this section, shall remain in \n     full force and effect under the terms, and for the duration, \n     of such grant or agreement.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I support this amendment offered by \nSenators Kerry, Snowe and Sununu. This amendment provides essential \nongoing support to Women Business Centers and has received bipartisan \nsupport in the small business committee and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Women small business entrepreneurs are making gains in today's \neconomy and have grown dramatically over the last few decades. In my \nState of Massachusetts women-owned small businesses have grown by 13 \npercent since 1997. But they still account for only one-third of all \nsmall businesses in the State. Nationally, they make up only 28 percent \nof all small businesses.\n  Women Business Centers provide essential training and support to \nwomen of all incomes, and of all races to help them start and grow \ntheir small business. These centers even the playing field for women \nentrepreneurs who still face significant obstacles in the world of \nbusiness.\n  The Center for Women and Enterprise in Massachusetts, has served over \n12,000 women who created 16,000 new jobs and generated more than $470 \nmillion in wages since 1995.\n  We must make this program permanent and make sure that women can \nparticipate in small business that is so vital to our national economic \ngrowth.\n  Women entrepreneurs are precious national assets that employ millions \nof workers and generate billions in wages. We should not limit their \npotential.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to support our women \nentrepreneurs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to speak about amendment No. 187. \nI offer this amendment along with my colleagues Senators Snowe and \nSununu to keep open our Nation's most experienced and successful \nwomen's business centers. These centers--including those in Boston and \nWorcester in my home State of Massachusetts, in Portsmouth, NH, and in \nWiscasset, ME--provide business counseling and financial literacy \ntraining to women who want to start or grow a business. We need to pass \nthis amendment so that the women's business centers have access to the \nFederal matching money that is necessary to raise private sector \ncapital.\n  For several years now Senator Snowe and I have been working on a \nsolution to keep open the most experienced centers. Last summer our \ncommittee passed a bill that would keep these centers open, though it \ndid not become law. I want to thank Senator Snowe and her staff for \ntheir collaboration on this important issue, and I also want to thank \nSenator Sununu for working with us to incorporate changes into his \noriginal amendment that reflect our committee's work. I thank the very \nable and resourceful executive directors of the women's business \ncenters for working with us all these years to keep their centers \ngoing, providing women with the tools they need to make their \nbusinesses succeed. In my home State, that includes our current leader, \nMs. Donna Good, and her predecessor, Andrea Silbert, who started the \nCenter for Women & Enterprise.\n  In my 21 years on the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have consistently promoted women entrepreneurs and \nfought for adequate funding for the women's business centers. As \nchairman of the committee in the 110th Congress, I will do the same and \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment. This important legislation will allow established women's \nbusiness centers to receive renewability grants after their initial \ngrant cycle of matching funds has expired.\n  The concept of sustainability grants is something I originally \nintroduced in 1999 with my Women's Business Center\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\nSustainability Pilot Program--a bill that garnered widespread \nbipartisan support and was instrumental in securing additional funding \nto allow successful and effective centers keep their doors open for \nwomen entrepreneurs in their community. And last Congress Senator Snowe \nand I introduced the Women's Small Business Ownership Programs Act, \nwhich allowed proven centers with a successful track record to receive \nadditional 3-year renewal grants beyond an initial 4-year grant cycle.\n  The amendment we introduced today builds upon our previous \nlegislative proposals by giving established women's business centers \nthe ability to apply for 3-year grants on an ongoing basis. It would \nprovide women's business centers with a permanent funding stream in the \nfuture.\n  By adopting this amendment today, we will ensure that successful and \nexperienced centers are able to continue serving entrepreneurs by \ngiving women-owned small businesses the tools they need to grow and \nflourish.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise to speak to the second-degree \namendment currently pending today that Senator Kerry and I have \nintroduced along with Senator Sununu. I would first like to commend my \ncolleague Senator Sununu for taking the initiative and offering the \noriginal women's business center amendment that includes critical \nlegislation to keep this longstanding program operating.\n  This second-degree amendment expands upon Senator Sununu's amendment \nby addressing the continuation of the women's business center \nsustainability program, a 5-year pilot program that expired in October \n2003. I am pleased to have worked closely with Senator Kerry, the \noriginal author of this program, to find a permanent solution to keep \nthe most experienced centers funded and operating.\n  We cannot afford to ignore, or minimize, the extraordinary \ncontributions America's businesswomen are making to our economy, our \nculture, and our future. The achievements of women entrepreneurs are \nundeniable. Women-owned firms generate almost $2.5 trillion in \nrevenues. They employ more than 19 million workers and are the fastest \ngrowing segment of today's economy. In my home State of Maine alone, \nmore an 63,000 women-owned firms generate an astounding $9 billion in \nsales. That is truly a record we can all be proud of.\n  There can be no doubt the Small Business Administration's, SBA, \nwomen's business center program has been an indispensable party on the \npath to success. In 2006, the 99 women's business centers nationwide \nserved more than 144,000 clients across the country. Whether focused on \nexpanding access to more affordable employee health coverage--enhancing \nFederal contract procurement opportunities for women-owned businesses--\nor improving access to capital, the women's business center program has \nbeen an invaluable resource to women-owned businesses in my home State \nof Maine and across the Nation.\n  The fact is, since the program was created in 1988, Congress renewed \nthe program seven times, and made it permanent in 1997. The women's \nbusiness centers' unique training and counseling has helped clients \ngenerate more than $235 million in revenue and create or retain over \n6,500 jobs in 2003. This program clearly has a record of success, \nfostering job growth and providing American small businesses with the \nopportunity to thrive.\n  Women entrepreneurs continue to face tremendous challenges--access to \nbusiness assistance, access to capital, and access to Federal \nGovernment contracting opportunities. The ``glass ceiling'' in \ncorporate America that led many women to start a small business has \nbeen transformed into another obstacle--a ``glass doorway''--between \nwomen who want to start and grow businesses and the lending and Federal \ncontract markets these women entrepreneurs seek to enter. Overcoming \nthese obstacles requires that women are provided the business \nassistance tools they need, which we here in Congress can ensure \nthrough the programs and services established within the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Over the past 4 years as chair of the Small Business Committee and \nnow as ranking member, I have carefully examined the SBA's programs \nwith a particular focus on the agency's initiatives that are intended \nto foster women-owned businesses. I introduced numerous bills in the \n108th and 109th Congress to improve and revitalize these programs.\n  In fact, in July 2006, I led the Small Business Committee in \nunanimously reporting out the Small Business Reauthorization and \nImprovements Act, S. 3778. This reauthorization package incorporated a \nbill, the Women's Small Business Ownership Programs Act of 2006, S. \n3659, that I, along with Senator Kerry, introduced and which was \ncosponsored by Senator Sununu.\n  The issue before us today is whether to renew and make permanent the \nWomen's Business Centers Sustainability Grants Program, which \nunfortunately expired in 2003. This amendment is designed to address \nthese issues and improve the programs and services that the SBA \ndelivers across the Nation for women business owners. The need and the \nimpressive record of the women's business centers only supports the \nreasons for making the program permanent. The centers have proven to be \na great value to the communities they serve, so we must ensure their \nprograms and services continue to be available.\n  Two years ago, the funding for the women's business center in my home \nState of Maine expired. This center, Coastal Enterprises, has struggled \nsince then to find funding necessary to continue providing vital \nassistance to women entrepreneurs across the State of Maine. Coastal \nEnterprises has helped women entrepreneurs succeed for over 10 years, \nand we must ensure the center receives this critical assistance to \ncontinue its operation.\n  The duty rests upon us to foster an environment favorable to economic \nexpansion so that each business can travel down their road of success. \nThis amendment achieves that goal--and not by establishing costly new \ninitiatives but by building on successful established programs within \nthe SBA and improving their delivery for the benefit of current and \nfuture women entrepreneurs.\n  My responsibility as ranking member of the committee includes \nensuring that every woman who owns a small business--or any woman who \ndreams of owning one--has the resources, the support, and the \nopportunities they need to embark on their next great entrepreneurial \nadventure.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 187) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sununu amendment as thus amended is agreed \nto.\n  The amendment (No. 112), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 127, as Modified, to Amendment No. 100\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I send to the desk the modified \nFeingold amendment numbered 127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 127, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 100.\n       The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 127, AS MODIFIED\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Buy American Act to require each Federal agency \n  to submit reports regarding purchases of items made outside of the \n                 United States, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Under the previous order, that amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 127), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, for the benefit of the Members, we have \ntoday disposed of six amendments. We have 18 other amendments pending. \nThe staffs will work over the evening.

We thank all \nof our colleagues for their cooperation. We are expecting a full day, \nwith a number of votes tomorrow. We are looking forward in the near \nfuture to getting final action on an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in morning business.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator desires to speak as in morning business, \nI don't think there would be any objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I hope there would not be any objection.\n  Madam President, may I suggest the Senator from Idaho be recognized \nand I be recognized following his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I will take 5 minutes or less to speak on \na matter of importance, in terms of the process we are following as we \nconsider the Small Business and Work Opportunity Act.\n  The concern I raise is regarding compensation-related tax increases \nthat came out of the Senate Committee on Finance as part of this \npackage.\n  The Small Business and Work Opportunity Act includes $8.3 billion \nworth of business tax reductions that are paid for with offsetting tax \nincreases. Two of these tax increases relating to the tax treatment of \ncompensation are brandnew proposals that have never been examined by \neither the Committee on Finance or the full Senate. In fact, the \nlegislative language was not even available when H.R. 2 was brought to \nthe Senate.\n  The concern I have about the process is this: Almost half of the \nbusiness tax cuts in the package we are considering are extensions of \ncurrent tax law provisions that Congress has previously passed with \nbroad bipartisan support without offsetting tax increases.\n  I understand the desire to offset the cost of new tax policies, but I \nam concerned about increasing taxes on individuals and employers to \noffset extensions of current policy. Mandatory spending programs, which \nare the real source of budgetary pressure, are automatically extended \nevery year. These automatic extensions are not paid for because they \nrepresent extensions of current law. The same standard should apply to \ncurrent tax policy.\n  We will engage in a debate over the pay-as-you-go budget requirements \nwhen a pay-go proposal is submitted to the Senate. Until that time, I \nurge my colleagues, we should not raise taxes to offset current tax \nlaw, particularly if the tax increase proposals have never been vetted. \nMaking major changes to the tax law without full examination of the \npolicy proposals will lead to unintended consequences and create real \nburdens on many of the employers that this bill seeks to help.\n  I will point out a few of the concerns these new proposals do raise \nthat, as I said, were not raised in the Committee on Finance as we did \nnot have time to review them carefully.\n  One of the proposals, the new limits on deferred compensation, limits \nthe amount of compensation an employee can save in a nonqualified \ndeferred compensation plan or an NQDC plan. I know we are getting into \nacronyms and some of the complications of the code, but these things \nhave real consequences in the business of our country. I have several \nsignificant concerns with this proposal which were not addressed during \nthe Committee on Finance consideration of the bill.\n  First, the proposal does not target executives. NQDC plans benefit a \nwide range of workers, including nonmanagerial employees. The Committee \non Finance proposal affects all employees in the plan, not just \nexecutives. As a result, the proposal would limit the amount that mid-\nlevel workers can set aside for retirement, attacking one of the \nobjectives that we in America need to be paying strong attention to, \nthe ability of Americans to begin saving assets for retirement.\n  Second, the proposal does not target multimillion dollar salaries--\nagain, one of the justifications for the proposal. It is said that this \nis the million-dollar salary provision. Yet the cap on annual deferrals \nis set at the lesser of $1 million or a 5-year average of past \ncompensation. This could have negative consequences on employees at a \nmuch lower salary level.\n  For example, consider a nonmanagerial employee who worked at a \nmanufacturing plant for 13 years at an average salary of $60,000 over \nthe past 5 years. In the process of downsizing, this employee may be \noffered a severance package that includes 1 year of health benefits \nplus 2 years of severance pay for every year on the job. A severance \npackage of this size would add up to $141,000 paid over a number of \nyears. The present value of this package--in other words, the value \nstream of the payments in today's dollars--is $125,000. Since the \nemployee is bound by a $60,000 cap on deferrals, this severance would \nbe taxed and hit with a 20-percent tax penalty. This is hardly the \nresult we would want.\n  This proposal does nothing to create parity in compensation between \nexecutives and rank-and-file workers and, in fact, does not limit the \namount that executives can be paid as, again, is the stated intention \nbehind the inclusion of this proposal in the bill. It simply requires \nthem to pay taxes on their compensation sooner rather than later. Yet \nit has that unintended consequence that we often speak so much about in \nthe Senate of reaching much more broadly than the payment of high \nsalaries to the high-paid executives and hitting the mid-level managers \nin the businesses around our country who will pay tax penalties because \nwe did not take the time to pay close attention to the kinds of \nprovisions contained in the bill.\n  All of us have been contacted by those in the country who are \nconcerned about this, organizations such as the American Bankers \nAssociation, the American Benefits Council, the American Council of \nLife Insurers, the Association for Advanced Life Underwriting, the \nERISA Industry Committee, FEI's Committee on Benefit Finance, FEI's \nCommittee on Taxation, the HR Policy Association, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Securities Industry and Financial \nMarkets Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, and, of course, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These groups which represent businesses \nof all sizes around the country, which seek to provide benefits and \nsupport for their employees, are asking us to pay attention to the \nprocess by which we put proposals of this kind into the Tax Code \nwithout the kind of due deliberation they deserve.\n\n  Hopefully, during the process of the consideration of this bill, we \nwill have\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nan opportunity to correct these unintended consequences and make sure \nthat the midlevel managers and others who are involved in NQDC plans--\nnonqualified deferred compensation plans--do not face these tax \npenalties we never intended them to face.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I seek recognition to speak in support \nof S.2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, of which I am a cosponsor, \nto increase the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour by 2009. The \nlast time Congress voted to raise the minimum wage was in 1996, raising \nit from $4.25 to $4.75 to eventually $5.15 in 1997.\n  History clearly demonstrates that raising the minimum wage has no \nadverse impact on jobs, employment, or inflation. In the 4 years after \nthe last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced its \nstrongest growth in over three decades. More than 11 million new jobs \nwere added, at the pace of 232,000 per month. We need to ensure that \nhard working Americans that are paid the minimum wage are given an \nincrease because there has been no increase for almost 10 years, while \ncost-of-living adjustments have been provided to others.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, the State minimum wage was \nincreased from $5.15 per hour to $6.25 per hour on January 1, 2007. On \nJuly 1, 2007, the State minimum wage will increase to $7.15 per hour. \nMany States surrounding the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, including New \nYork, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio, have already increased their \nState minimum wage above the Federal minimum wage with a State wage \nrate of $7.93 per hour. With 29 states, including Pennsylvania, passing \nlaws to increase their state minimum wage above the Federal wage, it is \ncrucial for this body and this Congress to pass legislation to increase \nthe Federal wage rate to have consistency across the entire United \nStates.\n  The official poverty rate in the United States increased from a 26-\nyear low of 11.3 percent in 2000 to 12.6 percent in 2005, including \n12.9 million children. The nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank, the \nEconomic Policy Institute, EPI, estimates that 11 percent of the work \nforce, or about 14.9 million workers, would receive an increase in \ntheir hourly wages if the Federal minimum wage was increased to $7.25 \nby 2008. Also, 59 percent of those workers likely to benefit are women \nand 9 percent are single parents. Further, evidence from an analysis of \nthe 1996-97 minimum wage increase shows that the average minimum wage \nworker brings home more than half, 54 percent, of his or her family's \nweekly earnings.\n  Increasing the Federal wage would enable a working family to afford \nalmost 2 more years of childcare, full tuition for a community college \ndegree, and many other staples for a healthy standard of living. \nUnfortunately, the current minimum wage fails to meet these standards. \nCongress needs to act. The longer there is inaction, the more behind \nminimum wage earners get in paying expenses just to survive.\n  Since taking office in 1981, I have consistently supported increasing \nthe Federal minimum wage. I understand the importance of ensuring that \nthe minimum wage keeps better pace with inflation. The real value of \nthe minimum wage has declined steadily in recent years and it is long \npast due for an increase. America's working families work hard every \nday, sometimes at two or three jobs, just to make ends meet. We need to \npass this legislation to give these families leverage to compensate for \nthe increased costs of living over time.\n  The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics defines \ninflation as ``the overall general upward price movement of goods and \nservices in an economy.'' The Bureau compiles statistics, called the \nConsumer Price Index, CPI, to measure the rate of inflation on a yearly \nDecember to December basis. CPI is measured by utilizing prices of a \n``market basket'' of goods and services purchased by an urban family, \nin which a market basket is individual items weighted by how much the \nurban family spent on those same items in a base year period--currently \n1982-1984. By any measure, the current minimum wage does not have the \nsame buying power as it did in 1997, the last time the Federal minimum \nwage was increased.\n  According to the Department of Labor, the rate of inflation from 1997 \nat 1.7 percent has increased at least 2.7 times to 4.7 percent in 2006. \nWhile the price of items has increased almost three times what they had \ncost in 1997, America's working families who depend on the Federal \nminimum wage have not seen any increase at all in the wages they take \nhome.\n  The Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress has \ndone nonpartisan research regarding the Federal minimum wage. They have \nfound that those who earned below $7.25 an hour in 2005 were more than \nlikely to have been women, 7 out of 11 million, of Hispanic origin, \nyoung, i.e., age 16-14; over fifty percent, or old, i.e. age 65 and \nabove; 3.6 percent, lacking a high school degree, 38.1 percent, working \npart-time, i.e. less than 35 hours a week; 35.1 percent, and not \nrepresented by a labor union, 16.7 percent. Continuing, the report \nstates that the families of these workers were more than likely than \nother families in 2005 to have been poor, receiving welfare, and \nlacking health insurance. As a frame of reference, in the private \nsector in 2005, the average wage of nonmanagement employees was $16.11 \nan hour according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of \nemployers.\n  While I do support increasing the Federal minimum wage, I am very \nmuch concerned about the impact on small businesses. In my travels \nthroughout Pennsylvania, I have heard from many small business owners \nabout the unfairness in our tax laws and the burden placed upon them in \ncomparison to large corporations. These complaints have been coupled by \nminimum wage earners who have struggled to make ends meet on just $5.15 \nper hour.\n  After reviewing the available data, I believe that increasing the \nminimum wage will help those in need and will not adversely affect \nsmall businesses. A 1998 EPI study did not find any significant job \nloss associated with the 1996-1997 Federal minimum wage increase. On \nthe other hand, the low-wage labor market--i.e. lower unemployment \nrates and increased average hourly wages--had performed better than in \nprevious years. Small business owners in those states with higher \nminimum wage rates than the Federal minimum wage rate, such as the \nState of Washington at $7.93 per hour, appeared to have prospered. The \nNew York Times reported on January 11, 2007 that small business owners \nin Washington's neighboring State of Idaho are hurting because of the \nState's low minimum wage rate of $5.15 per hour. Many residents living \nnear Washington seek jobs in the Evergreen State, forcing small \nbusiness owners to offer more than Idaho's minimum wage in order to \nhire new employees.\n  Small businesses are recognized as an integral part of a powerful \neconomic engine in America. As a critical job creator, they have helped \nbuild the prosperity that our country has shared. Nationwide, small \nbusinesses employ 52 percent of the private work force and contribute \nto 47 percent of all sales, spending over $1.4 trillion in annual \npayrolls. We need to strike a balance between the needs of these \nemployees and their employers, who will be tasked with paying for any \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  To counter balance the increase in the minimum wage, I have supported \nmany significant measures to help small businesses in recent years. In \nthe 109th Congress, I was a cosponsor of S. 406, the Small Business \nHealth Fairness Act and introduced my own bill in the 108th Congress, \nS. 2767, the Small Business Economic Stimulus Act, which would have \nenabled small businesses to join together to form associated health \nplans.\n  Further, on May 9, 2006, I voted to invoke cloture (to end debate) on \nS. 1955, the Small Business Health Plans bill. Further, in 2005, I \nsupported S.2020, the Tax Relief Act of 2005, which passed the Senate \n64-33. Among other provisions, this bill sought to extend various tax \nrelief provisions for businesses including bonus depreciation and \nincreased expensing for small business property. I have also \nconsistently supported the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, and \nfunding for the Small Business Development Center, SBDC, program, which \noperates in partnership with 16 Pennsylvania colleges and universities \nand assists entrepreneurs and\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\nsmall businesses through consulting, education and business \ninformation. This program received $89 million in fiscal year 2006.\n  It is my expectation that the small business incentives proposed by \nthe Senate Finance Committee will ultimately become law in legislation \nwhich increases the minimum wage.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a minimum \nwage increase that provides American workers a raise with no strings \nattached. It has been nearly a decade since the minimum wage was last \nincreased. We can no longer afford to delay action, and millions of \nhard-working Americans deserve better.\n  The Federal minimum wage today is only $5.15 per hour. Someone who \nworks at this rate for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year takes home less \nthan $11,000 annually far below the poverty line for families.\n  Increasing the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour would impact \nnearly 13 million Americans, the majority of whom are women, 59 \npercent, and people of color, 40 percent. Eighty percent of those \nimpacted would be adult workers, and most are full-time employees.\n  The consequences of nearly a decade of inaction are clear.\n  Almost 40 million Americans live in poverty, 13 million of whom are \nchildren.\n  Increasing the Federal minimum wage to $7.25 would add nearly $4,400 \nto a minimum wage worker's annual income, representing, for many \nfamilies, the difference between self-sufficiency or living below the \npoverty line.\n  For most Americans, the choice is clear. In the last election, voters \nin six States Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio \nsupported initiatives to increase their State minimum wages. In fact, \n29 States, nearly 60 percent, have a minimum wage above the Federal \nlevel.\n  I am proud that my own State of California has one of the highest \nminimum wages in the country, at $7.50 per hour, increasing to $8.00 \nper hour next year. Many California cities and counties stipulate that \nworkers must be paid a living wage, which in some cases guarantees an \nadditional $3 or $4 per hour.\n  There are two options before the Senate today. This body can act \nswiftly and stand behind nearly 13 million workers, Or we can delay \naction, by modifying the legislation before us to include $8.3 billion \nin tax breaks for small businesses.\n  Packaging the minimum wage bill with these tax cuts is \ndisadvantageous to businesses and minimum wage workers. Adding a tax \npackage creates procedural hurdles that could significantly delay \nimplementation of this wage increase.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes linking these small business tax \nbreaks to this legislation because many of the tax provisions are only \ntemporary extensions. They do not provide the long-term relief that \nbusinesses seek.\n  Considering the package of small business tax cuts separately would \nfacilitate a more robust discussion of how small businesses the primary \njob creators in this country can receive genuine relief from the rising \ncosts of operations.\n  Many small business owners would suffer no adverse impact if the \nminimum wage were increased. A recent Gallup Poll in the Sacramento \nBusiness Journal showed that 86 percent of small business owners \nsurveyed do not believe that an increase in the minimum wage would harm \ntheir businesses.\n  Nearly 75 percent of small business owners thought that a 10 percent \nminimum wage increase would have no impact on their businesses at all. \nMore than half of those polled thought the minimum wage should actually \nbe increased.\n  The evidence shows that increasing the minimum wage does not \nadversely affect the economy. In fact, in Los Angeles and San \nFrancisco, raising wages added stability to many businesses and the \nlocal economy.\n  In San Francisco, turnover for home-care workers fell by 57 percent \nafter the city implemented its living wage policies.\n  The average job tenure of workers in fast food restaurants increased \nby 3.5 months.\n  In Los Angeles, businesses affected by a living wage ordinance had \none-third less turnover among low wage earners, and absenteeism \ndeclined.\n  Higher wages improve worker loyalty and increase employee retention, \nwhile decreasing employee hiring and training costs.\n  Let me be clear: I support many of the tax cuts for small businesses. \nI think they should be considered, with the proper offsets, as part of \na separate revenue-neutral tax bill. But they should not be included in \nthis must-pass minimum wage bill.\n  Ensuring that all American workers receive fair pay for a hard day's \nwork should not be a partisan issue. The House overwhelmingly passed \nthis legislation by a vote of 315 to 116, with more than 80 Republicans \ncrossing party lines to support this cause.\n  Congress has increased the minimum wage nine times since the \nenactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act, under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. Only once, in 1996, was a minimum wage \nincrease paired with tax cuts.\n  The purchasing power of the minimum wage is at its lowest level since \n1955. The cost of living is up 26 percent since the last minimum wage \nincrease in 1997.\n  It is unfair to punish hard working people and make them wait for an \nincrease. We must not delay. We must not bog down this bill with \nprocedural tactics.\n  American workers deserve better. I urge my colleagues to do what is \nfair and just: Pass a clean minimum wage bill. Let's provide immediate \nrelief to those who need it most.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama).

Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to vote the \nevening of January 18 on a very significant amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Utah. During consideration of S. 1 last week, I was \nconcerned with section 220 of the bill, which would have severely \nundermined the ability of Americans to be informed about what is \nhappening here in the Capitol and, thereby, to petition the Congress \nwith their thoughts. I applaud Senator Bennett for offering his \namendment to strike these so-called grassroots lobbying provisions from \nthe ethics reform bill, and I thank Senate Republican Leader McConnell \nand Senator Bennett for their leadership in ensuring this amendment's \nsuccess. I ask that the Record reflect that, had I been here, I would \nhave voted in favor of Senator Bennett's amendment No. 20 last Thursday \nnight.\n  Additionally, I applaud the Senate's careful consideration and \npassage of S. 1, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act. \nAlthough I was unable to attend the vote on final passage of S. 1, I \nsupport the bill and hope that a conference to resolve differences \nbetween the House and Senate passed bills is convened soon. Scandals \ninvolving lobbyists and members of Congress from both sides of the \naisle have shaken the American public's confidence in Congress's \nability to do business objectively and judiciously. Although S. 1 fails \nto address transparency for so-called 527 organizations and fails to \nprovide the President the authority to veto wasteful pork projects, \npassage of this bill is an important step toward broadening \ntransparency in the legislative process, and I look forward to sending \na balanced bill to the President's desk. I ask that the Record reflect \nthat, had I been here, I would have voted for the bill, just as I voted \nfor a similar ethics reform bill on March 29, 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1049-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Captain Brian Freeman\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a month ago, I traveled to Iraq to meet \nthere with our men and women in uniform. One soldier in particular \nstood out to me, a bright young West Point graduate, CPT Brian Freeman. \nOur conversation lasted for no more than 5 minutes, and yet I was \nimmediately struck by his outspoken intelligence. ``Senator, it is nuts \nover here. Soldiers are being asked to do work we're not trained to \ndo,'' he told me. ``I'm doing work that State Department people are far \nmore prepared to do in fostering democracy, but they're not allowed to \ncome off the bases because it's too dangerous here. It doesn't make any \nsense.''\n  Now those words have taken on a tragic resonance. Four days ago, \naccording to media accounts, 30 gunmen disguised as U.S. officials \npenetrated an Iraqi checkpoint in Karbala. Once inside the Army \ncompound, the reports say, they opened fire and mortally wounded five \nAmerican soldiers.\n  On Sunday, Charlotte Freeman was visiting her family in Utah when she \nfound a message on her cell phone. Army chaplains had been to her house \nin California. The daily e-mails from her husband Brian had stopped. I \nimagine that few things have more anguish in them than waiting, in \nsuspended fear, for the news of a loved one's death. Late that \nafternoon, the news came.\n  So I rise to honor Captain Freeman and to add my voice to his \nfamily's prayers. His giving spirit and his self-sacrifice embodied all \nthe best of our Armed Forces, whether he was working to take the son of \na Karbala policeman to America for heart surgery or fighting to secure \ndeath benefits for the family of his murdered interpreter or organizing \na charity to fund medical care for Iraqi children. In his duty as a \nliaison between the Army and the Government of Karbala Province, he \nproved every day his dedication to the Iraqi people; the Governor of \nKarbala praised him as ``a soldier and a statesman.''\n  But the virtues we saw in Brian shone through even clearer to those \nwho loved him: Charlotte, his wife; his 3-year-old son Gunnar and his \n14-month-old daughter Ingrid; his father Randy and his stepmother \nKathy; his mother and his stepfather, Kathleen and Albert Snyder. \n``Brian is a beautiful man,'' his mother-in-law, Ginny Mills, wrote to \nme shortly after his death.\n  ``He is loving, funny, and intelligent. He had a spirit in him that \nsaw the good in life. A man who put his life on the line to help those \nless fortunate than himself. A man who was a loving husband and a \ndevoted father. A man whose daughter will never know him first-hand.''\n  In the place of a husband and father who will never see his children \ngrow up, Brian Freeman's young family will have to live on with the \nwarm memories of the man who loved them and who risked his life in the \nservice of his country. Memories and words of comfort are so \ninsufficient, so small, next to the flesh and blood. But there is \nnothing else to put in their place.\n  I have nothing else to add--except to note that the scenes of grief \nand comfort in the home of Charlotte Freeman have played themselves \nout, in some form or another, 3,000 times, in 3,000 families, for 3,000 \nlives. ``Each story is the same,'' wrote Ginny Mills. ``A wonderful, \nbeautiful soul sacrificed.''\n  ``I cannot understand that this war goes on and on,'' she wrote. ``It \nhas to stop. It has to stop now and I need to know how to do that.''\n  May God send comfort to her and to all of Captain Freeman's family \nand to every family that is bereaved. And may we remember, in every \nhour of our deliberations, the young lives that bear the burden of the \nchoices we make in this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1049-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1049-S1050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his or her counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself or herself in such manner so as to prevent, impede, \n     disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the hearings; nor shall this subsection be \n     construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     executive and public hearings.

Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his or her proposed testimony at least \n     48 hours prior to his or her appearance. This requirement may \n     be waived by the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member \n     following their determination that there is good cause for \n     failure of compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the Minority Members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the Chairman by a majority of the Minority \n     Members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     1 day of such hearings.

If a deposition \n     notice is disapproved by the Ranking Minority Member as \n     provided in this subsection, the deposition notice may be \n     authorized by a vote of the Members of the Committee. \n     Committee deposition notices shall specify a time and place \n     for examination, and the name of the Committee Member or \n     Members or staff officer or officers who will take the \n     deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private. The Committee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a \n     witness's failure to appear or produce unless the deposition \n     notice was accompanied by a Committee subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee Member or \n     Members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee Member or Members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his or her presence, the transcriber shall certify \n     that the transcript is a true record of the testimony, and \n     the transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of \n     the committee. The Chairman or a staff officer designated by \n     him/her may stipulate with the witness to changes in the \n     procedure; deviations from this procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his or her obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n\n\n                 rule 6. committee reporting procedures\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported, following final action, the report \n     thereon shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest \n     practicable time.

Such views shall then be included in the \n     Committee report and printed in the same volume, as a part \n     thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted on the cover \n     of the report. In the absence of timely notice, the \n     Committee report may be filed and printed immediately \n     without such views. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules \n     of the Senate.)\n       C.

The Chairman may request \n     additional reports from the Subcommittees regarding their \n     activities and budgets at any time during a Congress. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a resolution I \nsubmitted on January 8 in recognition of the uncommon valor and \ntremendous bravery demonstrated by New York City resident Wesley \nAutrey.\n  On January 2, 2007, Mr. Autrey and others stood on a platform in the \n137th Street subway station in Harlem, and watched as a young man \nsuffering from a seizure fell onto the train tracks. Terrified by what \nhe saw, Mr. Autrey heroically dove down onto the tracks, putting his \nown life in grave danger to save that of a stranger. Mr. Autrey covered \nthe young man in the trough between the tracks as the incoming train \nscreamed to a halt just inches above his head.\n  Later, when asked about the courageous rescue, Mr. Autrey responded \nhumbly, saying, ``I'm not looking at this like I'm the hero, cause the \nreal heroes are the young men and women that are fighting in Iraq now. \nWhat I did is something that any New Yorker should do . . . if you see \nsomebody in distress, do the right thing.''\n  We could all learn from Wesley Autrey's example. A proud member of \nthe Construction and General Building Laborers' Local 79, a veteran of \nthe United States Navy, and a father of two young girls, Mr. Autrey--in \nboth his heroic actions and his humble conduct in the midst of his \nnewfound fame--represents values that all Americans should cherish and \nrespect. His selflessness should be held up as an example to those in \nhis community, his state and his country.\n  Indeed, this resolution is just one fitting way in which to honor the \nuncommon valor and tremendous bravery demonstrated by Wesley Autrey \nwhen he dove in front of an incoming train to save the life of a \nstranger on January 2. I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle will join me in honoring Mr. Autrey by moving this \nlegislation as expeditiously as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1054-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MADELEINE COOPER TAYLOR\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to publicly \ncongratulate Ms. Madeleine Cooper Taylor on her recent appointment as a \nmember of the city council of Memphis, TN. Last Tuesday, she was \nappointed unanimously by the council to serve the remaining term of \ncouncil member TaJuan Stout Mitchell.\n  Ms. Taylor has worked as a program coordinator for the Memphis branch \nof the NAACP since 1991 and is a lifelong Memphian.\n  Now, I am not normally in the habit of coming to the Senate floor to \ncongratulate a new city council member, especially one who is not from \nmy home State of Delaware. But this is no normal circumstance. \nMadeleine Cooper Taylor is the mother of Reagan Taylor, an attorney and \npresidential management fellow whom I have been fortunate enough to \nhave on my staff for the past 6 months.\n  During her rotation on my Judiciary Committee staff, Reagan has made \nan invaluable contribution to legal and drug policy for our country. \nThanks to her efforts, we have succeeded in reauthorizing the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, and our fight against the scourge of \nmethamphetamine has been bolstered. And even though she is scheduled to \nrotate out of my office at the end of this month, as we speak she is \nhard at work improving security for our State and local courts and \nbetter utilizing DNA as a powerful tool in solving horrendous crimes.\n  While Reagan tirelessly works to make our communities safer through \nher efforts on the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, Councilwoman Taylor \nstated in one of her first public statements after her appointment that \nshe is concerned about crime in her community. As the old saying goes, \nthe apple does not fall far from the tree.\n  It has been my pleasure to have Reagan Taylor on my staff over these \npast months, and it is my distinct honor to congratulate Madeleine \nCooper Taylor on her new public office. I wish them both the best of \nluck in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1054-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1054-S1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LIEUTENANT COLONEL DAVID MEUNIER\n\n Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \ncommend an outstanding Arkansas company for a truly amazing gift. \nMurphy Oil Corporation, an El Dorado, AR, based company, has always \nbeen a national leader in philanthropy by providing substantial \ndonations for many very worthwhile causes, especially education. Murphy \nOil's recent announcement to establish the El Dorado Promise may be one \nof the most significant and groundbreaking gifts of any business to any \ngroup of people in recent years.\n  El Dorado Promise is an extraordinary scholarship program. The \nPromise will provide the opportunity for every graduate of El Dorado \nHigh School to pursue higher education by granting a scholarship to \nthese students to be used at community colleges or public universities \naround the country. This scholarship will cover tuition and other \nexpenses for many of these students for up to 5 years. The leadership \nat Murphy Oil has shown that they truly understand that in order to \nadequately prepare for the future we must make significant investments \nin the children of today. This gift represents that significant \ninvestment.\n  I would like to congratulate the students, families, teachers, and \ncommunity of El Dorado, AR. This is a wonderful gift that you truly \ndeserve, and I am excited for the tremendous prospects it will create \nfor you.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to commend the actions of \nClaiborne Deming, president and CEO of Murphy Oil. A great business \nleader known for his strong support of education, Mr. Deming has served \non the Arkansas Board of Education, helped found the Arkansans for \nEducation Reform Foundation, is president of the El Dorado Education \nFoundation, and continues to be a strong catalyst for investment in \neducation. I have no doubt he was instrumental in providing these \nstudents and families the ability to fulfill their ambitions.\n  Finally, I would like to personally thank Murphy Oil Corporation, Mr. \nClaiborne Deming, and members of the Murphy family for their unwavering \nsupport of El Dorado, the State of Arkansas, and the education system. \nThere is no doubt the gift of the El Dorado Promise will better many \nlives and shape the future of Arkansas and the country in a brighter \nway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1055-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hayes, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 323.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nclarify the house parent exemption to certain wage and hour \nrequirements; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss an issue that is \nnear and dear to my heart, because it involves children and youth in \nour foster care system. Inconsistencies in our Federal wage laws, \ncoupled with increases in the minimum wage, are financially crippling \nthe private, non-profit organizations and institutions that make up a \nnecessary part of our communities' support systems for the most \nvulnerable in our society, the children.\n  More than 500,000 children are in America's foster care system at any \ngiven time, because their own families are in crisis or unable to \nprovide for their essential well-being--most because they have been \nsubject to abuse and neglect. Thankfully, most of these children are \nable to be placed with individual caring families. But for those \nchildren without a suitable or available foster family, they are placed \nin one of the many group homes associated with our foster care system.\n  Many of these group homes are specially tailored to the specific \nneeds of foster care children by offering unique programs and on-site \neducation to help heal the emotional scarring they have experienced.\n  These homes--often run by private, non-profit organizations--are \ndedicated to providing residential care and treatment for the ``orphans \nof the living,'' and they have long been a vital part of the social \nservice networks in America's communities.\n  An essential component of the foster care network is the presence of \ncaring parents in a family-like situation. And as in traditional \nparenting, the houseparents of group foster homes seek to provide the \nsame love, care, and supervision of a traditional family for the five \nto eight children that reside with them.\n  Houseparents volunteer to permanently reside at the group home in \norder to create a family- like environment for those without a true \nsense of home--one that offers a structured atmosphere where these most \nvulnerable youth can heal, grow, and become productive members of \nsociety.\n  Foster care alumni studies show us that it is the consistent and \nlife-long connection of caring foster parents that plays the biggest \nrole in helping foster children transition into society.\n  However, our current laws are working against this cause, forcing \ngroup homes to move away from what they know is best for the children \nand preventing them from providing the most appropriate and consistent \ncare. These youth so desperately need the stability that a family- like \nsituation can provide. And this is what my amendment seeks to address.\n  Traditionally, in addition to a modest, fixed salary, houseparents \nhave received food, lodging, insurance, and transportation free of \ncharge.\n  In 1974, Congress recognized and confirmed the unique role \nhouseparents serve when it passed the Hershey Exemption. This amended \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act to preserve the appropriate method of \ncompensation for houseparents--and allowed the lodging and food \nprovided them to be considered when determining an appropriate salary \nfor married houseparents serving with their spouse at nonprofit \neducational institutions.\n  Through this exemption, Congress supplied a way for these vital \nsocial services to continue to be provided by non-profit organizations \nin a way that is cost-effective, and at the same time appropriate and \nmeaningful to both the children and the houseparents.\n  However, since the addition of this exemption, the demographics of \nAmerica and of America's foster children have changed. Research now \nshows that due to the negative experiences some youth have faced, they \nmay find a better environment for growth and healing in having a single \nhouseparent of the same sex.\n  Our labor standards for these group homes have not kept pace with the \never-changing needs of these children.\n  Because the Hershey Exemption was only extended to married couples, \ngroup homes are now forced to choose between what is cheaper and what \nis best for the children. Unfortunately, the financial realities of the \nsituation\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\nplace these facilities in a compromising situation.\n  You see, when a group home employs a single houseparent for a home, \nthey are required to pay them as an hourly employee, whereas married \nhouseparents serving together are allowed to be paid as salaried \nemployees.\n  As a result, it costs a facility in Florida more than $74,000 \nannually at the current minimum wage rate to provide a full-time, \nsingle houseparent using the traditional live-in model.\n  In response, most facilities have resorted to teams of houseparents \nthat work in 8 or 12 hour shifts--just to avoid the additional costs of \novertime pay. Yet even this team model is pricey and means tough \ncoordination and inconsistencies in care for these children. It also \ndestroys the family-like arrangement of the home.\n  If the minimum wage bill--to which I am offering this bill as an \namendment--passes, it will cost facilities across the U.S. in excess of \n$84,000 annually to house and employ a single, full-time houseparent in \na foster care or educational group home. However, if it were a married \ncouple serving in the same environment it would only require minimum \nwage guidelines being met.\n  Can you see how this inconsistency in our labor laws is, and will \ncontinue to be, crippling for the private, non-profit facilities?\n  In order to enable group homes to provide the most appropriate and \nconsistent care for foster and emotionally scarred youth, my amendment \nwill extend the Hershey Exemption to single houseparents, allowing them \nto be treated as salaried employees when free lodging and board are \nprovided.\n  Voting in favor of my amendment will enable private, non-profit group \nhomes to continue providing these vital services for our communities, \nwith a stronger atmosphere of love and growth for the children.\n  Voting against this amendment will--that is, allowing it not to \npass--will mean that the already heavy financial burden for these \nfacilities will continue to grow. Homes will be forced to close or have \nto scale back on the number of children they can help.\n  To vote against this amendment is to turn children out on the street \nat a time when they need us most.\n  As a loving parent and grandparent, I want what is best for my \nchildren and for my grandchildren--I want to make sure they have \nwhatever they need to overcome the obstacles of life and succeed. This \nis also what we should seek for foster children and the hurting youth \nin our communities--to provide the loving homes and facilities for them \nthat provide what they need most and in the most appropriate and \nconsistent way possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nreprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Appropriate and Consistent \n     Care for Youth Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Private, nonprofit organizations dedicated to providing \n     residential care and treatment for children have long been a \n     vital part of the social service networks America's \n     communities.\n       (2) No longer just serving orphans, these institutions tend \n     to the needs of the ``orphans of the living'', children and \n     youth who are unable to remain in their natural homes due to \n     emotional conflicts, life adjustment problems, relationship \n     disturbances, and spiritual and psychological scaring \n     associated with sexual, physical, and emotional abuse.\n       (3) The effectiveness of these institutions in caring for \n     these troubled and abused children has long been due to the \n     love, care, and supervision provided by residential \n     houseparents.\n       (4) These houseparents volunteer to permanently reside at \n     the group home in which they work in order to create a family \n     environment for those without a true sense of home, one that \n     offers a structured atmosphere where these vulnerable youth \n     can heal, grow, and become productive members of society.\n       (5) Traditionally, these houseparents have received food, \n     lodging, insurance, and transportation free of charge, in \n     addition to a fixed salary.\n       (6) Congress recognized the unique role houseparents serve, \n     and passed the Hershey Exemption (section 13(b)(24) of the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 212(b)(24))) in \n     1974 to assist with the provision of houseparents for \n     orphaned and disadvantaged youth by allowing for lodging and \n     food provided free of cost to be considered when determining \n     an appropriate salary for married houseparents serving with \n     their spouse at nonprofit educational institutions.\n       (7) Since the addition of the Hershey Exemption, research \n     shows that due to the negative experiences some troubled \n     youth have faced, they find a better environment for growth \n     in having a single houseparent of the same sex.\n       (8) Because the wage provision under the Hershey Exemption \n     was extended only to married houseparents serving with their \n     spouse, the Department of Labor has enforced a rule that \n     single houseparents need to be reimbursed on a 24-hour-a-day \n     basis, even for time they are sleeping or otherwise not \n     directly caring for residents of the home, and regardless of \n     the provision of free lodging, food, and other services.\n       (9) This has placed an undue financial burden on these \n     nonprofit institutions who wish to provide the best possible \n     care for their residents, forcing some homes to close and \n     others to adopt an employment model where ``teams'' of \n     houseparents work 8-hour sifts to care for residents.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same capital gains treatment for art and collectibles as for other \ninvestment property and to provide that a deduction equal to fair \nmarket value shall be allowed for charitable contributions of literary, \nmusical, artistic, or scholarly compositions created by the donor; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce again \nlegislation to eliminate one of the great inconsistencies in the \nInternal Revenue Code. I would like to thank my colleague, the senior \nSenator from New York, Senator Schumer, for again working with me on \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  The bill we are introducing today is designed to restore some \ninternal consistency to the tax code as it applies to art and artists. \nNo one has ever said that the tax code is fair even though it has \nalways been a theoretical objective of the code to treat similar \ntaxpayers similarly.\n  Our bill would address two areas where similarly situated taxpayers \nare not treated the same. These two areas are internal inconsistencies \ncontained within the tax code. Internal inconsistency number one deals \nwith the long-term capital gains tax treatment of investments in art \nand collectibles. The second internal inconsistency involves how \ncharitable contributions of art by the artist are treated under the \nlaw.\n  Long-term capital gains tax treatment of art is inherently unfair. If \na person invests in stocks or bonds and sells at a gain, the tax \ntreatment is long term capital gains. The top capital gains tax rate is \n15 percent. However, if the same person invests in art or collectibles \nthe top rate is hiked up to 28 percent. Art for art's sake should not \nincur a higher tax rate simply for revenue's sake. That is a big impact \non the pocketbook of the investor.\n  Art and collectibles are alternatives to financial instruments as an \ninvestment choice. To create a tax disadvantage with respect to one \ninvestment compared to another creates an artificial market and may \nlead to poor investment allocations. It also adversely impacts those \nwho make their livelihood in the cultural sectors of the economy.\n  Santa Fe, NM, is the third largest art market in the country. We have \na diverse colony of artists, collectors and\n\n[[Page S1060]]\n\ngallery owners. We have fabulous Native American rug weavers, potters \nand carvers. Creative giants like Georgia O'Keeffe, Maria Martinez, E. \nL. Blumenshein, Allan Houser, R.C. Gorman, and Glenna Goodacre have all \nchosen New Mexico as their home and as their artistic subject. John \nNieto, Wilson Hurley, Clark Hulings, Veryl Goodnight, Bill Acheff, \nSusan Rothenberg, Bruce Nauman, Agnes Martin, Doug Hyde, Margaret Nez, \nand Dan Ostermiller are additional examples of living artists creating \nart in New Mexico.\n  Art, antiques, and collectibles are a $12 to $20 billion annual \nindustry nationwide. In New Mexico, it has been estimated that art and \ncollectible sales range between $500 million and one billion a year.\n  Economists have always been interested in the economics of the arts. \nAdam Smith is a well-known economist. He was also a serious, but \nlittle-known essayist on painting, dancing, and poetry. Similarly, \nKeynes was both a famous economist and a passionate devotee of \npainting. However, even artistically inclined economists have found it \ndifficult to define art within the context of economic theory.\n  When asked to define jazz, Louis Armstrong replied: ``If you gotta \nask, you ain't never going to know.'' A similar conundrum has \nchallenged Galbraith and other economists who have grappled with the \ndefinitional issues associated with bringing art within the economic \ncalculus. Original art objects are, as a commodity group, characterized \nby a set of attributes: every unit of output is differentiated from \nevery other unit of output; art works can be copied but not reproduced; \nand the cultural capital of the nation has significant elements of \npublic good.\n  Because art works can be resold, and their prices may rise over time, \nthey have the characteristics of financial assets, and as such may be \nsought as a hedge against inflation, as a store of wealth, or as a \nsource of speculative capital gain. A study by Keishiro Matsumoto, \nSamuel Andoh and James P. Hoban, Jr. assessed the risk-adjusted rates \nof return on art sold at Sotheby's during the 14-year period ending \nSeptember 30, 1989. They concluded that art was a good investment in \nterms of average real rates of return. Several studies found that rates \nof return from the price appreciation on paintings, comic books, \ncollectibles and modern prints usually made them very attractive long-\nterm investments. Also, when William Goetzmann was at the Columbia \nBusiness School, he constructed an art index and concluded that \npainting price movements and stock market fluctuations are correlated.\n  I conclude that with art, as well as stocks, past performance is no \nguarantee of future returns, but the gains should be taxed the same.\n  In 1990, the editor of Art and Auction asked the question: ``Is there \nan `efficient' art market?'' A well-known art dealer answered \n``Definitely not. That's one of the things that makes the market so \ninteresting.'' For everyone who has been watching world financial \nmarkets lately, the art market may be a welcome distraction.\n  Why do people invest in art and collectibles? Art and collectibles \nare something you can appreciate even if the investment doesn't \nappreciate. Art is less volatile. If buoyant and not so buoyant bond \nprices drive you berserk and spiraling stock prices scare you, art may \nbe the appropriate investment for you. Because art and collectibles are \ninvestments, the long-term capital gains tax treatment should be the \nsame as for stocks and bonds. This bill would accomplish that.\n  Artists will benefit. Gallery owners will benefit. Collectors will \nbenefit. And museums benefit from collectors. About 90 percent of what \nwinds up in museums like New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art comes \nfrom collectors.\n  Collecting isn't just for the hoyty toity. It seems that everyone \ncollects something. Some collections are better investments than \nothers. Some collections are just bizarre. The internet makes \ncollecting big business, and flea market fanatics are avid collectors. \nIn fact, people collect the darndest things. Books, duck decoys, chia \npets, snowglobes, thimbles, handcuffs, spectacles, baseball cards, \nteddy bears, and guns are a few such ``collectibles''.\n  For most of these collections, capital gains isn't really an issue, \nbut you never know. You may find that your collecting passion has \ncreated a tax predicament--to phrase it politely. Art and collectibles \nare tangible assets. When you sell them, capital gains tax is due on \nany appreciation over your purchase price.\n  The bill provides capital gains tax parity because it lowers the top \ncapital gains rate from 28 percent to 15 percent.\n  As I stated earlier, the second internal inconsistency deals with the \ncharitable deduction for artists donating their work to a museum or \nother charitable cause. When someone is asked to make a charitable \ncontribution to a museum or to a fund raising auction, it shouldn't \nmatter whether that person is an artist or not. Under current law, \nhowever, it makes a big difference. As the law stands now, an artist/\ncreator can only take a deduction equal to the cost of the art \nsupplies. Our bill will allow a fair market deduction for the artist.\n  It's important to note that our bill includes certain safeguards to \nkeep the artist from ``painting himself a tax deduction.'' This bill \napplies to literary, musical, artistic, and scholarly compositions if \nthe work was created at least 18 months before the donation was made, \nhas been appraised, and is related to the purpose or function of the \ncharitable organization receiving the donation. As with other \ncharitable contributions, it is limited to 50 percent of adjusted gross \nincome (AGI). If it is also a capital gain, there is a 30 percent of \nAGI limit. Mr. President, I believe these safeguards bring fairness \nback into the code and protect the Treasury against any potential \nabuse.\n  I hope my colleagues will help us put this internal consistency into \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to improve the \nprovisions relating to the carrying of concealed weapons by law \nenforcement officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 2003, Senator Campbell and I, joined by \n68 other Senators, introduced a bill that allowed a qualified retired \nor current law enforcement officer to carry a concealed firearm across \nState lines. The Senate passed our bill by unanimous consent, which was \nsigned into law in July 2004. Passage of the Law Enforcement Safety \nOfficers Act was a resounding vote of confidence in the men and women \nwho serve their communities as protectors of the peace, and their \nNation as the first line of defense in any emergency.\n  But since enactment of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, it \nhas become clear that qualified retired officers have been subject to \nvarying and complex certification procedures from State to State. In \nmany cases, differing interpretations have complicated the \nimplementation of the law, and retired officers have experienced \nsignificant frustration in getting certified to lawfully carry a \nfirearm.\n  With the input of the law enforcement community, this bill proposes \nmodest amendments to streamline the current law, which will give \nretired officers more flexibility in obtaining certification, and \nprovides room for the variability in certification standards among the \nseveral States. For example, where a State has not set active duty \nstandards, the retired officer can be certified pursuant to the \nstandards set by any law enforcement agency in the State.\n  In addition to these adjustments, the bill also makes clear that \nAmtrak officers, along with officers of the Executive branch of the \nFederal Government, are covered by the law. The bill also reduces from \n15 to 10 the years of service required for a retired officer to qualify \nunder the law. Though these changes broaden the reach of the law, the \nrequirements for eligibility still involve a significant term of \nservice for a retired officer to qualify, and a demonstrated commitment \nto law enforcement.\n  This bill makes sensible improvements to existing law by providing \nthe flexibility needed to permit qualified retired law enforcement \nofficers to carry concealed firearms in a legal and responsible manner.\n  With the enactment of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, \nCongress and the President also recognized that law enforcement \nofficers are never ``off-duty.'' The dedicated public servants who are \ntrained to uphold the law and keep the peace deserve our support not \njust in their professional lives, but also when they go off-duty or \ninto retirement. Convicted criminals often have long and exacting \nmemories, and to the extent we can, we must aid these public servants \nwith the tools they need to keep themselves and their families safe. \nBecause one thing we know for sure is that a law enforcement officer is \na target, whether in uniform or out, and whether active or retired. We \nalso act in our own interest when we help law enforcement officers with \nthe ability to answer the call of duty wherever they may be. Society's \ntrust in the men and women who serve should include the faith that the \nresponsibilities we entrust to them do not disappear once State lines \nare crossed.\n  In 2004, Congress listened carefully to the concerns of the law \nenforcement community and responded appropriately. Let us do so again \nwith these sensible improvements.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a United States-Poland parliamentary \nyouth exchange program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation urging \nthe Administration to develop a United States-Poland Parliamentary \nYouth Exchange Program. I am pleased that my colleague from Indiana, \nCongressman Pete Visclosky, has agreed to again introduce this \nimportant legislation in the House of Representatives. I appreciate his \nstrong leadership in our continued joint efforts in this and many other \nareas.\n  The purpose of this exchange program is to demonstrate to the youth \nof the United States and Poland the benefits of friendly cooperation \nbetween the U.S. and Poland based on common political and cultural \nvalues. I have long been an active supporter of the Congress-Bundestag \nExchange program and am hopeful that this new endeavor will make \nsimilarly important lasting contributions to the U.S.-Polish \nrelationship.\n  As a Rhodes Scholar, I had the opportunity to discover international \neducation at Pembroke College--my first trip outside of the United \nStates. The parameters of my imagination expanded enormously during \nthis time, as I gained a sense of how large the world was, how many \ntalented people there were, and how many opportunities one could \nembrace. Student exchange programs do more than benefit individual \nscholars and advance human knowledge. Such programs expand ties between \nnations, improve international commerce, encourage cooperative \nsolutions to global problems, prevent war, and give participants a \nchance to develop a sense of global service and responsibility.\n  Funding a great foreign exchange program is a sign of both national \npride and national humility. Implicit in such a program is the view \nthat people from other nations view one's country and educational \nsystem as a beacon of knowledge--as a place where international \nscholars would want to study and live. But it is also an admission that \na nation does not have all the answers--that our national understanding \nof the world is incomplete. It is an admission that we are just a part \nof a much larger world that has intellectual, scientific, and moral \nwisdom that we need to learn.\n  The United States and Poland have enjoyed close bilateral relations \nsince the end of the Cold War. Most recently, Poland has been a strong \nsupporter of efforts led by the United States to combat global \nterrorism, and has contributed troops to and led coalitions in both \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Poland also cooperates closely with the United \nStates on such issues as democratization, human rights, regional \ncooperation in Eastern Europe, and reform of the United Nations. As a \nmember of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the \nEuropean Union (EU), Poland has demonstrated its commitment to \ndemocratic values and is a role model in its region.\n  I believe that it is important to invest in the youth of the United \nStates and Poland in order to strengthen long-lasting ties between both \nsocieties. After receiving for many years international and U.S. \nfinancial assistance, Poland is now determined to invest its own \nresources toward funding a U.S.-Poland exchange program. To this end \nthe Polish Foreign Minister unambiguously stated that Poland welcomed \nthe opportunity to be an equal partner in funding important efforts.\n  Last year the Senate approved a similar version of this legislation \nby unanimous consent. I ask my colleagues to again support this \nresolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 378. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect \njudges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their family members, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was disappointed at the end of last \nCongress that, like so much other urgent business of the American \npeople left unattended, we did not pass a measure to improve court \nsecurity. We made some progress on this important issue when the Senate \npassed a consensus bipartisan court security bill. Unfortunately we \nwere unable to cross the finish line because the House Republican \nleadership did not take up this bill. And so that still eaves our \nNation's judges and their families without the vital protections that \nbill would have provided.\n  Today, I join with other Senators on both sides of the aisle to try \nagain. Along with the Majority Leader Senator Reid; the Judiciary \nCommittee's Ranking Member, Senator Specter; the Majority Whip, Senator \nDurbin; and Senators Kennedy, Schumer, Cornyn, Hatch and Collins, I \nintroduce the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, a consensus \nmeasure with bipartisan support nearly identical to the bill we passed \nin the Senate last December. House Judiciary Chairman Conyers is \nintroducing an identical measure in the House with bipartisan support. \nThis bi-cameral, bi-partisan introduction sends a strong message that \nwe intend finally to finish this difficult struggle and enact this bill \nthat should have been enacted months ago to increase protections for \nthe dedicated women and men throughout the Judiciary in this country.\n  This is an important issue, and one I plan to make a priority this \nCongress. I hope that we can have quick action on this bill to bring to \nfruition our efforts to provide increased security, an effort that \ngained new urgency after the tragedy that befell Judge Joan Lefkow of \nChicago. She is the Federal judge whose mother and husband were \nmurdered in their home. As we heard in her courageous testimony in May \n2005 before the Judiciary Committee, this tragedy provided a terrible \nreminder not only of the vulnerable position of our judges and their \nfamilies, but of the critical importance of protecting judges both \nwhere they work and where they and their families live. The shooting \nlast summer of a State judge in Nevada provided another terrible \nreminder of the vulnerable position of our Nation's State and Federal \njudges. We cannot tolerate or excuse or justify violence or the threat \nof violence against judges.\n  In a speech last year, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor criticized the \nuncivil tone of attacks on the courts, noting that they pose a danger \nto the very independence of the Federal judiciary. It is most \nunfortunate that some in this country have chosen to use dangerous and \nirresponsible rhetoric when talking about judges, comparing judges to \nterrorists and threatening judges with punishment for decisions they do \nnot like. This rhetoric can only foster unacceptable violence against \njudges and it must stop, for the sake of our judges and the \nindependence of the judiciary. Judicial fairness and independence are \nessential if we are to maintain our freedoms. Our independent judiciary \nis the envy of the rest of the world and a great source of our national \nstrength and resilience. Let no one say things that might bring about \nfurther threats against our judges. We ought to be protecting them \nphysically and institutionally.\n  When I last chaired the Judiciary Committee, one of my first efforts \nwas pushing for passage of the Judicial Protection Act, which toughened \ncriminal penalties for assaults against judges and their families. In \norder to meet the continuing challenges of keeping the Federal \njudiciary safe, in the last Congress Chairman Specter and I introduced \nS. 1968, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2005.\n  The bill we are introducing today in the Senate and House is a \nconsensus bipartisan bill. I hope that quick action and passage of this \nbill can serve as a model for what we can achieve with bipartisan \ncooperation in the 110th Congress. Its core provisions, which \npreviously passed the Senate not only last December, but also in June \nas part of the managers' package of the ``John Warner National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007,'' S. 2766, come the Court \nSecurity Improvement Act of 2005.\n  The bill responds to the needs expressed by the Federal judiciary for \na\n\n[[Page S1063]]\n\ngreater voice in working with the United States Marshals Service to \ndetermine their security needs. It enacts new criminal penalties for \nthe misuse of restricted personal information to harm or threaten to \nharm Federal judges, their families or other individuals performing \nofficial duties. It enacts criminal penalties for threatening Federal \njudges and Federal law enforcement officials by the malicious filing of \nfalse liens, and provides increased protections for witnesses. The bill \nalso contains provisions making available to States new resources to \nimprove security for State and local court systems as well as providing \nadditional protections for law enforcement officers. I am pleased that \nthe bill includes an extension of life insurance benefits to \nbankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges.\n  Finally, the bill contains provisions that have passed the Senate \nseveral times extending and expanding to family members the authority \nof the Judicial Conference to redact certain information from a Federal \njudge's mandatory financial disclosure. This expired redaction \nauthority was used in circumstances in which the release of the \ninformation could endanger the filer or the filer's family. I hope that \nwe can reinstate and expand this much needed redaction authority.\n  These protections are crucial to the preservation of the independence \nof our Federal judiciary so that it can continue to serve as a bulwark \nprotecting individual rights and liberty. Our Nation's Founders knew \nthat without an independent judiciary to protect individual rights from \nthe political branches of government, those rights and privileges would \namount to nothing. It is the ultimate check and balance in our system \nof government in times of heated political rhetoric.\n  We owe it to our judges to better protect them and their families \nfrom violence and to ensure that they have the peace of mind necessary \nto do their vital and difficult jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 378\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

App.) is amended by striking ``2006'' and inserting \n     ``2011''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. An independent judiciary is essential to the proper \nadministration of justice. In order to maintain an independent \njudiciary, it is imperative that judges be protected from the threat of \nreprisal, so that fear does not influence their decisionmaking. This \nbill, which I am proud to cosponsor, is an opportunity to protect our \njudges and help guarantee their independence, and also protect the many \nother dedicated men and women who serve our judiciary and their \nfamilies.\n  In recent years, the need for increased judicial security has been \nhighlighted by a number of attacks. After an unfavorable trademark \nruling in Chicago, a disgruntled litigant murdered a Federal judge's \nhusband and mother in the judge's home. Two weeks later a State judge, \na court reporter, and a sheriff's deputy were killed in an Atlanta \ncourthouse. A year after that, death threats were made against U.S. \nSupreme Court Justices.\n  These attacks are not isolated incidents. On average, Federal judges \nreceive 700 threats a year; threats that are becoming increasingly \nserious. As these threats and attacks indicate, judges are not \ncurrently safe within the walls of our courts, nor are they safe in \ntheir homes. We cannot tolerate violence or the threat of violence \nagainst judges, court personnel, or their families. Violence against \nour judiciary represents an assault on our system of government.\n  By statute, the U.S. Marshals Service in the Department of Justice \nhas the primary responsibility for the security of the Federal \njudiciary. Currently, the Marshals Service is underfunded and \nunderstaffed. There is a lack of coordination and communication between \nthe Service and the Judicial Conference of the United States, the \nAdministrative Office of the United States Courts, and the Federal \nProtective Service in the Department of Homeland Security. As a result, \nthe Marshals Service struggles to keep up with the security needs of \nthe judiciary in this new high-risk age. There is no reason the system \nshould continue to be so vulnerable.\n  The legislation we are introducing will enhance judicial security in \nseveral respects. First, it would require the Marshals Service to \ncooperate and coordinate with the Judicial Conference on judicial \nsecurity on a continuing basis. This provision will give the judiciary \na needed voice in assessing their security needs. The Marshals Service \nwill receive additional funds to meet its responsibilities. It will \nhave the ability to accurately assess threats in a timely manner, \ncollect and share intelligence on threats among districts and \nrepresentatives of the FBI, and achieve appropriate staffing levels.\n  In addition, the legislation punishes those who intrude into the \npersonal lives of the judiciary and their families. It punishes those \nattempting to humiliate the judiciary or their families by recording a \nfalse lien or encumbrance against real or personal property and those \nwho post personal information about public officials or their families \nwith the intent to harm.\n  Equally important, the bill authorizes Federal grants to improve \nsecurity for State and local court systems. The problem of judicial \nsecurity is shared by all courts, State and Federal alike, and all \ncourts deserve the best possible security protections.\n  To maintain our freedoms as a democratic society, judicial fairness \nand independence are essential. Threats and acts of violence against \nthe judiciary are unacceptable. Its members must be fully protected. \nThis bipartisan and bicameral bill aids in that protection, and I am \nhonored to join my colleagues in urging that it be passed quickly by \nCongress and signed by the President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Levin, Mr. Leahy, \n        Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 381. A bill to establish a fact-finding Commission to extend the \nstudy of a prior Commission to investigate and determine facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the relocation, internment, and deportation \nto Axis countries of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December \n1941 through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \nUnited States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of \nJapanese Descent Act.\n  The story of U.S. citizens taken from their homes on the west coast \nand confined in camps is a story that was made known after a fact-\nfinding study by a Commission that Congress authorized in 1980. That \nstudy was followed by a formal apology by President Reagan and a bill \nfor reparations. Far less known, and indeed, I myself did not initially \nknow, is the story of Latin Americans of Japanese descent taken from \ntheir homes in Latin America, stripped of their passports, brought to \nthe U.S., and interned in American camps.\n  This is a story about the U.S. government's act of reaching its arm \nacross international borders, into a community that did not pose an \nimmediate threat to our Nation, in order to use them, devoid of \npassports or any other proof of citizenship, for hostage exchange with \nJapan. Between the years 1941 and 1945, our government, with the\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\nhelp of Latin American officials, arbitrarily arrested persons of \nJapanese descent from streets, homes, and workplaces. Approximately \n2,300 undocumented persons were brought to camp sites in the U.S., \nwhere they were held under armed watch, and then held in reserve for \nprisoner exchange. Those used in an exchange were sent to Japan, a \nforeign country that many had never set foot on since their ancestors' \nimmigration to Latin America.\n  Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American internees of \nJapanese descent were considered by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService as illegal entrants. By the end of the war, some Japanese Latin \nAmericans had been sent to Japan. Those who were not used in a prisoner \nexchange were cast out into a new and English-speaking country, and \nsubject to deportation proceedings. Some returned to Latin America. \nOthers remained in the U.S., where their Latin American country of \norigin refused their re-entry because they were unable to present a \npassport.\n  When I first learned of the wartime experiences of Japanese Latin \nAmericans, it seemed unbelievable, but indeed, it happened. It is a \npart of our national history, and it is a part of the living histories \nof the many families whose lives are forever tied to internment camps \nin our country.\n  The outline of this story was sketched out in a book published by the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians formed in \n1980. This Commission had set out to learn about Japanese Americans. \nTowards the close of their investigations, the Commissioners stumbled \nupon this extraordinary effort by the U.S. government to relocate, \nintern, and deport Japanese persons formerly living in Latin America. \nBecause this finding surfaced late in its study, the Commission was \nunable to fully uncover the facts, but found them significant enough to \ninclude in its published study, urging a deeper investigation.\n  I rise today to introduce the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \nInternment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act, which would \nestablish a fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the 1980 \nCommission. This Commission's task would be to determine facts \nsurrounding the U.S. government's actions in regards to Japanese Latin \nAmericans subject to a program of relocation, interment, and \ndeportation. I believe that examining this extraordinary program would \ngive finality to, and complete the account of Federal actions to detain \nand intern civilians of Japanese ancestry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Wartime \n     Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese \n     Descent Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on a preliminary study published in \n     December 1982 by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \n     Internment of Civilians, Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States--\n       (A) expanded its internment program and national security \n     investigations to conduct the program and investigations in \n     Latin America; and\n       (B) financed relocation to the United States, and \n     internment, of approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of \n     Japanese descent, for the purpose of exchanging the Latin \n     Americans of Japanese descent for United States citizens held \n     by Axis countries.\n       (2) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent from 13 Latin American countries were held \n     in the custody of the Department of State in internment camps \n     operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from \n     1941 through 1948.\n       (3) Those men, women, and children either--\n       (A) were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or indictment \n     by local police, and sent to the United States for \n     internment; or\n       (B) in some cases involving women and children, voluntarily \n     entered internment camps to remain with their arrested \n     husbands, fathers, and other male relatives.\n       (4) Passports held by individuals who were Latin Americans \n     of Japanese descent were routinely confiscated before the \n     individuals arrived in the United States, and the Department \n     of State ordered United States consuls in Latin American \n     countries to refuse to issue visas to the individuals prior \n     to departure.\n       (5) Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American \n     internees of Japanese descent were considered to be and \n     treated as illegal entrants by the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service. Thus, the internees became illegal \n     aliens in United States custody who were subject to \n     deportation proceedings for immediate removal from the United \n     States. In some cases, Latin American internees of Japanese \n     descent were deported to Axis countries to enable the United \n     States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (6) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent were relocated from their homes in Latin \n     America, detained in internment camps in the United States, \n     and in some cases, deported to Axis countries to enable the \n     United States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (7) The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians studied Federal actions conducted pursuant to \n     Executive Order 9066 (relating to authorizing the Secretary \n     of War to prescribe military areas). Although the United \n     States program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese \n     descent was not conducted pursuant to Executive Order 9066, \n     an examination of that extraordinary program is necessary to \n     establish a complete account of Federal actions to detain and \n     intern civilians of enemy or foreign nationality, \n     particularly of Japanese descent. Although historical \n     documents relating to the program exist in distant archives, \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians did not research those documents.\n       (8) Latin American internees of Japanese descent were a \n     group not covered by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.), which formally apologized and \n     provided compensation payments to former Japanese Americans \n     interned pursuant to Executive Order 9066.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the Commission \n     on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to \n     investigate and determine facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the relocation, internment, and deportation to Axis countries \n     of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December 1941 \n     through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \n     United States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, if any, \n     based on preliminary findings by the original Commission and \n     new discoveries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nState family support grant program to end the practice of parents \ngiving legal custody of their seriously emotionally disturbed children \nto State agencies for the purpose of obtaining mental health services \nfor those children; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Harkin, Kennedy, Coleman, Pryor, Cantwell, Durbin, Mikulski, \nBingaman, Lautenberg and Kerry, in introducing the ``Keeping Families \nTogether Act.'' This legislation is intended to reduce the barriers to \ncare for children with serious mental illness so that their parents are \nno longer forced to give up custody solely for the purpose of securing \nmental health treatment.\n  Serious mental illness afflicts millions of our Nation's children and \nadolescents. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of American \nchildren under the age of 17 suffer from a mental, emotional or \nbehavioral illness. What I find most disturbing, however, is the fact \nthat two-thirds of all young people who need mental health treatment \nare not getting it.\n  Behind each of these statistics is a family that is struggling to do \nthe best it can to help a son or daughter with serious mental health \nneeds to be just like every other kid--to develop friendships, to do \nwell in school, and to get along with their siblings and other family \nmembers. These children are almost always involved with more than one \nsocial service agency, including the mental health, special education, \nchild welfare, and juvenile justice systems. Yet no one agency, at \neither the State or the Federal level, is clearly responsible or \naccountable for helping these children and their families.\n  My interest in this issue was triggered by a compelling series of \nstories by Barbara Walsh in the Portland Press Herald which detailed \nthe obstacles that many Maine families have faced in getting \ndesperately needed mental health services for their children. Too many \nfamilies in Maine and elsewhere have been forced to make wrenching \ndecisions when they have been advised that the only way to get the care \nthat their children so desperately need is to relinquish custody and \nplace them in either the child welfare or juvenile justice system.\n  When a child has a serious physical health problem like diabetes or a \nheart condition, the family turns to their doctor. When the family \nincludes a child with a serious mental illness, it is often forced to \ngo to the child welfare or juvenile justice system to secure treatment.\n  Yet neither system is intended to serve children with serious mental \nillness. Child welfare systems are designed to protect children who \nhave been abused or neglected. Juvenile justice systems are designed to \nrehabilitate children who have committed criminal or delinquent acts. \nWhile neither of these systems is equipped to care for a child with a \nserious mental illness, in far too many cases, there is nowhere else \nfor the family to turn.\n  In some extreme cases, families feel forced to file charges against \ntheir child or to declare that they have abused or neglected them in \norder to get the care that they need. As one family advocate observed, \n``Beat `em up, lock `em up, or give `em up,'' characterizes the choices \nthat some families face in their efforts to get help for their \nchildren's mental illness.\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\n  In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report \nthat I requested with Representatives Pete Stark and Patrick Kennedy \nthat found that, in 2001, parents placed more than 12,700 children into \nthe child welfare or juvenile justice systems so that these children \ncould receive mental health services. This likely is just the tip of \nthe iceberg, since 32 States--including five States with the largest \npopulations of children--did not provide the GAO with any data.\n  Other studies indicate that the problem is even more pervasive. A \n1999 survey by the National Alliance on Mental Illness found that 23 \npercent--or one in four of the parents surveyed--had been told by \npublic officials that they needed to relinquish custody of their \nchildren to get care, and that one in five of these families had done \nso.\n  Some States have passed laws to limit custody or prohibit custody \nrelinquishment. Simply banning the practice is not a solution, however, \nsince it can leave children with mental illness and their families \nwithout services and care. Custody relinquishment is merely a symptom \nof the much larger problem, which is the lack of available, affordable \nand appropriate mental health services and support systems for these \nchildren and their families.\n  In 2003 and 2004, I chaired a series of hearings in the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee to examine this issue \nfurther. We heard compelling testimony from mothers who told us that \nthey were advised that the only way to get the intensive care and \nservices that their children needed was to relinquish custody and place \nthem in the child welfare or juvenile justice system. This is a \nwrenching decision that no family should be forced to make. No parent \nshould have to give up custody of his or her child just to get the \nservices that the child needs.\n  The mothers also described the barriers they faced in getting care \nfor their children. They told us about the limitations in both public \nand private insurance coverage. They also talked about the lack of \ncoordination and communication among the various agencies and programs \nthat service children with mental health needs. One parent, desperate \nfor help for her twin boys, searched for two years until she finally \nlocated a program--which she characterized as ``the best kept secret in \nIllinois''--that was able to help.\n  Parents should not be bounced from agency to agency, knocking on \nevery door they come to, in the hope that they will happen upon someone \nwho has an answer. It simply should not be such a struggle for parents \nto get services and treatment for their children.\n  We also need to question what happens to these children when they are \nturned over to the child welfare or juvenile justice authorities. I \nreleased a report in 2004 with Congressman Henry Waxman that found that \nall too often they are simply left to languish in juvenile detention \ncenters, which are ill-equipped to meet their needs, while they wait \nfor scarce mental health services.\n  Our report, which was based on a national survey of juvenile \ndetention centers, found that the use of juvenile detention facilities \nto ``warehouse'' children with mental disorders is a serious national \nproblem. It found that, over a six month period, nearly 15,000 young \npeople--roughly seven percent of all of the children in the centers \nsurveyed--were detained solely because they were waiting for mental \nhealth services outside the juvenile justice system. Many were held \nwithout any charges pending against them, and the young people \nincarcerated unnecessarily while waiting for treatment were as young as \nseven years old. Finally, the report estimated that juvenile detention \nfacilities are spending an estimated $100 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney each year simply to warehouse children and teenagers while they \nare waiting for mental health services.\n\n  The Keeping Families Together Act, which we are introducing today, \nwill help to improve access to mental health services and assist states \nin eliminating the practice of parents relinquishing custody of their \nchildren solely for the purpose of securing treatment.\n  The legislation authorizes $100 million over six years for \ncompetitive grants to states to create an infrastructure to support and \nsustain statewide systems of care to serve children who are in custody \nor at risk of entering custody of the State for the purpose of \nreceiving mental health services. States already dedicate significant \ndollars to serve children in state custody. These Family Support Grants \nwould help states to serve children more effectively and efficiently, \nwhile keeping them at home with their families.\n  In addition, the legislation calls for the creation of a federal \ninteragency task force to examine mental health issues in the child \nwelfare and juvenile justice systems and the role of those agencies in \npromoting access by children and youth to needed mental health \nservices. The task force would also be charged with monitoring the \nFamily Support grants, making recommendations to Congress on how to \nimprove mental health services, and fostering interagency cooperation \nand removing interagency barriers that contribute to the problem of \ncustody relinquishment.\n  The Keeping Families Together Act takes a critical step forward to \nmeeting the needs of children with serious mental or emotional \ndisorders. Our legislation has been endorsed by a broad coalition of \nmental health and children's groups, including the National Alliance on \nMental Illness, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Mental Health \nAmerica, the American Psychological Association, and the American \nPsychiatric Association. I ask unanimous consent that letters from \nthese organizations endorsing the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The Keeping Families Together Act will help to reduce the barriers to \ncare for children with serious mental illness, and I urge our \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Bazelon Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Susan Collins\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Judge David L. Bazelon Center for \n     Mental Health Law--the leading national legal-advocacy \n     organization representing children and adults with mental \n     disabilities who primarily rely on the public mental health \n     system for treatment--is pleased to support the Keeping \n     Families Together Act and commends your leadership on this \n     important legislation.\n       A lack of access to appropriate mental health services and \n     supports for children in both the private and public sectors \n     is a significant barrier families across the country face \n     when they are confronted with the horrific problem of custody \n     relinquishment of a child solely to access necessary menta1 \n     health treatment. Custody relinquishment for these purposes \n     should not and does not need to happen. It is a symptom of a \n     flawed children's mental health system that is in crisis.\n       The Keeping Families Together Act serves to address this \n     fragmented system by assisting states in developing and \n     expanding capacity to serve children with severe mental and \n     emotional disorders so families have options when their child \n     is in need of mental health care. With studies showing \n     approximately two-thirds of children and adolescents are not \n     receiving the mental health services they need, we welcome \n     this vital legislation. Promoting early intervention, \n     ensuring access to wide range of services and supports and \n     helping to maintain family integrity are achievable goals \n     supported by your legislation--goals we are confident will \n     help reduce these appalling statistics.\n       The Bazelon Center looks forward to working closely with \n     you and your staff throughout the legislative process to \n     enact the Keeping Families Together Act. Thank you for your \n     commitment to the health and mental health needs of our most \n     vulnerable chi1dren.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Robert Bernstein, Ph.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Psychological Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 145,000 members and \n     affiliates of the American Psychological Association (APA), I \n     am writing in support of the Keeping Families Together Act. \n     This vital legislation would establish a state family support \n     grant program to end the practice of parents needing to \n     relinquish legal custody of their children to state agencies \n     for the sole purpose of obtaining mental health services for \n     their children.\n       As you know, the custody relinquishment problem stems from \n     a paradox that exists in many states. Private healthcare \n     plans frequently do not cover many services needed by \n     children with physical, mental, or developmental \n     disabilities. As a result, many parents turn to the child \n     welfare or juvenile justice system for assistance. Neither of \n     these\n\n[[Page S1069]]\n\n     systems is intended nor equipped to care for a child with a \n     serious mental health problem. Yet, as the law currently \n     exists in many states, parents must relinquish custody to \n     receive otherwise unaffordable specialized care for their \n     children. Ironically, these children are frequently placed \n     with foster families that receive full funding for the \n     children's care, while competent parents lose contact with, \n     influence over and decision making authority for their \n     children. Custody relinquishment of a child solely so he or \n     she may access necessary mental health services is a national \n     tragedy.\n       The Keeping Families Together Act lays a strong foundation \n     for needed reforms by promoting access to needed services and \n     reducing fragmentation in service delivery. Some of the \n     legislation's main provisions include providing grants to \n     states to establish interagency systems of care for children \n     and adolescents with serious mental health and emotional \n     problems. Additionally, this legislation will establish a \n     federal interagency task force to examine mental health \n     issues in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.\n       APA members are actively engaged in research and practice \n     initiatives related to helping children and their families \n     receive the mental health services they need. Please view APA \n     as a resource to you for empirically-based research on child \n     mental health matters when considering the enactment of the \n     Keeping Families Together Act.\n       In closing, we would like to thank you once again for your \n     efforts in developing the Keeping Families Together Act and \n     to offer our association's assistance in furthering passage \n     of this vital legislation. Please contact Annie Toro of our \n     Public Policy Office if you would like any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      Gwendolyn Puryear Keita,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Public Interest Directorate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Mental Health America,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA., January 22, 2007.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pete Stark,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim Ramstad,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Harkin and Representatives \n     Ramstad and Stark: On behalf of Mental Health America \n     (formerly the National Mental Health Association), I am \n     writing to commend you for reintroducing the Keeping Families \n     Together Act in the 110th Congress.\n       As you know, thousands of families every year are forced to \n     give up custody of their children to the state in order to \n     secure vitally necessary mental health services. This custody \n     relinquishment tears families apart, is devastating for \n     parents and caregivers, and leaves children feeling abandoned \n     in their hour of greatest need. Parents are often forced to \n     take this tragic step because their private health care \n     coverage imposes discriminatory and restrictive caps on \n     mental health care or their insurers simply refuse to cover \n     the required treatment. The majority of these families are \n     not eligible for Medicaid coverage because of their income. \n     Furthermore, there is a widespread lack of appropriate mental \n     health services for children and adolescents in most states \n     and communities which forces families to make desperate \n     choices.\n       Your legislation promises to improve access to the services \n     these families need to stay together by providing grants to \n     states to establish interagency systems of care for children \n     and adolescents with serious mental disorders. These grants \n     will allow states to build more efficient and effective \n     mental health systems for children and families. Your bill \n     also calls for the creation of a federal interagency task \n     force to examine mental health issues in the child welfare \n     and juvenile justice systems. This analysis is greatly needed \n     because, as you know, children who become wards of the state \n     in order to receive mental health services are generally \n     placed in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems even \n     though neither system is designed or intended to serve as a \n     mental health provider.\n       No family in our nation should ever be asked to make the \n     heart-wrenching decision to give up parental rights of their \n     seriously ill child in exchange for mental health treatment. \n     We welcome this legislation as a critical step toward ending \n     custody relinquishment and toward delivering more cost \n     effective and appropriate services for children and families.\n       Once again, we thank you for your leadership and commitment \n     to ending this practice and for continuing to stand up for \n     children and families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            David L. Shern, Ph.D.,\n     President and CEO, Mental Health America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Alliance on\n\n\n                                               Mental Illness,\n\n                                  Arlington, VA, January 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Harkin: On behalf of the 210,000 \n     members and 1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance on \n     Mental Illness, NAMI, I am writing to offer our strong \n     support for the Keeping Families Together Act, KFTA. As the \n     nation's largest organization representing families of \n     children and adolescents living with mental illness, NAMI is \n     proud to offer our support for this important legislation.\n       The KFTA represents a major step forward in helping to end \n     a national scandal that has lingered too long in states \n     throughout our nation. As you know, thousands of families \n     every year are forced to give up custody of a child to the \n     state in order to secure vitally necessary mental illness \n     treatment and support services. This unthinkable practice \n     tears families apart, devastates parents and caregivers and \n     leaves children feeling abandoned in their hour of greatest \n     need.\n       This practice occurs because most families have \n     discriminatory and restrictive caps on their private mental \n     health coverage or insurers fail to cover the required \n     treatment. The majority of these families are not eligible \n     for Medicaid coverage because of their income and assets. \n     This truly unfortunate practice also exists because of the \n     lack of appropriate mental health services in many states and \n     communities for children and adolescents with mental \n     disorders. This was well documented in President Bush's 2003 \n     New Freedom Initiative Mental Health Commission report.\n       Your legislation would help end this growing crisis by \n     providing grants to states to establish interagency systems \n     of care for children and adolescents with serious mental \n     disorders. These grants would allow states to build more \n     efficient and effective mental health systems for children \n     and families. It would also. eliminate barriers to home and \n     community-based care for children by enabling a greater \n     number of children to receive mental health services under \n     the Section 1915(c) Medicaid home- and community-based \n     waiver. The waiver promises to make appropriate services \n     available to children in their homes and communities and \n     close to their loved ones at a considerable cost savings over \n     providing those services in an institutional setting.\n       The KFTA also creates a federal interagency task force to \n     examine how the child welfare and juvenile justice systems \n     serve children and adolescents with mental illness. A GAO \n     report released in April 2003 showed that when parents give \n     up custody of their child to secure mental health services, \n     those children are placed in one of these two systems--\n     neither of which is designed to be a mental health service \n     agency.\n       NAMI feels strongly that no family should ever be asked to \n     make the heart-wrenching decision to give up parental rights \n     of their seriously ill child in exchange for mental health \n     treatment and services. Thank you for your leadership and \n     commitment to ending this practice and for continuing to \n     stand up for children, families and common sense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Michael J. Fitzpatrick, M.S.W.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am honored to join with the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, in introducing \nthe Keeping Families Together Act. As a long-time advocate for people \nwith disabilities, I believe that this legislation represents an \nimportant step forward in ensuring the health and wellbeing of our \nchildren, in particular those with mental illness.\n  One in five children has a diagnosable mental disorder, and one in \nten children has a mental disorder serious enough to hinder their \nfunctioning at school, at the home, and in their communities. \nRegrettably, two-thirds of children in this latter group do not receive \nthe treatment they need. Without treatment, mental illness negatively \naffects all areas of children's lives, and it can have dire \nconsequences for their future, including their ability to become \nproductive members of society. Children with mental health problems are \nat higher risk of chronic illness, academic difficulties and school \ndiscipline problems, delinquency, incarceration, and suicide.\n  The good news is that 90 percent of all mental health disorders are \ntreatable by therapy and medication. Yet parents face a multitude of \nobstacles and challenges in finding appropriate services for a child \nwith serious mental illness. Often, they find that their private \ninsurance will not pay for necessary mental health services, or that \nthey do not qualify for Medicaid. In their efforts to secure effective \ntreatment, many parents exhaust their own financial resources and find \nthat they have nowhere else to turn. Tragically, many dedicated, loving \nparents reach the point where they believe that they have no other \noption but to relinquish custody of their child to the State in order \nto access appropriate services. These out-of-home placements can be \ntraumatic for children, and profoundly disruptive and heart-breaking \nfor families that are already in crisis.\n  Making matters worse, state systems are often poorly equipped to \nserve the needs of these children. Many children end up being placed in \nexpensive residential institutions, rather than less\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\ncostly home- and community-based services. Our juvenile justice system \nis overwhelmed by young people in need of mental health services. A \ncongressional report authored by Senator Collins and Representative \nHenry Waxman of California suggests that, every night, nearly 2,000 \nyouths are placed in juvenile detention facilities not because they are \ncriminals but because they do not have access to necessary mental \nhealth services. This results in a $100 million bill to the taxpayers. \nNot only is this a serious misuse of public funds, it is a tragic \ninjustice to the children and families involved. We simply cannot allow \nchildren to languish in detention facilities when they are really in \nneed of mental health treatment.\n  The Keeping Families Together Act lays a foundation for securing \nbetter access to mental health services for children. Consistent with \nrecommendations by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental \nHealth, this legislation encourages interagency coordination in the \nprovision of mental health services for children. The bill gives States \nincentives to remedy the fragmentation that now exists among child \nwelfare, education, juvenile justice, and mental health agencies \nresponsible for helping children. It ensures that States will improve \naccess to mental health services and eliminate the practice of parents' \nrelinquishing custody of their children solely for the purpose of \nsecuring mental health treatment. Our bill also promotes sustainable \nfinancing by requiring States to provide graduated matching funds.\n  In sum, by providing a sustainable, coordinated system of mental \nhealth care, children will be able to receive needed services within a \nstable, loving home environment. Families will be able to stay \ntogether.\n  In a decent, humane society, every family should have access to \nappropriate mental health services for their children. Parents should \nnot have to surrender a child to the State as the price for obtaining \naccess to mental health treatment. The Keeping Families Together Act \noffers a better way. It allows children with mental disorders to stay \nwhere they belong--in the custody and care of their loving family. I \njoin with Senator Collins in urging our colleagues to support this \nurgent and important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 383. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend the \nperiod of eligibility for health care for combat service in the Persian \nGulf War or future hostilities from 2 years to 5 years after discharge \nor release; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I today introduce legislation that, if \nenacted, will help ensure that returning servicemembers receive the \ncare they need from VA in the 5 years immediately following detachment \nor deactivation, without having to meet strict eligibility rules. The \nchanges this legislation would make will contribute to the ``seamless'' \ntransition of military personnel from active duty to veteran status. \nThis legislation is identical to the bill I introduced last Congress.\n  Today, any active duty servicemember who is discharged or separated \nfrom active duty following deployment to a theater of combat--including \nReservists or Guard who stand down but remain on reserve duty--is \neligible for VA health care for a 2-year period. In my view, it is \nvital that this period be extended to 5 years to provide a more \nappropriate window of time for servicemembers to access VA care. Since \nthe start of OEF and OIF, an average of 157,800 servicemembers have \nbeen discharged or deactivated per year. This legislation will help the \nexisting 315,600 veterans who have been inactive for more than 2 years \nbut fewer than 5, and thousands more in the future.\n  Following the first Persian Gulf War, and partially in response to \nthe unexplained illnesses among those who served, Congress enacted the \nVeterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998. This law gave 2 years of \npriority eligibility for health care to any veteran who served in a \ntheater of combat following discharge or deactivation from active duty. \nThe original intent was to ensure health care for servicemembers after \ntheir active duty health care benefits ended. It is now clear this the \n2 year window of eligibility is insufficient.\n  There are two primary reasons to amend the law to allow a greater \nperiod of eligibility: protection from budget cuts and access to care \nfor conditions, including mental health conditions, that may not be \nreadily apparent when a servicemember first leaves active duty. In \nrecent years, funding for VA health care has been delayed or cut by the \nlegislative and appropriations processes, leading to delayed or denied \ncare to those veterans with lower priority for VA care. Those veterans \nwho have served in a theater of combat operations deserve to have their \nhealth care guaranteed for at least the first 5 years immediately \nfollowing their discharge or detachment.\n  With regard to mental health, 2 years is often insufficient time for \nsymptoms related to PTSD and other mental illnesses to manifest. In \nmany cases, it takes years for such symptoms to present themselves, and \nmany servicemembers do not immediately seek care. Experts predict that \nup to 30 percent of OEF/OIF servicemembers will need some type of \nreadjustment services. Five years would provide a bigger window to \naddress these risks. We face a growing group of recently discharged \nveterans, and this legislation will help smooth their transition to \ncivilian life.\n  One final reason, that I believe this legislation is necessary, is \nthat extending the window of eligibility for VA health care services \nmay also serve to prevent homelessness among veterans. We all know that \nveterans represent a disproportionate segment of the homeless \npopulation, and that is a national tragedy. While we continue to battle \nhomelessness among older veterans from Vietnam and other conflicts, we \nmust do all we can to ensure that none of the new veterans returning \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan fall through the cracks. Providing more time \nfor them to access VA's services is a key part of that effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, as I believe it is \ntruly a way to honor the service of our men and women in uniform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 384. A bill to provide pay protection for members of the Reserve \nand the National Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today there are 91,555 members of the \nNational Guard and our Reserve armed forces serving bravely in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and any other part of the world our country calls them to \nserve. The President is sending an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq in \none final push to bring stability to that country. Regardless of what \nwe think about this plan, Americans stand by our troops. They have the \nbest equipment and training for their mission and we would never deny \nthem the support they need. But back at home, there is still a great \ndeal that we can do to support our guard and reserves families.\n  When guardsmen and reservists are deployed they leave their families, \ntheir jobs, and their communities behind, causing tremendous stress on \nthe home front and in the workplace. Families often lose the main bread \nwinner when a citizen soldier gets deployed. They may have trouble \npaying bills, the rent, the mortgage, or buying medicine for their \nchildren.\n  The reason these families cannot make ends meet is because for \nGuardsmen and Reservists military pay is often less than civilian pay. \nWe call that the ``pay gap.'' According to the most recent Status \nForces Survey of Reserve Components, 51 percent of our citizen soldiers \ntake a pay cut when they get deployed and 11 percent of them lose more \nthan $2,500 per month.\n  To help provide relief from the pay gap for our Guard and Reserve, I \nam pleased to introduce, along with Senators Durbin, Graham and Kerry, \nthe Helping Our Patriotic Employers at Helping our Military Employees \nAct of 2007. I call the bill by its nickname: HOPE at HOME. Our guard \nand reserve families have enough to worry about when a loved one gets \ncalled away, the least we can do is relieve some of their financial \nworry by encouraging employers to make up the pay gap. Let me describe \nfor my colleagues how this legislation works.\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\n  HOPE at HOME will give a 50 percent tax credit to the thousands of \nemployers around the country who have taken the patriotic step of \ncontinuing to pay the salary of their guard and reservists employees \nwho have been called to active duty. There are literally thousands of \nemployers out there who already take this noble step--they do it \nvoluntarily, selflessly and at great sacrifice. The HOPE at HOME Act \nhonors that sacrifice.\n  HOPE at HOME will also give companies that cannot afford to make up \nthe pay-gap an incentive to do so. One survey found that only 173 of \nthe Fortune 500 companies make up the pay gap. If the wealthiest \ncompanies cannot afford to help their active duty employees, imagine \nhow difficult this is for smaller companies. HOPE at HOME will allow \ncompanies large and small to do the patriotic thing and reward those \nemployees who are serving to keep us all free.\n  HOPE at HOME will also give small patriotic employers additional tax \nrelief if they need to hire a worker to temporarily replace the active \nduty Guardsmen or Reservist. In addition, the bill clarifies the tax \ntreatment of any pay-gap payments to make income tax filing easier for \nour Guard and Reservists.\n\n  I mentioned that thousands of employers make up the pay-gap for their \nemployees. There is one employer, however, and it happens to be the \nNation's largest, that does not make up the pay gap: Uncle Sam. The \nFederal Government, which should set the bar for patriotism in our \ncountry, does not do its part to help our citizen soldiers. We cannot \nask the private sector to do more than they are doing if the Federal \ngovernment is not willing to step up and do its part for our military \nmen and women.\n  Today our Nation relies on the Guard and Reserve to meet our armed \nforces needs more than at any other time in our history. At times in \nthe war on terror, 40 percent of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwere citizen soldiers, if not more. Many of them performed multiple \ntours of duty or found their duties extended.\n  All of the experts tell us that our need for our Guard and Reserve \ntroops will only get greater. During the Cold War, end strength of the \nU.S. military force never dropped below 2.0 million personnel and \npeaked at over 3.5 million during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. From \n1989 to 1999, end strength dropped steadily from 2.1 million to 1.4 \nmillion, where it has remained. Our ground forces are stretched thin \nand the number of deployments has increased by over 300 percent. The \nGuard and Reserve have made it possible to meet these challenges. We \nstill find ourselves stretched thin, but without the Guard and Reserve \nwe would never be able to meet our obligation as guardians of freedom \nin the World.\n  But this over-reliance on the Guard and Reserve is starting to have a \ntoll on our ability to recruit and retain these men and women. The top \nreasons for leaving the Guard and Reserve, according to the Status of \nForces Survey of Reserve Components, are family stress, the number and \nlengths of deployments, income loss, and conflict with civilian \nemployment.\n  HOPE at HOME recognizes that a soldier who is worrying about how his \nor her family is paying the bills is not focusing on the mission at \nhand. A soldier who is worrying about whether the family is paying the \nrent, is not going to reenlist. And every time one of our soldiers \nleaves, our nation loses the experience and service of a highly \ntrained, capable professional. We need to make every effort to keep our \ncitizen soldiers in service to their country. HOPE at HOME is a first \nstep to addressing our military's larger recruitment and retention \nissues.\n  During the Cold War we built our strength on having the biggest, best \nequipped standing army in the World. Now our military gathers its \nstrength from a large reserve of qualified men and women in the Guard \nand Reserve who are ready to fight at a moment's call. We will lose \nthat strength if we do not give our guardsmen and Reservists and their \nfamilies HOPE at HOME.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in giving our Guard and Reserve \nHOPE at HOME Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith, \n        and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 385. A bill to improve the interoperability of emergency \ncommunications equipment; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to an \nimportant issue that the Congress has not adequately addressed since \nthe painful events of September 11, 2001.\n  That issue is the inability of our first responders to speak to each \nother, a problem especially troubling during an emergency, when the \nability to quickly and effectively communicate saves lives.\n  This is why I, with the cosponsorship of my colleagues, Senators \nStevens, Kerry, Smith and Snowe, are introducing the Interoperable \nEmergency Communications Act.\n  After September 11, 2001, we heard heartbreaking stories of \nfirefighters and police officers who went into harm's way because they \nlacked adequate information. These brave men and women were unable to \nreach victims because their systems could not communicate with one \nanother.\n  At that time, the Congress began devoting greater attention to why \nmany of our first responders lacked this ability to communicate with \neach other in the field. We asked what it would take to ensure \ncommunications equipment and facilities could withstand a natural \ndisaster. We asked which equipment would be worthy of our investment.\n  Then Hurricane Katrina struck in August, 2006, and we found that our \nfirst responders faced the same communications failures. This is an \nunnecessary frustration that prevents our first responders from \neffectively doing their jobs.\n  Our bill provides needed direction to the National Telecommunications \nand Information Administration (NTIA) regarding its administration of \nthe $1 billion grant program for interoperable communications systems \nfor first responders, which was created by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee early last year. It will be funded by money from the Digital \nTransition and Public Safety Fund and administered by the NTIA.\n  The bill designates grants for regional or statewide communications \nsystems that will allow first responders to talk to one another during \nan emergency. It also sets aside funding for a technology reserve for \nimmediate deployment of communications equipment in the event of an \nemergency or disaster.\n  To ensure a fair distribution of funds, the money will be distributed \nin accordance with guidelines outlined in the Patriot Act to ensure a \nfair distribution of funds, and grant allocations will be prioritized \nbased on an ``all hazards'' approach that will take into account threat \nand risk factors associated with natural disasters--such as hurricanes, \ntsunamis, earthquakes, and tornadoes--as well as risks associated with \nterrorist attacks.\n  Every day we hear about potential threats against our Nation and it \nwill not be long until we are again in the midst of hurricane season. I \nhope that history will not repeat itself and that the Congress can act \nquickly in directing the NTIA to give our first responders the tools \nthey need to effectively do their jobs. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to require a higher volume \nof renewable fuel derived from cellulosic biomass, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the connection \nbetween energy production and agriculture. Agriculture and energy \npolicy are converging and unlike anytime in the past, farmers and \nranchers are producing food, fiber, and fuel. As the country recognizes \nthe danger of relying on imported oil, we need to develop an energy \npolicy that is aggressive while at the same time thoughtful. Renewable \nfuels like ethanol and biodiesel are not the total solution to our \nproblems, but they can help reduce our dependence on imported oil from \nunstable regions of the world.\n  In 2005, the Congress passed, and President Bush signed, the Energy \nPolicy Act that established the Renewable Fuel Standard, RFS. The RFS \nrequires minimum volumes of renewable fuels be used in America's motor \nfuels market annually, from 4 billion gallons in 2006 to 7.5 billion in \n2012. On January 1, 2006, the Renewable Fuel Standard went into effect \nand since then, the United States has used more than 5 billion gallons \nof ethanol, outpacing RFS requirements by more than 25 percent. \nAccording to the Renewable Fuels Association, in the next 18 months the \nindustry will add nearly 6 billion gallons of new production capacity. \nIn short, in 2008, new capacity will exceed the minimum level as called \nfor in the RFS.\n  This progress is astounding. However, the expansion has not come \nwithout some cost to the rest of the agriculture sector. For the first \ntime in memory corn prices increased during the 2006 harvest season and \nexceeded a critical threshold of $4 per bushel on the Chicago Board of \nTrade and continue to do so.\n  If corn prices continue to set new highs over the next year, the \nbroiler industry in my home State of Georgia and across the Southeast \nwill come under increasing pressure. I fear continued price spikes will \nforce some producers out of business. This is not unique to the poultry \nindustry, but will also impact swine and cattle operations across the \ncountry as ethanol outbids livestock for corn.\n  We find ourselves in the position of encouraging an industry that \ndirectly competes with another that is important in all our States, and \nI hope the end result is not policy that encourages livestock operators \nto further integrate and consolidate. We need to continue to support \nthe biofuels sector, but also do it in a way that has the least \ndisruption on existing markets as possible.\n  For this reason, I am introducing the Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive \nAct of 2007. This act builds upon the success of the RFS and increases \nthe target from 7.5 billion gallons in 2012 to 30 billion gallons in \n2030. Central to the bill is a set-aside that will help commercialize \ncellulosic ethanol much faster than under current law. This is \nimportant in order to ensure Federal policy does not erode the \nprofitability of the U.S. livestock sector by encouraging additional \ncompetition for available corn. The bill meets the challenge set forth \nby President Bush last night and mirrors the renewable fuel targets in \nhis proposal.\n  Furthermore, the legislation promotes regional diversity in the \nproduction of biofuels. This is important in order to spread the \nbenefits of renewable energy policy more evenly across all regions of \nthe country. By recommending a minimum level of consumption within a \nparticular region, we will provide a needed economic boost to rural \nareas, a new income stream for farmers and ranchers and a further \nacceleration in the production of cellulosic ethanol from a diverse \nresource base ranging from wood chips in the Southeast to wheat straw \non the Great Plains.\n  Ever since the founding of our great country, farmers and ranchers \nhave been an integral part in growing the safest, most affordable food \nsupply in the world. Now we can build upon their success and we ask \nthem to help grow an abundant source of energy. I am confident they are \nup to the task and the Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive Act is an important \nstep to help promote this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 386\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, to many Americans, the word ``Vietnam'' has \nbecome a painful remainder of a bloody quagmire of a never-ending war \nwithout an exit strategy. Certainly, Vietnam is a reminder of failed \nleadership and two destroyed Presidencies. Like the Johnson and Nixon \nadministrations during the Vietnam era, when their war policies were \nattacked, the Bush administration wraps itself in the American flag and \noften engages in tactics of impugning not only the integrity but the \npatriotism of its critics. President Bush has even said those who \ncompared Iraq to Vietnam send the wrong message to our troops. Such a \ncomparison, he suggests, harms our troops.\n  I continue to be alarmed that the war in Iraq shows all the signs of \ndegenerating into an equally calamitous debacle as Vietnam. And that is \nthe point. The war in Vietnam lasted more than 10 years. It took more \nthan 58,000 American lives. That long, painful war could have been \navoided. Thousands of American lives could have been saved. The blood \nof thousands of American sons and daughters could have been saved. It \nneed not have been spilled. That is why references to Vietnam are being \nmade when talking about the war in Iraq. I make the comparison because \nI am furious, absolutely furious, that this Government, after the \nbitter and bloody experience of Vietnam, has failed to heed the lessons \nof Vietnam.\n  How could we have failed to consider the lessons of Vietnam before \nstumbling into Iraq? I didn't vote to go into Iraq. I said, hell, no, I \nwon't go. We are doing the wrong thing if we go into Iraq. Did they \nlisten? Did they hear? The American people have a right, the public has \na right, to ask this question.\n  As a Senator, I have an obligation both morally and politically to \nask that question. How could we not think about the error this country \nmade with respect to Vietnam before we invaded Iraq? The similarities \nwere obvious. In opposing the Iraq war resolution, which I did, I and \nothers expressed concern that the Iraq resolution was another Gulf of \nTonkin resolution and could well lead to another Vietnam. As to the \nTonkin Gulf resolution, S.J. Res. 46, I explained in this way:\n\n       . . . have several things in common. Congress is again \n     being asked to vote on the use of force without hard evidence \n     that the country poses an immediate threat to the national \n     security of the United States. We are being asked to vote on \n     a resolution authorizing the use of force in a hyped up, \n     politically charged atmosphere in an election year. Congress \n     is again being rushed into a judgment.\n\n  And I quoted Senator Wayne Morse, one of the two Senators who opposed \nthe Tonkin Gulf resolution, as he proclaimed:\n\n       The resolution will pass, and Senators who voted for it \n     will live to regret it.\n\n  How right he was.\n  Tragically, tragically, as the war in Iraq has progressed, the \nparallels with the Vietnam war continue to mount. We have learned that, \nonce again, the American people were led down the primrose path in \nrallying support for a costly war. Congress and the American people \nwere told about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Yes. They were \ntold about Saddam Hussein's connections to al-Qaida. They were told \nabout Iraq trying to purchase uranium from Africa.\n  The cost of the war was once estimated to be less then $100 billion. \nBut the bill is now rising ever closer to half a trillion dollars. As a \nresult, the National Journal pointed out, ``as with Vietnam, political \nsupport for [the war in] Iraq has proved to be fragile in part because \nit was secured by justification that has been discredited.''\n  In each of the two wars, American soldiers were placed in the \ntreacherously difficult situation of having to fight an uncertain, \nindistinguishable\n\n[[Page S1075]]\n\nenemy, never knowing friend, never knowing foe, until they started \nshooting. As in Vietnam, our soldiers are once again confronted with \nthe deadly situation of trying to ferret out insurgents in a population \nthat is willing--listen--a population that is willing to hide them.\n  In each war, we went in thinking of ourselves as liberators. We came \nto be seen by the people we were supposed to be liberating as the \ninvaders. In each war, where it was so necessary for us to win the \nhearts and minds of the people of the country, our presence there, \ninstead, alienated the people of the country and turned them against \nus. In each war, both the White House, yes, and the Pentagon, yes, \ngrossly and tragically underestimated the determination and the \nferocity of our opponents.\n  Bring them on, bring them on, President Bush chided the Iraqis and \nterrorists on July 2, 2003. Do you remember that? I do. He said ``bring \n'em on.''\n  In the time since he made that statement ``bring 'em on,'' we, the \nAmerican people, have lost more than 2,800 troops in that war.\n  Yes, ``bring 'em on.'' ``Bring 'em on.'' And so they brought them on. \nWe have lost more than 2,800 troops in that war. As of today, 3,062--\nget that--3,062 Americans in total have been killed in Iraq. And for \nwhat? And for what, I ask? As of today, 3,062 Americans in total have \nbeen killed in that war.\n  Yes, ``bring 'em on,'' President Bush chided the Iraqis and \nterrorists on July 2, 2003. So I will say it once more. We have lost \nmore than 2,800 troops in that war since President Bush said: ``bring \n'em on.''\n  Former Senator Max Cleland--do you remember him? I remember him. He \nused to sit right back there. Max Cleland, bless his heart, recently \npointed out that American forces have now ``become sitting ducks in a \nshooting gallery for every terrorist in the Middle East.''\n  Although Congress should have learned important lessons from the \nVietnam war, there are now ominous indications that a path to a new \nmilitary confrontation is being created right before our eyes. Just \nthis month, the President announced his intention to ``interrupt the \nflow of support from Iran and Syria'' into Iraq.\n  What does this saber-rattling comment really mean? Hear me. Does the \nPresident seek to expand the ongoing war beyond Iraq's borders? Does \nhe? Does this comment really mean that? Or are we already on a course \nto another war in the Middle East? Are we? Will Syria or Iran be the \nCambodia of a 21st century Vietnam? Will Syria or Iran be the Cambodia \nof a 21st century Vietnam?\n  In the State of the Union Address last night, the President called \nout Iran no less than seven times. Was the speech the first step in an \neffort to blame all that has gone wrong in the Middle East on Iran? Was \nthe focus on Iran during the President's address an attempt to link \nIran to the war on terrorism, and, by extension, start building a case \nthat our response to the 9/11 attacks must include dealing with Iran?\n  I fear--and I hope I am wrong--that the machinery may have already \nbeen set in motion which may ultimately lead to a military attack \ninside Iran or perhaps Syria, despite the opposition of the American \npeople, many in Congress, and even some within the President's \nadministration.\n  Wise counsel from congressional leaders to step back from the \nprecipice of all-out war in the Middle East is too easily disregarded. \nTo forestall a looming disaster, Congress must act to save the checks \nand balances established by the Constitution.\n  Today I am introducing a resolution that clearly states that it is \nCongress--the Congress, the Congress, not the President--that is vested \nwith the ultimate decision on whether to take this country to war \nagainst another country.\n  This resolution, which I hold in my hand--here it is--this resolution \nis a rejection--hear me--a rejection of the bankrupt, dangerous, and \nunconstitutional doctrine of preemption. Let me say that again. This \nresolution, which I hold in my hand, is a rejection of the bankrupt, \ndangerous, and unconstitutional doctrine of preemption, which proposes \nthat the President--any President--may strike another country before \nthat country threatens us, before that country threatens us. That is \nthe doctrine of preemption: We may strike, we may attack, we may invade \nanother country before it threatens us.\n  Now, this resolution, which I am going to introduce, returns our \nGovernment to the inspired intent of the Framers, God bless them, of \nthe Constitution who so wisely placed the power to declare war in the \nhands of the elected representatives of the American people.\n  If there exists a reckless determination for a new war in the Middle \nEast, I fear that the attorneys of the executive branch are already \nseeking ways to tie this war to the use of force resolution for Iraq, \nor the resolution passed in response to 9/11. But the American people \nneed only be reminded about the untruths of Iraq's supposed ties to the \n9/11 attacks to see how far the truth can be stretched in order to \nachieve the desired outcome.\n  If the executive branch were to try to prod, stretch, or rewrite the \n9/11 or the Iraq use of force resolutions in an outrageous attempt to \napply them to an attack on Iran, on Syria, or anywhere else, this \nresolution of mine is clear--clear as the noonday Sun in a cloudless \nsky--this resolution is clear: The Constitution says that Congress--we \nhere and those over there on the other side of the Capitol--the \nConstitution says that Congress, not the President, must make the \ndecision for war or peace. The power to declare war resides in \nCongress--resides here--and it is we--we, the elected representatives \nof the people--who are the ``deciders.''\n  Congress has an obligation to the people of the United States. With \nso many of our sons and daughters spilling their blood in one costly \nwar, Senators and Representatives have a moral duty to question whether \nwe are headed for an even more tragic conflict in the Middle East. But \nin order to question this administration--in order to fulfill the \nduties entrusted to us by the Constitution, to which we have sworn to \nsupport and defend--Congress must first insist that the powers given to \nthis body--the Congress, the Senate and the House--are held sacrosanct. \nWe must insist that these powers, including the power to declare war, \nare not usurped by this President or any other President who will \nfollow.\n  The resolution, Mr. President, which I am submitting today, is an \neffort to protect the Constitution--an effort to protect the \nConstitution--from the zeal of the executive branch, whose very nature \nis to strive for more and more power during a time of war.\n  It is time now for Congress to put its foot down and stand up for the \nConstitution. Our Nation did not ask to be put into another Vietnam. \nLet us not deceive ourselves that we are somehow immune to another \nCambodia. Let us stop a reckless, costly war in Iran or Syria before it \nbegins by restoring the checks and balances that our Founders so \ncarefully--so carefully--designed.\n  I send, Mr. President, the resolution to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let the title be read, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the title will be read.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 39) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the need for approval by the Congress before any \n     offensive military action by the United States against \n     another nation.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Con. Res. 4\n\n       Whereas, we respect the Constitutional authorities given a \n     President in Article II, Section 2, which states that ``The \n     President shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of \n     the United States;'' it is not the intent of this resolution \n     to question or contravene such authority, but to accept the\n\n[[Page S1076]]\n\n     offer to Congress made by the President on January 10, 2007 \n     that, ``if members have improvements that can be made, we \n     will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust;''\n       Whereas, the United States' strategy and operations in Iraq \n     can only be sustained and achieved with support from the \n     American people and with a level of bipartisanship;\n       Whereas, over 137,000 American military personnel are \n     currently serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since \n     March 2003, with the bravery and professionalism consistent \n     with the finest traditions of the United States armed forces, \n     and are deserving of the support of all Americans, which they \n     have strongly;\n       Whereas, many American service personnel have lost their \n     lives, and many more have been wounded, in Iraq, and the \n     American people will always honor their sacrifices and honor \n     their families;\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including their \n     Reserve and National Guard organizations, together with \n     components of the other branches of the military, are under \n     enormous strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq \n     and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas, these deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have lasting impacts on the future recruiting, retention \n     and readiness of our nation's all volunteer force;\n       Whereas in the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2006, the Congress stated that ``calendar year \n     2006 should be a period of significant transition to full \n     sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for \n     the security of a free and sovereign Iraq;''\n       Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, \n     approved November 28, 2006, ``determin[ed] that the situation \n     in Iraq continues to constitute a threat to international \n     peace and security;''\n       Whereas, a failed state in Iraq would present a threat to \n     regional and world peace, and the long-term security \n     interests of the United States are best served by an \n     Iraq that can sustain, govern, and defend itself, and \n     serve as an ally in the war against extremists;\n       Whereas, Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating and ever-\n     widening problem of sectarian and intra-sectarian violence \n     based upon political distrust and cultural differences \n     between some Sunni and Shia Muslims;\n       Whereas, Iraqis must reach political settlements in order \n     to achieve reconciliation, and the failure of the Iraqis to \n     reach such settlements to support a truly unified government \n     greatly contributes to the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       Whereas, the responsibility for Iraq's internal security \n     and halting sectarian violence must rest primarily with the \n     Government of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces;\n       Whereas, U.S. Central Command Commander General John \n     Abizaid testified to Congress on November 15, 2006, ``I met \n     with every divisional commander, General Casey, the Corps \n     Commander, [and] General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future;''\n       Whereas, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on \n     November 27, 2006 that ``The crisis is political, and the \n     ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting \n     of innocents are the politicians;''\n       Whereas, there is growing evidence that Iraqi public \n     sentiment opposes the continued U.S. troop presence in Iraq, \n     much less increasing the troop level;\n       Whereas, in the fall of 2006, leaders in the Administration \n     and Congress, as well as recognized experts in the private \n     sector, began to express concern that the situation in Iraq \n     was deteriorating and required a change in strategy; and, as \n     a consequence, the Administration began an intensive, \n     comprehensive review of the Iraq strategy, by all components \n     of the Executive branch;\n       Whereas, in December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes ``new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly;''\n       Whereas, on January 10, 2007, following consultations with \n     the Iraqi Prime Minister, the President announced a new \n     strategy (hereinafter referred to as the ``plan,'') the \n     central element of which is an augmentation of the present \n     U.S. military force structure through additional deployments \n     of approximately 21,500 U.S. military troops to Iraq;\n       Whereas, this proposed level of troop augmentation far \n     exceeds the expectations of many of us as to the \n     reinforcements that would be necessary to implement the \n     various options for a new strategy, and led many members to \n     express outright opposition to augmenting our troops by \n     21,500;\n       Whereas, the Government of Iraq has promised repeatedly to \n     assume a greater share of security responsibilities, disband \n     militias, consider Constitutional amendments and enact laws \n     to reconcile sectarian differences, and improve the \n     quality of essential services for the Iraqi people; yet, \n     despite those promises, little has been achieved;\n       Whereas, the President said on January 10, 2007 that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       Whereas, the recommendations in this resolution should not \n     be interpreted as precipitating any immediate reduction in, \n     or withdrawal of, the present level of forces: Now therefore \n     be it--\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Senate disagrees with the ``plan'' to augment our \n     forces by 21,500, and urges the President instead to consider \n     all options and alternatives for achieving the strategic \n     goals set forth below with reduced force levels than \n     proposed;\n       (2) The primary objective of the overall U.S. strategy in \n     Iraq should be to encourage Iraqi leaders to make political \n     compromises that will foster reconciliation and strengthen \n     the unity government, ultimately leading to improvements in \n     the security situation;\n       (3) The military part of this strategy should focus on \n     maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq, denying \n     international terrorists a safe haven, conducting \n     counterterrorism operations, promoting regional stability, \n     and training and equipping Iraqi forces to take full \n     responsibility for their own security;\n       (4) United States military operations should, as much as \n     possible, be confined to these goals, and should charge the \n     Iraqi military with the primary mission of combating \n     sectarian violence;\n       (5) The military Rules of Engagement for this plan should \n     reflect this delineation of responsibilities;\n       (6) The United States Government should transfer to the \n     Iraqi military, in an expeditious manner, such equipment as \n     is necessary;\n       (7) The Senate believes the United States should continue \n     vigorous operations in Anbar province, specifically for the \n     purpose of combating an insurgency, including elements \n     associated with the Al Qaeda movement, and denying terrorists \n     a safe haven;\n       (8) The United States Government should engage selected \n     nations in the Middle East to develop a regional, \n     internationally sponsored peace-and-reconciliation process \n     for Iraq;\n       (9) The Administration should provide regular updates to \n     the Congress, produced by the Commander of United States \n     Central Command and his subordinate commanders, about the \n     progress or lack of progress the Iraqis are making toward \n     this end.\n       (10) our overall military, diplomatic and economic strategy \n     should not be regarded as an ``open-ended'' or unconditional \n     commitment, but rather as a new strategy that hereafter \n     should be conditioned upon the Iraqi government's meeting \n     benchmarks that must be specified by the Administration.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Nelson of Nebraska and Senator \nCollins and I have worked for some time to put forward a resolution \nembracing the very serious, heartfelt sentiments of Senators with \nregard to the President's plan that he enunciated on January 10.\n  That plan--and I credit the President for the in-depth study and \npreparation that went into it, the consultations; I was privileged to \nbe a part of three consultations with the President in that period--it \nis that plan about which a number of us here in the Senate have some \nthoughts.\n  The President, in his statement on January 10, laid down the \ninvitation for Members of Congress to come forward and provide their \nthoughts. And that is the vein in which the three of us, together with \na series of cosponsors, have adopted this first draft, which is \nidentical to the draft we put into the Record some nights ago. We \npurposely have not changed a comma or a period or any other word in it \nbecause a number of colleagues, in a very thoughtful and proper way, \nhave come to us with suggestions and ideas. But at this time, we \nbelieve we should lay this down, such that other Senators who might \nwish to be cosponsors may do so. The Senate works its will each day, \nand we are always here to consider ideas from other colleagues, but at \nthe present time this is the format. We purposely waited until after \nthe Foreign Relations Committee worked on its resolution, which I \nunderstand will soon be working its way to the calendar.\n  So for that purpose, we put in ours. We find some differences--very \nsignificant, in my judgment--between ours and the resolution offered by \nthe distinguished Senator, Mr. Biden, and others--Senator Levin, \nindeed, Senator Hagel.\n  We believe we have put a greater emphasis on urging the President to \nconsider other options, given that we have a general disagreement with \nthe very\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\nsignificant level of troops that are specifically set forth in the \nPresident's plan.\n  We also feel very strongly about the issue of sectarian violence and \nhow that must be the primary mission of the Iraqi forces. The American \nGI simply should not be, in my judgment--whenever possible, the rules \nof engagement should provide that the Iraqi forces should deal with the \nsectarian violence issue. They understand the language. They understand \nthe cultural differences, which precipitate the animosity between the \nSunni and the Shia and, indeed, the most distressing aspects of it: the \nShia upon Shia and Sunni upon Sunni. We recognize that sectarian \nviolence is undermining, in many ways--the level of it--the efforts of \nthis Government under Prime Minister Maliki to go forward and exercise \nthe full reins of sovereignty and that it is in those interests that \nsectarian violence has to be dealt with. It is an important mission, \nbut I believe strongly it is a mission that should be given primarily \nto the Iraqi forces.\n  We concur with the President, who said many times, including in his \nstatement on January 10, that to allow this Government to fail and to \nallow the accomplishments toward sovereignty through free elections by \nthe Iraqi people to be lost and this country to simply be plunged into \nchaotic situations is not in the interests of peace in that region and, \nindeed, peace in the world.\n  Our resolution does not provide for a reduction in any way or suggest \nthe level of U.S. forces there now. It does not provide a timetable. It \nsimply urges the President to consider all options and sets forth in \nthere the primary missions as we interpret them to be in the interests \nof our country. Those primary missions track in large measure the \nBaker-Hamilton report.\n  We also stress the need for benchmarks to be spelled out with \nclarity. And should the operations in Baghdad go forward under the \nCommander in Chief--and we recognize fully and in no way try to \ncontravene the authority of the President to act under the Constitution \nas Commander in Chief--should that go forward, it will be done in an \nincremental fashion, as we have been told by the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs and others.\n  So when the first operation takes place, we should carefully set \nforth the benchmarks and see if the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi \narmed forces fulfill those benchmarks; namely, do they all come in the \nnumbers that they were supposed to under that plan? They failed to do \nthat when a similar augmentation for the Baghdad operation was \ninitiated this summer. Will the political structure in Iraq resist, \nrefrain, and in every other way allow the military commanders, both \nU.S. and Iraqi, to carry out the missions as they see fit and employ \nsuch tactics as they deem necessary to achieve those missions without \nbeing called by the Government and told: Stop this, withdraw here, or \ndo not take that prisoner, but if you have him, then release him. We \ncannot go in under that guise.\n  Thirdly and most importantly, we have to see how the Iraqis perform. \nWill they take the point? Will they take the lead? And in such tactics, \nwill they then be the primary--the primary--if not the essential force \nthat deals with sectarian violence, such that the rules of engagement \nspell out: Whenever necessary, the coalition forces and namely the \nUnited States shall not be utilized.\n  At this time, I would invite my colleagues to express their views, \nand I will ask each to name those cosponsors whom we have gotten from \neach side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the \nsenior Senator from Virginia for his considerable work in drafting this \nresolution and working over the weekend with us and our staffs, who \nworked very closely together to prepare this Iraq resolution.\n  I think it is important to say as well that I respect the work done \nby the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today in considering the \nresolution submitted by, supported by their chairman, the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Biden. I have a great deal of respect for \nSenator Biden's work.\n  This is an area where there can be more than one idea about how to \napproach something, but at the end of the day, it is going to be \nimportant to have a resolution that has broad bipartisan support.\n  I also appreciate the work of Senator Collins, who, as our colleague, \nhas worked very closely on this resolution together with her staff to \nbe able to submit it today in this fashion by putting it not only into \nthe Record but on the floor so it can become part of the business of \nthe Senate.\n  There will be some who would say: Why is there a need for a second \nresolution? Well, this resolution offers a new set of ideas, more \nbroadly worded, and in some cases, clearly, more likely to be \nbipartisan for Senators to consider. Given the fact that the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee resolution came out on largely a partisan \nvote, we think this resolution, because it is picking up bipartisan \nsupport, will be, in terms of content and support, consistent with an \neffort to bring about a bipartisan resolution with broad support.\n  The recommendations of the Iraq Study Group have not been followed to \nany significant extent to date. In some respects, they have been almost \non a skyhook for future consideration. It was our feeling that many of \nthese recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton study group should be \nincluded in a resolution, and we included many of those recommendations \nin the body of our resolution.\n  We also worked very carefully to avoid political rhetoric or any kind \nof rhetoric that threatens the real objective. The real objective of \nthis resolution is to stress to the White House that we disagree with \nthe approach this plan takes by putting more men and women in our \nuniform in harm's way to fight, to do battle, to overcome the sectarian \nviolence and the possible civil war of the Sunnis and the Shias and \nvarious subgroups within those religious and political elements. We \nalso believed it was important to stress benchmarks and to empower the \nPrime Minister and the Iraqi Government to be able to meet certain \nobjectives, certain goals, and to be able to deliver.\n  At the end of the day, we think it is important to send a strong but \nunified message to the White House and Iraq. The more support the \nresolution receives in the Senate, the stronger our message will be. So \ntonight I am very pleased and am certainly proud to be here with my \ncolleagues to say that at the end of the day, we think the strength of \nthis resolution to uphold our responsibility will be in the best \ninterests of our country and our military and that our colleagues \nshould join together with us in opposition to the surge of U.S. troops \nto be placed in Baghdad. It is the responsibility of the Iraqi \nGovernment and the Iraqi military to overcome the battles between \nsectarian groups within their own country and to seek less of a \nmilitary resolution and certainly more of a political resolution to the \nproblems that exist at the present time.\n  With that, let me say that I would like to see our unanimous consent \nbe modified to include up to 10 minutes for Senator Salazar from \nColorado to speak on the resolution afterward, if there is no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly will not object. I wonder if I \nmight have 2 minutes following Senator Collins to summarize before we \nreceive the distinguished Senator from Colorado for his remarks. I ask \nunanimous consent that the unanimous consent agreement be modified so I \ncan have about 2 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  If not, without objection, the unanimous consent agreement is so \nmodified.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to now turn \nto Senator Collins, who has worked very closely with us. Before I do, I \nshould indicate the cosponsors from the Democratic side are Senator \nSalazar, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Landrieu, Senator Bayh, and \nSenator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my two colleagues on \nthe Senate floor this evening in submitting a very important resolution \non what is perhaps the greatest challenge facing our country.\n  Let me first say it has been an honor and a privilege to work with \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia, the former chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, as well as my friend and colleague \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Ben Nelson. We have worked very hard on this \nresolution, spending many hours wordsmithing the language of it, trying \nto get exactly the kind of serious policy statement we could bring \nbefore our colleagues in the Senate.\n  I am very pleased that on the Republican side, we are joined by two \nleaders on this issue, Senator Coleman and Senator Smith. They, too, \nhave had input to the resolution. That brings the number of us who are \njoining tonight as original sponsors of our resolution to 10 Members of \nthe Senate. I would also note that based on conversations I have had \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, there are several more \nSenators who are very interested in our resolution and may well join in \ncosponsoring it at a later date or certainly in voting for it.\n  Yesterday the Senate Armed Services Committee held a very useful \nhearing on the nomination of an outstanding military officer, General \nPetraeus, whom the President has tapped to lead our forces in Iraq. \nEarlier today the Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe by \nunanimous vote, voted to report this vital nomination to the full \nSenate. General Petraeus is the ideal person to be taking over as \ncommander of our troops in Iraq. If anyone can make what I believe to \nbe a flawed strategy a success, it is he. But I had a very interesting \nexchange with General Petraeus. I talked to him about my concern that \ninserting more American troops into Iraq may well lessen the pressure \non Iraqi leaders to take the long overdue steps that are needed to \nquell the sectarian violence.\n  I know the President believes the answer is more American troops, \nthat that will provide the Prime Minister and other leaders with the \nspace they need to take the reforms forward. I fear it is just the \nopposite. I believe it lessens the pressure on the Iraqi leaders.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Did not the CENTCOM commander, who is still the CENTCOM \ncommander, General Abizaid, testify before our committee and, in the \nprecise words, said he felt that at this time added troops were not \nnecessary, more troops would lessen the incentive of the Iraqis to pick \nup the burdens which we are trying to have them assume under \nsovereignty?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The distinguished Senator from Virginia is exactly \ncorrect. That is indeed the testimony that was brought before our \ncommittee a month ago. This was not ancient history. It was very \nreasoned testimony and it could not have been clearer testimony. \nIndeed, similar testimony was given by General Casey.\n  I asked General Petraeus if he felt we would be facing the widespread \nand deteriorating sectarian violence that threatens the entire country, \nbut particularly the Baghdad region, if Iraqi leaders had amended their \nConstitution, had passed an oil revenue law that more equitably \ndistributed oil proceeds among the groups in Iraq, if they had held \nprovincial elections, if they had more fully integrated the Sunni \nminority into the Government power structures; would we be in the same \nplace today? And he told me he did not believe we would be. I think \nthat is significant, because I believe if Iraqi leaders had taken those \nsteps, we would not be facing the widespread sectarian violence that \nhas engulfed the Baghdad region.\n  I also talked to General Petraeus about a fascinating article he \nwrote a year ago in which he outlined 14 observations that he had, \nbased on his previous tours in Iraq. The first and most important \nobservation in this article in ``Military Review'' that General \nPetraeus had was to quote Lawrence of Arabia back in 1917, to say that \nit was a mistake for us to do too much, whoever the foreign force is, \nand that you had to let the Iraqis take the lead on these issues. Well, \nthose words, true in 1917, are just as true today, as General Petraeus \nhimself observed in this article.\n  The second observation in the same article, General Petraeus said an \narmy like ours in a land like Iraq has a half life as liberators, that \nthey are quickly seen as an army of occupiers. I believe that is what \nhas happened in Iraq and that confirms what my own observations were \nduring a trip a month ago to that land. Our delegation met with a \nBritish commander in Basra who described to us a declining consent \nline. He said at first when the British arrived in Basra, they were \ngreeted as liberators. But as time has gone by, their presence is more \nand more resented and less and less tolerated.\n\n  The observations General Petraeus had in this article offer us good \nguidance and, indeed, reflect in many ways the concepts we have worked \nhard to include in this resolution.\n  There is one final point I want to make this evening. Some have said \nif we pass this resolution, we show that America is somehow divided and \nnot supportive of our troops. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nThe fact is every Member of this body is united in support of our \ntroops. Every Member of this body wishes General Petraeus all the best \nand hopes he will succeed in this very difficult mission. But the fact \nis, Americans are deeply divided over the strategy we should pursue in \nIraq. It is part of the health of our American democracy that we debate \nthese issues, and we do so because we care about the brave men and \nwomen in uniform who are representing us in Iraq, who are on the front \nlines, who are sacrificing so much. That is exactly the motivation for \nthe resolution that the 10 of us are introducing tonight.\n  Let me close my remarks by again saying it has been a wonderful \nexperience to work so closely with the senior Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Ben Nelson. Both of them have worked so \nhard. They care so much about this issue. It has been a great pleasure \nto join with them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleagues, the Senator from Nebraska and \nSenator Collins. It is important that we have taken this initiative \nbecause a number of colleagues--10 now--wish to be recognized. But \nbelieve me, there are 10 more and 10 more who will soon come forward, \nhopefully, and support this resolution. I also want to stress, as both \nof my colleagues did, I hope as this debate progresses, it will not be \na question of who is the most patriotic, who is the strongest supporter \nof the American troops. I pride myself with having had a relationship \nwith the Armed Forces of the United States, modest though it may be, \nsince late 1944-1945. I had the privilege of working and learning. I \noften feel the Armed Forces did far more for me than I have done for \nthem. In my years, now 29 years, here in the Senate on the Armed \nServices Committee, I have done everything I could to repay the Armed \nForces for what they did for this humble person, to provide for them in \na way that meets the sincerity of their commitments and that of their \nfamilies.\n  So it is not a question of who is the most patriotic or a question of \nwho is trying to be confrontational with the President. These are \nheartfelt, closely held views we have about one of the most serious \nepisodes in contemporary American history. I think the President has \nshown a measure of courage in this matter. But as has been \nacknowledged, we have made mistakes. And what we have tried to do is \nconscientiously say how we feel about the immediate future.\n  I asked for a change in strategy, I guess it was October, when I came \nback and said the situation, as I saw it, in Iraq was going sideways. \nThat has been done. This is a change in strategy. I acknowledge that. \nWe were invited by the President to make suggestions. We have done that \nin a courteous, respectful manner. I thank my colleagues.\n  I stress also the need for bipartisanship. I am not certain anyone \ncan predict how this debate will go and what the outcome will be or how \nmany resolutions come forward. I think it should be a healthy, strong \ndebate and one in which the American public, which is\n\n[[Page S1079]]\n\nvery much attuned to this situation and has strong views of its own--\nand we should respect those views--I hope that what debate and actions \nfollow, whatever they may be by this Chamber on such final resolutions \nthat may be voted on, earn the respect and the trust and the confidence \nnot only of the Armed Forces but of the American public. Because we can \nonly be successful in this operation to save the Government of Iraq, \nwhether it is this one or a successor one, to save the people of Iraq \nso they can exercise sovereignty if there is strong public support and \na strong and accurate bipartisan level of participation by the Congress \nof the United States. To have a vote all on one side and a vote all on \nthe other side will not help this very situation at this time.\n  So one of the main goals--and we have achieved it--is bipartisanship, \ntruly.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor. And I wish to, in so \nyielding, thank the distinguished Senator from Colorado for joining us \nin this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me first say I am pleased and honored \nto be here with Senator Warner and Senator Collins and Senator Nelson. \nIt was about a year or so ago that Senator Levin and Senator Warner led \na CODEL of Senators into Iraq and Afghanistan. I had the great fortune \nof traveling with both Senator Warner and Senator Levin on that CODEL. \nI learned a tremendous amount from them in terms of what it is they had \nseen in Iraq and Afghanistan, the observations they made about where we \nwere on the levels of violence in Iraq. I came away from that CODEL \nwith them feeling as if they truly had the best interests of America at \nheart. As they have sponsored these resolutions today, what they are \nacting out here is in the best fashion of what a Senator should do, and \nthat is trying to do the best for our country.\n  Let me say, first of all, with respect to the resolution that was \nheard earlier today in the Foreign Relations Committee, sponsored by \nSenator Levin and Senator Biden and Senator Hagel, I very much \nappreciate their leadership and thinking and the passion they brought \nto the debate and to this issue.\n  When I sat down and compared the resolution considered in the Foreign \nRelations Committee to the resolution that is now being introduced by \nSenator Warner and other colleagues, I thought there were a great \nnumber of similarities between the two resolutions.\n  Let me just comment about my own involvement and give part of my \nrationale for becoming an original sponsor of this resolution. First \nand foremost, I think what this country needs today more than anything \nelse is a sense of unity. I think we have had a great deal of \ndivisiveness in this country over the last 6 years. I think in the long \nrun, when one looks 10, 20, 30, 40 years down the road at these very \ndifficult times that are very challenging to our country--very \nchallenging to our men and women in uniform and the other men and women \nof America--we will be judged as to whether we in this Congress were \nable to unify a direction in Iraq that ultimately was a successful \ndirection in Iraq.\n  I have called for a new direction in Iraq because I believe we need \nthat to get us to success there. I don't believe we can get to success \nin Iraq if we have a divided country in terms of how we move forward.\n  With respect to the resolution that is before us, in my own \nconversations with the President and with members of his administration \nin the past, I have told them that, in my view, with all due respect to \nour Commander in Chief, we need to move forward in a new direction.\n  When I returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with the Levin-Warner \ncodel, one of the things I told the President we needed to do was to \nenhance our diplomatic efforts in the region; that the countries in the \narea have as much, if not more, at stake than the United States. I saw \nthem doing very little.\n  Today, I see Saudi Arabia, with all its wealth, doing very little to \nhelp in the reconstruction of Iraq. The same thing could be said about \nKuwait and many of the neighboring countries. That effort has to be \nenhanced because they simply, in my judgment, are not doing their part \nto contribute to a successful outcome in that region.\n  I have also spoken to the President and members of his administration \nabout the importance of the effort of reconstruction and making sure \nthat there are other countries besides the United States putting their \nshoulder to the wheel on the reconstruction efforts that are underway \nin Iraq.\n  The way I see this debate unfolding is that we essentially have the \nplan of the President, which I call plan A. His plan is that we do a \nlot of what we have been doing but, in addition, that we move forward \nand add an additional 21,500 troops to the war effort in Iraq. That \nwould be what I call plan A. There is another plan out there, plan B, \nfrom some Members of Congress and others that say we ought to bring our \ntroops home and bring our troops home right away; that we ought to \nengage in an immediate withdrawal from Iraq and from that region. My \nown view of that plan, plan B, is that is not a good plan either. At \nthe end of the day, no matter what criticisms we make about the \noriginal decision to invade Iraq, about the way the war has been \nmishandled, the fact is we are in Iraq today; there is a mess in Iraq \nand in the Middle East. So the question for me becomes: How do we as \nthe United States of America, working in the Senate, working in the \nHouse of Representatives, working with the President, how do we put \nHumpty-Dumpty together again? It seems to me that Humpty-Dumpty has \nfallen off the wall, and it is up to us to try to figure out, in some \nunited way, under difficult circumstances, how to move forward together \nto create the unity that will allow us to succeed in Iraq.\n  When I look at the possibility of plan B, which is a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq, it seems to me that will create tremendous \ndangers not only to the Middle East but to the long-term interests of \nthe United States. I, for one, want us very much to succeed in Iraq \nand, because I want to succeed, I want to see whether we can create a \nkind of unity on how we move forward.\n  I think this resolution introduced by the senior Senator from \nVirginia, the Senator from Nebraska, and the Senator from Maine is a \ngood direction for us to go in. I want to point out what I consider to \nbe four central points of this resolution which, in my view, are also \nreflected in the Biden-Levin-Hagel resolution. The first of those \npoints is that there is a disagreement with the President's decision to \nmove forward with a surge of 21,500 more troops. I think both \nresolutions say that equally and clearly. Why, in this resolution, is \nthat conclusion reached? Why was it reached in the other resolution \nheard in the Foreign Relations Committee?\n\n  In my view, it is because of what our military commanders have said. \nGeneral Abizaid said it a few weeks ago, in November. He said an \nincrease in troops was not the way to go because it sends the wrong \nsignal about the ultimate responsibility to quell the sectarian \nviolence in Iraq. It is not the right way to go because when you look \nat what happened with the surges we have had over the last 6, 7 months \nin Iraq, they themselves did not work. When operations going forward \nstarted in June, there was a sense that it might quell some of the \nsectarian violence going on. It didn't work. We came back in August and \ndid another operation going forward. It did not work.\n  The Iraq bipartisan study commission, chaired by former Secretary \nBaker and Lee Hamilton, found, in fact, that those surges created an \nescalation of violence by 43 percent during that time period. In a \nmatter of 6 months we saw a 43-percent escalation of violence there. \nRegarding putting more troops in, it seems we have the laboratory of \nexperience where it hasn't worked in the past, and there is nothing I \nhave seen that indicates that moving forward in that direction will \nwork at this time. I agree with the resolution and making a statement \nthat we disagree with the President's decision moving forward in that \nregard.\n  As to the second part of this resolution, also reflected in the \nalternative resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee, I think \nthere is unanimity of opinion. I bet you that we can get 100 Senators \nto vote for the position that the Iraqi Government needs to assume \nresponsibility for a functioning government that will provide security\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nto the Iraqi nation and to the people of Iraq.\n  When Senator Warner and I visited Iraq with Senator Levin, I still \nremember meeting with the Iraqi Ministers and with our own forces \nresponsible for helping with the training of the Iraqi police. Mr. \nPresident, 2006 was supposed to be the year of the police in Iraq. This \nis the year where the Iraqi security was supposed to be taken to the \npoint where they could move forward and assume the responsibility for \ntheir own security. Yet that handoff hasn't occurred and the sectarian \nviolence has continued to increase.\n  I very much agree with the spirit of both resolutions that says if we \nare going to move forward and be successful on this issue, it is the \nIraqi Government and people who need to move forward and assume \nresponsibility for their security.\n  The third thing in this resolution that I think is important is that \nwe contemplate that there is going to be some continuing involvement of \nthe United States in Iraq, without limitation. Nobody knows for how \nlong. But our efforts to engage in counterterrorism in that area will \nbe a continuing and important role of the United States of America. Our \nefforts to attempt to restore the territorial integrity of Iraq and to \nstop the weapons flowing into Iraq from Iran and Syria are important \nmeasures that I believe the U.S. military can address. I agree with \nthose aspects of the resolution as well.\n  Finally, as I said earlier in my comments, at the end of the day, \nthis is not a United States of America problem alone. When one looks at \nthe Gulf States and other countries in that area, such as Egypt, there \nis a huge problem that belongs to them as well. We have our hands on \nthe tar baby as the United States of America. They, too, as countries \nhave a huge stake in the success of Iraq and also have to get their \nhands on the tar baby. I believe the resolution put forward by Senator \nLevin and my other colleagues is a step in the right direction in that \nit creates a framework for how we ought to be moving forward in Iraq.\n  In conclusion, again, I say how much I respect the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia. I remember well the work that we did just a year or so \nago in the so-called Gang of 14. I see that Senator Nelson and Senator \nCollins and Senator Warner are back again trying to pull the Members of \nthis body together on what is a very contentious issue. I wish them \nwell, and I am delighted to be part of the effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from \nColorado and pick up on the theme that he closed and talked on \nearlier--unity.\n  Yes, there is great unity among the American people and a depth of \nconcern about the loss of our forces and the wounding and suffering of \nthe families. We have not lost our resolve. Our President has been \nfirm. But this institution, the great Congress of the United States, a \ncoequal branch of the Government, now must rise and show our commitment \nto fulfill the wishes and hopes and prayers of the American people, and \ndo so in a bipartisan manner. That is the very heart of the effort of \nour 10 colleagues who thus far have come forward and put their names \ninto the public domain as supporting the provisions of this resolution.\n  They do resemble, in many respects, the provisions in the Biden-\nLevin-Hagel resolution. When that first came out, so much of the \nrhetoric surrounding that resolution was disturbing to many people. \nThat gave rise to the efforts that we have put forth, culminating in \nplacing this document into the Record tonight.\n  I hope others will consider joining us because it is important to \nshow unity and bipartisanship in the Congress in saying that we, in \nfact, understand the hopes, wishes, and prayers of the American people \nand the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/24/senate-section/article/S1080-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1080-S1081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 176.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the United States has an obligation \n     to its citizens to secure its borders and ensure the rule of \n     law in its communities.\n       (2) The Government of the United States must strengthen \n     international border security efforts by dedicating adequate \n     and significant resources for technology, personnel, and \n     training for border region enforcement.\n       (3) Federal immigration policies must adhere to the United \n     States tradition as a nation of immigrants and reaffirm this \n     Nation's commitment to family unity, economic opportunity, \n     and humane treatment.\n       (4) Immigrants have contributed significantly to the \n     strength and economic prosperity of the United States and \n     action must be taken to ensure their fair treatment by \n     employers and protection against fraud and abuse.\n       (5) Current immigration laws and the enforcement of such \n     laws are ineffective and do not serve the people of the \n     United States, the national security interests of the United \n     States, or the economic prosperity of the United States.\n       (6) The United States cannot effectively carry out its \n     national security policies unless the United States \n     identifies undocumented immigrants and encourages them to \n     come forward and participate legally in the economy of the \n     United States.\n       (7) Illegal immigration fosters other illegal activity, \n     including human smuggling, trafficking, and document fraud, \n     all of which undermine the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (8) Illegal immigration burdens States and local \n     communities with hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     uncompensated expenses for law enforcement, health care, and \n     other essential services.\n       (9) Illegal immigration creates an underclass of workers \n     who are vulnerable to fraud and exploitation.\n       (10) Fixing the broken immigration system requires a \n     comprehensive approach that provides for adequate legal \n     channels for immigration and strong enforcement of \n     immigration laws which will serve the economic, social, and \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (11) Foreign governments, particularly those that share an \n     international border with the United States, must play a \n     critical role in securing international borders and deterring \n     illegal entry of foreign nationals into the United States.\n       (12) Federal immigration policy should foster economic \n     growth by allowing willing workers to be matched with willing \n     employers when no United States worker is available to take a \n     job.\n       (13) Immigration reform is a key component to achieving \n     effective enforcement and will allow for the best use of \n     security and enforcement resources to be focused on the \n     greatest risks.\n       (14) Comprehensive immigration reform and strong \n     enforcement of immigration laws will encourage legal \n     immigration, deter illegal immigration, and promote the \n     economic and national security interests of the United \n     States.\n\n                        TITLE I--BORDER SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 1101.

BILATERAL EFFORTS WITH MEXICO TO REDUCE MIGRATION \n                   PRESSURES AND COSTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Migration from Mexico to the United States is directly \n     linked to the degree of economic opportunity and the standard \n     of living in Mexico.\n       (2) Mexico comprises a prime source of migration to the \n     United States.\n       (3) Remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United \n     States reached a record high of nearly $17,000,000,000 in \n     2004.\n       (4) Migration patterns may be reduced from Mexico to the \n     United States by addressing the degree of economic \n     opportunity available to Mexican citizens.\n       (5) Many Mexican assets are held extra-legally and cannot \n     be readily used as collateral for loans.\n       (6) A majority of Mexican businesses are small or medium \n     size with limited access to financial capital.\n       (7) These factors constitute a major impediment to broad-\n     based economic growth in Mexico.\n       (8) Approximately 20 percent of Mexico's population works \n     in agriculture, with the majority of this population working \n     on small farms and few on large commercial enterprises.\n       (9) The Partnership for Prosperity is a bilateral \n     initiative launched jointly by the President of the United \n     States and the President of Mexico in 2001, which aims to \n     boost the social and economic standards of Mexican citizens, \n     particularly in regions where economic growth has lagged and \n     emigration has increased.\n       (10) The Presidents of Mexico and the United States and the \n     Prime Minister of Canada, at their trilateral summit on March \n     23, 2005, agreed to promote economic growth, competitiveness, \n     and quality of life in the agreement on Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership of North America.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Partnership for \n     Prosperity.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States and Mexico should accelerate the implementation of the \n     Partnership for Prosperity to help generate economic growth \n     and improve the standard of living in Mexico, which will lead \n     to reduced migration, by--\n       (1) increasing access for poor and under served populations \n     in Mexico to the financial services sector, including credit \n     unions;\n       (2) assisting Mexican efforts to formalize its extra-legal \n     sector, including the issuance of formal land titles, to \n     enable Mexican citizens to use their assets to procure \n     capital;\n       (3) facilitating Mexican efforts to establish an effective \n     rural lending system for small- and medium-sized farmers that \n     will--\n       (A) provide long term credit to borrowers;\n       (B) develop a viable network of regional and local \n     intermediary lending institutions;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the United States has an obligation \n     to its citizens to secure its borders and ensure the rule of \n     law in its communities.\n       (2) The Government of the United States must strengthen \n     international border security efforts by dedicating adequate \n     and significant resources for technology, personnel, and \n     training for border region enforcement.\n       (3) Federal immigration policies must adhere to the United \n     States tradition as a nation of immigrants and reaffirm this \n     Nation's commitment to family unity, economic opportunity, \n     and humane treatment.\n       (4) Immigrants have contributed significantly to the \n     strength and economic prosperity of the United States and \n     action must be taken to ensure their fair treatment by \n     employers and protection against fraud and abuse.\n       (5) Current immigration laws and the enforcement of such \n     laws are ineffective and do not serve the people of the \n     United States, the national security interests of the United \n     States, or the economic prosperity of the United States.\n       (6) The United States cannot effectively carry out its \n     national security policies unless the United States \n     identifies undocumented immigrants and encourages them to \n     come forward and participate legally in the economy of the \n     United States.\n       (7) Illegal immigration fosters other illegal activity, \n     including human smuggling, trafficking, and document fraud, \n     all of which undermine the national security interests of the \n     United States.\n       (8) Illegal immigration burdens States and local \n     communities with hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     uncompensated expenses for law enforcement, health care, and \n     other essential services.\n       (9) Illegal immigration creates an underclass of workers \n     who are vulnerable to fraud and exploitation.\n       (10) Fixing the broken immigration system requires a \n     comprehensive approach that provides for adequate legal \n     channels for immigration and strong enforcement of \n     immigration laws which will serve the economic, social, and \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (11) Foreign governments, particularly those that share an \n     international border with the United States, must play a \n     critical role in securing international borders and deterring \n     illegal entry of foreign nationals into the United States.\n       (12) Federal immigration policy should foster economic \n     growth by allowing willing workers to be matched with willing \n     employers when no United States worker is available to take a \n     job.\n       (13) Immigration reform is a key component to achieving \n     effective enforcement and will allow for the best use of \n     security and enforcement resources to be focused on the \n     greatest risks.\n       (14) Comprehensive immigration reform and strong \n     enforcement of immigration laws will encourage legal \n     immigration, deter illegal immigration, and promote the \n     economic and national security interests of the United \n     States.\n\n                        TITLE I--BORDER SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 1101.

BILATERAL EFFORTS WITH MEXICO TO REDUCE MIGRATION \n                   PRESSURES AND COSTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Migration from Mexico to the United States is directly \n     linked to the degree of economic opportunity and the standard \n     of living in Mexico.\n       (2) Mexico comprises a prime source of migration to the \n     United States.\n       (3) Remittances from Mexican citizens working in the United \n     States reached a record high of nearly $17,000,000,000 in \n     2004.\n       (4) Migration patterns may be reduced from Mexico to the \n     United States by addressing the degree of economic \n     opportunity available to Mexican citizens.\n       (5) Many Mexican assets are held extra-legally and cannot \n     be readily used as collateral for loans.\n       (6) A majority of Mexican businesses are small or medium \n     size with limited access to financial capital.\n       (7) These factors constitute a major impediment to broad-\n     based economic growth in Mexico.\n       (8) Approximately 20 percent of Mexico's population works \n     in agriculture, with the majority of this population working \n     on small farms and few on large commercial enterprises.\n       (9) The Partnership for Prosperity is a bilateral \n     initiative launched jointly by the President of the United \n     States and the President of Mexico in 2001, which aims to \n     boost the social and economic standards of Mexican citizens, \n     particularly in regions where economic growth has lagged and \n     emigration has increased.\n       (10) The Presidents of Mexico and the United States and the \n     Prime Minister of Canada, at their trilateral summit on March \n     23, 2005, agreed to promote economic growth, competitiveness, \n     and quality of life in the agreement on Security and \n     Prosperity Partnership of North America.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Partnership for \n     Prosperity.--It is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States and Mexico should accelerate the implementation of the \n     Partnership for Prosperity to help generate economic growth \n     and improve the standard of living in Mexico, which will lead \n     to reduced migration, by--\n       (1) increasing access for poor and under served populations \n     in Mexico to the financial services sector, including credit \n     unions;\n       (2) assisting Mexican efforts to formalize its extra-legal \n     sector, including the issuance of formal land titles, to \n     enable Mexican citizens to use their assets to procure \n     capital;\n       (3) facilitating Mexican efforts to establish an effective \n     rural lending system for small- and medium-sized farmers that \n     will--\n       (A) provide long term credit to borrowers;\n       (B) develop a viable network of regional and local \n     intermediary lending institutions; and\n       (C) extend financing for alternative rural economic \n     activities beyond direct agricultural production;\n       (4) expanding efforts to reduce the transaction costs of \n     remittance flows in order to increase the pool of savings \n     available to help finance domestic investment in Mexico;\n       (5) encouraging Mexican corporations to adopt \n     internationally recognized corporate governance practices, \n     including anti-corruption and transparency principles;\n       (6) enhancing Mexican efforts to strengthen governance at \n     all levels, including efforts to improve transparency and \n     accountability, and to eliminate corruption, which is the \n     single biggest obstacle to development;\n       (7) assisting the Government of Mexico in implementing all \n     provisions of the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption (ratified by Mexico on May 27, 1997) and urging \n     the Government of Mexico to participate fully in the \n     Convention's formal implementation monitoring mechanism;\n       (8) helping the Government of Mexico to strengthen \n     education and training opportunities throughout the country, \n     with a particular emphasis on improving rural education; and\n       (9) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create \n     incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States \n     to return to Mexico.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Bilateral Partnership on \n     Health Care.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of Mexico should \n     enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and \n     burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States \n     due to legal and illegal immigration, including--\n       (1) increasing health care access for poor and under served \n     populations in Mexico;\n       (2) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma \n     health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on \n     expanding prenatal care in the United States-Mexico border \n     region;\n       (3) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated \n     workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico \n     in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home \n     country; and\n       (4) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program \n     with the private sector to cover the health care needs of \n     Mexican nationals temporarily employed in the United States.\n\n              TITLE VI--FAMILY UNITY AND BACKLOG REDUCTION\n\n     SEC. 1601.

We hope we can work \nthat out either later tonight or in the morning.\n  We would like to move through this bill, but we cannot do that unless \npeople are willing to let us vote on their amendments. So after the \nvote tomorrow at 10:30, hopefully we will have more to tell the body as \nto what votes have been able to be lined up for later in the day.\n  Everyone should know that it is unlikely there will be any votes from \nabout 1 to 2 o'clock tomorrow.
