Mr. President, relative to the conference report that is \nbefore the Senate, this emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nincludes $95 billion for the Department of Defense, primarily to fund \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is approximately $4 \nbillion more than the President requested for the Department of \nDefense, including $2.2 billion above the President's request for \nhealth care for our service men and women and their families.\n  When the military forces are in harm's way, it is our solemn duty to \nprovide the equipment they need and the health care they deserve, and \nwe are meeting that duty with this bill. We also owe it to our troops \nto give them the best chance to succeed. In the case of Iraq, a \nmajority of the Members of the Congress and a majority of Americans \nbelieve a change in course in Iraq will provide the best chance of \nsuccess. That is at the heart of the debate here in Washington.\n  There is at least a broad, if not universal, consensus that the war \nin Iraq will not be won militarily and that a political settlement by \nthe Iraqi leaders is required to end the sectarian violence and defeat \nthe insurgency. General Petraeus made that point in a press conference \nin Baghdad on March 8 when he said:\n\n       Any student of history recognizes that there is no military \n     solution to a problem like Iraq.\n\n  Iraq's own Prime Minister Maliki noted 5 months ago that:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the \n     [Iraqi] politicians.\n\n  The debate, then, is how best to bring about the political settlement \nthat must take place. There are some who say security, particularly in \nBaghdad, is the key, and if Baghdad can be made secure, the Iraqi \npoliticians will have breathing room to reach the agreements and pass \nthe legislation that will lead to reconciliation.\n  Others, including this Senator, believe the Iraqis must be pressured \nto take responsibility for their own future, and the best way to do \nthat is to convince them our military presence is not open-ended.\n  The emergency supplemental before us is designed to do just that. It \nforces the Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for their own country \nby ending the open-ended commitment to provide a U.S. security blanket. \nInstead, it would require the beginning of a partial reduction of U.S. \ntroops, leaving time for the Iraqis to make the political compromises \nthey promised to make months ago.\n  The bill calls for a change in mission for our forces in Iraq, from \npolicing a civil war to a limited support mission, so that the Iraqis \ncan finally realize our military presence in Iraq is not open-ended; \nthat the future of their country is in their hands, not ours.\n  The present course in Iraq is failing. The Iraqis are no closer to \npolitical reconciliation today than they were when the surge began. \nInstead of Prime Minister Maliki's government becoming stronger, it \nappears it is weaker. Disagreements in the Government have prevented \nproposals for debaathification and oil revenue sharing legislation from \neven being forwarded to the Council of Representatives for \nconsideration.\n  The committee considering amendments to the Iraqi constitution \nappears to be as far from completing its work as it has always been. \nMeanwhile, the Iraqi Assembly is apparently planning to go on a 2-month \nrecess at the end of June. Now, let me repeat that since it is so \nunbelievable. The Iraqi Council of Representatives is apparently \nplanning to go on a 2-month recess at the end of June.\n  Incredibly enough, a man named Hasan Suneid, who is a lawmaker and \nthe adviser to Prime Minister Maliki, was quoted in the paper the other \nday as saying, ``Time is irrelevant.''\n  Well, time is plenty relevant to us, to our troops, and to their \nfamilies. Baghdad is burning while the politicians in Iraq avoid \nresponsibility for their own country's future. Even the detonation of a \nsuicide bomb within the Green Zone killing Iraqi parliamentarians has \nfailed to change the political situation. It appears the Iraqi factions \nare content to seek vengeance rather than reconciliation.\n  Senior administration officials, including Secretary Gates, Secretary \nRice, and Ambassador Khalilzad have, in fact, wisely used this debate \nin Congress in an attempt to pressure the Iraqis to achieve political \nreconciliation.\n  Secretary Gates said the week before last in Jordan:\n\n       The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to \n     the Iraqis that American patience is limited. The strong \n     feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable \n     probably has had a positive impact . . . in terms of \n     communicating to the Iraqis that it is not an open-ended \n     commitment.\n\n  Secretary Gates told a press conference just last Thursday:\n\n       I think one of the ancillary benefits of the debate on the \n     Hill is that the Iraqis have to know that this isn't an open-\n     ended commitment. The President has said that our patience is \n     not unlimited. I don't think we've been very stubborn in \n     communicating these messages to the Iraqis.\n\n  That is what Secretary Gates said: ``I don't think we've been very \nstubborn in communicating these messages to the Iraqis'' that our \npatience is not unlimited. Well, we need to change course in Iraq. We \nneed to stubbornly communicate our message to the Iraqis. Voting for \nthis bill will help to send that message.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5124-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am glad we are ready to begin again, \nafter we finished up on our bill yesterday.\n  Finally, we will be prepared to deal with the funding for our troops \ntoday. It has taken a very long time but, nevertheless, I am glad the \ntime has arrived.\n  I just wanted to say that as often is the case, I have had the \nopportunity to visit with several students from my wife's class at \nWashington Lee High School. Each year I look forward to her bringing \nher class here because it is important for young people to understand \nthis is their Government as much as yours and mine. So I am delighted \nat the number of young people who come here from Wyoming and, in this \ncase, from Virginia.\n  To learn more about this Government is so important, and these young \npeople are, of course, tomorrow's responsible leaders. I am just \ndelighted to have them here. We talked about the American COMPETES Act. \nThese students and opportunities for them is what it is all about. That \nis what we have been talking about and thinking about.\n  The American COMPETES Act has a good purpose and a good role. America \nmust maintain its competitiveness to be able to continue to compete. We \nneed to challenge our young people and encourage them to challenge \nthemselves to be prepared to move into the future and be prepared to \ntake advantage of the opportunities this country provides for all of \nus.\n  However, I do not believe the solution to keeping America in the \nforefront of technology simply lies in throwing money there, without \nany particular reason to expect results from it.\n  We have gotten in the position here in the Congress that when we hear \nof a problem--and there are problems--if we can pass a bill and send \nsome money, then we have accomplished our job. I am sorry, I do not \nbelieve that is necessarily the case. I think we have to take a look at \nwhere we are on these issues. For instance, how many Federal \neducational programs are there now? What kind of a job have we done in \ntrying to see how effectively those dollars have been spent and are \nbeing spent? So just having more programs and more money is not \nnecessarily the answer.\n  Certainly, these students and these schools need more money, and they \nneed to have programs, but they really need support from dedicated \nteachers,\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nfrom parents, from family members, and friends.\n  Having discussed this topic on the floor before, we have to be \ncareful about the number of Federal programs we continue. We talk about \nthe budget over here, about deficit spending, and yet at the same time: \nWell, let's have another bill, let's have another $60 billion and go \nforward with programs of that kind.\n  It is important that we try to concern ourselves about adding more \nprograms and not knowing necessarily where and how effectively that \nmoney is going to be spent. Unfortunately, most of the programs we put \nout there are institutionalized. They suddenly become part of the \npermanent process and are there forever and become permanent fixtures, \nirrespective of whether there are objectives to be met and whether they \nare meeting them. I hope, as we go forward, as we are now in the \nprocess of doing, with appropriations and funding for the year 2008 and \nbeing concerned about the deficit, about the amount of spending the \nFederal Government finds itself in and, frankly, the role of the \nFederal Government in terms of what the States should be doing, what \nlocal schools should be doing, these kinds of things, we will \nreevaluate what is the role of the Federal Government and how we can be \nmost effective. We have a role, there is no question, but there is a \nlimit to that role.\n  It is a little easy for us, if we see a problem, to say: Let's just \npass another bill. Let's put some more money out there and then just \nwalk away from it and say: We have done our job. That is not \nnecessarily the case.\n  I believe the America COMPETES Act has good intentions. Perhaps it \nwill do some good. But I have to say again that in retrospect, it is \nimportant that we look at what is the role of the Federal Government. \nWhat programs are we doing and how do we measure their effectiveness \nand how do we measure how long they will be there and how can we \nmeasure their impact. We will find out soon how that works.\n\n\n                           iraq supplemental\n\n  A word or two about the supplemental bill that will come before us \ntoday. We have talked about this a number of times. I must say that I \nam not pleased with how we have gotten to where we are. It has \nabsolutely taken too long. There is no question, as my friend from the \nother side of the aisle says, that we need to talk about this issue. We \nhave talked about it. We need to take positions. We have taken \npositions. That is a good thing. But the idea of simply stalling the \nmoney that is necessary to support our troops who are already there is \nnot a good idea. Funding is not the way to deal with our feelings about \nit.\n  In particular, the process has taken too long. Billions in \nnonemergency spending has been added to the bill, things that may have \nmerit, some of them, and some of them do not. Fortunately, some of them \nhave been taken out. But the idea of adding spending that is totally \nirrelevant to funding the troops just doesn't seem to be appropriate. \nIt sort of indicates the way we keep spending money around here and \nfinding ways to hook it onto something else. I am disappointed in that.\n  The majority has attached an increase in the minimum wage to this \nbill. How does that fit the funding for the troops in Afghanistan and \nIraq? During the conference, additional measures not in either the \nHouse nor Senate bill were quietly tucked in. We are using this as a \ntransportation system for a lot of things, when the challenge before us \nis that we have troops there who have to be funded. There is talk \nabout: Well, they don't need to be funded until July because they can \ntake their money from somewhere else. Then you are taking money away \nfrom the various kinds of health care that is available for veterans \nand other things that are equally important.\n  What is most frustrating is the majority has used the parliamentary \nmaneuver to deny a vote that I had intended as an amendment on the most \negregious spending. We didn't get a chance to put that on the floor. \nCertainly, if there is anything that is appropriate, that would have \nbeen the way.\n  At any rate, we seem to have lost our focus somewhat. We had a good \nreport yesterday from the commanding general in Iraq. He indicated that \nwhile we are not experiencing runaway success, we are beginning to see \nsuccess in a new approach with new leadership, and they need our \nsupport. I am optimistic the Senate will have another opportunity to \nget through this, get it right, and get the funding to the troops. I \nwill do my part to ensure that we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Wyoming in \nrising to express my concerns about the budgetary problems the Army and \nMarine Corps are going to face because the Democratic majority has \ncommitted to staging a showdown with the White House instead of \nfulfilling our obligation to fund the military.\n  Over 2 months ago, the former Army Chief of Staff, General \nSchoomaker, testified before the Armed Services Committee that if the \nArmy and Marine Corps do not get the supplemental funding by mid-April, \nthe services will experience a serious cashflow problem and have to \ntake extraordinary measures that will slow down the whole system. On \nApril 11, the Secretary of Defense wrote Congress and stated:\n\n       It is a simple fact of life that if the Fiscal Year 2007 \n     supplemental legislation is not enacted soon, the Army faces \n     a real and serious funding problem that will require \n     increasingly disruptive and costly measures to be initiated--\n     measures that will inevitably negatively impact readiness and \n     Army personnel and their families.\n\n  Moreover, on April 19, the Associated Press reported that the $70 \nbillion provided to fight the war has mostly run out. I want to say \nthat again: The $70 billion that the Army needs to fight this war has \nmostly run out.\n  In order to stretch their remaining funds through June, the Army is \nslowing down the purchase of nonessential repair parts. I am not sure \nwhat repair parts during a war are nonessential. I guess we will have \nto leave it to our generals to inform their soldiers that their \nvehicles are not getting repaired because they are nonessential.\n\n  There is important funding in this supplemental. For example, Senator \nBiden offered an amendment to purchase more mine-resistant, ambush-\nprotected vehicles for our soldiers in the field. I commend Senator \nBiden for offering this amendment. I commend his commitment to it. \nSenator Biden said two things with which I wholeheartedly agree. First, \nhe said that providing funding for these vehicles is a moral \nimperative. Second, he said it was a matter of life and death. I agree. \nHis amendment and the supplemental as a whole represent a moral \nimperative for every Senator. It is a matter of life and death for our \nsoldiers serving in combat. Yet the Democratic leadership is not \nhandling this issue as a matter of life and death because they are \ndetermined to send a bill to the President that he has said he will \nveto.\n  As we all know, the President's objection to this bill is the troop \nwithdrawal language that ties our commanders' hands and telegraphs to \nour enemies the time and place of our surrender. Congress should not \nand Congress must not get into the habit of interjecting itself into \nthe military chain of command. To do so invites disaster and moves the \ncountry from the premise of conducting our military operations with one \nCommander in Chief and not running it by committee.\n  I direct some of my comments to some of our colleagues on the other \nside, primarily the leadership. I have been very concerned and shocked \nrecently to read statements of members of the majority stating that \ntheir strategy is to send the President bills he will veto because it \nis politically advantageous. Some of our colleagues on the other side \nwere quoted as saying recently:\n\n       We are going to pick up Senate seats because of this war.\n\n  Quoting again:\n\n       We will break them, because they [the Republicans] are \n     looking extinction in the eye.\n\n  I would say to my Democratic colleagues, we are not the enemy. If you \nwant to break something, let's break the enemy. Let's break al-Qaida. I \nam concerned about where this debate is headed.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, as I have listened to our colleagues \ntalk about this war particularly of late, we have had Democratic \nleadership saying that the war was lost. If that is true, then who won? \nTerrorism? Al-Qaida?\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\nReligious extremists who murder the innocent? Or all of the above? If \nthis is a true and accurate representation of the majority's position, \nit is not surprising that Congress has not sent an emergency \nsupplemental to the President.\n  I serve on the Armed Services Committee. I have traveled several \ntimes to Iraq. I have visited, numerous times, Walter Reed Hospital and \nthe military hospital in Germany. I have to say that I have not talked \nto one GI who says the war is lost. I have not talked to one injured \nsoldier who says the war is lost. I have not talked to one officer who \nhas said the war is lost. I have not talked to one commander who has \nsaid the war is lost. The only place I hear the statement that the war \nis lost is right here from the Halls of our Nation's Capitol or from \nnews reports from Al-Jazeera or Iranian television quoting the majority \nleader of the Senate.\n  Our American soldiers believe they can win. Our American soldiers \nalways believe they can win. That is why they are American soldiers. \nThey are the best. It has to be very disturbing to our American \nsoldiers to constantly hear politicians in Washington, DC, telling them \nthey can't win. The Democratic leadership in Washington is playing a \ngame of roulette with the administration where the only losers will be \nthe American soldier.\n  We need to focus on providing our troops the equipment and resources \nthey need to win this war. It is a global war. We have to quit acting \nas if short-term political gains are going to win this war for us. They \nwill not. We need a unified and serious effort on the part of both \nparties in the Congress to win this war and to keep our Nation secure. \nHistory is going to judge us based on how we respond to the crisis of \nour generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, instead of this body appointing \nan accusatory finger across the partisan aisle, what this body ought to \nbe doing is invoking the old principle that in the old days, at the \nwater's edge, partisanship stops. We have seen on both sides of the \naisle too much of that partisanship, particularly in matters of war and \npeace. There is a genuine disagreement not only over the conduct of the \nwar but the very fact that we are in this war to begin with. We can't \ndo anything about that now. We were given false information, massaged \ninformation, misinformation that caused us to enter this war and, after \na quick and very decisive and very impressive victory, then set about \nthe process of an occupation that was fraught with error and \nmisinformation. But that was then, and now is now. What is in the \ninterest of the United States? Clearly it is to stabilize Iraq, if that \nis possible.\n  A distinguished group of Americans, five Republicans and five \nDemocrats in the Iraq study commission, unanimously came together last \nwinter and said what they thought would be the plan, the best way we \ncould stabilize Iraq, led by an eminent and distinguished Republican, \nformer Secretary of State and a former Chief of Staff in the White \nHouse to President Reagan, Jim Baker, and led by the longtime and \ndistinguished and equally as respected former Congressman and former \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the House, Lee Hamilton.\n  Now, this is not a question about losing or winning a war; this is a \nquestion about, What is the best chance we have for stabilizing Iraq? \nBecause clearly a stabilized Iraq in that part of the world is going to \ncertainly help the neighbors in the region, and it is certainly going \nto help us, and clearly it is going to help the Iraqis.\n  So what did the Iraq study commission say? Well, they said it very \nclearly. I am reading from the Executive Summary:\n\n       The primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to \n     one of supporting the Iraqi army, which would take over \n     primary responsibility for combat operations. By the first \n     quarter of 2008--\n\n  By the way, that is a year from now, that is April, that is the end \nof March--\n\n       By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected \n     developments in the security situation on the ground, all \n     combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be \n     out of Iraq.\n\n  It is true, they did not say ``should be out of Iraq.'' They said \n``could be out of Iraq.'' But they are giving a blueprint.\n  I continue with the quote:\n\n       At that time, U.S. combat forces in Iraq could be deployed \n     only in units embedded with Iraqi forces, in rapid-reaction \n     and special operations teams, and in training, equipping, \n     advising, force protection, and search and rescue.\n\n  I conclude this particular paragraph:\n\n       Intelligence and support efforts would continue. A vital \n     mission of those rapid reaction and special operations forces \n     would be to undertake strikes against al Qaeda in Iraq.\n\n  That is the Iraq Study Group report. It said: Go after al-Qaida. It \nsaid: Continue to train the Iraqi forces. It specifically talked about, \nin that training, embedding with Iraqi forces. It said ``force \nprotection,'' meaning force protection for our forces and for U.S. \npersonnel. And it said ``search and rescue'' missions. That is exactly \nwhat we have in front of us today to vote on.\n  Now, there is additional language put in here about the President \nwould have to certify and waive on this and that progress by the Iraqi \nGovernment. Clearly, you want to give some indicators to the Iraqi \nGovernment of what we expect. Again, what we are voting on today is a \ngoal of having redeployed--basically, with the waiver by the President, \nwe are talking about October 1. This is April--May, June, July, August, \nSeptember--6 months from now is the goal of starting the redeployment. \nIt does not say ``withdrawal,'' it says ``redeployment'' because \n``redeployment'' is a term that is then defined by all of those things \nwe just talked about. That is in this legislation we are going to vote \non today.\n  Now, there are those in this body I certainly respect who would say \nthey do not want any kind of conditions put on the President in order \nto conduct the war. I respect that. That is a difference of opinion \nthat we have. But common sense would tell you that you cannot conduct a \nwar if you do not have the support of the American people. The American \npeople clearly want change. So it is time for us to start the process \nof the change.\n  Now, this Senator, along with most every Senator in this Senate, was \nin the meeting yesterday with General Petraeus. There was clearly a \nmessage that General Petraeus had hope, but seasoned with a great deal \nof reality, realizing the additional complexity. There were no clear-\ncut answers yesterday in us meeting with the top general over there in \nIraq, a general whom we all admire and respect. Yes, there is still \nhope. But there is also the need for change. This document starts the \nprocess of the change.\n  Now, it is my hope that after we go through this exercise, it will \npass today--narrowly, just like it passed a month ago narrowly--the \nlegislation will go down to the President--and he has already said he \nis going to veto it--and then is the opportunity for cooler heads, as \nthe Good Book says, to come let us reason together. That is my hope.\n  So I will be voting for this supplemental funding request that funds \nthe troops, that funds other necessary emergencies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5126-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5126-S5128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the subject of the \nemergency war supplemental and the adverse impact this political \ntheater is having on our efforts in Iraq.\n  For me, this political gamesmanship calls to mind a book written some \n50 years ago about some very brave men in our Nation's history--not \nbrave in the sense of today's marines and soldiers, who are doing the \ngrunt work in Afghanistan and Iraq to ensure that the free world can \nsleep in peace at night. No, the men in this book were brave for a very \ndifferent reason.\n  The book I am referring to is the 1956 classic, ``Profiles in \nCourage,'' written by a young U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, John F. \nKennedy, who later became our 35th President. The book is an account of \nmen of principle, integrity, and bravery in American politics.\n  Then-Senator Kennedy profiled eight exceptional U.S. Senators from \nthroughout the Senate's history whom he considered to be models of \nvirtue\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\nand courage under pressure. These men defied the public opinion of the \nday in order to do what was right for the country even though they \nsuffered severe criticism and losses in popularity because of these \nactions.\n  The Senators profiled included: Thomas Benton from Missouri, for \nstaying in the Democratic Party despite his opposition to extending \nslavery into the territories; Sam Houston from Texas, for opposing \nTexas' secession from the Union--for refusing to support this \nsecession, Houston was later deposed as Governor--and Edmund Ross from \nKansas, for voting for acquittal in the Andrew Johnson impeachment \ntrial. As a result of Ross' vote, Johnson's presidency was saved and \nthe stature of the office was preserved.\n  In this definitive book on political courage, each of the eight \nSenators profiled is today considered a ``hero'' for having done the \nright thing, not the popular thing.\n  They are heroes today for having filtered out the political noise of \nthe chattering classes of their day.\n  They are heroes for having done what was in the best interest of the \nUnited States and not in their own political best interest.\n  They are heroes for doing what was necessary instead of simply doing \nwhat was easy.\n  Today, each of us faces our own ``Profiles in Courage'' moment. A \nclash of visions regarding America's future has brought us to this \npoint.\n  One vision has America defeating al-Qaida and the forces of Islamic \nfascism.\n  The other vision has America surrendering in Iraq and allowing \njihadist forces to determine Iraq's future, making America and the rest \nof the world less safe.\n  These competing visions must be reconciled by each individual \nSenator.\n  But let's understand exactly what the majority party is attempting to \naccomplish by hijacking this legislation. I could speak at length about \nthe ample amounts of unrelated pork that have somehow found their way \ninto this emergency supplemental. Those embarrassments continue to be \naddressed by my colleagues.\n  What I would like to do is spend a few minutes specifically \ndiscussing the misguided efforts of the other side to revise, or more \naccurately restrict, this Nation's policy in Iraq.\n  Democrats are once again attempting to constrain this Nation's \nCommander in Chief in the execution of his constitutional duties; this \ntime by inserting language in the emergency supplemental that would \nlimit the use of force in Iraq to certain congressionally preapproved \nends.\n  It would also provide a date certain for the surrender of U.S. forces \nin Iraq. This language within the emergency supplemental \nunconstitutionally micromanages the conduct of the war from the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. It does so by providing that Congress, and not the \nCommander in Chief, would determine just how our military is to be \nused. It inserts 535 ``commanders in chief'' into the decisionmaking \nprocess when it comes to the execution of military operations in Iraq.\n  This is not what our Founding Fathers intended.\n  This legislation, as it is currently written, directs the President \nto begin the surrender of our forces no later than October 1 of this \nyear, and calls for all U.S. combat forces to be back in the United \nStates 180 days after that.\n  As a matter of policy, even the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Commission \nspecifically considered and rejected setting a timetable for our \nwithdrawal from Iraq.\n  But this current debate we are engaged in regarding the emergency \nsupplemental affects more than politicians on Capitol Hill. It goes far \nbeyond the political posturing taking place on Sunday talk shows. It is \nmore than a mere power struggle between the Commander in Chief and a \nnew majority in Congress asserting itself.\n  No, this debate directly affects the health and well being of our men \nand women in uniform; men and women that this Congress authorized the \nPresident to send to Iraq.\n  This is unconscionable.\n  Recently, the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on overseas basing \nissues. Witnesses represented the Department of Defense and the \nDepartments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n  As the ranking member, I asked these witnesses about the impact that \ndelaying enactment of the emergency supplemental would have on \nDepartment of Defense operations, particularly those associated with \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  I learned from them that the Army has already started to feel the \nfinancial squeeze of our failure to pass the emergency supplemental and \nhas begun to limit certain functions.\n  They have had to curtail the training of Army Guard and Reserve units \nwithin the United States, thus reducing their readiness levels.\n  They have had to reprioritize predeployment training and eliminate \nanything that is not Iraq specific. No longer will units deploy to Iraq \ncapable of handling the full spectrum of possible military scenarios.\n  The Army has begun reducing quality of life initiatives, including \nthe routine upgrade of barracks and other facilities.\n  They have stopped the repair and maintenance of hundreds of tanks, \nBradleys, and other vehicles necessary for deployment training.\n  The impact only gets worse with time.\n  If the emergency supplemental funding is not received by May 15--less \nthan a month from now--the Army will undertake further actions.\n  These include:\n  reducing the pace of equipment overhaul work at Army depots, which \nwill worsen the equipment availability problems facing stateside units;\n  curtailing training rotations for brigade combat teams scheduled for \ndeployment to Iraq. This will also slow the arrival of more brigades \nwhich are needed to expand the Army's rotational pool and reduce stress \non existing units.\n  This smaller rotational pool will result in the further extension of \nthose currently deployed until their replacements are judged to be \nready for deployment.\n  The Army would be forced to implement a civilian hiring freeze.\n  They would have to prohibit the execution of new contracts and \nservice orders.\n  They would have to hold or cancel repair parts orders in the \nnondeployed Army, directly impacting the units' ability to deploy with \nmission capable equipment and fully trained soldiers.\n  I shudder to think of what additional steps the military will need to \ntake if Democrats remain as stubborn and irresponsible regarding the \nemergency supplemental as they have proven to be up to this point.\n  Before we consider voting on any emergency supplemental legislation \nwhich includes the offending surrender language, we need to seriously \nask ourselves: in 20, or 50, or even 100 years, will those generations \nthat follow us look upon us as the heroes of our time for having done \nthe courageous thing?\n  Will we be admired for having chosen to do what was in the best \ninterest of the Nation, in the best interest of the world, regardless \nof the political costs?\n  Or will this body be viewed with disdain for having cast our vote to \nset certain a date for our surrender to the forces of al-Qaida?\n  Will we be viewed as inhumane for condemning some 25 million Iraqis \nto a living hell on earth?\n  It is my opinion that this misguided effort by my Democratic \ncolleagues is a surrender strategy for Iraq; a surrender that will take \nus at least a year to complete, but a surrender strategy nonetheless.\n  I join today with the President in refusing to surrender to the likes \nof al-Qaida.\n  Calling this surrender a ``withdrawal,'' or a ``redeployment,'' is \nlike putting lipstick on a pig. No matter what you call it, it is still \na pig. And no matter what you call this surrender, it is still a \n``surrender''.\n  Now, there might have been a time in our history when we could have \nhidden behind our own borders and not had to worry about what was \nhappening in the Middle East or any place else across the ocean. Those \ndays haven't existed for some time.\n  Remember the consequences of our abandonment of Afghanistan in the \n1980s. We supported the Mujahedin against the Soviets until the Soviets \nsurrendered, or ``withdrew'' as my Democratic friends would call it, in\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n1989. Then we left the Afghans to fend for themselves. In short order, \nthey had a civil war. The Taliban rose to power and provided a safe \nhaven for al-Qaida. Osama bin Laden established training camps where he \ntrained some 20,000 terrorists in the late 1990s; graduates of those \ncamps came here and killed 3,000 of our fellow citizens on 9/11.\n  Perhaps, at the end of the Cold War, it was difficult to imagine the \nimpact of the U.S. leaving Afghanistan. The same cannot be said about \nleaving Iraq. We have to prevail in Iraq, and we can if we don't choose \nto surrender.\n  In closing, I have a question for those on the other side.\n  If my Democratic colleagues believe our current struggle against \nIslamic jihadists in Iraq is such a mistake; if you honestly believe \nthat you were lied to or misled into initially supporting this war and \nthat there is no useful purpose for continuing; if you believe that the \nlives of those in uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice were \ntruly wasted; if you believe that al-Qaida and the threat of Islamic \nfascism confronting America is merely something invented by a small \nband of neoconservatives, or; if Islamic fascism is simply an \nideological movement that can be appeased and reasoned with; then why \nare you seeking to continue funding our fight in Iraq for even another \nday?\n  If you believe that Iraq is simply a mistake gone bad, then you \nshould at least have the courage of your convictions and act \naccordingly. Vote to end the funding now.\n  Don't string along those putting their lives on the line for you to \nmake some sort of weak political statement.\n  This may well be our ``Profiles in Courage'' moment. I implore you to \ndo the right thing, not the currently popular thing. Support our men \nand women in uniform, and do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5128-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I would like to speak just for a few \nmoments, not about the pending business, which I know is extremely \nimportant and that debate will go on throughout the day and perhaps \nover the next several days as we try to make decisions about \nsupplemental spending for the Gulf of Mexico and the importance of the \nemergency that is still underway there, and as we try to debate the \nbest way to find success in Iraq.\n  I wanted to take a moment to speak about another issue that is \nimportant today to many Americans. In fact, we are celebrating that day \non Capitol Hill. It is called Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day.\n  I have been honored over the many years with my cochair, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, who is on the floor of the Senate today, to cohost \nthis event for the Senate. We have many colleagues and staff members \nwho participate in bringing their children and grandchildren and \nfriends and neighbors to the Capitol to work to see the work of the \nSenate and the Capitol--how it happens, who makes it happen, and the \nsignificance of it. These children come from all over our country and \ntake this experience back to their classrooms and into their homes and \nneighborhoods and share with their friends throughout the year.\n  I thank Ms. Magazine for starting this. Over 35 million adults and \nchildren will participate today. So in skyscrapers all over America, \nand on farms out in our rural areas, in small businesses and \nrestaurants and small little boutique hotels, and even in home offices, \nchildren will be working with their parents or with their grandparents \nunderstanding the value of work, understanding and exploring options \nfor themselves as they grow, and trying to make choices about how they \ncan contribute significantly to this economy and to being part of the \nworld community.\n  So I am pleased today to be able to submit for the Record the names \nof 14 young ladies who are with me today. I am not going to take the \ntime to read their names, but I will submit them for the Record. They \nare from New Orleans, LA, and some from Manderville; some are from \nWashington, DC, friends of the family who are here; and others are from \noutlying areas such as Maryland and Virginia who have joined us today \nto be part of the Senate.\n  Already this morning some of these girls have participated in closing \nthe gap with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation that met on \nCapitol Hill out on the west lawn of our Capitol this morning to talk \nabout the great effort that is being made to address breast cancer, \nparticularly in this country, and to not only find cures but to offer \npreventive measures to help women and families stay healthy in our \ncountry. They have already participated in a press conference and will \nbe joining us later today as we work through our offices in and around \nthe Senate complex.\n  I wanted to welcome them to the Senate. I will submit their names to \nbe printed in the Record, and I encourage anyone in the Capitol \ncomplex, if you are not participating today, to think about next year \nand what you could do to contribute to make this day a special day for \nsome child in either your family or in your community who could use an \nextra boost or some insight into a possible career for themselves.\n  I thank Senator Reid for making the tour of the Senate possible today \nfor the young girls and boys who got to spend some time on the floor \nearlier this morning, and I thank minority leader Mitch McConnell for \narranging the special tours for that as well.\n  Mr. President, I again thank Ms. Magazine for an extraordinary \neffort. I know the children enjoy getting a day off from school, but it \nis more than that, and I have enjoyed participating these many years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Morgan Daigle, 11, New Orleans, LA, St. Dominic.\n       Christine Evans, 10, Washington, DC, National Cathedral \n     School.\n       Katherine Evans, 10, Washington, DC, National Cathedral \n     School.\n       Charlotte Ganucheau, 13, Mandeville, LA, Our Lady of the \n     Lake.\n       Sofia Gonzales, 13, New Orleans, LA, Metarie Park Country \n     Day School.\n       Jamie Hauptmann, 11, Mandeville, LA, Lake Harbor, Middle.\n       Lena Jones, 12, Washington, DC, St. Peter's Inter-parish \n     School Capitol Hill.\n       Gabrielle Kehoe, 11, New Orleans, LA, St. Pius X.\n       Kristen Landrieu, 12, New Orleans, LA, St. Dominic.\n       Natalie Mufson, 13, Washington, DC, Georgetown Day School.\n       Selin Odabas-Geldiay, 13, Washington, DC, Georgetown Day \n     School.\n       Erica Sensenbrenner, 14, New Orleans, LA, Dominican High \n     School.\n       Hannah Sensenbrenner, 12, New Orleans, LA, St. Dominic.\n       Eliza Matthews\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Iraqi \nsupplemental. I want to discuss this briefly with my colleagues. I will \nvote against the conference report with a deadline in it. A conference \nreport with a deadline in it, if it passes, and sending it to the \nPresident to sign--he is not going to sign it, but if he does sign it, \nif he would sign it--would be the day al-Qaida would declare victory. \nThe day the deadline is set would be the day they would declare \nvictory. I think it is the wrong way for us to go, and that is why I \nwill be voting against the supplemental.\n  I am very pleased to support the President in his efforts not to set \na deadline. I want to take the brief time I have to talk about a way \nforward because I think there is a bipartisan way forward. Once we get \nthrough this, and once this is forced upon the President, once he \nvetoes it, and once the veto is upheld--and I think these are motions \nwe should not be going through because they take away precious time \nfrom focusing on a way forward, on a political solution that involves \nboth sides of the aisle--we should focus on federalism in Iraq. It is \nsomething Senator Biden has spoken often about on the Democratic side, \nand I have spoke about on this side: federalism that will require a \nlongtime presence by the United States in Iraq.\n  I have spoken several times on this floor about how Iraq is more than \nthree groups in one country: a Kurdish group, a Sunni group, and a Shia \ngroup. It has been held together for much of its history--not \naltogether but in much of its history--by exterior forces that have not \nwanted it to fly apart, who still don't want it to fly apart. I think \nwe should recognize these realities as we did in the former Yugoslavia, \nas we are today in Sudan where the south is going to vote to secede, \nand recognize these political forces and put in place a federated \nsystem: one country, three states, Baghdad as a Federal city where \npowers devolve to the states, and recognize that it will require a \nlong-term U.S. military presence to ensure that it will work. It is a \nroute forward, and it is a route forward that we can agree upon as a \nbody. It is a route forward that has allowed for the Iraqi \nConstitution, with a distribution of oil revenues equally distributed \nthroughout the country, to be able to help hold things together. It is \na route forward that can get us to a political equilibrium, that can \nget the violence down, that can give each of the groups their area, \ntheir region, and allow us to move forward. It requires a long-term \nU.S. military presence such as what happened in Bosnia and the Dayton \nAccords, where 15 years later we are still there and we are going to be \nthere for some period of time because if we are not, they are going to \ngo back to the violent ways they have had, and they have done \npreviously.\n  This is a realistic route that both sides of the aisle, that both \nparties, and the executive and legislative branches, could embrace.\n  I met last week with the Vice President about it. I talked with the \nNational Security Adviser about it. Many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are saying: What is the plan? What is the exit plan? \nHow do we get out? Here is a route to be able to deal with this. But \nthey have to admit, as well, on their side that a timeline, a deadline \nwill not work. We cannot do that. We cannot hoist it upon the \nPresident, and it will not work in that region. As soon as you set that \ndeadline, as I said, al-Qaida will declare victory and people in the \nregion will start looking for security in other places. They will be \ngoing to militias and different groups, and it will further fragment \nthe country.\n  If we would just set our partisanship aside for a little while and \nthink about this, we would recognize that this is the situation we are \nin and this is the only viable solution forward. We don't want to bring \nback a dictator or allow one back into Iraq. We don't want Iraq to \ndevolve into a full-scale civil war with a terrorist state taking place \nin that country. We don't want to turn it over and just have the Shia \nrun the whole place and run over the Kurds and run over the Sunni in \nthe region. That is not realistic.\n  The other options are not viable and will not work. This is a route \nforward. I urge my colleagues that this prospect, this federalism that \nis enshrined in the Iraqi Constitution--the Iraqi Parliament passed a \nfederalism law last year--the Kurdish regions in northern Iraq show \nthat it is possible for Iraq and deepens its commitment to a Federal \nsystem. I urge my colleagues to embrace this after this is vetoed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator from West \nVirginia to yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized immediately following the remarks of Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  It has been 4 years since the President sent our troops into Iraq, 4 \nlong years. That is longer than it took to win World War II. More than \n3,300 troops have sacrificed their lives in Iraq, and nearly 25,000 \nhave been wounded--many severely.\n  With passage of this conference agreement, Congress will have \nappropriated more than $450 billion for the war in Iraq. Did my \ncolleagues hear that? Four hundred and fifty billion dollars. That \ncompares with the $296 billion which the United States spent on World \nWar II. Yet in the 4 years since our troops succeeded in removing \nSaddam Hussein from power, the President has failed--and I say this \nwith all due respect when I speak about the President--the President \nhas failed in his mission to bring peace and stability to the people of \nIraq. The troops had the courage and the strength to win the war, but \nthe President has not had the wisdom to win the peace. It is time--past \ntime--for a new direction in Iraq.\n  The agreement before us today provides that new direction. But rather \nthan admit the need to change course, the President--and I say this \nwith all due respect--continues to try to mislead the American public \nabout the war in Iraq.\n  He recently asked Congress to ``put partisanship on hold.'' But then \nhe, the President, voiced the incredible assertion that the attacks on \n9/11 are linked to the war in Iraq. That is not true, and the American \npeople know it.\n  The President complained that Congress is holding funding for the \ntroops hostage to funding for domestic needs. President Bush claims \nthat Democrats are adding porkbarrel spending to a bill intended for \nthe troops. The President has charged that Democrats are ``legislating \ndefeat'' in Iraq.\n  President Bush has tried to scare the pants off the public by \nsuggesting that our bill could result in death and destruction in \nAmerica. What utter nonsense. What hogwash. This Senate must not be a \nrubberstamp for this or any President. Under the Constitution, Congress \nhas a duty to question the war policies of this or any President. We \nmust listen to the voices of the people, and the American people have \nsent a very clear message to Washington: It is time to start to bring \nour troops home from Iraq.\n  The Congress has responded, crafting a new direction that will spur \nthe Iraqi Government to pursue real political reconciliation in that \ncountry. The American people do not support an open-ended U.S. military \noccupation in Iraq. It is time for the truth; it is time for the White \nHouse to stop the fear mongering and face the truth.\n  In the book of John, chapter 8, verse 32 of the King James version of \nthe Holy Bible are these words:\n\n       And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you \n     free.\n\n  The Congress is not holding funding for the troops hostage to \ndomestic porkbarrel spending. The $6.9 billion for rebuilding the gulf \ncoast after Hurricane Katrina is not pork barrel spending. Ask the \ncitizens of New Orleans. The $1.8 billion for the VA to provide first-\nclass health care to our wounded veterans is not porkbarrel spending. \nAsk the troops who are waiting for care, and ask their families. I know \n$20 million to repair Walter Reed Hospital is not pork barrel spending. \nThe $650 million for the SCHIP child health program to deal with the \nshortfall in 14 States is not porkbarrel\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nspending. Ask the parents with sick children. The $2.25 billion for \nsecuring the country from terrorist attack, including port and border \nsecurity, transit security, funds to improve screening for explosives \nat airports, and/or screening cargo on passenger aircraft is not \nporkbarrel spending. It is homeland security to prevent the death and \ndestruction which President Bush warns about.\n  This country must not forsake critical domestic needs because of this \nPresident's single-minded obsession with his failed mission. Congress \nhas appropriated more than $38 billion for rebuilding Iraq, and this \nagreement adds another $3 billion. I simply do not understand why this \nPresident--our President--is eager to commit billions of dollars to \nrebuild Baghdad but absolutely opposes additional money to rebuild the \ngulf coast here in America. Why does President Bush decry needed funds \nfor the Veterans' Administration to build a first-class health care \nsystem for our brave troops?\n  Porkbarrel spending? I think not. The conference agreement that is \nbefore the Senate today totals $124 billion. It is lower than the House \nbill. Yet essential funding for gulf coast recovery, veterans medical \ncare, homeland security, and agricultural disaster relief remains.\n  The conference report also includes an increase in the minimum wage--\nthe first increase since 1997. It is needed, it is fair, and it is long \noverdue.\n  There is also $4.9 billion in tax incentives for small businesses \nthat are fully paid for in the bill. Small business is the backbone of \nour economy and these incentives will help economic growth.\n  This bill includes more than $100 billion for the Department of \nDefense--nearly $4 billion above the President's inadequate request. It \nprotects the troops by including $1.2 billion above the President's low \nnumber for mine-resistant vehicles.\n  This bill cares for the troops by providing $2.1 billion more than \nthe President for health care, including more resources for troops with \ntraumatic brain injury. Porkbarrel? I think not.\n\n  The President--our President--claims this is a partisan bill. The \nPresident claims Congress is trying to micromanage the war, \nsubstituting our judgment for the judgment of our generals. The \nPresident knows better.\n  The Constitution says that ``the Congress shall have power''--do you \nknow what that means? The Congress, that is us--``the Congress shall \nhave power to . . . provide for the common Defence.'' It is the \nCongress--yes, it is the Congress--that is given the sole power to \ndeclare war. The Congress is sworn to ``raise and support Armies.'' The \nCongress has heard the voices of the people, and we have responded as \nwe are elected to do.\n  This conference agreement provides a new directive for the war in \nIraq. It is patriotic, not partisan, to help the President to see the \ntruth--the truth. It is our duty. It is a duty born of love for this \ngreat country, the Constitution, and the American people.\n  If the President decides to veto the bill, he will be holding funding \nfor the troops hostage to his stubborn insistence on going into Iraq \nand the resulting disaster caused by his, the President's, war \npolicies.\n  I encourage all Members to vote for this conference report. We can \nsend a strong message to the White House. We can help this President \nface the truth. Four years after our troops removed Saddam Hussein from \npower, the President's policies simply are not working. They must \nchange. We must come together as a country to repair the damage caused \nby this horrendous war--this horrendous war--and chart a new direction \nin Iraq.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is to be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the majority side, including time reserved \nfor the leader, there is 53 minutes. And on the minority side, \nincluding the time of the leader, there is 74 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speakers \nbe in the following order: that following Senator Hutchison, I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, then Senator Lieberman, then to Senator \nDurbin for 5 minutes, to Senator Inhofe, and then to Senator Kennedy \nfor 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, and I won't object, I am \nwondering why we are confining the time to 5 minutes if we have that \nmany minutes remaining. If the Senator wishes to expand the time--\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I inform the Senator that I was limiting \nthe Senators on our side to 5 minutes. The Senator from Oklahoma has \nunlimited time. I did not give time to speak on the Senator's side.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry: There is a unanimous consent \nagreement already on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. What is the amount allocated for Senator Inhofe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, Senator Inhofe \nis provided 5 minutes.\n  Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, does the time start now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, when Tom Brokaw wrote the book ``The \nGreatest Generation,'' it reminded America what is great about our \ncountry. It reminded us that men and women have sacrificed through the \nyears for our country to make sure it was free for the next generation.\n  Can you imagine in the middle of World War II the Congress mandating \nthe withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe and the Pacific, oblivious to \nthe facts on the ground or the absolute necessity to win? Can you even \nimagine in the middle of the Cold War if Congress had required the \nwithdrawal of troops from the same parts of the world, thinking that if \nwe withdrew our troops, the Communists would do the same and peace \nwould prevail?\n  If earlier Congresses had done what it appears this Congress is \ntrying to do, freedom would have died in Europe, it would have died \nwhere it was in Asia, and who knows what would have happened in the \nfuture in America.\n  Today we have to ask ourselves: Are we worthy of the sacrifices so \nmany have made in the past? Are we going to stand for freedom and fight \nfor future Americans to have the same opportunities we have had because \nso many brave men and women have sacrificed?\n  There are those who say this isn't a world war; it is a civil war; it \nis over there, and we can't do anything about it. This is a tough time, \nthere is no question. Every one of us grieves when we see the killing \nof innocent people, Iraqis or Americans. But make no mistake about it, \nthis is a world war. Al-Qaida is in Iraq. General Petraeus said that \nyesterday. They have all the evidence. They know what al-Qaida is doing \nthere. They are attacking Americans. They are attacking Iraqis. They \nare trying to take over Iraq so they will have the capability to spread \ntheir terrorism throughout the world.\n  Does that mean they are in a civil war or are they an enemy we must \nface? If we don't face it there, we will face it in our own country. \nGeneral Abizaid, the former Commander of U.S. CENTCOM, said to the \nArmed Services Committee: If we leave, they will follow us home. If we \ndon't stand for freedom against this enemy, we will see it again. We \nwill see it on our own shores, and we will see it in other parts of the \nworld.\n  It would be unimaginable to me for Congress not to fund our troops \nand to send the mixed message out of Washington to the enemy, to our \nallies in such an important conflict that Congress isn't sure if \nAmerica has the will to stand and fight for freedom. And make no \nmistake about it, that is what is at stake in these votes that are \nhappening on Capitol Hill.\n  I have heard people say: Oh, we are going to vote on this every month \nbecause it is good for politics. They may think it is good for \npolitics, but I say the American people are going to get it. They are \ngoing to understand if we look weak in the Congress on standing and \nfighting the enemy wherever it is to keep Americans secure, they will \nsee what happens and they will question if\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\nwe are worthy of the sacrifices of the greatest generation.\n  I wondered when that book came out: If America were ever attacked, \nwould we stand and fight for freedom? I hope the answer is yes. I hope \nthe Congress will wake up and see that setting deadlines and sending \nthe signal to the enemy that we are weak is not worthy of the \nsacrifices of the past.\n  I hope Congress will do the right thing, strip this language, send \nthe money to the troops, and show that we, too, will stand for freedom \nfor our children.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \nsupplemental appropriations conference report, and let me begin by \nthanking Senator Byrd, the chairman of our Appropriations Committee, \nwho has worked diligently throughout the process to bring us to this \npoint today where we are addressing the critical infrastructure needs \nof this country as well as moving forward and changing course in Iraq.\n  I also thank and commend our majority leader, Senator Reid, for his \ncourage and his diligence in speaking out to get us to a point where we \nwill be sending a message to the President and to the country that we \nare willing to be courageous and change course in Iraq.\n  The agreement before us takes us on a responsible path on many of the \nmost pressing issues of the day--the war in Iraq, as we have talked \nabout and I spoke about on the floor yesterday, moving forward with the \nneeds of our veterans and our injured servicemembers, homeland \nsecurity, and the needs of our hard-hit communities here at home.\n  I realize my colleagues across the aisle would prefer that Congress \nobediently approve the President's request, but we are not. Instead, we \nare providing a funding bill that meets the needs of the American \npeople and those bravely serving for us overseas and all of those here \nat home.\n  Last November, on November 7, the American people called for an end \nto the rubberstamp Congress, and today we are here to deliver. This is \nnot, as some have tried to say, simply a war-funding bill. Instead, it \nprovides funding for critical needs here at home in addition to the \n$100 billion in funding that is directed to our troops who are serving \nus so honorably overseas.\n  In recent weeks, there has been a lot of heated rhetoric and plenty \nof mischaracterizations about this important bill. Much of that has \nfocused on the critically necessary language that is included in this \nbill that will transition our mission in Iraq and begin to redeploy our \ntroops.\n  As Senator Byrd stated, there is much more in this bill. We need to \npass this legislation because we need a new direction in Iraq, but we \nalso need to pass this bill because it provides everything our troops \nneed to complete their mission. It provides billions of dollars more to \ntake care of them when they come home, and it will, finally, help \nAmerican communities recover and rebuild.\n  In addition to funding for the troops overseas, this conference \nagreement provides more than $5 billion to ensure that our returning \ntroops and veterans get the critically important healthcare they have \nearned and deserve and which we now so vividly see is needed.\n  It provides $6.9 million for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and \nHurricane Rita. Senator Landrieu has been on the floor many times to \ntalk about those families who have been forgotten on the gulf coast. We \nhave not forgotten them in this bill, and this must get to the \nPresident and be signed to take care of those families.\n  We provide $2.25 billion in homeland security investments, including \nfunds for port security and mass-transit security, for explosives \ndetection equipment at our airports, and for initiatives in the 9/11 \nbill that recently passed here in the Senate. These are needs which we \ncannot forget, and we include them in this bill.\n  We provide $3\\1/2\\ billion to provide relief for our farmers and our \nranchers across the country. There are many families who are struggling \nand who have suffered from drought and agricultural disasters. For too \nlong, we have forgotten them in this country or ignored them or blocked \ntheir needs. The Senate today is saying we have not forgotten.\n  Finally, this conference agreement includes emergency funding for \nforest firefighting, a critical need throughout the West; low-income \nenergy assistance, drastically needed in many of our communities; and \npandemic flu preparations that all of us know we cannot forget.\n  I was on the floor yesterday to talk about much of the funding, but \ncritically important is the funding for our troops and our veterans \nwhen they come home. We all vividly saw the Walter Reed scandal just a \nfew weeks ago. We provide the funding to make sure our soldiers, \nwhether they are at Walter Reed or any of our facilities across the \ncountry, get the best of care, from traumatic brain injury to post-\ntraumatic stress syndrome.\n  Of course, again, we do have the Iraq language, which is so critical. \nI hope our colleagues, as we move this bill to the President, will \nremind him and the country that this bill is essential for our troops, \nfor those of us here at home, and for the future of this country. We \nurge him to read the bill and to sign it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The Senator said it well. The Senator could not have said it better. \nSenator Murray is right.\n  I thank Senator Murray, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 10 minutes \nallocated in his own right.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill we \nare debating today contains language that would have Congress take \ncontrol of the direction of our military strategy in Iraq. Like most \nSenators of both parties, I support the appropriations in this bill. \nBut because I strongly oppose its language on Iraq, I will vote no.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate majority leader spoke at the Woodrow \nWilson Center and laid out the case for why the bill now before this \nChamber, in his view, offers a viable alternative strategy for Iraq. It \nwas the most comprehensive recent argument in support of this position, \nand so I wish to address myself to its content respectfully and point \nby point.\n  I have great respect for my friend from Nevada. I believe he has \noffered this proposal in good faith, and therefore I wish to take it up \nin good faith and examine its arguments and ideas carefully and in-\ndepth because this is a very serious discussion we are having this \nmorning for America and its future security.\n  In his speech Monday, the Senate majority leader described the \nseveral steps this new strategy for Iraq would entail. The first step, \nhe said, is to:\n\n     . . . transition the U.S. mission away from policing a civil \n     war . . . to training and equipping Iraqi security forces, \n     protecting U.S. forces, and conducting targeted counter-\n     terror operations.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to step back for a moment and consider this plan. \nWhen we say that U.S. troops shouldn't be policing a civil war, that \ntheir operation should be restricted to the narrow list of missions, \nwhat does this actually mean? To begin with, it means our troops will \nnot be allowed to protect the Iraqi people from the insurgents and \nmilitias and terrorists who are trying to terrorize and kill them. \nInstead of restoring basic security, which General Petraeus has \neffectively argued should be the focus of any counterinsurgency \ncampaign, it means our soldiers would, instead, be ordered, by force of \nthis proposed law, not to stop the sectarian violence happening all \naround them no matter how vicious or horrific it becomes. I fear if we \nbegin to withdraw, it will become both vicious and horrific.\n\n  In short, it means telling our troops to deliberately and consciously \nturn their backs on ethnic cleansing, to turn their backs on the \nslaughter of innocent civilians--men, women, and children singled out \nand killed on the basis of their religion alone or their ethnicity. It \nmeans turning our backs on the policies that led us correctly to \nintervene in the civil war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s, the principles \nthat today lead many of us to cry out and demand intervention in \nDarfur. To me, this makes no moral sense at all.\n  It also makes no strategic or military sense. Al-Qaida's own leaders \nhave\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\nrepeatedly said that one of the ways they intend to achieve victory in \nIraq is to provoke civil war. They are trying to kill as many people as \npossible, precisely in the hope of igniting sectarian violence because \nthey know this is their best way to collapse Iraq's political center, \noverthrow Iraq's elected Government, radicalize its population, and \ncreate a failed state in the heart of the Middle East that they can use \nas a base. That is why al-Qaida blew up the Golden Mosque in Samarra \nlast February, and that is why we are seeing mass-casualty suicide \nbombings by al-Qaida in Baghdad today. The sectarian violence the \nmajority leader says he wants to order American troops to stop \npolicing, in other words, is the very same sectarian violence al-Qaida \nhopes will take it to victory. The suggestion that we can draw a bright \nlegislative line between stopping terrorists in Iraq and stopping civil \nwar in Iraq flies in the face of this reality. I don't know how to say \nit any more plainly. It is al-Qaida that is trying to inflame a full-\nfledged civil war in Iraq. So we cannot both fight al-Qaida and get out \nof the civil war. They are one.\n  The majority leader said on Monday that he believes U.S. troops will \nstill be able to conduct targeted counterterror operations under his \nplan. Even if we stop trying to protect civilians in Iraq, in other \nwords, we can still go after the bad guys. But, again, I ask my \ncolleagues, how would this translate into reality on the ground? How \nwould we find these terrorists, who do not gather on conventional \nmilitary bases or fight in conventional formations?\n  By definition, targeted counterterrorism requires our forces to know \nwhere, when, and against whom to strike, and that, in turn, requires \naccurate, actionable, real-time intelligence. This is the kind of \nintelligence which can only come from ordinary Iraqis--the sea of \npeople among whom the terrorists hide. That, in turn, requires \ninteracting with the Iraqi people on a close, personal, daily basis. It \nrequires winning individual Iraqis to our side because they conclude we \nare there on their side, gaining their trust, and convincing them they \ncan count on us to keep them safe from the terrorists if they share \nvaluable information about them. This is no great secret. It is at the \nheart of what is happening in Iraq today and is part of the Petraeus \nplan.\n  In sum, on this point, you can't have it both ways. You can't \nwithdraw combat troops from Iraq and still say you are going to fight \nal-Qaida there. If you believe that there is no hope of winning in Iraq \nor that the cost of victory there is not worth it, then you should be \nfor complete withdrawal as soon as possible.\n  There is another irony in the Iraq language in this bill. For most of \nthe past 4 years, under former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, the United \nStates did not try to establish basic security in Iraq. Rather than \ndeploying enough troops necessary to protect the Iraqi people, the \nfocus of our military has been on training and equipping Iraqi forces, \nprotecting our own forces, and conducting targeted antiterrorist sweeps \nand raids--in other words, the very same missions proposed by the \nproponents of the legislation before us.\n  That Rumsfeld strategy failed, and we know why it failed. It failed \nbecause we didn't have enough troops doing the right things to ensure \nsecurity, which in turn created an opening for al-Qaida and its allies \nto exploit and allowed sectarian violence to begin to run rampant. Al-\nQaida stepped into the security vacuum, as did the sectarian militias, \nand through horrific violence created a climate of fear and insecurity \nin which political and economic progress became impossible.\n  For years, many Members of Congress saw this and spoke to it. We \ntalked about it. We called for more troops and a new strategy--and, for \nthat matter, a new Secretary of Defense. Yet now, when President Bush \nhas come around, when he has acknowledged the mistakes that have been \nmade and the need to focus on basic security in Iraq and to install a \nnew Secretary of Defense and a new commander in Iraq, now his critics \nin Congress have changed their minds and decided that the old failed \nstrategy--the Rumsfeld strategy--wasn't so bad after all, because that \nis what would be adopted in the language on Iraq in this bill. What is \ngoing on here? What has changed so that the strategy we criticized and \nrejected in 2006 suddenly makes sense in 2007?\n  The second element in the plan outlined by the majority leader on \nMonday is the phased redeployment of our troops no later than October \n1, 2007. Let us be absolutely clear what this means. The legislation \nwould impose a binding deadline for U.S. troops to begin retreating \nfrom Iraq. That withdrawal would happen regardless of conditions on the \nground, regardless of the recommendations of General Petraeus--\nin short, regardless of reality, on October 1, 2007. As far as I can \ntell, none of the supporters of withdrawal have attempted to explain \nwhy October 1 is the magic date, what strategic or military \nsignificance this date holds. Why not September 1? Why not January 1 or \nApril 1? October 1, 2007, is a date as arbitrary as it is inflexible. \nIt is, I contend, a deadline for defeat.\n\n  How do proponents of this deadline defend it? On Monday, Senator Reid \ngave several reasons. First he said a date for withdrawal puts \n``pressure on the Iraqis to make desperately needed political \ncompromises.''\n  But will it? According to the legislation now before us, the \nwithdrawal will happen, regardless of what the Iraqi Government does. \nHow, then, if you are an Iraqi Government official, does this give you \nany incentive to make the right choices? On the contrary, there is \ncompelling reason to think a legislatively directed withdrawal of \nAmerican troops will have exactly the opposite effect than its sponsors \nintend.\n  I ask the Chair, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Connecticut has \nconsumed the 10 minutes he was allocated.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I gather Senator Cornyn has yielded his 5 minutes to \nme?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  This, in fact, is exactly what the most recent National Intelligence \nEstimate on Iraq predicted. A withdrawal of American troops in the \nmonths ahead would ``almost certainly lead to a significant increase in \nthe scale and scope of sectarian conflict, intensify Sunni resistance, \nand have adverse effects on national reconciliation.''\n  That is the NIE, broadly supported and embraced by proponents of the \nIraq language in this legislation.\n  Second, the majority leader said withdrawing our troops will ``reduce \nthe specter of the U.S. occupation which gives fuel to the \ninsurgency.''\n  My colleague from Nevada, in other words, is saying the insurgency is \nin some measure being provoked by the very presence of American troops. \nBy diminishing that presence, presumably the insurgency will diminish.\n  But I ask my colleagues, where is the evidence to support this \ntheory? I find none. In fact, all the evidence I find supports the \nopposite conclusion. Since 2003, and before General Petraeus took \ncommand and began implementing our new strategy there, American forces \nwere ordered on several occasions to pull back from Iraqi cities and \nregions, including Mosul, Fallujah, Tel'Afar, and Baghdad. What \nhappened in these places? Did they stabilize when the American troops \nleft? Did the insurgency go away? Of course not.\n  On the contrary, in each of these places where U.S. forces pulled \nback, al-Qaida and sectarian warriors rushed in. Rather than becoming \nislands of peace, they became safe havens for terrorists, islands of \nfear and violence.\n  So I ask advocates of withdrawal, on what evidence, on what data have \nyou concluded that pulling U.S. troops out will weaken the insurgency \nthere when every single experience we have had since 2003 suggests that \nwithdrawal, the kind of withdrawal mandated by this legislation, will \nstrengthen the terrorists and insurgents and increase violence?\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the words of Sheikh Abdul Sattar, one \nof the leading tribal leaders in Anbar Province, who is now fighting on \nour side against al-Qaida because he is convinced we are on his side. \nThis is what he told the New York Times when asked last month what \nwould happen if U.S. troops withdraw? He said:\n\n       In my personal opinion, and in the opinion of most of the \n     wise men of Anbar, if the American forces leave right now, \n     there will be civil war and the area will fall into total \n     chaos.\n\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\n\n  This is a man whose father was killed by al-Qaida, who risks his life \nevery day to work with us, a man who was described by one Army officer \nas ``the most effective local leader in Ramadi I believe the coalition \nhas worked with . . . since 2003.''\n  In his remarks earlier this week, Senator Reid also observed there is \n``a large and growing population of millions--who sit precariously on \nthe fence. They will either condemn or contribute to terrorism in the \nyears ahead. We must convince them of the goodness of America and \nAmericans. We must win them over.''\n  On this I completely agree with my friend from Nevada. But my \nquestion to him and others supporting this language is this: How does \nthis strategy you propose in this bill possibly help win over this \npopulation of millions in Iraq who sit precariously on the fence?\n  What message, I ask, does this legislation announce to these people \nwho are the majority in Iraq? How will they respond when we tell them \nwe are not longer going to make an effort to protect them and their \nfamilies against insurgents and death squads? How will they respond \nwhen we declare we will be withdrawing our forces, regardless of \nwhether they are making progress in the next few months toward \npolitical reconciliation? Where will their hopes be for a better life \nwhen we withdraw the troops that are the necessary precondition for the \nsecurity and stability and opportunity for a better life that the \nmajority of Iraqis clearly yearn for?\n  Do my friends believe this is the way to convince Iraqis and the \nworld of the goodness of America and Americans? Does anyone in this \nChamber believe that by announcing a date certain for withdrawal we \nwill empower Iraqi moderates, the mainstream, or enable Iraq's \nreconstruction, or open more schools for their children or more \nhospitals for their families or provide more freedom for everyone? With \nall due respect, this is a fantasy.\n  The third step the majority leader proposes is to impose ``tangible, \nmeasurable, and achievable benchmarks on the Iraqi government.''\n  I am all for such benchmarks. In fact, Senator McCain and I were \namong the first to propose legislation to apply such benchmarks on the \nIraqi government.\n  But I don't see how this plan will encourage Iraqis to meet these or \nany other benchmarks, given its ironclad commitment to abandon them--\nregardless of how they behave.\n  We should of course be making every effort to encourage \nreconciliation in Iraq and the development of a decent political order \nthat Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds can agree on.\n  But even if today that political solution was found, we cannot \nrationally think that our terrorist enemies like al-Qaida in Iraq will \nsimply vanish.\n  Al-Qaida is not mass murdering civilians on the streets of Baghdad \nbecause it wants a more equitable distribution of oil revenues. Its aim \nin Iraq is not to get a seat at the political table.\n  It wants to blow up the table--along with everyone seated at it. Al-\nQaida wants to destroy any prospect for democracy in Iraq, and it will \nnot be negotiated or reasoned out of existence. It must be fought and \ndefeated through force of arms. And there can be no withdrawal, no \nredeployment from this reality.\n  The fourth step that the majority leader proposed on Monday is a \n``diplomatic, economic, and political offensive . . . starting with a \nregional conference working toward a long-term framework for stability \nin the region.''\n  I understand why we are drawn to ideas such as those that are in this \nlegislation on Iraq. All of us are aware of the justified frustration, \nfatigue, and disappointment of the American people with Iraq. All of us \nwould like to believe there is a better solution--quicker, easier--to \nthe challenges we face in Iraq. But none of this gives us an excuse to \npaper over hard truths of which I have tried to speak. We delude \nourselves if we think we can wave a legislative wand and suddenly our \ntroops in the field will be able to distinguish between al-Qaida \nterrorism and sectarian violence or that Iraqis will suddenly settle \ntheir political differences because our troops are leaving or that \nsweet reason alone will suddenly convince Iraq and Syria to stop \ndestabilizing Iraq, stop enabling the terrorists and insurgents who are \nkilling too many Americans and Iraqis there today.\n  What we need now is a sober assessment of the progress we are \nbeginning to make and a recognition of the significant challenges we \nstill face. There are many uncertainties before us, many complexities, \nmany challenges. Barely half of the new troops General Petraeus \nrequested have even arrived in Iraq.\n  In following General Petraeus's path, there is no guarantee of \nsuccess, but there is hope and a new plan for success. In rejecting \nGeneral Petraeus's path, as this legislation would do, there is a \nguarantee of failure and, I fear, disaster. The plan embedded in this \nlanguage contains no reasonable prospects for success. It is a strategy \nbased on catch phrases and bromides rather than military realities and \nall that is on the line for us in Iraq.\n  It does not learn from the many mistakes that have been made in Iraq. \nRather, it promises to repeat them. Let me be absolutely clear. In my \nopinion, Iraq is not yet lost, but if we follow the plan in this \nlegislation, it will be lost and so, I fear, will much of our hope for \nstability in the Middle East and security from terrorism here at home. \nThat is why I will vote no.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, we are now in our fifth year of this \nconflict in Iraq, and throughout that time I have met with commanders \nof our Armed Forces, listened to their experiences and recommendations, \nand after much consideration I have come to the conclusion that we are \nnot on the right path. While some of my colleagues believe that we \nshould support President George W. Bush, who continues to make \ndecisions that place our men and women in the Armed Forces in harm's \nway, I disagree.\n  The past few months have been among the deadliest for our military \npersonnel. We have seen 79 U.S. soldiers killed in February, 82 in \nMarch, and 85 so far this month. To the more than 3,300 U.S. soldiers \nthat have been killed and the over 24,000 wounded since the conflict \nbegan, to our men and women in the Armed Forces and their families who \nare valiantly serving our country and to the American people, I say to \nall of you, we must change our course.\n  To stay the course is to welcome disaster. Iraq lies like the \nproverbial clay pot broken in shards on the ground. It is shattered \ninto the fragments of warring factions, clans, and religious groups. \nAfghanistan, still the center of the war on al-Qaida, is becoming \nprogressively more dangerous as our attention remains focused on Iraq. \nAl-Qaida and the Taliban are rebuilding their forces and terrorists \nhave extended their attacks to North Africa and Western Europe. We are \nfacing, as our military leaders tells us again and again, a ``thinking \nenemy,'' one that learns and adapts. Should we not also learn and \nadapt? Can anyone doubt that our strategy needs to change?\n  Some have painted this conflict as simply a war against al-Qaida in \nIraq. Let us not make the mistake of fooling ourselves. Al-Qaida is \nstoking the flames but it is the internal divisions among the Iraqis \nthemselves which has made it the bonfire it is today. If the Iraqis \nunite, they can defeat al-Qaida as they have demonstrated in some \nprovinces already. But as everyone, including the President and our \nmilitary leaders, have observed, the Iraqis themselves must form a \nreconciliation government. American soldiers are not a thread that can \npermanently stitch together the broken parts of Iraq. The Iraqis \nthemselves are the masters of their own fate.\n  The legislation before us today is a call for a new strategy. It \nrequires that we change our present course. It makes clear that the war \nin Iraq can only be won by Iraqis. It is their will and their will \nalone that must determine the fate of their country. Americans cannot \ndo the fighting for them. A democratic Iraq will not be established \nunless the Iraqis do it for themselves. We cannot put the shattered \npieces of Iraq together. Only the Iraqis can do that.\n  Today, with the Senate passage of H.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop \nReadiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability \nAppropriations Act, 2007, we will be providing $100 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense, primarily for continued military operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. It also\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\nincludes a $1 billion increase for the National Guard and Reserve \nequipment and $1.1 billion for military housing. Mr. President, $1.789 \nbillion would be provided for the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nspecifically target treatment for veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom \nand Operation Enduring Freedom, reduce the backlog of benefit claims, \nand ensure that facilities are maintained at the highest level. In \naddition, $6.9 billion would be appropriated for the victims of \nHurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, $650 million would be provided \nfor the State Children's Health Insurance Program, $2.25 billion in \nhomeland security investments, including funds for port security and \nmass transit security, and $3.5 billion to help relieve pressures that \nfarmers and ranchers experienced due to severe drought and agricultural \ndisasters.\n  In addition to funding these important efforts, the legislation \nincludes an important step in setting the proper course in Iraq for our \nmilitary servicemembers and their families by providing them with a \nroad map to success. By outlining the benchmarks that must be met by \nthe Iraqi government and clarifies our military involvement in Iraq. It \ndefines our mission in Iraq by steering our military away from policing \na civil war to training and equipping Iraqi security forces, protecting \nU.S. forces, and conducting targeted counterterror operations. A phased \nredeployment of our troops would begin no later than October 1, 2007, \nwith a goal of removing all combat forces by April 1, 2008, except for \nthose carrying out security, training, and counterterror operations. \nThis bill holds the Iraqi government accountable by setting benchmarks \nthat must be met for security, political reconciliation, and improving \nthe lives of the Iraqi people. It is no longer acceptable for this \nAdministration to set arbitrary benchmarks that have no consequences \nattached to it. It is time for the Iraqi government and regional \nleaders to work together to promote democracy in Iraq. It is time for \nthe United States to take the necessary steps that illustrates our \nwillingness to relinquish control and allow the Iraqi government and \nthe Iraqi people to control their own destiny. And it is time for the \nIraqi people to set their own path to victory and democracy.\n  The American people and more importantly, our servicemembers and \ntheir families, deserve to have the administration define our mission \nin Iraq. The President must also give a clear directive to the Iraqi \ngovernment that it must demonstrate the will to overcome the civil \nunrest that is taking control of their country. Unfortunately, the \nPresident has indicated that he will veto this important legislation. \nBy vetoing this legislation, this administration is sending the wrong \nmessage. It is preventing our troops from receiving the funds they need \nto continue their mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is preventing \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita from rebuilding their \nlives and farmers and ranchers from receiving relief due to severe \ndrought and agricultural disasters. Moreover, it is preventing our \nveterans from receiving the health care and benefits that they deserve.\n  It is time for this administration, this President, to lead us out of \nthe morass in Iraq. This legislation sends the right message to our \nservicemembers, to the Iraqi government and its people, and to the \nAmerican people. I urge the President to do the right thing and enact \nH.R. 1591, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, \nand Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007.\n  Mr. Salazar. Mr. President, today I will vote for the Iraq-\nAfghanistan emergency supplemental bill. I believe that this bill \nsupports our troops, our veterans and their families, and should be \nsigned by the President.\n  But first I would like to say that as we continue the debate on this \nlegislation and on the best way forward in Iraq, I come to the floor \ntoday with two key principles in mind.\n  One, we should honor the bravery and courage of our troops. America's \nfinest men and women have done an extraordinary job--too often without \nthe needed equipment and support. But honoring our troops means more \nthan just singing their praise. It means making sure that every \nAmerican in Iraq is adequately trained and equipped; it means \nguaranteeing every veteran access to all available benefits and \nservices; and it means setting a policy that is as wise as our soldiers \nare brave.\n  And two, we should work to heal the deep divisions which this war has \ncaused at home. Not since Vietnam has the American public been so \ndivided. I am concerned that the bitterness and the harshness of the \ndebate clouds good judgment on the future direction in Iraq.\n  It is important for us to remember that, no matter how contentious \nthis debate may become, every Senator shares the same goal: peace and \nstability in the Middle East and a safe return home for our troops. \nWhile we may disagree on the best path to that end, we must continue to \nwork together for a constructive change in our policy. It is important \nto remember what binds us together--so that we will not be torn too far \napart.\n  I would now like to comment on the bill before us today.\n  Specifically, the bill includes: More than $100 billion for our \ntroops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan; more than $5 billion to \nhelp ensure that our veterans and their families can receive the health \ncare they need and deserve when they return home; nearly $7 billion to \nrebuild the gulf coast and help the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita so that they can finally rebuild their homes, communities and \nlivelihoods; and $3.5 billion in disaster assistance to help our \nfarmers and ranchers across the Nation recover from 7 years of drought \ncapped by this winter's devastating blizzards.\n  The bill sends a direct message to the Iraqis that our military \ncommitment is not open-ended. We hold the Iraqi government accountable \nthrough measurable and achievable benchmarks for security, political \nreconciliation and improving the lives of ordinary Iraqis.\n  The bill also launches a new diplomatic, economic and political \noffensive and takes steps to begin to rebuild our military.\n  Finally, it sets an April, 1, 2008, goal of redeploying U.S. troops \nnot engaged in carrying out security, training and counterterror \noperations in Iraq.\n  I support this new direction for Iraq. This new direction recognizes \nthe reality that success in Iraq is contingent upon a strategy of \nmilitary, political and diplomatic progress.\n  I am disappointed that the President has said he intends to veto this \nlegislation. But I remain hopeful. I believe that we must continue to \nseek a new course in Iraq. I believe we can and should do that by \nachieving a bipartisan consensus on the best path to success.\n  I know most of my Republican colleagues do not support this bill. But \nI believe they sincerely want to join in finding a solution to the \ndifficult problem that confronts us in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group \nprovides a model for how we can work in good faith, across party lines. \nAnd I believe that the group's recommendations can and should be our \nblueprint for a compromise that can gain broad support here in the \nSenate.\n  So next week, I will be back on the floor to discuss with my \ncolleagues how we can implement those recommendations, working with the \nPresident.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr President, this morning I had the honor of saluting \nmembers of the Maryland Army National Guard as they departed to begin \ntraining for their upcoming deployment to Iraq. The 58th Brigade Combat \nTeam, including the Headquarters Company from Pikesville, MD, the 1st \nBattalion of the 175th Infantry from Dundalk, MD, and the 1st Squadron \nof the 158th Cavalry Regiment, are leaving their families and \ncommunities to answer our Nation's call. As the Senator from Maryland \nand the Senator for Maryland, I have promised them that I will do \neverything I can to support them while they are on the battlefield, \nhelp care for their families while they are gone, and ensure they have \nthe medical care, education, and job training benefits they need when \nthey return.\n  I support the conference report on the fiscal year 2007 emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill because it will help us keep our \npromises to America's citizen soldiers and their families. \nUnfortunately, President Bush continues to threaten to veto this bill. \nI hope it will not come to that. I\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\nurge the President to work with this Congress to meet the pressing \nneeds of our men and women in uniform.\n  I support this emergency supplemental bill because it: Fully funds \nthe needs of our warfighters on the battlefield; adds $466 million to \nensure veterans get health care they need when they come home; and \nrequires the President to immediately change our mission in Iraq; and \nsets the goal of bringing our troops home by no later than April 1, \n2008.\n  This bill states clearly that Congress and the American people will \ncontinue to support and protect our troops. Our troops must understand \nthat Congress will never abandon them, not while they are fighting on \nthe battlefield and not when they come home. The best way to support \nour troops is to bring them home--swiftly and safely.\n  I am not new to this position. I never wanted to go to war in the \nfirst place. I was one of the 23 who voted against this war, 4 years \nago, on October 11, 2002. I opposed giving the President unilateral \nauthority to launch a preemptive attack. I said the United States had \nto exhaust our diplomatic options. I encouraged the administration to \nstick with the United Nations U.N., to let the U.N. meet its \nresponsibility to deal with the threat from Saddam. The day of the \nvote, I said, we don't know if we will be greeted with flowers or \nlandmines. Well, now we know: When we got to Iraq, there were no \nweapons of mass destruction, but the destruction happened, and it \nhappened fast.\n  The United States went to war with Iraq, but today, we are at war \nwithin Iraq. Saddam is gone, but we are still there, mired in a civil \nwar. No one could ask more of our troops. They are brave and courageous \nand have fought valiantly. And it is time to bring them home.\n  We need a way forward in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group gives us 79 \nrecommendations as a way to go forward, but the President has \ncompletely ignored this report. Surely out of 79 recommendations, there \nare 50 we can agree on. The Iraq Study Group report calls for new and \nenhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and a change in the \nprimary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq to enable the United States to \nbegin to move our forces out of Iraq responsibly. It provides a \ndirection for the U.S. and Iraqi Governments to follow that could lead \nto withdrawal of American forces by the first quarter of 2008.\n  This is exactly the approach called for by this supplemental bill, \nwhich will have most of our troops out of Iraq by March 31, 2008. What \nare we voting for? This bill contains a binding resolution that directs \nthe President to promptly transition the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq \nand begin a phased redeployment within 120 days. It sets a goal of \nbringing U.S. combat forces home by April 1, 2008, except for a limited \nnumber of troops essential for force protection, training, and \nequipping Iraqi troops, and targeted counter terror operations.\n  This resolution also says success in Iraq depends on the Iraqi \nGovernment's ability to meet important benchmarks, including the \ntraining and equipping of Iraqi security forces so they can control the \ncapitol city of Baghdad; giving Iraqi military commanders the authority \nto conduct operations without political interference; disarming \nsectarian militias and ensuring that Iraqi security forces are loyal to \nIraq's Government; drafting and implementing legislation to ensure the \nequal division of Iraqi oil revenues; drafting and implementing \nlegislation to reform the debaathification process; implementing a fair \nprocess for amending the Iraqi constitution to ensure minority rights \nare protected; and implementing new rules to protect minority rights in \nthe Iraqi Parliament.\n  I support this Iraq resolution. It says what the Iraq Study Group has \nalready told us: the problems in Iraq cannot be solved by the U.S. \nmilitary--they require a political solution by the Iraqis and \ndiplomatic engagement with Iraq's neighbors. It says Congress and the \nAmerican people will not only support the troops but continue to \nprotect them as well.\n  I want to end this war, and the resolution in this bill will do just \nthat. Yet in ending the war, it is my responsibility as a Senator to \nensure that our troops are brought home not only swiftly but safely. I \nwill not vote to end funding for the pay that supports military spouses \nand children, body armor and armored humvees our troops need for \nsurvival, tourniquets and surgical hospitals on the battlefield, jet \nfuel for the airplanes that take injured troops from Baghdad to Germany \nand then home, or the medical care they need when they get here.\n  In the last few weeks, we have all been shocked and awed by the \nconditions facing our wounded warriors. We know that more than 22,000 \nPurple Hearts have been awarded in Iraq. Yet our troops are being twice \nwounded. We know that acute care for our injured troops has been \nastounding, with historic rates of survival from even the most brutal \nbattlefield injuries. Yet, while we have saved their lives, we are \nfailing to give them their life back. Outpatient care, facilities, \nsocial work, case workers, disability benefits--the whole system is \ndysfunctional.\n  This supplemental includes an additional $20 million to improve \nconditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and an additional $900 \nmillion for research and treatment of traumatic brain injury, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, and other physical and mental trauma. It \nalso adds $466 million for veterans' health care, including $53 million \nfor new polytrauma facilities and services, $10 million for 100 \nadditional caseworkers to aid troops and their families as they \ntransition from active duty, $25 million for prosthetic research and \n$120 million for mental health treatment.\n  We know this is only a downpayment for our troops and veterans. We \nneed to overhaul the disability benefits system that is outdated and \nadversarial. We need a better system for transitioning our troops from \nactive duty to the Veterans' Administration, to ensure they get the \nhealth care, job training, and educational benefits they deserve. We \nneed to hear the recommendations of the Dole-Shalala Commission on how \nto fix the problems in our military and veterans hospitals. And I look \nforward to working with Senator Murray, Senator Levin, and Senator \nInouye on a comprehensive reform package that will ensure our troops \nhave the medical care they will need for the rest of their lives.\n  This supplemental supports our troops, follows the will of the \nAmerican people, and follows the advice of the Iraq Study Group. It is \ntime to change our direction in Iraq and bring our forces home. Let's \nsend in the diplomats and bring our troops home safely and soon.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of the conference report to H.R. 1591, \nmaking emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2007.\n  The conference report includes $124.153 billion in net, new \ndiscretionary budget authority for 2007, of which $100.681 billion is \nfor defense activities and $23.472 billion is for nondefense \nactivities. The additional budget authority will increase outlays by \n$31.935 billion in 2007. Of the total spending authority provided, H.R. \n1591 designates $124.789 billion in budget authority as emergency \nspending, which will increase outlays by $31.926 billion.\n  The conference report to H.R. 1591 is subject to several points of \norder. First, the conference report includes emergency funding that \nwould cause the $86.3 billion cap on 2007 emergency funding to be \nexceeded. This cap was included in S. Con. Res. 83, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2007, and was made applicable \nby the deeming resolution included in section 7035 of P.L. 109-234. \nFunding above the cap counts against the subcommittees' allocations and \nwould cause them to exceed their allocations. As a result, the \nconference report is subject to a point of order under 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act. Second, the small business tax relief \nprovisions included in the conference report reduce revenues by $4.465 \nbillion over the 2006-2010 period. Because the Congress is over the \nrevenue aggregates under the 2006 budget resolution, the conference \nreport is subject to a point of order under section 311 of the \nCongressional Budget Act. It should be noted that the tax provisions \nare fully offset over the 2007-2012 and 2007-2017 periods. Finally, the \nconference report is subject to a point of order under section 402 of \nH. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\non the budget for fiscal year 2006, for including a number of emergency \ndesignations for spending on nondefense activities.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor bringing this legislation before the Senate. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     HR. 1591, THE CONFERENCE REPORT TO H.R. 1591, MAKING EMERGENCY\n  SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30,\n                                  2007\n                     [Fiscal year 2007; $ millions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Defense   Nondefense    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Emergency:\n        Budget Authority..............   $100,681      24,108    124,789\n        Outlays.......................     26,665       5,261     31,926\n    Nonemergency:\n        Budget Authority..............          0        -636       -636\n        Outlays.......................          0           9          9\n          Total:\n            Budget Authority..........    100,681      23,472    124,153\n            Outlays...................     26,665       5,270     31,935\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is irresponsible for Congress to \noperate this way.\n  With the provisions in this bill, Congress is deserting our \ncommitments to our military leaders and telling them that none of it \nmatters, the war is over and your mission is done. Congress, with this \nbill, is reneging on the war and sending our men and women in uniform a \ndemoralizing message.\n  I am committed to giving our military, led by General Petraeus, time \nand resources to try to calm Baghdad.\n  I understand the deep national unrest over the course of the war. I \ndo not support an open-ended commitment in Iraq. The Iraqi government \nmust do more.\n  But effectively abandoning our military effort at this time poses a \ntreacherous threat to the United States and the region.\n  We should do right by our troops, give them the resources they need \nand work with the Iraqis toward solutions that will bring our Armed \nForces home at an appropriate time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nhave performed valiantly in Iraq in the face of great adversity. The \ncosts of this war have been great to them and our Nation. Over 3,300 \nbrave American servicemembers have been killed in Iraq over 30 from my \nown State of Connecticut.\n  To date, over $500 billion has been approved by Congress for military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, not including the $95.5 billion \nincluded in the conference agreement being debated today or the $141.7 \nbillion in additional funding already requested by the administration \nfor fiscal year 2008.\n  In addition, because of the war, our forces have been drained of \ncritical combat gear and training time, adding another element to the \ncosts of this war--our military's combat readiness. Two-thirds of the \nArmy in the United States and 88 percent of our National Guard are \nreporting 'not ready' for duty, largely due to equipment and training \nshortfalls.\n  Now, as we have entered the fifth year of the Iraq war, it is long \npast time for a course correction. Rather than continue abetting the \nadministration's efforts to escalate our entanglement in Iraq's civil \nwar, it is time for Congress to assert itself and heed the American \npeople's call for change.\n  The conference report before us today takes the first steps toward \nthat change. While I wish it would have included stronger language to \nimmediately begin withdrawing combat troops from Iraq and limiting the \nmission there to counterterrorism, training and equipping Iraqi troops \nand force protection for remaining U.S. personnel, it does for the \nfirst time set some new goals for this administration and the Iraqi \nGovernment that will mandate a change of course. For the first time it \ndemands real accountability from the President to take action to \nrestore our military's readiness which has been hollowed out as a \nresult of his policies. And this bill finally provides critical \nresources for combat gear and protective equipment that the Bush-\nCheney-Rumsfeld administration has consistently shortchanged in their \nbudget proposals.\n  Regrettably, as my colleagues know, the President has already said \nthat he will refuse to sign this legislation into law. He has announced \nhis intention to veto this bill because after 4 years of a disastrous \nwar policy, escalating combat deaths, and growing instability in the \nregion, he insists that his is the only way. It is disheartening that \nPresident Bush does not see or will not admit that his policy in Iraq \nis a failure.\n  In plowing ahead on the current course in Iraq, the President has \nrejected the advice of experts from across the political spectrum, from \nthe Baker-Hamilton Report, and from members of Congress, all of whom \nhave urged him to change the course in Iraq, to diminish our military \nfootprint there, and to start a surge of diplomacy in the region. Like \nall my colleagues, I want to see success in Iraq. I wish that the \nPresident's policies were working. I wish that U.S. combat forces were \nable to restore security to Baghdad and to other parts of Iraq. I wish \nthat the President had not mismanaged this war from day one. I wish \nthat we had deployed enough troops on the ground to secure the peace at \nthe outset. I wish that Secretary Rumsfeld hadn't run the Coalition \nProvisional Authority like a staffing agency for Republican political \noperatives, displacing countless U.S. Foreign Service professionals in \nthe beginning of the war. I wish we hadn't disbanded the Iraqi Army and \nthat we hadn't allowed looting. And I wish that our surge of 30,000 \nmore men and women in uniform into Iraq could be successful in \nstabilizing that country.\n  But now is not the time for wishful thinking. Now is the time to \naddress the real facts on the ground. This conflict cannot be resolved \nby increased military action. It requires a coherent, broad-based \nstrategy to promote the political reconciliation necessary to secure \nthe future for Iraq.\n  The bill before us begins that process. If the President determines \nthat the Iraqis are not making progress on key political, security, and \neconomic benchmarks, then, under this legislation, the redeployment of \nAmerican troops would begin this summer. If, on the other hand, the \nPresident determines that the Iraqis are complying with the benchmarks \nset forth in the legislation, then the redeployment of American forces \nwould begin later in the fall of 2007. These reasonable and responsible \ntimetables and benchmarks will force the President to change his \nstrategy and will incentivize the Iraqi Government to take difficult \nbut necessary steps toward reconciliation, power sharing, and security.\n  This bill also allows for a limited ongoing presence of U.S. forces \nin Iraq for the specific purposes of training and equipping reliable \nIraqi security forces, carrying out counterterrorism operations within \nIraq, and providing force protection, because we understand that these \nvital components will be necessary to ensure a stable and secure Iraq \neven after our combat troops have been redeployed. Iraqis will continue \nto need some limited American assistance, and it is in our and Iraq's \nnational interests for that limited support to continue.\n  Exactly 1 day after President Bush disingenuously charged the \nDemocratic Congress for causing what he called ``unacceptable'' delays \nin troops returning home, Secretary Gates announced that he was \nimmediately extending the tour lengths of those units sent to Iraq to \n15 months--3 months longer than before. In addition, 13,000 National \nGuard troops from Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, and Ohio, as well as \nother States, were recently told to prepare to be deployed to Iraq.\n  As a result of 4 years of war in Iraq, our Army has been stretched to \nits breaking point.\n  It is time to say, ``enough is enough.'' And with this supplemental \nbill, Congress is taking a big step in that direction. This bill holds \nthe President directly responsible for units being deployed who are not \n``fully mission capable'', by requiring him to waive requirements that \nmandate that units fully restock their depleted equipment inventories \nand restore their mission readiness prior to deployment. It includes \nfunding for critical equipment, including mine-resistant, ambush-\nprotection vehicles which would dramatically lower the number of \ninjuries and casualties sustained by our troops. And it includes \nbillions of dollars for health care for our wounded veterans, many of\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\nwhom return home with debilitating and life-altering injuries. They \nhave sacrificed everything for this Nation, and at the very least we \nowe them the best health care available.\n\n  Sadly, there is no magic formula for fixing the myriad problems in \nIraq, as the Baker-Hamilton Commission rightly pointed out. But it is \ncritical that Iraqis make progress on reconciliation and security and \nthat the Government improves the living conditions of its citizens. \nIraq's neighbors and regional leaders must also play a role in finding \nsuch a solution. The United States and Iraq's neighbors all have long-\nterm interests in the region, and a broken Iraq does not advance those \ninterests.\n  With this supplemental bill, Congress is offering the President an \nopportunity to change our course in Iraq, to listen and respond to the \nwill of the American people, to support the men and women sacrificing \ntheir lives there, and to provide for a responsible change in strategy \nin Iraq.\n  It is also vital that we make America more resilient here at home. \nThis bill begins to do just that, in providing $325 million to protect \nthe millions of Americans who ride public transportation each day.\n  Our Nation's public transit systems are inadequately prepared to \nminimize the threat and impact of potential terrorist attacks. Since \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Government has \ninvested nearly $24 billion in aviation security--protecting the 1.8 \nmillion people who fly on an average day. At the same time, our \nNational Government has invested only $386 million, before the 110th \nCongress began, in transit security to protect the 14 million people \nwho ride transit on an average workday. Put another way, since 2001, \nour Nation has spent over $7.50 per passenger on aviation security but \nless than one penny per transit rider on transit security. I am not \nsuggesting that we ought to be investing equally, but clearly this is \nnot the appropriate balance.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee, I have made improving our national security a top priority. \nThe very first hearing that I held as chairman focused on increasing \nthe security of our Nation's 14 million daily transit passengers. The \nvery first legislation that the committee considered during my \nchairmanship was the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2007, which was reported by the Banking Committee unanimously on \nFebruary 8. The legislation authorizes the distribution of $3.5 billion \nin security funds, over the next 3 fiscal years, on the basis of risk \ndirectly to transit agencies.\n  The Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 was \nincluded as title XV of the 9/11 bill, which the Senate passed on March \n13. Senator Shelby and I worked with Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran \nto include language in the legislation to allow for such sums as \nnecessary to be appropriated in this fiscal year to address the \ncritical needs of our Nation's transit systems. The $325 million \nincluded in this appropriations act is a significant investment toward \nour goal of better securing our Nation's rail and transit systems. This \ninvestment builds on the $175 million that was included in the fiscal \nyear 2007 continuing resolution. I once again thank all of the members \nof the Banking and Appropriations Committees who have worked so hard to \nadvance us to where we are today.\n  This bill also continues congressional efforts to help the citizens \nof Mississippi and Louisiana rebuild their lives after the catastrophic \neffects of Hurricane Katrina by including more than $1.3 billion to \nfund flood and storm damage reduction projects in affected areas.\n  Finally, I want to take a few brief moments to discuss the minimum \nwage increase provision included in this bill. It has been nearly 10 \nyears since millions of hard-working men and women have seen their \nwages go up. During that time, inflation has eroded the purchasing \npower of families being paid the minimum wage. In fact, the real value \nof the minimum wage has declined $4 below what it was nearly 40 years \nago, in 1968. It is currently at its lowest inflation-adjusted level in \nmore than 50 years. During the past 10 years, while the minimum wage \nremained unchanged, the cost of housing, food, health care, education, \ntransportation, and energy has increased.\n  We cannot reduce poverty if we don't tackle raising the minimum wage. \nIt is simply outrageous that so many Americans live in poverty, and it \nis long overdue that we take action to reduce the inexcusable and \nunconscionably high levels of poverty in this country. The language of \nthe Fair Minimum Wage Act, which is included in this bill, will provide \na three-step increase in wages over 26 months from the current level of \n$5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour. This additional $4,400 per year would \nallow a low-income family of three to buy 8 months of rent, 15 months \nof groceries, 19 months of utilities, 20 months of childcare, or more \nthan 24 months of health insurance.\n  I urge the President to seize this opportunity to make America and \nIraq stronger and safer. I sincerely hope he will reconsider his \ndecision to veto this bill when it arrives on his desk. Such a veto \nwould be an affirmation of the status quo in America, a status which \nthis Nation can simply no longer afford.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the pending emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill includes a number of items within the jurisdiction \nof the Finance Committee. I would have preferred that the Senate had \nconsidered these matters on legislation that the Finance Committee had \nreported. I believe in the committee process. In the future, I will try \nto minimize the occasions on which Finance Committee legislation \ntravels on legislation reported by other committees.\n  But the House of Representatives included the minimum wage and small \nbusiness tax provisions in the House-passed version of this \nsupplemental appropriations bill. So it was only appropriate that the \nfull Senate respond. The Senate Appropriations Committee added matters \nrelated to health care, so it was only appropriate that the conference \ncommittee on this supplemental appropriations bill address those \nissues, as well.\n  I appreciate that the conference committee on this supplemental \nappropriations bill deferred to members of the Finance Committee in the \nformulation of these Finance Committee tax and health matters in the \nconference report on this bill. I particularly thank Chairman Byrd for \nhis assistance in this regard.\n  Some have been concerned that an increase in the minimum wage would \nburden small businesses. Small businesses are a vital source of job \ncreation, economic opportunity, and technological innovation.\n  There are about 23 million small businesses in America. Businesses \nwith fewer than 500 employees represent more than 99 percent of all \nbusinesses in America. They pay more than 45 percent of American \nprivate payroll. They have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs \nannually over the last decade. They employ 41 percent of high-tech \nworkers.\n  Small business is particularly important in my home State of Montana. \nSmall businesses are the backbone of our communities.\n  We have the opportunity to help small businesses through tax \nincentives that stimulate their rates of formation and growth. That is \nwhy Chairman Rangel and I worked together to combine the House and \nSenate small business tax packages to achieve a comprehensive small \nbusiness tax package.\n  This is a responsible package that will help small businesses in the \ncontext of an increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n  The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the \npublic a technical explanation of the bill. The technical explanation \nexpresses the committee's understanding and legislative intent behind \nthis important legislation.\n  The small business tax package provided a more than 3-year extension \nof the work opportunity tax credit, or WOTC. WOTC allows employers a \ntax credit for wages that they pay to economically disadvantaged \nemployees. The final small business tax package also expands WOTC to \nallow the credit for employers who hire disabled veterans, a proposal \nthat was part of both the Senate and House packages. The package \nincludes the Senate's proposed expansion to allow the credit for \nemployers who hire employees in a county\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nthat has suffered significant population loss.\n  The small business tax package also includes a 1-year extension of \nsection 179 expensing. Section 179 allows small business owners to \npurchase and write off more equipment each year for use in their trade \nor business. Section 179 expensing was included in both the Senate and \nHouse small business tax packages. The final small business tax package \nalso increases the amount allowed to be expensed in 2007 from $112,000 \nto $125,000, a proposal in the House version.\n  Enhancement of the tip credit, family business tax simplification, \nand waiver of limitations under the alternative minimum tax on WOTC and \ntip credits are three other House proposals included in the final small \nbusiness tax package.\n  Enhancement of the tip credit for certain small businesses will \nprevent a decrease in the amount of business tax credit that restaurant \nand other service-oriented business owners may claim for the Social \nSecurity taxes that they pay on their employee's tips despite an \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage.\n  The family business tax simplification proposal ensures that when a \nmarried couple jointly owns a small business, both spouses will receive \ncredit for paying Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n  The waiver of individual and corporate AMT limitations on WOTC and \ntip credits would allow business owners to take the WOTC and tip \ncredits under AMT.\n  The Senate's S corporation package is also included in the final \nsmall business tax package. The S corporation package includes several \nsimplifications and modifications to rules governing community banks \nand other small businesses that operate as S corporations.\n  The small business tax package includes several tax incentives \nincluded in both the Senate and House small business tax packages to \nhelp recovery of small business and low-income housing in areas hit by \nHurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.\n  The small business tax package is a responsible package that is \ncompletely offset. The package includes offsets that were included in \nboth the Senate and the House small business tax packages, such as \nmodification to the interest suspension rules for IRS and a proposal \nto discourage the practice of transferring investments to one's child \nfor the purpose of avoiding higher tax rates.\n\n  The package also includes modifications to the collection due process \nfor employment taxes, an expansion of preparer penalties, and a new \npenalty on erroneous refund claims. These offsets were part of the \nadministration's fiscal year 2008 budget proposal to improve tax \ncompliance.\n  The small business tax package does not include the Senate's 15-year \ndepreciation proposal for improvements made to leaseholds, retailer-\nowned businesses, and restaurants. Nor does this final package include \nthe Senate's proposal to expand availability of the cash method of \naccounting.\n  These proposals both have merit. They were included in the chairman's \nmark when the Finance Committee wrote the Senate's small business tax \npackage. These proposals enjoy the support of many Senators, including \nSenators Kerry and Snowe. But there simply was not enough room in a \n$4.8 billion conference package to include the 15-year depreciation and \ncash method of accounting proposals, as they have a combined estimated \npricetag of nearly $7.4 billion. But this will not be the last bill in \nwhich the Senate can address these important proposals.\n  If and when the President vetoes this bill, and it comes back again, \nwe need to preserve the integrity of this balanced compromise. Congress \nshould not litigate this tax package over again. I urge my colleagues \nto support this package.\n  This bill also accomplishes key urgent health priorities.\n  The bill includes emergency funding for the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP. This fiscal year, 14 States will run short \nin their Federal CHIP funds by a total of about $624 million. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that 700,000 children will lose \nCHIP coverage unless Congress acts.\n  This bill fills the gap in Federal CHIP funds. It ensures that all \nStates can meet the demand for CHIP coverage for all those now eligible \nfor coverage this year.\n  I thank Chairman Byrd and Chairman Harkin for their help on this \nprovision. Keeping children from losing their health coverage is a \ncritical national priority. I will work with my colleagues to ensure \nthat the final supplemental bill includes this provision.\n  Another provision originally offered by Senator Durbin puts a 1-year \nhold on rulemaking relating to Medicaid payment rates for public \nhospitals and nursing homes. In January, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services proposed a rule that would make sweeping changes to \nreimbursement rates for public facilities. The rule also proposed major \nchanges to how States can define which governmental facilities can pay \na State's Medicaid share.\n  The Nation's Governors have weighed in against the Medicaid rule, as \nhave many hospitals and nursing homes. They are concerned that this \nrule would do immediate harm to our Nation's safety net by cutting \nMedicaid reimbursement for publicly owned facilities that serve our \nmost vulnerable citizens.\n  I am concerned this rule goes too far in implementing new policy, \nmaking changes that are better made by Congress.\n  It is Congress's job to make major changes to the law. A 1-year \nmoratorium will give the Finance Committee enough time to study this \nissue and determine the right approach in legislation to limit \nopportunities for fraud and abuse of Medicaid, while protecting the \nvulnerable individuals and vital safety net providers who rely on \nMedicaid payments.\n  Some have raised concerns about the original Durbin amendment \nmoratorium. They said that it should not have been included in an \nappropriations bill and that it could undermine oversight of Medicaid \nat the Department of Health and Human Services. I agree that we should \nkeep Finance Committee issues within the committee. In this case, \nhowever, the Department is poised to act before July of this year. We \nneed to take action now, before it is too late.\n  I also agree that protecting against fraud and abuse in Medicaid is a \npriority. Not one taxpayer dollar should be misspent. That is why the \nrevised version of this amendment clarifies that the moratorium has no \naffect on all other Medicaid integrity enforcement activity at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  This final version also removes the increase in the Medicaid \nprescription drug rebate that was used to offset the cost and replaces \nit with other Medicaid policies that will save Federal dollars. The new \nversion includes provisions that will lower the incidence of fraud in \nMedicaid drug prescribing and preserve access to affordable \nprescriptions for 100,000 seniors covered by Wisconsin's Pharmacy Plus \nprogram.\n  I think this is the right approach. It provides a shorter moratorium \nthat allows the Finance Committee to act and preserves oversight on \nfraud and abuse at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I will work with Senator Durbin and members of the Appropriations \nCommittee to ensure that this version stays in the final bill.\n  Once again, I thank Chairman Byrd for his help in reaching this good \noutcome. And I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n\n                          Retail Improvements\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to followup on the comments \nChairman Baucus made about the depreciation of retail improvements and \nengage in a colloquy with Senators Snowe and Baucus. Under current law, \nimprovements made to rented retail property are depreciated over 15 \nyears. Improvements made to owned property are depreciated over 39 \nyears. The current tax treatment of improvements to retail property \nresults in an inequity. There is no justification to treat these \nimprovements differently for tax purposes based on whether the property \nis owned or rented. Unfortunately, this provision was not included in \nthe small business tax package.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I join Senator Kerry in my disappointment that this \nprovision that would benefit retail operations\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nlike Greenacres Kennel Shop in Bangor, ME, was not included in the \nconference agreement of the supplemental appropriations bill. The \nprovision originated from legislation, S. 271, that I introduced with \nSenators Lincoln, Hutchison, and Kerry to provide relief and equity to \nour Nation's 1.5 million retail establishments, most of which have less \nthan five employees. This bill will simply conform the Tax Code to the \nrealities that retailers on Main Street face. Despite the fact that \nsmall businesses are the real job-creators in our Nation's economy, the \ncurrent tax system is placing an entirely unreasonable burden on them \nwhen trying to satisfy their tax obligations. What is most troubling is \nthat companies that employ fewer than 20 employees spend nearly $1,304 \nper employee in tax compliance costs, an amount that is nearly 67 \npercent more than larger firms. As a result, I was most pleased when \nthe chairman and ranking member included this modest proposal as part \nof the small business tax relief package. Unfortunately, the provision \ndid not survive conference negotiations with the House.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree with the comments made by Senator Snowe, and we \nhave heard first hand how important this provision is to small \nbusinesses. During the January Finance Committee hearing on small \nbusiness tax issues, Mr. Dave Ratner, owner of Dave's Soda and Pet City \nof western Massachusetts, testified about the need for retail owners to \nbe able to depreciate improvements over 15 years instead of 39 years. \nHe eloquently explained why owners and renters should be treated in the \nsame manner and how difficult it is for small businesses to compete \nwith large retail chains. Senator Snowe and I would like to work with \nyou to address this inequity.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand and share the concerns \nexpressed by Senator Kerry and Senator Snowe. I agree that owners and \nrenters should receive the same tax treatment for improvements.\n  There are many small businesses in Montana in which the owners would \nlike to make improvements. And this provision would be extremely \nhelpful.\n  Just this week, I received an e-mail message from Scott Brown, the \nowner of The Base Camp in Helena, MT. Scott told me how this provision \nwould help him and other Montana retailers to be more competitive.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to find additional \nopportunities to address this important provision.\n  Mr. KERRY. I look forward to continuing to work with you on this \nimportant provision which helps small businesses. We need to provide \nequal tax treatment for depreciated property regardless of whether it \nis owned or rented.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I concur with Senator Kerry and appreciate his support for \nthis proposal that simply would bring equity between retail operations. \nFrankly, this provision should have been included when Congress first \nextended accelerated depreciation for leasehold improvements. This is \nnot a new provision but, rather, it simply perfects current law. Though \ndisappointed by the absence of the provision in the conference \nagreement, I appreciate the chairman's commitment to this issue and \nhope he will continue to work with Senator Kerry and me, as well as the \nother cosponsors of S. 271, to see that the provision receives full and \nfair consideration as the process to finally enact small business \nrelief continues to move forward\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent in the order that \nhas already been placed, following Senator Kennedy, Senator Isakson be \nrecognized, and then the following Senators be recognized on our side, \nalternating with Republicans, for 4 minutes each Senator: Cardin, \nMenendez, Webb, Schumer, Feinstein, Jack Reed, and Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry, please: I ask the Senator from \nWashington, that takes place after the Senator from Illinois and I are \nrecognized, is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a war which never should have \nstarted and on this President's watch may never end. But the face of \nthis war is not the face of President George W. Bush, nor is it the \nface of any Member of Congress. The face of this war can be found in \nthe grief of children, wives, mothers, in 3,333 homes across America \nwhere a folded American flag and fading photograph are daily reminders \nof a fallen soldier.\n  The face of this war can be found in a hospital room in the Midwest \nwhere a 22-year-old soldier sits in a wheelchair. When you walk in the \nroom he notices you and watches you, but he cannot speak. He is a \nvictim of traumatic brain injury, the signature injury of this war. His \npowers of communication are very limited. We hope that will change, but \nit may not.\n  Seated next to this 22-year-old soldier in the hospital room is a 21-\nyear-old wife, holding the picture of a 2-year-old daughter. For 10--\n20--30--or 40 years, this may be his life and her life. The face of \nthis war can be found in hundreds of counseling sessions that are now \ntreating thousands of soldiers who returned, haunted by the demons of \nthis war or fighting post-traumatic stress disorder. The face of this \nwar can be found in the wives and mothers at home, anxiously awaiting \nthe return of their soldier, paying the bills, caring for the kids, \nhoping their marriage will survive.\n  Today we send the President a chance to change the course of this \nwar, a chance to finally demand accountability from the Iraqis, and a \nchance to honor our great men and women in uniform by bringing them \nhome in an orderly, sensible, safe way.\n  When the President receives this bill early next week, I hope he will \nask himself some basic questions. How many lives? How many wounds? How \nmany soldiers must America sacrifice, waiting for the Iraqis to accept \ntheir responsibility?\n  Time and again the Iraqis have failed to shoulder the burden of \nleadership. They have set their own timetables and deadlines to finally \nbring political order to their country, and have failed time and time \nand time again. Instead of being held to the task of governing their \nown country, some in this Government make excuses and say let's send in \nsome more soldiers and buy them some more time. As the Iraqis fail, \nbrave Americans fall--victims of IEDs, victims of car bombs, victims of \na civil war that has its roots in an Islamic battle that has gone on \nfor 14 centuries; victims of Iraqi politicians who delay making the \nhard political decisions which might bring stability to their country.\n  The law we send the President will give him a chance to start anew, \nan opportunity to finally accept change--a moment in history where he \ncan accept the reality of this grim and deteriorating war in Iraq.\n  The President has already predicted he is going to take this bill and \nveto it. But we hope there will be 1 moment--1 moment of prayerful \nreflection before he puts that pen to paper. In that moment, if he \ncloses his eyes in prayer, I hope he sees the faces I have spoken of, \nof these fallen soldiers, of these battered warriors, of these men and \nwomen and families who have given more than we can ever ask of anyone \nin this country, and I hope he will realize, with that pen in his hand, \nhe can honor them, honor this country, and bring this war to an end.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is very difficult for me to believe \nsome of the things I am actually hearing right now. In fact, I don't \nbelieve them after General Petraeus has made such a fine presentation \nto us. There are a few things in the closed session that we cannot talk \nabout, but I have taken those out. The things we can talk about--in \nanswer to a question, you said: Can you talk about some of the positive \nthings that have happened?\n  He is talking about Anbar. I am now quoting: Anbar has gone from \nbeing assessed as being lost to a situation that now is quite \nheartening because of the decision by a number of Sunni Arab tribes to \njoin the fight against al-Qaida; the reduction of sectarian murders in \nBaghdad, that is down by approximately a third; progress in Anbar is \nalmost something that is breathtaking--the killing of the security\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\nAmir of al-Qaida in eastern Anbar Province; the detention of the \nKhazali network; we have picked up the Shabani network head in Iraq. \nThat is the explosively-formed projectile element in Iraq that gets \nthem from others in Iraq, these are the explosively-formed projectiles.\n  It goes on and on. He talks about the progress in Ramadi.\n  My only wish is that so many of those who are detractors would have \nhad the opportunity and had taken the opportunity to go and spend the \ntime in the area of operations, in the whole area out there. But I can \nrecall so many things that people just are not aware of here.\n  I remember being in Tikrit. Tikrit is where they had the Iraqi \nsecurity forces building that was blown up. Forty of them were either--\nthese are Iraqi security trainees--40 either were killed or were \ninjured so that they would not be able to go back to the fields. You \nknow, the families--you do not hear about this--of all 40 of these \nsupplied the one who had died with another member of the family. In \nother words, they have this commitment that is so strong.\n  I asked the general yesterday, I said: Are you still getting the \nfamily support that I witnessed when I was over there?\n  He said: It is even stronger now. They are lined up and talking about \nit.\n  The Iraqi security forces in Fallujah--now, that was a great \nexperience that I had, having the honor of being there during two of \ntheir elections. The Iraqi security forces go out and vote the day \nbefore the rest of the public votes for two reasons: one, so they can \nprovide security for the public when they vote, and the second reason \nis that they go out there knowing that is the risky time. They are \nwilling to risk their lives, and several of them in the Fallujah area \ndied just in the process of voting.\n  I remember sitting down with the general--his name is General Mahdi--\nand he was one, I have to say--he was the brigade commander for Saddam \nHussein. He hated Americans. He was the one who said--when they came in \nthere after the fall of Saddam Hussein--he was still the brigade \ncommander for the Iraqis until the marines came to Fallujah and started \ntraining with the Iraqi security forces. He made the statement--he \nsaid: We became so close to the marines--this is the general who had \nbeen Saddam Hussein's brigade commander. He said: We became so close to \nthe marines that when they rotated out, we got together and we all \ncried.\n  We went from there on up, flew in a Black Hawk, and the easiest way \nto get around there is to fly low and fast over the Triangle, only to \nsee the little kids down there waving American flags. I just wonder, if \nsomething like this is passed and we are telling all of those kids down \nthere and we are telling the Iraqi security forces that are doing so \nwell right now in their advanced training, that they are now on the \npoint of these invasions that are taking place, the defenses that are \ntaking place all throughout Iraq, that we are saying that we are the \ncut-and-run guys, we built up your hopes, we now see an improved Iraq, \nwe see hospitals are opened, we see manufacturers that are making \nclothing, we see girls who are going to school when this has never \nhappened in the history of Iraq, we have seen all of this progress, but \nwe are going to dump on you now.\n  So I just hope that we can stand back from the politics and do the \nright thing and get a good resolution--defeat this bill, get it vetoed, \nget a good resolution so we can finish what we started and give General \nPetraeus a chance to finish what he has started so successfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Chair notify me when I have 15 \nseconds remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to congratulate our \nDemocratic leader for his bold and decisive leadership and his \ndetermination to bring our troops home from Iraq in an orderly, \nresponsible, and safe way. Those who are disparaging him are engaged in \nnothing more than a ploy to change the focus of the debate.\n  Harry Reid is an effective and capable leader. What the American \npeople and our soldiers in Iraq need is new leadership from the White \nHouse and a new policy in Iraq that requires the Iraqis to take \nresponsibilities and our troops to begin to come home.\n  A timeline for the withdrawal of combat troops is the only realistic \nway to encourage the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future. \nThe Bush administration supported deadlines for three Iraqi elections \nand for writing of the Constitution as part of its strategy to ensure \nthat Iraqis would make essential decisions. Yet the administration \nremains emphatically opposed to any timeline for the withdrawal of our \nmilitary. The administration should follow the logic of its past action \nand embrace, rather than reject, a timeline. It should stop defying the \nwill of the American people who want to bring our troops home to the \nheroes' welcome they have earned.\n  The President is wrong to threaten to veto this legislation, he was \nwrong to get us into this war, wrong to conduct it so poorly, wrong to \nignore the views of the American people, and wrong to accuse those of \nus who are working to change course as harming our troops. Now he is \nwrong to threaten to veto this bill, delaying funds and keeping our \ntroops in a civil war with no end in sight to our commitment. Instead, \nPresident Bush should be listening to the American people and working \nwith Congress to bring this tragic war to an end.\n  Instead of continuing to defy the will of the American people and \nCongress by threatening to veto the legislation, he should be putting \nthe Iraqis on notice. He must make it clear to the Iraqi Government \nthat it is time for them to take responsibility for their country and \nresolve their political differences. The American military will not \npolice Iraq's civil war indefinitely. It is time to end the loss of \nAmerican lives and to begin to bring our soldiers home. For the sake of \nour troops, we cannot repeat the mistakes of Vietnam and allow this to \ndrag on long after the American people know it is a mistake.\n  We have Presidents who make mistakes. President Johnson was wrong in \nescalating in Vietnam. President Nixon was wrong to continue that \nescalation, and we saw the loss of 58,000 American lives. Presidents \nmake mistakes.\n  This President has made this mistake. The American people were right \nin Vietnam and brought that war to an end, and the American people are \nright now. No one in the administration can tell the American people in \ngood faith and in good conscience that we are making progress in Iraq. \nIraq is sliding deeper into civil war, and our military cannot solve \ntheir problems. It is time the President listen to the Iraq Study \nGroup, the Congress, and the American people and work with us to bring \nour troops home.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the United Nations issued a progress report \non the progress of violence in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that \nsections of that report be printed at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Summary\n\n       1. The Government of Iraq continued to face immense \n     security challenges in the face of growing violence and armed \n     opposition to its authority and the rapidly worsening \n     humanitarian crisis. A number of large-scale insurgency \n     attacks had devastating effects on both the civilian \n     population and Iraqi law enforcement personnel, and continued \n     to claim lives among Multinational Force (MNF) personnel. \n     Civilian casualties of the daily violence between January and \n     March remained high, concentrated in and around Baghdad. \n     Violent deaths were also a regular feature of several other \n     cities in the governorates of Nineveh, Salahuddin, Diyala and \n     Babel. The implementation of the Iraqi-led Baghdad Security \n     Plan (Khittat Fardh al-Qanun) on 14 February saw an increase \n     in Iraqi and MNF troop levels and checkpoints on the streets \n     of Baghdad, expanded curfew hours and intensified security \n     operations and raids. The challenge facing the Government of \n     Iraq is not limited to addressing the level of violence in \n     the country, but the longer term maintenance of stability and \n     security in an environment characterized by impunity and a \n     breakdown in law and order. In this context, the intimidation \n     of a large segment of the Iraqi population, among them \n     professional groups and law enforcement personnel, and \n     political interference in the affairs of the judiciary, were \n     rife and in need of urgent attention.\n       2. In its previous reports on the human rights situation in \n     Iraq, UNAMI regularly cited the Iraqi Government's official \n     data,\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\n     including the Ministry of Higher Education's statistics on \n     killings among academics and the Ministry of Interior's \n     statistics on killings among police officers. It is therefore \n     a matter of regret that the Iraqi Government did not provide \n     UNAMI access to the Ministry of Health's overall mortality \n     figures for this reporting period. UNAMI emphasizes again the \n     utmost need for the Iraqi Government to operate in a \n     transparent manner, and does not accept the government's \n     suggestion that UNAMI used the mortality figures in an \n     inappropriate fashion.\n       3. Evidence which cannot be numerically substantiated in \n     this report nonetheless show that the high level of violence \n     continued throughout the reporting period, attributable to \n     large-scale indiscriminate killings and targeted \n     assassinations perpetrated by insurgency groups, militias and \n     other armed groups. In February and March, sectarian violence \n     claimed the lives of large numbers of civilians, including \n     women and children, in both Shi'a and Sunni neighborhoods. \n     One of the most devastating attacks occurred on 3 February \n     when a truck packed with a ton of explosives detonated, \n     killing an estimated 135 people and injuring 339 others in a \n     busy market in the predominantly Shi'a district of al-\n     Sadriyya of Baghdad. While government officials claimed an \n     initial drop in the number of killings in the latter half of \n     February following the launch of the Baghdad Security Plan, \n     the number of reported casualties rose again in March.\n       4. In its previous reports, UNAMI expressed its concern \n     that many Baghdad neighborhoods had become divided along \n     Sunni and Shi'a lines and were increasingly controlled by \n     armed groups purporting to act as protectors and defenders of \n     these areas. Efforts to find a long-term and durable solution \n     to mass displacement will necessitate a reversal of this \n     trend, enabling civilians to return to their homes safely and \n     voluntarily. According to figures from the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), an estimated \n     736,422 persons were forced to flee their homes due to \n     sectarian violence and military operations since the \n     bombing of the al-Askari shrine in Samarra' on 22 February \n     2006. Of these, more than 200,000 were displaced since \n     December 2006. Together with 1.2 million IDPs displaced \n     prior to 22 February 2006, they are in need of continuous \n     assistance, including shelter and improved access to the \n     Public Distribution System (PDS). Additionally, \n     Palestinian refugees residing in several neighborhoods in \n     Baghdad continued to be victims of the deteriorating \n     security situation. According to a Palestinian human \n     rights organization and other Palestinian sources, 198 \n     Palestinians were killed in targeted assassinations or \n     attacks on their residential compounds since 4 April 2003. \n     Many Palestinians responded to continuing threats and \n     attacks by leaving their homes and seeking refuge in camps \n     along the Iraq-Syria border.\n       5. UNAMI notes again the serious trend of growing \n     intolerance towards minorities, whose representatives \n     continued to lodge complaints about discrimination, \n     intimidation and individual targeting on religious and \n     political grounds. The 2005 Iraqi Constitution protects the \n     ``religious freedoms'' of all of its citizens. Of equal \n     concern are ongoing attempts to suppress freedom of \n     expression through tighter control of the broadcast media and \n     printed press. UNAMI noted several incidents of harassment, \n     legal action and intimidation against journalists addressing \n     issues of corruption and mismanagement of public services in \n     the Region of Kurdistan. Across the country, attacks against \n     journalists and media outlets continued, resulting in a high \n     number of casualties among media workers.\n       6. UNAMI remained concerned at the apparent lack of \n     judicial guarantees in the handling of suspects arrested in \n     the context of the Baghdad Security Plan. While in his public \n     statements Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pledged that the \n     government would respect human rights and ensure due process \n     within a reasonable time for those under arrest, there were \n     no references to any mechanisms for monitoring the conduct of \n     arresting and detaining officials. The new emergency \n     procedures announced on 13 February contained no explicit \n     measures guaranteeing minimum due process rights. Rather, \n     they authorized arrests without warrants and the \n     interrogation of suspects without placing a time limit on how \n     long they could be held in pre-trial detention. The use of \n     torture and other inhumane treatment in detention centers \n     under the authority of the Ministry of Interior and the \n     Ministry of Defense continues to be of utmost concern. UNAMI \n     re-emphasizes the urgent need to establish an effective \n     tracking mechanism to account for the location and treatment \n     of all detainees from the point of arrest.\n       7. During this reporting period, UNAMI further expanded its \n     monitoring and reporting activities in the three northern \n     governorates under the authority of the Kurdistan Regional \n     Government (KRG), where the security situation remained \n     stable. Infringements to freedom of expression, including \n     press and media freedoms, were of serious concern. Equally \n     serious was the lack of due process with regard to detainees \n     held by Kurdish security forces (Asayish), the majority on \n     suspicion of involvement in acts of terrorism and other \n     serious crimes. Hundreds have been held for prolonged periods \n     without referral to an investigative judge or charges brought \n     against them. UNAMI also noted the absence of serious \n     measures by the KRG authorities to address the growing level \n     of violence against women, including prompt investigations \n     and criminal prosecution of perpetrators.\n       ``Civilian casualties of the daily violence between January \n     and March remained high concentrated in and around Baghdad.'' \n     [page 3 of U.N. report.]\n       ``By late February, government officials announced that the \n     number of such killings had decreased, which they attributed \n     to the success of the Baghdad Security Plan. Despite this \n     announced decrease, the number of victims was nevertheless \n     high, with up to 25 bodies still being found on some days \n     during this period in Baghdad. March again witnessed a rise \n     in the number of casualties, with reports of large number of \n     bodies found in Baghdad, al-Ramadi, al-Hilla, Kirkuk, Mosul, \n     Khalis, Tikrit and Himreen.'' [page 8 of U.N. report.]\n       ``Despite reports from Iraqis in late February that \n     security had somewhat improved, there were a series of \n     indiscriminate attacks targeting civilians, and the rate of \n     kidnappings remained high.'' [page 7 of U.N. report.]\n       Large-scale suicide and car bomb attacks were carried out \n     between January and March, with several incidents claiming \n     the lives of more than 50 people each [page 6 of U.N. \n     report].\n       According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, more \n     than 200,000 Iraqis have been displaced since last December. \n     [page 4 of U.N. report.]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that this conference \nreport includes the minimum wage bill. After 10 long years, we will \nfinally be able to send a minimum wage increase to the President. It's \nlong overdue, and it's yet another reason why the President should sign \nthis important bill.\n  The minimum wage bill passed the House and Senate by overwhelming \nmargins in January and February of this year. Under it, minimum wage \nworkers will get a raise of $2.10 per hour. Those who work full time \nwill earn an additional $4,400 a year.\n  That's enough to pay for utilities that might otherwise be shut off, \nto put gas in the car so you can get to work, or to pay for after-\nschool care for a son or daughter who might otherwise be left home \nalone.\n  In many ways, including the minimum wage increase in this bill on \nIraq couldn't be more appropriate. The minimum wage represents the \nvalues our troops are fighting for--basic fairness. It's about what we \nstand for as a Nation.\n  Americans believe that hard work should help you build a better life \nfor your family. They believe that a job should keep you out of \npoverty, not force you to live in poverty.\n  Our troops are away fighting to provide a better future for the \npeople of Iraq. We'd like to think that our men and women in uniform \ndon't have to worry about the economic security of their families here \nat home. But many of our fighting forces have husbands or wives back at \nhome who are struggling to make ends meet.\n  Ten percent of military spouses earn between $5.15 and $7.25 per \nhour. 50,000 military families will benefit from an increase in the \nminimum wage to $7.25 per hour. Our troops are overseas putting their \nlives on the line for their country, and we should provide fair \nopportunities for their spouses who are working hard here at home.\n  I hope we can provide these families--and all other struggling \nfamilies across the country--with the fair wages they deserve as soon \nas possible. I hope the President will do the right thing for our \ntroops and for America's minimum wage workers by signing this important \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, at the beginning of my remarks, I wish to \nassociate my remarks with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman. \nI think his point-by-point rebuttals to previous declarations were \nappropriate and were right on point.\n  I will not talk long, but I rise to explain precisely why I will vote \nagainst this supplemental. In fact, there are a number of reasons I \nwill vote against it--140,000 reasons are the men and women deployed \nright now on behalf of the United States of America and the civilized \nworld.\n  It is right for the Senate to debate this war. It is right for us to \nask questions. But it is wrong to hold hostage the money that supports \nthose troops. We should separate the money from the debate. We should \nnever hold hostage the money for our troops who are, on order of the \nPresident of the United States, defending our country and what we stand \nfor.\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\n  There are almost 3,300 reasons I will vote no; that is, the \nsacrifices that have already been made on behalf of the United States \nof America, those troops who have fought and those who have given the \nultimate sacrifice, troops like Diego Rincon, the first soldier from \nGeorgia to die in Iraq, and LT Noah Harris, a famous Georgian who \nsacrificed his life as well. I have known those families. I have gone \nto those services. I understand the sacrifice, and I know how they feel \nof the pride of their sons who fought on behalf of this noble cause.\n  There are six additional reasons--my grandchildren. This is the \nultimate war between good and evil. This is but one battle in a war \nthat will determine the future security of the world. Make no mistake, \nthere have been mistakes made, but it would be a horrible mistake to \nnot confront terror or the agents of terror, because if we do, they \nhave won.\n  Unlike any other war ever fought by the United States, we are \nfighting a group of people who don't want what we have, they don't want \nus to have what we have: the Bill of Rights; the right for me to \nexpress myself and Senator Kennedy to do the same without fear or \nwithout cowering; the right for the press to call it as they see it; \nthe right to worship as you see fit; the right to bear arms. The 10 \nbasic rights of the Bill of Rights are precisely what they want to take \naway, not only from us but from the rest of the world.\n  Terrorists want us to cower in fear and want to run the world based \non that principle. To pass a supplemental appropriations bill that \ncouches the support of our troops based on arbitrary deadlines that \nonly serve to benefit the very people we fight is just plain wrong.\n  I relish debate of this war every day on the floor and hope we will \ncontinue. The way you avoid making mistakes in the future is debating \nthose things which have happened in the past. But it would be the worst \nof mistakes to withhold funding from our troops or condition it upon \narbitrary deadlines and circumstances in another country, at another \ntime, at another place.\n  Mr. President, I end my remarks by thanking those brave men and women \nwho have sacrificed and those who are sacrificing now and the families \nof those troops, many of them families who live in my State of Georgia. \nI will vote for the supplemental appropriations of our troops \nunconditionally and separate our debate of other issues to another \ndocument. But I will not support holding hostage our troops or their \nmoney.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ hours ago, along with Senator \nMikulski, I attended a mobilization ceremony for members of the \nMaryland National Guard who are being deployed to Iraq. All Marylanders \nare proud of the service of our members of the National Guard who have \nbeen called up and have served in Iraq and Afghanistan and are now \nbeing called up. It was an emotional morning as these soldiers said \ngoodbye to their families.\n  I can tell you, they are ready. They are ready to serve our country. \nThey will serve with great distinction. I told our soldiers and their \nfamilies I would do everything I could as a Senator to make sure they \nhad all of the resources so they can carry out the mission that has \nbeen assigned to them as safely and as effectively as possible. That is \none reason I will vote for this conference report. I told their \nfamilies I would do everything I could to help support their needs and \nto support the needs of military families around this Nation and to \nsupport the needs of veterans around this Nation, to take care of their \nsupport services, including their health care needs. That is another \nreason I will be voting for this conference report.\n\n  We need a change in our mission in Iraq so our soldiers can achieve a \nmission that is in the best interest of this country. That is another \nreason I am supporting this conference report. It spells out a mission \nthat is in the best interest of this Nation and can be achieved. We \nneed to change our role in Iraq. We need to get our soldiers out of the \nmiddle of a civil war, to focus on the war against terror, to help the \nIraqi people take care of their own needs, to bring our troops home. \nThat is another reason I will be supporting this conference report.\n  We need measurable and achievable benchmarks for the Iraqi Government \nso they can secure their own country to undertake political \nreconciliation and to provide basic needs for ordinary Iraqi citizens, \nanother reason I will be supporting this conference report.\n  We need a political framework to include all the Iraqi stakeholders \nin order to provide a political answer to the problems of that country, \nanother reason I support this conference report.\n  The President of the United States has threatened a veto. That would \nonly delay the delivery of much needed funds to our forces, delay a \nchange in direction in Iraq, and undermine the need for political \nreform in Iraq itself. We have our responsibility. Our first \nresponsibility is to act and to pass this supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  I urge colleagues to support this appropriation. It is in the best \ninterest of the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, a lot has been said about this bill. \nLet's get the facts straight before we cast a vote. This administration \nhas said: If you vote for this bill, you don't support the troops. \nNothing could be further from the truth. This bill is the ultimate \ndefinition of supporting the troops. The truth is, a ``yes'' vote \nensures our troops are equipped and prepared to defend themselves, \nmoves them out of another country's civil war, and provides health care \nthat has been lacking for those who return home injured. This is not \nabout surrender, this is about our best chance for success.\n  A vote against this $124 billion spending bill is a vote against the \n$100 billion for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. A vote against \nthis bill is a vote against a billion-dollar increase to get \ndesperately needed equipment to our National Guard and Reserve who \nfight abroad and protect us at home. A vote against this bill is a vote \nagainst $3 billion for the purchase of 8,500 mine-resistant, ambush-\nprotected vehicles to protect our soldiers from deadly roadside bombs. \nA vote against this bill is a vote against nearly $3 billion to help \nreform an overburdened veterans health system struggling to take care \nof our returning wounded. A vote against this bill is a vote against \n$900 million to research and treat posttraumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injuries, two of the most critical issues facing \nwounded soldiers. A vote against this bill is a vote against more than \n$650 million in emergency funding for children's health care coverage. \nWithout this funding, we are closing our doctors' doors to our Nation's \nchildren. A vote against this bill is a vote against $6.9 billion for \nthe victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita who are still struggling to \nrebuild their homes and their lives more than a year after the storms \nhit.\n  A vote against this bill is a vote against allowing States to have \nstronger standards to protect chemical security plants. A vote against \nthis bill is a vote against over $2 billion in homeland security \ninitiatives, including mass transit, port security, and other measures \nthat passed in the 9/11 bill in the Senate.\n  Quite frankly, I don't have faith in President Bush's escalation, a \nplan with benchmarks but no real consequences. I have said again and \nagain, benchmarks without consequences are just aspirations. We have \nseen countless misguided plans from this administration, but the Iraqis \nhave never been held accountable.\n  We were told that by the end of 2006 a provincial election law would \nbe approved. That benchmark has not been met. We were told the Iraqis \nwould approve a law for debaathification, but that benchmark has not \nbeen met. We were told the Iraqis would create a law to help restrain \nsectarian militias. That benchmark has not been met. We were told that \nIraqis would establish a law to regulate the oil industry and share \nrevenues, but that benchmark has not been met. We were told that by \nMarch the Iraqi Government was supposed to hold a referendum on \nconstitutional amendments, but that benchmark has not been met.\n  Time and time again, the Iraqi Government has fallen short, and time \nand\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nagain this administration has looked the other way, basing their plans \non the hope that the Iraqi Government will step up.\n  Continuing this failed policy in Iraq based on the mere hope that \nthings will improve is not good enough. The broken promises must stop.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle point out that the President is \nthe Commander in Chief. I remind my friends that the Constitution puts \nthe Congress in charge of appropriating funds. Congress has the power, \nthe right, and the obligation to make sure we spend the taxpayers' \nmoney wisely. What we are saying today with this bill is no more blank \ncheck for the Iraq war.\n  This bill sends a strong message to the Iraqis that it is their \nresponsibility to take control of their own country and that our \ninvolvement in Iraq is not indefinite. As Thomas Friedman has written: \nIt is time to decide ``we will no longer play host to a war where we \nare everyone's protector and target.''\n  We must put in motion a plan to bring a responsible end to this war. \nI urge all colleagues to vote for the supplemental, a vote that takes \ncare of our troops, a vote to responsibly bring our troops home, and a \nvote for a new direction in Iraq and here at home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the title of this bill, ``The U.S. Troop \nReadiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Act,'' doesn't say \nmuch for the contents of this legislation because it has gone way \nbeyond that with a lot of material that has nothing to do with the \ntitle. The Finance Committee matters definitely don't fit into this \nbill.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd has said on so many occasions the Founding Fathers vested \nthe great power of the purse in the Congress. Likewise, the other great \npower, the power to raise taxes, is vested in Congress. The power of \nthe purse, appropriations, is our power. We are directly accountable to \nour constituents for our spending actions. In that vein, I deeply \nrespect the deep traditions of the Appropriations Committee.\n  As former chairman and now ranking member of the Finance Committee, I \nalso deeply respect the division of power. The power to tax is our \npower as a committee, and we are directly accountable to our \nconstituents for our taxing actions. We should mix the jurisdiction of \nthe two great money committees--Finance and Appropriations--rarely, if \nat all. It should only occur if at all when the senior members of the \ntax writing and appropriations committees agree. Mixing tax writing and \nappropriations jurisdiction should not occur. As a leadership power \nplay, those kinds of actions demean the committees.\n  Fortunately, the leadership respected this division of jurisdiction \nbetween the tax writers and appropriators over the last 6 years. \nUnfortunately, early on in the tenure of this new Democratic majority \nand their leadership, we have seen a dramatically different course of \naction for purely partisan reasons.\n  The Democratic leadership inserted into this sensitive supplemental \nappropriations bill two major matters that involve Finance Committee \njurisdiction. So the first lesson we have learned is that the line \nbetween the tax writing committee jurisdiction and appropriations \njurisdiction will not be observed. That will only undermine each \ncommittee and break down the committee process. The second lesson is \nthe ``I told you so.'' Shortly after the Senate acted on the minimum \nwage and small business tax relief bill, I said I had learned something \nfrom the Democratic leadership, as they were in the minority over the \nlast 6 years. It was a lesson the Democrats taught us while they were \nin the minority. That lesson is, get a preconference agreement. Put \nanother way, if you are in the Senate minority, as we are now, don't \nagree to a conference unless you secure an agreement for fair treatment \nin advance. That is something that worked well for the Democrats while \nthey were in the minority, something we ought to have learned, and we \nhave learned.\n  Now let me say I appreciate all the consultation and courtesy that \nChairman Baucus has given me. He worked with me and I worked with him \nto get the minimum wage, small business tax relief bill through the \ncommittee. But the composition of the final package that is before us \nis heavily weighted toward an extension and modification of the work \nopportunity tax credit--and I support that credit--and the benefits of \nthat policy are delayed. Small businesses need tax relief to be in sync \nwith the time of the minimum wage kicking in. Both of these outcomes do \nnot reflect a proportionate agreement between the House and Senate \nbills. The arbitrary ceiling on the amount of tax relief was not a fair \nbalance. This agreement confirms that a preconference process--learning \nthat from the Democratic minority of the last 4 years--is necessary to \nensure that a conference agreement will reflect the priorities of both \nbodies. I will reiterate my point to the Republican leadership again on \nthat. This process proves that we need a preconference agreement before \nagreeing to go to conference in the first place.\n  Now I will return to the substance of the deal, Mr. President. I am \nhearing from a lot of small business folks who are going to be paying \nthe minimum wage. They want to retain their current workforces, hey \nhave to look to the bottome line. They are very disappointed that the \narbitrary $5 billion limit meant that important tax relief measures \nwere tossed out. I am referring to a simplification of the cash method \nof accounting. That proposal would cut down on a lot of paperwork small \nbusinesses currently have to do. I'm also referring to faster \ndepreciation rules for new restaurant buildings, and I am referring to \nfaster depreciation rules for retailers and owner-financed building \nimprovements. All of these proposals would help with the coming cash \ncrunch that these small businesses will be facing.\n  I am not hearing from a lot of the big business folks who were \ntargeted by the loophole closers and antitax shelter measures. Because \nof House opposition and fealty to the $5 billion number, those \nreasonable revenue raisers were tossed out the window.\n  This was a missed opportunity. It was a missed opportunity for a \nCongress that started with a supposed reform mission to send a message \nto K Street in DC and Wall Street in New York City. That message \nwould've been simple. Don't engage in tax shelters like the so-called \n``SILO'' transactions. Don't move your company headquarters offshore to \nminimize your American tax responsibilities like the so-called \n``inversion'' transactions. For high-paid CEOS, don't rely too much on \nnon-qualified deferred compensation arrangements. Nope, you can kiss \nthat opportunity goodbye.\n  When it came to the small business tax relief package, K Street and \nWall Street big business won and Main Street small business lost. Not a \ngood outcome. Hopefully, once this bill is vetoed and we return to the \nminimum wage/small business tax relief package, Main Street small \nbusiness will come out on top.\n  Now I am going to turn to the other Finance Committee material in \nthis time-sensitive appropriations bill. I am referring to Medicaid \nproposals in the conference agreement. There is a provision in the \nconference agreement that would prevent CMS from implementing the cost-\nlimitation rule.\n  Certainly, a one-year moratorium is an improvement over the two-year \nmoratorium that was in the bill as passed by the Senate, but the \nlanguage in the bill still encourages states to push the envelope on \npayment schemes.\n  If CMS gets a waiver or state plan amendment that has authority to do \nwith the rule, I don't think CMS has the authority to turn it down. \nNeither does CMS.\n  And after trying to work it out with the sponsors of the provision \nfor the last couple of weeks, I don't think they want CMS to have any \nauthority either.\n  Why? This is a provision written for the benefit of a special \ninterests so they can avoid real scrutiny of their financing \narrangements.\n  This provision will encourage states to offer payment schemes that \nCMS has previously disallowed as being inappropriate.\n  It will encourage litigation if CMS tries to assert that they do \nstill maintain jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\n  This is just bad public policy.\n  The inspector general has investigated and reported to congress on \nwhy there are problems in the areas the rule addresses.\n  We have not had the first hearing on why the rule doesn't work and \nmust be stopped.\n  This is a tremendous mistake and should not be in the bill.\n  The way that this provision is paid for is equally noxious.\n  The extension of the Wisconsin pharmacy plus waiver is an unnecessary \nearmark. Every State but Wisconsin has changed their pharmacy \nassistance program as the MMA required.\n  But why hasn't Wisconsin? It's very simple. They want the Federal \ndollars that Medicaid provides and the rebates they get from drug \ncompanies.\n  That it is an earmark is bad. But the way the language is written is \nreally offensive. The language is written in a way that games \nMedicaid's budget neutrality test. It's written to guarantee that it \nappears to save money.\n  The reality is that Wisconsin will be providing many poor seniors \nwith less of a benefit than they could get through part d. Wisconsin \ncharges greater cost-sharing than Medicare for low income seniors.\n  It truly is another missed opportunity. They could have paid for this \nwith a provision we would have gladly supported.\n  But again, the special interest won out. We could have struck a \nprovision that the House Rules Committee stuck in the tax bill in the \nmiddle of the night last December that creates an unfair advantage for \ncertain private fee-for-service Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Senator Baucus and I thought this was terrible policy, we said so on \nthe floor, and have wanted to change it. Plans based in Illinois and \nNevada are among the plans it advantages most. So for some reason, \nstriking the provision didn't make it into the bill. It's a corporate \ngiveaway that should be eliminated.\n  Legislating to prevent CMS from cleaning up intergovernmental \ntransfers scams on this appropriation bill sets a bad precedent. That \nis clear. It's legislation on Medicaid and, that is a basic part of the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  If the Senate proceeds in this manner, then nothing then would \nprevent the Senate legislating changes on other Medicaid and Medicare \nissues on appropriation bills without the benefit of hearings or \ncommittee action on those subjects.\n  Invading the Medicaid and Medicare jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee is a mistake.\n  It is almost impossible to cope with Medicaid and Medicare \nlegislation on appropriation bills. These are complex issues that are \nbest dealt with by the committee of jurisdiction.\n  This bill is going to be vetoed. The Appropriations Committee will \nreturn to its work to fund the troops in the field. We ought to focus \non that. On minimum wage/small business tax relief, we need to go to \nregular order. Let's arrive at a pre-conference agreement on the House \nand Senate bills and go to conference and hash it out with a real \nconference. Unlike this situation, the chairmen and ranking members of \nboth tax writing committees should be conferees. In that setting, we \ncan arrive at a bipartisan agreement that passes the House, Senate, and \nbe signed by the President. On the Medicaid provision, it ought to be \ncrafted by the committees of jurisdiction and incorporated in a vehicle \ncontrolled by those committees.\n  After the veto, let's get this right. I would ask the leadership to \nget out of the way of the tax writing committees and let us do our work \non our schedule in line with our committees' objectives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, there is a lot of emotion in the Congress \ntoday, as there is in the country, on this issue. There is a lot of \nrhetoric flying back and forth. Some of it is inaccurate. The first \nthing we need to say is that this is not an issue of the Congress \ndenying anything to the people of the Armed Forces. We are exercising \nour constitutional power to appropriate. We are sending the President a \n$100 billion check. If he chooses not to cash that check, it is up to \nhim to come up with the reasons why, not us.\n  There is also a lot of rhetoric going around over the past couple of \ndays about defeatism and surrender and accusations of betraying the \ntroops. We need to calm down a bit. There is no one in this Congress \nwho wants anything more than to support those people who have been put \ninto harm's way. I believe people should be very careful on this floor \nto discuss political motivations of our military which reflect very \nclosely the political views of the country at large. Poll after poll \nshows that.\n  In respect to accusations about defeatism and surrender, the question \nbecomes: Defeat by whom and surrender to whom? We won this war 4 years \nago. The question is, When do we end the occupation? Iraq has been in \nturmoil for thousands of years. It will be in turmoil of one kind or \nanother long after we leave. The U.S. military is not going to change \nthe societal makeup of Iraq. The Maliki government is not going to \nbring peace among Iraq's competing factions without the strong, over \ndiplomatic cooperation of other countries in the region. Despite the \nrhetoric to the contrary, these other countries, all of them, do have \nan incentive in seeing a stable Iraq.\n  This administration claims that our deciding to withdraw from the \ninternal problems of Iraq will embolden the enemy. Then the question \nbecomes: Just which enemy? Do they mean the enemy that attacked us on \n9/11? We all know that was Osama bin Laden. He not only was not in \nIraq, but he was opposed to the continuation of Saddam Hussein's regime \nbecause it was a secular government.\n  Do they mean Saddam Hussein, whose ouster was their justification for \nbeginning this war? Do they mean the remnants of the old regime, which \nwas their catch phrase when the occupation began? Do they mean al-\nQaida? Let's remember, there were no al-Qaida operations in Iraq before \nwe invaded, and there will be very little motivation for al-Qaida to \ncontinue in Iraq once we have left. Not only that, but the Iraqis \nthemselves are quite capable of standing up to al-Qaida without our \nhelp. They do not want al-Qaida in Iraq. That is why they are \ncooperating with our forces in Anbar Province right now. And they kept \nal-Qaida out of Iraq before we got there. Or do they mean what this \nadministration continually calls the insurgency, as if there were a \nmonolithic group of defeatable guerrilla forces? We keep hearing about \nthis insurgency. Well, which one? The Sunnis? The Shia? Ask yourselves \nagain, against whom are the insurgents operating? Some are operating \nagainst us. Why? Because we are there and they want us to leave, as a \nvast majority of the Iraqis say in poll after poll. Some are operating \nagainst other ethnic factions in Iraq. But to what extent is that the \nresponsibility of the United States military, to try to end ethnic \nrivalries that go back hundreds of years? Or perhaps, as defined by \nthis administration, we are talking about the factions within the \nfactions that are busily trying to kill each other, just as the \nfactions in Lebanon were trying to kill each other more than 20 years \nago, when we put the marines in the middle of that violence.\n  Some say our withdrawal from Iraq would create chaos in the region. I \nhave long advocated a withdrawal that should be accomplished under the \numbrella of a strong diplomatic effort that involves regional \ncooperation. But I must regrettably say, for those of us who warned \nagainst invading Iraq and decapitating that existing Government, the \nchaos the administration is now predicting is exactly the chaos their \ninvasion has brought us in the first place--instability in the region, \na loss of American prestige, a rise in the influence of Iran, an \nincrease in terrorist activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to say I am very disappointed in some \nof the provisions in this report. I must say that candidly. At the same \ntime, I believe, very strongly, the reservations\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\nI have pale in comparison with my disappointment in the failure of \nleadership that has brought us into Iraq in the first place--a \nleadership that refuses to find a suitable turning point which will \nbring us out.\n  This administration must be confronted. It must understand the \nAmerican people have grown tired of this disastrous, one-dimensional \napproach to a crisis that demands innovative answers. It is for that \nreason I support this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on a question that \ncontinues to weigh rather heavily on my heart. I am reluctant to ask it \nsince such a question would never have been asked, or even \ncontemplated, by previous generations of Americans. But it is a \nquestion that now must be asked since it is central to our future: Do \nwe, as Americans, have the resolve to see our commitments through? It \nis a question we must confront in a number of policy arenas that will \ndirectly affect the way we, our children, and our grandchildren will \nlive in this new century. Do we have the resolve and the courage to \nmeet our commitments and confront the looming crisis of Social \nSecurity?\n  Do we have the resolve to balance our Nation's budget? Do we have the \nresolve to endow our children with a proper education so they can \nmaster and push the limits of science, thereby providing our Nation the \nmeans to compete in an increasingly competitive world economy?\n  However, at this point in our Nation's history, the crucial question \nconcerning our resolve as a nation does not relate to matters of \ndomestic policy. It relates to our commitments beyond our borders. It \nis the central and critical component in determining who will prevail \nin the global war on terrorism. Will we, our coalition allies, the \npeople of Iraq and their elected Government, emerge victorious? Or will \nwe renounce and abdicate our commitments and responsibilities to the \nIraqi people--leaving them to a fate controlled by terrorists and \nleaving our future security as a nation in peril?\n  Generations ago that, unto itself, would be a stain on the honor of \nthis country; but these are different times.\n  Turning our back now will only provide our enemies with a new base of \noperations, and unlike Afghanistan, this base contains vast oil wealth. \nImagine al-Qaida with billions of dollars to do with as Osama bin Laden \nwishes. I wonder what they will buy with all that money. Remember, \nshortly after the liberation of Kabul, there were numerous media \nreports that al-Qaida was working on chemical weapons.\n  So, with that in mind, I again ask: Do we have the resolve to see our \ncommitments through?\n  As we seek to answer this question, I am reminded of events that \noccurred during the summer of 1940. The Nazi armies, seemingly \ninvincible, had conquered Western Europe. France, the Netherlands, \nPoland, Denmark, Norway, and Belgium had all fallen.\n  The British Army, after its rescue from Dunkirk, no longer possessed \nsufficient numbers of artillery and tanks to defend against the \nblitzkrieg. All that stood between Hitler and complete victory was the \nEnglish Channel and 650 fighters of the Royal Air Force.\n  Then Hitler offered a deal. In exchange for a ``free hand in \nEurope,'' the Nazis would provide ``guarantees'' that they would not \ninvade Great Britain.\n  Despite the fact that the British Army lacked sufficient equipment to \neffectively repulse an invasion, Prime Minister Churchill resolved to \nkeep his nation's commitment to the people of Europe. He would not \nabandon them.\n  His words, which I will paraphrase, still echo today:\n\n       The Battle of France is over . . . the Battle of Britain is \n     about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of . . \n     . Western civilization. . . .The whole fury and might of the \n     enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he \n     will have to break us . . . or lose the war. If we can stand \n     up to him, all Europe may be free. . . . But if we fail, then \n     the whole world, including the United States . . . and all \n     that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of \n     a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps \n     more protracted, by the lights of perverted science. Let \n     us, therefore, brace ourselves to our duties and so bear \n     ourselves that . . . men will say--This Was Their Finest \n     Hour.\n\n  This is the lesson that history teaches us: that resolution to see \nyour commitments through is what great statesmen and nations are made \nof--that peace and justice can only be restored through bold action.\n  So what do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle offer, \nknowing full well this lesson of history? In a word: defeat. In his own \nwords, the Democratic leader said on the floor of the Senate, on April \n19, the ``war is lost.'' To be fair, the leader did attempt to temper \nhis words by saying:\n\n       As long as we follow the President's path, the war is lost. \n     But there is still a chance to change course and we must \n     change course. No one wants us to succeed in the Middle East \n     more than I do. But there must be a change of course.\n\n  So what plan, or new course, does the Democratic leader or other \nDemocrats offer? How can we, in his words, ``succeed in the Middle \nEast''?\n  His answer can be found in the conference report to this bill. But I \nwarn anyone who attempts to read this legislation, first you must wade \nthrough billions in spending allocated to projects and programs that \nhave nothing to do with the war before you learn how our Democratic \ncolleagues plan to ``succeed in the Middle East.''\n  What is their plan for victory? Well, their legislation states that \nno matter what happens, the bulk of our forces will begin to withdraw \nafter July 1, or if the President makes certain certifications, after \nOctober 1.\n  So what is their strategy? I believe Winston Churchill would have \ncharacterized the Democratic strategy as: guaranteed defeat.\n  Is this resolve?\n  Is this determination to see our commitments through?\n  No.\n  This is the worst case of capitulation to appeasement since Neville \nChamberlain spoke the words ``peace in our time.''\n  What is needed now is leadership. Now, at this critical moment in \nhistory, great nations need to follow Churchill's advice, yet the \nDemocrats offer us only Chamberlain's.\n  The Democratic leaders previously stated, in 2005:\n\n       [A]s far as setting a timeline . . . that's not a wise \n     decision because it only empowers those who don't want us \n     there, and it doesn't work well to do it.\n\n  Wise and sound words. That was real leadership. Unfortunately, that \nwas when the polls supported their position to stand firm. Now the \nDemocratic leaders have reversed themselves because the polls have told \nthem that is what they should do.\n  Two days ago, during an interview on CNN, the Senator from Nevada was \nasked if he would believe the words of our new commander General \nPetraeus ``that there is progress going on in Iraq, that the so-called \nsurge is working. Will you believe him when he says that?''\n  What was his response? ``No, I don't believe him, because it's not \nhappening.''\n  Now, I find this to be an incredible remark. Less than 3 months ago, \nthe majority leader had joined a unanimous Senate and voted in favor of \nGeneral Petraeus. But this was more than just another confirmation \nvote. The major subject of his confirmation hearing and the subsequent \ndebate on the Senate floor was the new strategy the general had \noutlined.\n  So what is the new strategy? Simply put, General Petraeus is \nexecuting one of the tenets of a classic counterinsurgency strategy by \nproviding and maintaining security to the local population and \nneighborhoods in Baghdad. Only when this is achieved will the Iraqi \nGovernment be able to continually offer basic services such as clean \nwater and electricity, which are the backbone of any modern society.\n  This, in turn, creates conditions where the Iraqi people can begin to \ndevelop a growing economy and where families feel safe to send their \nkids to school. As these goals are achieved, more and more of the \npopulation will desire even greater stability and will support and work \ntoward creating Iraqi Government institutions and security services \nthat maintain and enhance this new, secure environment.\n  How is this different from the past? Previously, U.S. forces would \nclear an area of insurgents, but, unfortunately, soon thereafter, our \nforces would leave and the insurgents would return. Now, under General \nPetraeus's plan, American and Iraqi security forces will\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\nmaintain security in the cleared neighborhoods of Baghdad. To date, \nover 50 security force units, based in what are called garrisons, can \nbe found in the neighborhoods of the city, and even more are planned.\n  That is why the additional forces that we are sending to Iraq are \nvital. It is not more for more's sake, but to maintain a secure \nenvironment for the Iraqi people and to help them stand up for \nthemselves.\n  Based upon the briefing that the Senate received yesterday from \nGeneral Petraeus, and information I have examined as a member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, I can report that we are seeing signs of \nprogress.\n  Frankly, I believe the changes that have been made in the last 3 \nmonths are remarkable and need our full support, and it is readily \napparent we do not yet have all the promised forces deployed and in \nIraq.\n  So let us return to the question that I asked when I began my \nremarks: Do we, as Americans, have the resolve to see our commitments \nthrough? Or will we falter?\n  That is what the vote on this conference report will demonstrate. \nWill we stand with firm resolve behind our commitments and see our new \nstrategy through? Or do we adopt a policy of appeasement and hope that \nal-Qaida, and those who wish us harm and seek to destroy the values \nthat we hold so dear, do not follow us home to our country?\n  What side of history do you wish to be on? Based on America's history \nand our resolve that has seen us through so many difficulties in the \npast, I believe the American people do not want retreat, they want \nsuccess and security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we can do both: fund the troops and change our mission \nin Iraq. That is what this supplemental does, and we urge you, Mr. \nPresident, to look into your heart, reconsider, and sign it.\n  The American people, bipartisan majorities in both Houses of \nCongress, military experts, and the Iraq Study Group all agree the only \nway to succeed is to change our mission. Only President Bush and his \nsmall band of advisers think we should stay the course.\n  What is more, the President wrongly thinks the only way to support \nour troops is for everyone to rubberstamp his policies. That is not \nwhat the American people want. The American people want a change in \nmission. They want a new direction, not more of the same failed \npolicies.\n  I have talked to generals and to NCOs. They do not want us to \nrubberstamp the President's policies. They want a debate because \neveryone knows the present direction is failing. Everyone knows we need \na change of mission--except the President and his small group of \nadvisers who are clustered down there at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and \nrefuse to listen--stubbornly refuse to listen--to the experts, to the \nAmerican people, and to so many others.\n  First, let me tell you what this supplemental does. The first thing \nit does is fund our troops. It fully supports our troops. It allocates \nmore dollars for them than the President has asked for.\n  Second, it provides reasonable and meaningful guidelines to protect \nour troops by ensuring that all units that are sent overseas to fight \nare ready, trained, and equipped to fight. It will require the \nDepartment of Defense to adhere to its own guidelines to ensure that \nevery unit that is deployed is ``fully mission capable.''\n  Why would President Bush want to send our troops to Afghanistan and \nIraq, into fierce battles, without the training and equipment needed to \nget the job done and come home safely? But when he says he will veto \nthis bill, he will veto that provision.\n  Third, this legislation shows both the United States and Iraq how to \nchange the failing strategy.\n  What has happened is simple. Our mission in Iraq has devolved so that \nmost of what we do is patrol, police, and stand in the middle of a \ncivil war. The Sunnis and the Shiites have hated each other for \ncenturies. Their enmity goes way back. They will continue to not like \neach other, not work with each other, fight with each other long after \nwe are gone--whether it is 3 months or 3 years. Yet most of the time \nour troops--our brave men and women--are simply caught in the middle of \na civil war. We have not chosen a side; we are just in the middle.\n  The original purpose in Iraq was to fight terrorism. Our supplemental \nsays, let's go back to that original purpose: counterterrorism, as well \nas force protection, and training the Iraqis. But to continue to spend \nmost of our time, effort, and lives--lives--patrolling a civil war \nmakes no sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 30 additional \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in conclusion, again, there is a simple \nanswer to our problems in Iraq, which is mission change. We can both \nsupport the troops and change the mission. That is what the American \npeople want. That is what the experts tell us. I believe that is what \nmost of our soldiers want. I urge support of this supplemental and \nagain urge the President to reconsider and sign it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our job in this body right now for all of us \nis to fight and win the war that radical Islam terrorists have declared \nupon us.\n  As I see it, Congress has three choices. First, Congress can and \nshould provide the money it needs to support the troops. That is the \nonly proper choice. There is money in this supplemental for additional \nmine-resistant armored protection vehicles--vehicles the Army reports \nwill reduce casualties by 70 percent. Each day this Congress neglects \nto fund the troops and pass a bill that can be signed into law is an \nadditional day our troops are without that protection.\n  Second, if you want to stop this war, Congress can vote to cut off \nfunding. However, doing so would tell the troops that even though 77 \nMembers of this body said we should fight this war to keep America \nsafe, we would now be telling all of our brave men and women in Iraq, \ntheir families, and the families of those who gave their lives, we did \nnot mean it, that we did not want to finish this job, and that when the \ngoing gets tough, America gets going--out. We will tell America we are \nno longer concerned about keeping our homeland safe from a new 9/11, \nabout denying al-Qaida the safe haven it has declared it is seeking in \nIraq to prepare for new attacks on America. While that choice is deadly \nwrong, it is an honest choice under the constitutional power given to \nthe Congress.\n  Third, and most deplorable, Congress is delaying the funds by forcing \nvote after vote, while attempting to score political points, and trying \nto micromanage the war, even though war management is the President's \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  Most sadly, this is the course of action the Democratic leadership \nhas chosen--a course that will result in ``death by a thousand cuts.''\n  Those who are attempting to end the war precipitously, politically, \nbecause they think it will score them seats in Congress or perhaps even \nthe White House, are putting polls and politics ahead of our national \nsecurity. Democratic leaders have stated they intend to pick up seats \nas a result of what they have referred to as a lost war. These comments \nwere not just broadcast here in the United States; this talk about war \nloss was picked up and broadcast gleefully by al-Jazeera to our enemies \nand the world.\n  The Los Angeles Times has reported a top House Democrat has said: Our \ngoal is to keep giving them--Republicans--votes on Iraq.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Democratic strategists also believe that repeated votes on \n     the war will allow the party to expand its congressional \n     majorities in next year's elections by continuing to link GOP \n     lawmakers with the President and his war policies.\n\n  I am sure our troops in the field appreciate very much that some of \nthe Democratic leadership are working to win the war--not the war \nagainst our sworn enemies blowing up our troops and killing Iraqi \nchildren who rely on\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nour protection but against fellow Americans in coming elections. Where \nis their strategy to win, to leave Iraq a stable and safe country?\n  As I have said, the other side's leadership, by embracing a policy of \nrepeated votes and delaying funding, is denying our troops the \nresources they need. Their enemy should be al-Qaida and its murderous \ninsurgents, not the President and Republican opponents.\n  Substituting Congress for General Petraeus's leadership and telling \nhim how to run a war from 8,000 miles away is a disaster. General \nPetraeus is executing a new plan, a plan essentially recommended by the \nBaker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group, which last fall our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle said we should follow. But now even if some \ngenerals in Congress think they are smarter than General Petraeus and \ncan devise in legislation a better plan, which I strongly doubt, I am \nvery doubtful they can adjust that plan to conditions on the \nbattlefield. This is a sad reflection of how vested the Democratic \nleaders are in defeat--defeat for President Bush but defeat for our \ntroops and our safety in Iraq.\n  Congress attempts to put artificial political timetables on the \nmanagement of the war and does nothing to accomplish the mission. The \nBaker-Hamilton commission explicitly rejected timetables for \nwithdrawal, because they recognized--the bipartisan group recognized--\nit was a disaster, and many Democratic leaders have previously stated a \nlegislative timetable, laying out this strategy in legislation, is \nabsolutely unacceptable. What the political timetable does is give al-\nQaida the encouragement and information it needs to know when and where \nand how to attack our troops.\n  This January, in open session, leaders of our intelligence community \ncame before the Senate Intelligence Committee to answer questions about \nestablishing a political withdrawal and the consensus was alarming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand I had 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did. He is down to 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the intelligence community said withdrawing \nforces before we can provide security will result in chaos: more \nkilling among Iraqis, an al-Qaida safe haven, and a possible regionwide \ndeclaration of war.\n  We need a political solution in Iraq, not in Washington, to allow the \nleaders in the national unity government to come together, but to get \nthat, we need to repel the terrorists, we need to rebuild the Iraqi \nsecurity forces. What won't help General Petraeus is direction from \narmchair generals in Congress.\n  What I would say to those who want to direct the war is: If you want \nto run it, you will own it. When a newly revitalized al-Qaida carries \nout a renewed 9/11 scale attack, you will own that one, too.\n  Mr. President, hundreds of thousands of soldiers and their families \nat home will remember that. I suggest we support our troops.\n  As my colleagues know, I hail proudly from the Show-Me-State.\n  If all of the rhetoric in Washington about supporting the troops is \ntrue and I suspect it is, then I suggest that the Congress show our \ntroops that we do support them, get them the funds and give them a \nchance to succeed.\n  Comments like ``The war is lost'' do not help our troops, but they do \nembolden the enemy.\n  Our actions should inspire our troops and the millions of Iraqi \ncitizens who actually trust that Americans will not embrace defeat.\n  Our action should not be one that inspires al-Qaida and the murderous \ninsurgents.\n  We should not pass legislation that provides our enemy the clear path \nto their victory, a victory which some in this body have already \nawarded them.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for his remarks. As the \nsenior Republican on the Intelligence Committee, I know he has \nknowledge and information and passion maybe some of the rest of us \ndon't have the benefit of.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to oppose final passage of the emergency \nsupplemental funding bill.\n  It troubles me to oppose this bill because our troops need this money \nright now to continue operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the \nglobe.\n  But there are so many things I find objectionable in this final bill \nthat I cannot support it.\n  The bill still includes over $21 billion in unrequested items--$425 \nmillion for rural schools, $3.5 billion for agricultural assistance, \nand even an additional $910 million more than the President requested \nin FEMA disaster relief for communities impacted by Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita.\n  It is not that these programs are bad or wrong, because many of them \naren't--in fact, most of this assistance is very valid. We desperately \nneed that FEMA money on the gulf coast to repair our communities as \nmany communities are still struggling to get back on their feet.\n  But this is an emergency supplemental that is supposed to focus on \nthe urgent needs of our military in fighting the war on terror. We \nshould not be including money for a multitude of requirements that may \nbe important, but are not urgent.\n  I'm also very troubled that this bill micromanages the President's \nability and constitutional mandate to serve as Commander in Chief of \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Through this bill, the Congress says to General Petraeus: ``Thank you \nvery much, General. We unanimously think that you're the right man for \nthe job--we just don't believe you when you tell us what you need to do \nthat job, or when you tell us how things are actually going on the \nground.''\n  It tells our enemies: Just wait a few months, and the place is yours.\n  It tells our friends: When the going gets tough, don't count on \nAmerica to stick around.\n  And it tells President Malaki: Good luck with that democracy and \nfreedom thing you are working on. Let us know how it turns out.\n  This is exactly the wrong message at the wrong time to send--not only \nto the terrorists in Iraq, but to terrorists and rogue states around \nthe globe.\n  The stakes only get higher from here. I'm convinced that surrender in \nIraq will embolden these terrorists and ultimately threaten the \nsecurity of our shores.\n  Don't get me wrong--I, too, want our servicemen and women to come \nhome as soon as possible. I pray that not 1 more American has to pay \nthe ultimate price in this struggle.\n  I agree that the Iraqi Government must step up to the plate as soon \nas possible, and take responsibility for the security of their county.\n  I have always supported the establishment of benchmarks to ensure \nthat expectations are clear, and progress against those expectations \ncan be measured.\n  What I don't agree with is telling the President and the Generals on \nthe ground how to do their job.\n  But this bill is even worse then that--this bill is like a bait and \nswitch: we'll give the money today for operations in Iraq, but you need \nto come home tomorrow because we don't support operations in Iraq.\n  Which one is it? Do we support our troops and their mission, or not?\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want our troops to \ncome home tomorrow, they can make that happen. It is easy. The \nConstitution of the United States gives the legislative branch the \npower of the purse.\n  You can cut off money today--you can vote against this bill today.\n  When you start marking up the fiscal year 2008 Defense appropriation, \nyou can cut off Iraq funding there as well.\n  But what we have here is political theatre. This is a ``do nothing'' \nCongress at its worst.\n  The President has been very clear many times--he is going to veto \nthis bill because of the withdrawal timeline and all the excess \nprojects. And in the Congress, there will not be enough votes to \noverturn that veto. Then what?\n  I guess we'll get to talk about this matter again next week or the \nweek after. But at some point, very soon, our inaction is going to \ncause some real harm--and I hope that the real harm doesn't include the \nloss of more American lives around the world.\n  If we can't get moving and fund our troops with no strings attached, \nwe are eventually going to impact the safety and capability of our \nmilitary, not just in Iraq, but around the globe.\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\n  This should not be about the President. It should not be about the \nCongress. This is about funds for our troops--the men and women in \nuniform--who are in Afghanistan and Iraq right now, doing the job they \nwere directed to do. They need this money. They need the equipment the \nmoney would provide to do the job, and that should be our focus.\n  This funding was requested by the President on February 6, almost 3 \nmonths ago, and through this political theater we are fixed to embark \nupon a vote we know will not become law, one that will surely be vetoed \nby the President. This legislation is dead before arrival. Why don't we \nacknowledge that and find a way to get the job done without delaying \neven more, forcing our military to move funds around, to borrow from \nPeter to pay for Paul. It will have a negative effect on our men and \nwomen in the Navy and the Air Force and the rest of the military.\n  We could have turned this over to our senior members of the \nAppropriations Committee, my colleague from Mississippi and the other \nappropriators, including the Senator from Washington State, and said: \nLook, work through this. Let's get something we can support in good \nconscience.\n  There are more problems with this than just artificial deadlines. The \n$21 billion in domestic spending was added beyond--I believe that is \napproximately right--what the President asked for. Some of it is needed \nand justified. I know my colleague from Mississippi and the \nAppropriations Committees on both sides of the aisle and on both sides \nof the Capitol could have worked through that and come up with a bill \nto get the job done. It is not that some of these adds are not good and \njustified. The President asked for funds for Katrina recovery, and I \nthink maybe some funds have been added to that beyond what he asked \nfor. This is important to me and my State, but I refuse to be trying to \nget funds that may be immediately needed for a disaster on the back of \nour troops and to delay it even more. Surely there is a way we can come \nto an agreement on how to achieve this result.\n  This is an emergency supplemental. Some of the things that have been \nadded--not just money but language--don't relate to an emergency \ndomestically or in terms of what our troops need. That language should \nbe stricken. We make grand speeches here on the floor about how we \nshould not legislate on appropriations, yet things have been added in a \nnumber of categories, not just the minimum wage and small business tax \ncuts that don't get the job done.\n  This is a classic case of micromanagement where the Congress is \ntrying to set dates. We have an alternative. If we want to use the \npower of the purse to stop the war on terror and our efforts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, vote no. Vote no. Vote against this. Don't provide the \ntroops the funds they need or any of this other money. If you want to \ndo that, go right ahead. There is a procedure. But here we are trying \nto set ourselves up as the final judges.\n  General Petraeus was here yesterday telling us what is going on. He \nwas honest. He didn't say it is perfect. There was a change in \nstrategy. It is being implemented and carried forward. We voted 100 \npercent for General Petraeus, and now we are saying: Oh, well, sorry \nabout that, General. We are going to try to tell you when to do what, \nnot wait until we get more reports from you. Wait months, our enemies \nare told, and the place is yours. When the going gets tough, can you \ncount on the Americans to see it through in a responsible way? This is \nthe wrong message at the wrong time.\n  Mr. President, I am an incurable optimist. Let's get it done. Let's \nlet it go on through. The President will veto it. But next week, can we \nget together and do the right thing for our country and for our troops? \nI beg my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have made our \npolitical points, our political statements. Then let's get our job \ndone. Let's do the right thing for America, not the right thing for \nRepublicans or Democrats but the right thing for our troops.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on our side \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be recognized; following her, \ngoing back and forth, then Senator Feinstein for 4 minutes, and then \nSenator Jack Reed for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have a book which is a poignant and \nwonderful account of life in Louisiana after the storms. It is called \n``1 Dead in Attic,'' written by Chris Rose, a reporter for the Times \nPicayune. The title refers to the unique system for identifying what \nhappened in people's homes during the storm. The notation, sprayed on \nthe wall for everyone to see, would explain whether there were pets or \npeople or, in this case, someone no longer living. This symbol--this \ninformation--remains spray painted on the sides of many houses to this \nday.\n  In this book, Mr. Rose describes 2005:\n\n       This was the year that defines our city, our lives, our \n     destiny. Nothing comparable has ever happened in modem times \n     in America, and there is no blueprint for how we do this. We \n     just wing it. Do good works. Save someone or something.\n       *  *  *\n       If there was no New Orleans, America would just be a bunch \n     of free people dying of boredom.\n\n  A photographer for from England noted:\n\n       I witnessed the destruction of one of the finest cities in \n     America, her soul bared and exposed, her inequality and \n     inefficiency laid out for all to see. And through it all I \n     saw the grace, courage and dignity of her citizens, forced to \n     flee their homes, their lives, their history. I trust her \n     soul will be repaired.\n\n  I want to thank Chairman Byrd for his many courtesies and assistance \nin this bill. I also want to thank his staff for all of their hard work \nand long hours. I also want to thank Senator Cochran, who has done so \nmuch for the people of the gulf and who shares so much of the hard work \non the recovery with me and the other gulf coast Senators. In fact, the \nentire Senate appropriations Committee--my fellow Senators and their \nstaff--have been so supportive of us through this process--and I thank \nthem.\n  There are many provisions that will help the ongoing recovery efforts \nin my state and along the rest of the gulf coast included in this bill.\n  I intend to vote for this bill because it provides critical resources \nand removes obstacles to the recovery of the gulf coast. In addition, \nthe bill provides funding necessary to support our troops in Iraq.\n  Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in August of 2005 and Hurricane \nRita followed on its heels just a few weeks later. While a great deal \nof time has passed, and a lot of progress has been made, this recovery \nwill take many, many years.\n  As you have heard me say on many occasions, the damage to the gulf \ncoast is unimaginable. Sometimes I think that people forget just how \nunimaginable the damage was. Mr. President, 1,836 people were killed. \nTo put this in perspective, this means that l out of every 3 people who \nwork here in the Senate would have lost their lives 6008 people work \nfor the Senate. Mr. President, 650,000 people were displaced. It would \nbe as if every single solitary person in the District of Columbia were \ndisplaced from their homes and neighborhood.\n  Over 275,000 homes were damaged, with over 205,000 of those in \nLouisiana alone--again, this is the equivalent of every home in the \nDistrict of Columbia being flooded, damaged, or destroyed, and 240,000 \njobs were lost. Here in DC, we are lucky, there are more jobs than \nthere are residents. However, were a similar disaster to strike DC., \nevery other person employed in the District would have lost their job. \nAlso, 875 schools were destroyed and there was $82 billion in property \ndamage.\n  If you want to try an experiment at home, paint a chalk line at a \npoint 3 feet from the floor and imagine that everything below that line \nsubmerged in water.\n  But we are coming back from that aweful year. It is a long, hard \nstruggle but there are signs of hope. Our people are rebuilding their \nhomes. There are now over 223,000 people living in Orleans Parish--\nabout 43 percent of the pre-storm population--and over 450,000 in \nJefferson. Our businesses are reopening. Visitors are returning. Our \nschools are rebuilding--better than before. We are creating a new \nhealth care system for the 21st century in Louisiana.\n  However, much work remains. This bill will help so very much with \nthose\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\nongoing efforts. I want to thank all of you for supporting these \nmeasures.\n  Some out there have taken issue with this funding. This assistance to \nthe gulf coast is not ``extraneous''. It is necessary. However, the \nPresident has called this spending ``excessive non-emergency \nspending''. This is simply untrue.\n  This bill provides about $3 billion in additional direct aid to the \ngulf coast. We spend $8.6 billion per month in Iraq, which is $286 \nmillion per day. So, we are providing the people of the Gulf Coast with \nthe equivalent of 10 days of the funding for the war. To date; we have \nspend $470 billion in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq only, we have spent \n$379 billion.\n  Mr. President, you tell Cameron Parish where all 6 of their grade \nschools were closed until October 31, 2005 and 62 percent of all school \nfacilities were destroyed that their teachers don't deserve a little \nextra money and that providing $30 million for bonuses and incentives \nfor the grade schools in Mississippi and Louisiana is too much.\n  You tell Dillard University, which had $115 million dollars in \nphysical damage and lost $26 million in revenues--which counts Ellis \nMarsalis and Reavis Ortiz among its alumni--whose campus is not far \nfrom the lower levee breach of the London Avenue Canal and which \nsuffered extensive flood damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina \nand whose main hall, Nelson Hall, was destroyed by a fire, during the \nflood, whose students took their normal classes at The New Orleans \nWorld Trade Center and The New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel until \nthis fall, that $30 million in assistance--to be divided among the 27 \nuniversities that were closed in Louisiana and Mississippi--is \n``excessive''.\n  You tell small businesses in St. Bernard--where there were 1,400 \nbusinesses before the storm and only about 400 have re-opened and less \nthan 70 percent of the population has returned--that $25 million for \neconomic injury loans is ``extraneous'' or unnecessary. Even Wal-Mart \nhas not reopened in this Parish.\n  You tell the people of Jefferson Parish, St. Bernard Parish, \nPlaquemines Parish, and Orleans Parish that their levees should not be \nrepaired and that their homes and businesses will remain vulnerable to \nthe next storm and that an additional $1.3 billion for their safety is \ntoo much.\n  What is included in the Emergency Supplemental is FAIR funding, \nwaiver of the 10 percent match. This bill eliminates the red-tape \nassociated with so much of the Federal money. This supplemental \nincludes the FAIR Funding Act language which will waive the local cost \nshare for FEMA public assistance. This is FAIR. Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita were the first and third most costly disasters in the history of \nthis country and the Federal Government has waived this local share \nrequirement in 32 different disasters since 1985, including Hurricanes \nAndrew and Iniki.\n  Forgiveability of CDLs is included. This bill will also correct a \ngrave inequity and allow for our community Disaster loans to have the \nsame treatment as all others.\n  Levee money is included. In addition, this bill will shore up a \nshortfall that has been identified by the Army Corp of Engineers. They \nhave estimated that they will be short $1.3 billion dollars this year \nfor necessary levee work in Louisiana. However, instead of asking for \nmoney to alleviate this shortfall, the administration merely wanted to \nrob Peter to pay Paul. However, this committee has wisely decided to \nprovide additional money for this necessary work. Unfortunately, I do \nnot believe that this will be sufficient to meet the ongoing needs--or \nwill be enough to restore, repair and rebuild our levee system.\n  There is support for our education system. The Universities in \nLouisiana have been critical to our rebuilding efforts. They have \nfought to come back and about 80 percent of the students have returned. \nMore importantly, the universities have provided resources and \nleadership during the rebuilding of the region. In Louisiana, they are \nalso helping our grade schools stand up--forging new and stronger \npartnerships with our new school system.\n  Our universities suffered over a billion dollars in damages as a \nresult of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In the 4th supplementa1 passed \nlast Congress, we provided $40 million dollars for higher ed \nassistance--of which $33 million went to Louisiana universities. In \nthis bill, we appropriate another $30 million, every penny of which is \nnecessary.\n  We also provide $30 million in order to reward the teachers who give \ntheir hearts out trying to bring normalcy to our children and prepare \nthem for the future.\n  I appreciate the continued assistance that this committee and my \ncolleagues in the Seanate have given to the people of the Gulf Coast--\nand the hope that this legislation provides to them.\n  Mr. President, it is not often I disagree with my good friend from \nMississippi, but I will say the people of the gulf coast don't think \nthey are riding on the backs of the troops; they think they are the \ntroops. The Guard and National Reserve who were in Iraq who are from \nLouisiana, 3,000 fighting in Iraq, only to come home to have their \nhomes destroyed, have their jobs lost. They don't think it is too much \nto ask of the President to include $3 billion in a $24 billion bill--$3 \nbillion for the gulf coast recovery, which is domestic emergency \nfunding that has been included in every supplemental, even when the \nRepublicans drafted a bill where there was money for domestic \nemergencies. The people of the gulf coast don't believe $3 billion is \ntoo much to ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We are spending $8.6 billion a month in Iraq, which is \n$286 million a day. In this bill, we are asking the gulf coast to have \n10 days--10 days of funding for the troops who are fighting in Iraq who \nlost their homes in the gulf coast. I don't think it is excessive. I \nask the President to rethink his veto policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in 1999, when George Bush was a \ncandidate for the Presidency and President Clinton was Commander in \nChief, George Bush had this to say about American troops in Bosnia:\n\n       Victory means exit strategy, and it's important for the \n     President to explain what the exit strategy is.\n\n  Well, the Congress has been asking for an exit strategy year after \nyear for 4 years now. In fact, President Bush has no exit strategy. So \nthe United States is bogged down in an impossible situation: ``Shock \nand awe,'' followed by ineffective follow-on efforts. Today, in the \nfifth year of this war, the United States is enmeshed in what has \nbecome a vicious and terrifying civil war. It cannot be won through the \nuse of American military force. This war can only be won through \npolitical accommodation between Sunni and Shia, which means only the \nIraqis can settle it, which means only the Iraqi Government can settle \nit. To this date, they appear to be unable to do what needs to be done \nto stop this conflict.\n  So without an exit strategy, the war goes on, the killings continue, \nand the casualties rise. Nearly 25,000 Americans injured, with tens of \nthousands of Iraqis killed and injured, and hundreds of thousands of \npeople displaced from their homes by this war. Estimates put Iraqi \ncivilian deaths in the first 3 months of this year at more than 5,500 \nin the Baghdad area alone.\n  On Monday, two truck bombs killed nine members of the 82nd Airborne \nDivision and wounded 20 more. It was the deadliest day of combat in the \ndivision's history since the Vietnam war.\n  I fear that unless Congress acts and puts forward that exit strategy, \nthis bloodshed will continue year after year. That is intolerable.\n  Today, we have before us a measure that offers a solution and a \nstrategy to fill the void left by the administration. The Iraqi \nsupplemental spending bill responsibly funds our troops and changes the \ncourse in Iraq.\n  Most importantly, it sends a message to the Iraqi Government that the \nU.S. commitment is not open-ended, that benchmarks will measure the \nprogress, and that political accommodation is crucial.\n  Under this legislation, the Iraqi Government would be judged on how \nit disarms militias, pursues Sunni-Shia reconciliation initiatives, \nestablishes fair\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\noil-sharing laws, reforms debaathification laws, and protects the \nrights of minorities. This is as it should be.\n  This legislation ensures that our troops have sufficient rest and \ntraining and are provided well-maintained equipment. This is as it \nshould be.\n  It allows for a redefined mission for American forces limited to \nantiterrorism operations, training Iraqi forces, and protecting \nAmerican civilians and members of the Armed Forces. This is as it \nshould be.\n  It begins the process of bringing our troops home. Into the fifth \nyear of a war, this, too, is as it should be.\n  The American people spoke in a clear voice. Today, the United States \nSenate will as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to \nthis measure before the Senate, and I will cast my vote against it.\n  This measure places undue constraints on the utilization of our brave \nmilitary, together with our allies working with us and, indeed, \nconstraints on the utilization of the Iraqi military, which likewise \nhas followed through with a brave performance with our forces.\n  This is a very complex situation on the battlefield, and in the \ngovernment, with respect to Iraq. Last fall, with other Senators, I \nreturned from my eighth visit to Iraq and I said the complexity of the \nbattlefield has forced the sovereign nation of Iraq to ``drift \nsideways.'' Regrettably, it continues, in my judgment, to drift. Our \nforces, and indeed our allies in that country, have fought bravely and \nare following through on their mission to try and bring about a greater \ndegree of security in Baghdad.\n  While I expressed some concerns about the ``surge'' operation when it \nwas announced on January 10, it is an ongoing operation now. We are \nlosing life and limb daily, and we must allow our troops to be properly \nfunded to carry out their missions.\n  Now, we heard yesterday from General Petraeus, and in my judgment, he \ngave a very factual, pragmatic, professional military opinion, showing \nobjectivity. He is to be commended and our forces bravely fighting \nunder his command should likewise be commended as well.\n  I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues a comment made by \nour distinguished Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, during his \ntrip. He said, ``our commitment to Iraq is long-term, but it is not a \ncommitment to have our young men and women patrolling Iraqi streets \nopen-endedly.'' In no way does he question the long-term need for our \nNation to show its resolve and commitment to give security to this \nregion of the world. But he clearly says it is not open-ended.\n  We cannot ask our forces, nor the Iraqi forces, to risk life and limb \nduring their missions, unless the Iraqi legislature and the government \nof Iraq begins to give an equal or greater measure of commitment to \nperform their responsibility to achieve political solutions. A military \nsolution, we all acknowledge, will not alone achieve a strong, \nsurvivable, sovereign Iraq. A political solution and a framework of \nlegal reconciliation is essential.\n  And we must, at this point in time, bring to light a serious \npotential problem, which I have been told, that the Iraqi legislature \nmight possibly take a 2-month recess during July and August. That is \nnot acceptable. An action of that consequence would severely hinder \nthose of us, myself and others, who are looking at the greater issue \nbeyond Iraq as to the impact on this region if the combined efforts of \nour country and other nations fail.\n  We are seeing some progress as it relates to the international group \nof nations coming together, the border nations are scheduled to meet a \nsecond time. It is through only political reconciliation measures and \nbold leadership by the Prime Minister and each and every Member of the \nIraqi Legislature, that this conflict can bring forth a stable, \nsovereign government, that is fully functioning, and is capable of \nproviding for its own security. In so doing, Iraq will then be able to \nplay an integral role in the security of this region.\n  Further, we must again, and again, signal to Prime Minister Maliki \nand to each of the Members of the Iraqi Legislature that they must do \ntheir job in a timely manner because every day Iraqi and American lives \nare being lost in their heroic effort to provide the security for the \nIraqi government to function.\n  Finally, while I will vote against this report, I pledge to work with \nother Senators on how to rewrite the next bill, following the veto \nprocess, for these funds are essential for our troops and as we draft \nthe next bill, we must we must assure the world of our resolve and \ncommitment to the region.\n  I yield the floor so that others may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we must change the mission of our military \nforces in Iraq. We have to concentrate on training Iraqi forces so they \ncan assume the burden of this hostility. We have to continue our \nefforts in counterterrorism to strike those international terrorists \nwherever they may be. And we have to protect our forces at all times. \nBut we cannot continue an open-ended commitment and involvement in a \ncivil war. That is essentially what the President is urging us to do.\n  This appropriations bill provides more resources for our military \nthan was requested. It also funds extremely important domestic \nconcerns, including the Veterans' Administration, so we can keep faith \nwith those veterans who have served and will continue to serve; and \nalso, as my colleague from Louisiana pointed out, we have to begin to \nreconstruct our gulf coast. It is ironic that we are pouring billions \ninto Baghdad, helping them build all sorts of utilities, and still \nAmericans languish along the gulf coast.\n  It also includes the Murtha standards of readiness on our forces as \nthey deploy, to ensure that no American unit goes into the war zone \nwithout proper equipment, proper training, and appropriate personnel. \nThe President has the ability to waive this under certain \ncircumstances, so we are not unduly constricting his ability as \nCommander in Chief.\n  Then, of course, this legislation has benchmarks so that the Iraqi \nGovernment can stand up to their task. I think the one common theme \nthat I have heard in this body is, ultimately, this is a political \nstruggle and, ultimately, the Iraqi Government will make the decisions \nthat are so important to the success of their efforts, which will allow \nus to begin a phased redeployment. But their record is very \ndiscouraging when it comes to their government.\n  Leon Panetta published an editorial a few days ago in the New York \nTimes. He points out the Iraqis promised to achieve by the end of last \nyear and the beginning of this year the approval of a provincial \nelection law but, so far, no progress; approval of a law to regulate \nthe oil industry and share revenues, and a draft is circulating, but it \nhas not been approved by the parliament; approval of a debaathification \nlaw to reintegrate officials of the former regime and have a \nreconciliation, but there has been no progress; approval of a law to \nrein in sectarian militias, but no progress there either.\n  By March, the Government promised to hold a referendum on \nconstitutional amendments. No progress.\n  By May, the Prime Minister committed to putting in place the law \ncontrolling militias, with no progress; the approval of the amnesty \nagreement, with no progress; and the completion of all reconciliation \nefforts. No progress.\n  If the Iraqi Government is unwilling to stand up to the demands they \nmust face, then I think we can legitimately--and, indeed, we must--tell \nthem very strongly that we will not support an open-ended commitment to \nthat Government, that we will change our mission and refocus our \nresources.\n  It is interesting to me that our Secretary of Defense and the \nSecretary of State, those who travel to Baghdad, stand up and say this: \nTell them what we are doing here is important, critical, and will \nhappen, unless the Iraqis change. But in Washington, we are criticized \nfor doing this.\n  I think the reality in Baghdad has to be the same as here. We have to \nmove forward with this legislation to change the course, protect our \nsoldiers in the field, and to allow a chance for success in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\n  I think we are all committed, we hope, to a policy that will lead us \nand the people of Iraq to a much better day. I believe supporting this \ninitiative will do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this conference report is the wrong \nresponse to the President's request for the supplemental funding that \nis urgently needed by the Department of Defense.\n  While most of the funds--over $109 billion--are appropriated to wage \nthe global war on terrorism, to continue operations in Afghanistan, and \nto support Iraqi security forces, the conference report also includes \nfunding for continuing the recovery from Hurricane Katrina and ensuring \nthat our veterans receive the care they deserve.\n  I am very disappointed this bill includes language that sets forth a \ntimetable for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. We should be \nproviding the President with a bill he can sign so our military forces \ncan receive the funding they now need.\n  I recently brought to the attention of the Senate a letter I received \nfrom the Joint Chiefs of Staff on April 2 describing the urgency of an \nappropriations bill and their concerns about further delays of funding. \nIt has been now over 3 weeks since that letter was received.\n  It is very clear that delay is occurring, and it is undermining the \nability to manage the responsibilities of the Department of Defense. We \nare talking about life-and-death situations and the ability to obtain \nequipment, armaments, and the training that is necessary by our Armed \nForces to carry out their mission.\n  The Joint Chiefs pointed this out in their letter:\n\n       Without approval of the supplemental funds in April, the \n     Armed Services will be forced to take increasingly disruptive \n     measures in order to sustain combat operations.\n\n  In addition, they stated:\n\n       These restrictions increase the burden on servicemembers \n     and their families during this time of war.\n  I cannot support this effort to dictate the management of this very \nserious threat to our Nation's security interests. The opponents of the \nPresident's efforts to win the battle against the terrorists should not \nbe permitted to hijack this supplemental appropriations bill. The \nresponsible thing for us to do is to send this conference report to the \nPresident so he can veto it. We can then revise it so it can be enacted \nwithout the offensive language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining on this side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe that all Members of this body \nsupport the Defense appropriations section. The only area of concern \nand contention is that which refers to Iraq.\n  I think all of us agree that our forces today are bogged down in \nIraq. They are caught in the middle of a civil war, and we need a \nchange in plans. This war has dragged on too long and, incidentally, \nlonger than our involvement in World War II. Staying the course is not \nworking, and I, for one, am not convinced that it ever will.\n  The only way we can succeed in Iraq is if the Iraqis fundamentally \nchange the dynamic. The language in the conference agreement embraces \nthis idea of offering a new plan. This new plan eventually should allow \nfor forces to be withdrawn from Iraq.\n  The proposal establishes a goal--and I repeat the word ``goal''--of \nredeploying most of our forces from Iraq by next March. It does not \nmandate that all the troops are removed. To the contrary, it allows \nthat forces remain in Iraq to protect U.S. and coalition personnel. It \nalso stipulates that U.S. forces can continue to train and equip the \nIraqis so they can better defend themselves, and it directs that we may \ncontinue targeted counterterrorism operations in Iraq.\n  This is a balanced plan. It recognizes that we still have \nresponsibilities in Iraq and will continue to do so even a year from \nnow, but it will force the Iraqis to fight their own civil war if they \ninsist on doing so.\n  We all know there are very few military objectives to be achieved in \nIraq. We defeated the Iraqi Army 4 years ago. We should keep that in \nmind. I still recall the huge banner on the carrier that said: \n``Mission Accomplished.'' Yes, the military mission was accomplished. \nWe won that part of the war, the part the military can win. We failed \nin not preparing for the aftermath of direct conflict, and now we are \nenmeshed in an untenable position.\n  Our military has performed remarkably. They have achieved their \nmilitary objectives. But the plan to rely on the military to achieve \npolitical objectives has not worked, and what we desperately need is a \npolitical solution. And in the end, how many truly believe we will \nemerge victorious with a Jeffersonian democracy on the banks of the \nTigris River? What is victory? I have asked this question many times. \nWhat will constitute victory? And no one has answered that question. Or \nwe can embrace a new plan that begins to reshape our forces in Iraq to \nprovide those missions that our military is best suited for with a \ngoal, not a mandate, but a goal of redeploying the remaining forces.\n  If Iraq is to succeed, it must assume responsibility for its own \ndestiny. It must decide if it wants to stop the civil war. We cannot do \nthat for them. This is a very modest proposal, but one that is caught \nup in the emotion of the debate. This conference report offers a plan, \none that has much greater chance of success than staying the course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. INOUYE. May I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. It does not mandate a timetable for ending our \ninvolvement in Iraq but provides a new way ahead which will ensure \nbetter protection for our forces and a greater chance for the Iraqis to \nsucceed.\n  This is a good, balanced package. It includes the best from each of \nour bills. It funds the critical needs of our military and provides a \nway ahead for our forces in Iraq.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this conference agreement.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 3 months ago, President Bush set a new \ncourse in Iraq. He proposed a plan to secure Baghdad and its resident \npopulation, and he asked GEN David Petraeus, one of our best military \nminds of this generation, to carry out the mission. A Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress approved the general without dissent and wished him \nwell.\n  Then something strange happened. Soon after sending General Petraeus \ninto the field of battle, the Democratic leadership began its own \nchange in course. It decided this new mission was over before it even \nhad time to work.\n  We were told in January by some of our Democratic colleagues to \nlisten to the generals. Yet this week, with our top general in Iraq \nhere to report on progress, most of those on the other side of the \naisle covered their ears. The Speaker of the House skipped General \nPetraeus's briefing altogether, didn't even go listen to him.\n  This posture may be calculated to impress opponents of the war at \nhome, but it frustrates our troops abroad, and today the Democratic \nleadership does further damage by passing a war spending bill that has \nno chance--no chance--of being signed into law, a bill that calls for \nwithdrawing U.S. troops without regard to conditions on the ground, a \nbill that says we leave in October if the Iraqis have made progress and \nthat we leave in July if they haven't.\n  Let me say that again. This bill says that we leave in October if the \nIraqis have made progress and leave in July if they haven't. Either \nway, we are gone.\n  It should not be this way. We should uphold our end of the bargain \nand pass a bill that funds our troops and gives us a reasonable period \nof time to judge this new strategy.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group has outlined the stakes. They said premature \nwithdrawal would ``almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence \nand further deterioration of conditions. The near-term results would be \na significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional \ndestabilization, and\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\na threat to the global economy. Al-Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as \na historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-\nterm consequences could eventually require the United States to \nreturn.''\n  That is the Iraq Study Group which has been so frequently cited by \nour good friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  Bin Laden knows the stakes, too. In a letter last year, bin Laden had \nthis to say: America's defeat in Iraq would mean defeat in all its \nwars.\n  Yesterday, the commander of a senior Afghan Islamist group said bin \nLaden is personally involved in attacks on Americans in Iraq. General \nPetraeus went even further. He said al-Qaida has declared war on all of \nIraq.\n  I call on my friends on the other side to have an open mind and \nlisten to the general. We must give this plan for winning the military \ncomponent of our strategy in Iraq a real chance to succeed. Without it, \nthere is no political solution. Just 4 months old and operating at half \nits ultimate strength, the Baghdad security plan is already having an \neffect. Military leaders say the increased violence around Baghdad is a \nsign that the terrorists are shaken. The latest attacks were meant to \nbe dramatic and to be visible. They were meant to force our withdrawal \nand ultimately our humiliation.\n  George Orwell said:\n\n       The quickest way to end a war is to lose it.\n\n  This is a road we must not take. This legislation is tragic. If the \nIraqis make progress, we leave; if they don't, we leave. This is not a \nchoice, it is a mandate for a defeat that al-Qaida desperately wants.\n  It is not too late to change course. I ask my colleagues to be as \npatient as our soldiers and marines--and, indeed, the terrorists--and \ndraft a bill that does not arbitrarily circle a date on the calendar \nand trigger withdrawal without regard to conditions on the ground. Then \nwe can tell our troops that help is on the way, that they can finish \nthis mission, and that they will return with honor. If not, if we give \nup, we will truly have reason to fear because if we cannot win this \nmost important battle, how will we ever win the war?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all time has expired on the other side; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is meritorious legislation, important \nlegislation. First, I thank Senator Byrd, the chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee, and his staff for working so hard to get us \nwhere we are. I thank Congressman Obey, chairman of the comparable \ncommittee in the House of Representatives.\n  I know that my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from \nMississippi, does not agree with the Iraq language, but I express my \nappreciation to his staff. This bill has in it more than the Iraq \nlanguage, and his staff has worked with us all the way to get that \ndone. I extend my appreciation for his usual gentlemanly way doing \neverything he does here.\n  Also, because she worked so hard on a lot of things that she was \nassigned to do by Senator Byrd, Senator Patty Murray has done an \noutstanding job on this bill. She is in the Chamber, and I express my \nappreciation to her for her usual fine work but especially her fine \nwork on this matter.\n  The individuals I have just mentioned have delivered to us a \ntremendous conference report, one we can all be proud to send to the \nPresident and we should send to the President. This conference report \nhonors and provides for our courageous men and women in uniform. This \nconference report doesn't forget the emergencies Americans face at home \nwhile the war rages abroad. This conference report makes us more secure \nby charting a new, more sustainable course in Iraq so we can find a \nresponsible end to the war and return our focus to the global \nchallenges that lie ahead.\n  President Bush requested $91.5 billion for continued military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We provided every penny of that \nrequest, but, Mr. President, more. Our bill matches the President \ndollar for dollar on the equipment and training he requested for the \n140,000 troops in Iraq and the 20,000 deployed in Afghanistan, \nincluding hundreds of troops deployed from the State of Nevada.\n  This conference report doesn't stop there because we recognize the \nPresident's request shortchanges our troops and our security in a \nnumber of critical areas. For example, with the roadside bombs that \nhave accounted for over half of the fatalities suffered by our troops \nin Iraq, Democrats have added $1.2 billion for mine-resistant vehicles. \nThis is important.\n  My friend--and he is my friend--the distinguished Republican leader, \nsaid we should live up to our end of the bargain. Our end of the \nbargain? We have done pretty well, spending over one-half trillion \ndollars in the faraway land of Iraq, having lost more than 3,300, \nthrough death, of our finest, 27,000 wounded, a third of them missing \nlimbs, 2,000 double amputees, brain injuries as we have never seen \nbefore, and paralysis. We have lived up to our end of the bargain.\n  At a time when the health care needs of thousands of our soldiers and \nveterans are being ignored, Democrats have added--with the help of two \ncourageous Republicans, who I am confident will vote with us on this \nmatter--we have added $2.5 billion to ensure all of our troops receive \nthe quality care they have earned--our troops--veterans. These funds \nwill improve the unconscionable conditions at Walter Reed and other \nmedical facilities around the country and greatly enhance the care \nprovided to those who suffer from brain trauma and post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\n  Every Thursday, Senator Ensign and I, when we are in session, in the \nJohnson Room, have a ``Welcome to Washington'' for Nevadans. The \nBaileys were here today. They had a 27-year-old son who went to Iraq \nand came home with severe emotional problems. He was fine before he \nwent. He went to a VA facility in Southern California, hundreds of \nmiles away from his parents, where he was not taken care of. He died of \na drug overdose. Not illegal drugs but drugs they gave him. What we \nhave put in this bill to help veterans, those people returning from \nIraq who have been injured, is important. It is in this bill and it \nshould stay here.\n  At a time when our citizen soldiers have been pushed to their limit, \nand most Guard and Reserve units lack the equipment they need to \nconduct their mission, our bill would provide an additional $1 billion \nfor the supplies and equipment they need. Despite the fact a majority \nof the American people disapprove of this administration's Iraq policy, \nthis bill clearly takes care of the men and women who are serving us \ncourageously in Iraq, as clearly as anyone who opposes this legislation \nwould set back or hurt badly our efforts to support our fighting \nforces.\n  We provide for our troops, we do that, but we also believe we have an \nobligation to address emergencies facing Americans here at home. That \nis what emergency supplemental bills were at one time--emergencies that \ndeveloped during the year.\n  President Bush has made numerous trips to the gulf region to take a \nlook at the devastation created by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which \ndevastated that region of the country, but he hasn't done anything \nabout it, to speak of. We believe we have a responsibility to help the \nvictims of this historic tragedy. We agree with the sentiment of the \npeople of this country, who are determined to help their fellow \ncitizens, and that is what this bill does. We provide $7 billion for \nthe victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, whose help is long overdue.\n  Thousands of family farmers and ranchers from virtually every State \nin this country are suffering the effects of extreme drought or \ndamaging weather conditions. These are emergencies. We rely upon these \nAmerican farmers and ranchers for the Nation's food supply, and we \nbelieve we have an obligation to help them when disaster strikes. That \nis why we provide $3.5 billion to help address some of the losses \nsuffered by farmers and ranchers caused by drought, flood, fire, \nhurricanes, and pestilence.\n  More than 5 years after the terrible terrorist attacks of 9/11, we \nknow gaps remain in this Nation's homeland security efforts. This is an \nemergency. We have tried here on the Senate floor to offer amendments \nto cover this. We have been defeated on a straight party-\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nline basis. This bill has that relief. That is why we provide $2 \nbillion for port security, mass transit security, airport security, and \nother initiatives to address the shortcomings identified by the \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission, whose recommendations came down almost 3 \nyears ago.\n  Tens of thousands of children across this country will lose their \nhealth care in the next several months if we don't do something in this \nconference report. This, too, is an emergency. That is why we provide \n$650 million to keep the State Children's Health Insurance Program \nrunning. This is health care for kids.\n  All of these nonmilitary investments are crucial priorities, but \nfully funding our troops and changing the course of the war in Iraq is \nthis bill's primary goal. No one wants this Nation to succeed in the \nMiddle East more than I do. But I know that after more than 4 years of \nmismanagement and incompetence of the war in Iraq by this \nadministration, there is no magic formula or silver bullet that will \nlead us to the victory we all desire. Yet I also believe there is a way \nforward that gives us our best chance to end the war responsibly while \nprotecting our strategic interests, strengthening our security, and \nbetter positioning us to provide the long-term assistance Iraq will \nneed for years to come. This way forward is consistent with what our \nmilitary leaders are telling us, including General Petraeus, who \nrepeated again yesterday, publicly--not privately but publicly--that \nthis war cannot be won militarily. That is what General Petraeus says.\n  I want to talk about what is in this bill as relates to Iraq.\n  First, we transition the U.S. mission from policing a civil war to \ntraining and equipping Iraqi security forces, protecting U.S. forces \nand conducting targeted counterterror operations.\n  Second, we begin the phased redeployment of our troops no later than \nOctober 1, 2007, with the goal of removing all combat forces by April \n1, 2008, except for those carrying out the limited missions I have \nmentioned.\n  Third, we impose tangible, measurable, and achievable benchmarks on \nthe Iraqi Government so they will be held accountable for making \nprogress in security, political reconciliation, and improving the lives \nof ordinary Iraqis, who have suffered so very much.\n  Fourth, we launch the kind of diplomatic, economic, and political \noffensive the President's strategy lacks, starting with a regional \nconference working toward a long-term framework for stability in the \nregion, as recommended by the Iraq Study Group, with Saudi Arabia, \nJordan, Egypt, Syria, and, yes, Iran must be involved.\n  Fifth, and finally, we build up our overburdened military to ensure \nthat only battle-ready troops are sent into battle, and giving them the \nmanpower and support they need to face the daunting challenges that lie \nahead. My friend Congressman Murtha, whom I had the good fortune to \nserve with when I was in the House of Representatives, pointed out \nclearly in the debate on the House floor last night that we are \ncurrently paying 126,000 individuals, independent contractors, to \nsupplement the work of our soldiers. These contractors are not held to \nthe same standards or accountability of our troops, yet often earn tens \nof thousands of dollars more. This is unacceptable. Do the American \ntaxpayers know this, that 126,000 people are being paid over there for \nvarious things? Doing what? Why? This is costing billions, and for \nwhat? And why? This supplemental funding bill was forged by listening \nto Members of Congress from both parties, to military experts, and, \nmost importantly, to the American people. I have had a number of people \nfrom the other side who have come to me and said, we know you are doing \nthe right thing but we can't help you now. There are two people on the \nother side, however, who are coming and saying they are going to vote \non this matter. I don't know what I can say, other than to say it is \nfor the American people, and they have a lot of courage.\n\n  This compromise was forged through thoughtful negotiation. It was \nforged with the firm resolve that we must do what is right for our \ntroops, our Nation's security, and Iraq's future. Once we pass this \nbill, we will send it to the President's desk. We know he has \nthreatened to veto this legislation. But in the same spirit of \ncompromise and bipartisanship with which this bill was written, we hope \nthe President will reconsider his stubbornness and his refusal to \nlisten to the American people. This is a good conference report. It \nprovides for the safety of our troops, it helps Americans recover from \nemergencies that have plagued us here at home, and it sets us on a new \ncourse, away from a civil war with no end in sight, and toward a \nresponsible, phased redeployment, and it holds the Iraqis accountable. \nThis is a responsible plan for redeployment, not a precipitous \nwithdrawal.\n  Our troops in harm's way will always have the resources to do the \nmission their leaders ask of them. It directs our attention to \neliminating al-Qaida, addresses refugee and humanitarian crises, and \nlaunches the diplomatic and political surges necessary to prevent \nregional instability. It also allows us to provide the longer term \ninvestments and the political solutions needed in Iraq. It prevents the \njihadists from being able to claim victory over America, and it begins \nto restore America's prestige, power, and influence in the region and \nthroughout the world.\n  Some will say there is no alternative to the President's course. They \nsay the only course is to stay the course or fail; that there is no \nplan B. But our President is wrong. I say that with all due respect. \nThe choice is in our hands. Today, we have the chance to support our \ntroops, represent the will of the American people, and lead America to \na path of responsibility. If the President refuses to change direction, \nAmerica risks being bogged down in Iraq for years, not months.\n  This President, who took us to war under false pretenses, now needs \nthe courage to admit his policies have failed and work with us to bring \nthe war to a responsible end. This conference report gives him that \npath forward, and I hope he follows it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for Members of the Senate, as we have \nannounced, there will be no more rollcall votes this week.\n  We hope that we can move, on Monday, without any problems, to the FDA \nreauthorization. This is an extremely important piece of legislation \nwhich Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi have worked on for months. Now, \nwe hope we can move to that. We know people want to offer amendments. \nCertainly, that will be part of what we are doing here because the bill \nis imperfect. But it is a bill on which we must move forward. With all \nof the food safety and health safety issues that have come up during \nthe past several years, we must do this. So we are going to move to \nthat bill on Monday. That will be the next order of business for the \nSenate.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, with this vote, Congress has provided \nfunding for our troops while also putting forward sensible provisions \nto begin the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. I call upon the President \nto work with Congress in order to ensure the troops receive these funds \nand that we change course in Iraq.\n  I am also pleased to announce with Senator Schumer that after a long \nstruggle, and thanks to the leadership of Senator Byrd and Senator \nHarkin, we have secured $50 million for the monitoring, diagnosis, and \ntreatment for the thousands of men and women whose health has been \nterribly affected by the dust, debris, and poisons that filled the air \nafter the attacks of 9/11.\n  I am grateful for the support of Senator Byrd, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter who have been steadfast in recognizing our duty to help \nthose who helped New York in our hour of need--and help everyone whose \nhealth and lives have been affected by 9/11.\n  This is a great victory for the victims and heroes, for New York, and \nfor our values which were targeted on 9/11.\n  The Centers of Excellence providing care through the Mt. Sinai \nconsortium and the Fire Department of New York with Federal funds are \ndoing heroic work--but more and more people are walking through the \ndoors because of respiratory problems and other debilitating \nconditions. These treatment centers--centers that provide essential \ncare to those who responded in our time of need--are on the brink of \nrunning out of Federal resources in the fall. Thanks to the funding in \nthis bill, we will be able to send a lifeline of funding before these \ntreatment centers fall over the financial cliff.\n  Based upon the estimates of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, it would take nearly $283 million to treat to 34,000 first \nresponders and workers for just one year. And that number doesn't take \ninto account the treatment needs of forgotten populations, such as \nresidents, office workers, students, and others who were also exposed \nto these toxic substances.\n  The funding contained in this legislation is a great step forward and \nwill serve as a bridge fund until we are able to come up with a long \nterm solution. This $50 million will be used to help provide both \ninpatient and outpatient treatment services for responders and workers \naffected by debilitating respiratory and mental health problems.\n  These are more than names on a list or lines in a budget. These are \nlives that have been turned upside down, often silently, often without \npublic notice.\n  When the towers collapsed, thousands of tons of coarse and fine \nparticulate matter were released into the air, and inhaled into the \nlungs of hundreds of thousands of individuals--substances that included \ncement dust, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, hydrochloric acid, and other \ntoxic pollutants. The combustion of jet fuel after the attacks created \na dense plume of black smoke, filled with other toxic substances like \nbenzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Fires at Ground Zero \ncontinued to burn underground for several months after the attacks.\n  Of course, none of our incredibly brave firefighters, police \nofficers, emergency responders, workers, volunteers and others stopped \nto think about the health implications of what they were walking into--\nthey risked their lives to help save others.\n  The day after 9/11, I visited Ground Zero; it was evident that the \nair was not fit to breathe and these conditions continued for months \nafterwards.\n  Over the next 9 months, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of \nindividuals were exposed to the dust and debris not only at Ground \nZero, but also a site at Fresh Kills, the landfill in Staten Island, \nwhere workers sifted through the debris in an attempt to recover \nevidence from the attacks.\n  People began coming down with what we would later call World Trade \nCenter cough. We heard reports of previously healthy detectives who \ncould bench press 250 pounds unable to lift a child. Firefighters who \ncould run miles no longer able to climb stairs. Construction workers in \nperfect physical shape before the attacks with incredible difficulty \nbreathing after the attacks. Increased risk of cancer. Newly developed \nasthma, bronchitis, persistent sinusitis, laryngitis, or other \nrespiratory problems. For these individuals, their illnesses are a \nconstant reminder of that terrible day.\n  On March 21, the HELP Committee held a hearing--which I led along \nside Chairman Kennedy--on the long term impacts of 9/11.\n  What we heard that day was nothing short of devastating and all of us \nin the room during the hearing came away with a new sense of urgency in \nmaking sure that the workers, residents, students, volunteers and \nothers who are experiencing adverse health effects due to exposure of \n9/11 toxins get the care they desperately need.\n  Of particular concern: many of those who are ill are falling through \nthe cracks of traditional health coverage. According to testimony \npresented at this hearing, more than 40 percent of the responders \nenrolled in the Mt. Sinai treatment program are uninsured, and an \nadditional 23 percent are underinsured. New York City reports that \napproximately 60 percent of those enrolled at Bellevue Hospital's \ntreatment program are also uninsured.\n  Today, Congress has sent a powerful message to the police officers, \nfirefighters, first responders, workers, and volunteers of 9/11: You \nare not forgotten. We will respond to an attack on our values and way \nof life by honoring our values and helping the victims.\n  But we must go further.\n  We need a longer-term Federal solution to provide monitoring, \ndiagnosis, and treatment. The city and local organizations have done a \ntremendous service, but this was as an attack on our whole Nation and \nour whole Nation should support the efforts taking place in New York. \nThese funds will only support the work for the short term. And a third \ntreatment center at Bellevue Hospital--the only center that evaluates \nand treats many of the forgotten victims: residents, office workers, \nstudents, and others--has not received any Federal help at all.\n  I have introduced the 9/11 Heroes Health Improvement Act to provide \n$1.9 billion in grants for ongoing medical and mental health treatment \nand monitoring, and I will continue to work with my colleagues on the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to ensure that we have \na long-term solution for 9/11 affected individuals.\n  We should always keep in our hearts the people who deserve our help.\n  Retired New York Police Detective Michael Valentin is one of those \nwho is living with the health effects of 9/11. He rushed to Ground Zero \nfrom his home on Long Island on 9/11 and for the first few days \nsearched for remains in the area, later working on the pile and \nproviding perimeter security.\n  Before 9/11, he was running miles a day and going to college at night \nto become a supervisor.\n  Since 9/11, he has experienced respiratory problems and breathing \ndifficulties, asthma attacks, operations to treat tumors he has \ndeveloped, and other conditions. He could no longer find the strength \nto attend college at night or run enough to pass even the police \ndepartment's physical test. He retired officially on January 31 of this \nyear.\n  Detective Valentin wanted to attend the hearing in Washington. He \nwanted to speak out and be heard because too many of the victims and \nheroes feel forgotten and left behind. Unfortunately, Detective \nValentin was too sick to make the trip, and he is not alone.\n  The tragedy of 9/11 is not over. The loss of life, the pain, and the \nsuffering are not over. The tragic legacy continues for the families \nwho lost loved ones and for residents, workers, volunteers, first \nresponders and others who\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\nhave faced hardship and health consequences in the aftermath of the \nattacks.\n  Today, we have achieved a great victory--but it must only be a first \nstep to make sure those that gave so much on that terrible day are not \nforgotten and receive the help they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in passing this emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill this afternoon, the Democratic-controlled Senate \nhas sent a message--one that the war is lost, that we have given up, \nand that we have no hope of victory.\n  Today, we have also put an arbitrary deadline on our military. I \nbelieve it is unequivocally wrong to do this, the wrong message at \nexactly the wrong time. I believe we must give our troops the \nopportunity to win. We cannot tie the hands of our commanders on the \nground. We cannot have 535 generals micromanaging the war from the \nHalls of Congress.\n  This war is a test of wills. Our defeatist message states that today \nour will has been broken. This is not the message we want our enemy to \nhear. Our actions in the Senate have consequences. I believe we have \njust sent a message--the wrong message--that our efforts were not \nenough. We have sent a message that the enemy has won. I believe we \nhave sent a message of surrender, a message of submission, a message of \nfailure. And this message was not just sent to those fighting against \nus in Iraq, it reverberates around the globe. Today, I believe the \nSenate has illustrated raw partisan politics at its worst.\n  I believe the American people deserve better. Our troops deserve \nbetter. Our Armed Forces need the support of the people--us--who sent \nthem into a war zone, not partisan politics. They need the time to \nsucceed, not a timetable for retreat.\n  George Orwell once said: The quickest way to end a war is to lose it. \nYes, the quickest way to end the war is to lose it. With today's vote, \nwe are well on our way. Yet fortunately, for our troops, the President \nwill veto this bill, and Congress will have enough votes to sustain it.\n  In the coming weeks, when Congress crafts a new supplemental \nappropriations bill, I believe we must not use the same narrow-minded \napproach. We must not send another message of defeat, of surrender.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5155-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5155-S5156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE PARITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, on April 17, just over a week ago, I \nrose, along with the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate take up and adopt S. 223, which was \nreported unanimously by the Rules Committee on March 28. Senator \nAlexander objected on behalf of a Republican Senator. As a result, the \nbill remains in limbo. To this date, that Republican Senator has \ndeclined to come forward to say why the bill should not become law.\n  This is such a simple, direct bill with respect to transparency. It \nis an idea whose time has long come. It is very hard for us to \nunderstand who could oppose this good government bill and what their \nreason for opposing it could be.\n  After last week's roadblock halted passage, the minority leader's \nspokesman told the Washington Post:\n\n       Senators are now reviewing the bill in anticipation of \n     legislative action.\n\n  We would hope that review is complete. We could now get down to \nbusiness and today, by unanimous consent, just as we did in the Rules \nCommittee, pass this bill, send it to the House, and have it become \nlaw. At our hearing on March 14 and our markup on March 28, it was \nclear there was no public opposition whatsoever to this bill. It is \nreally time for the Senate to act.\n  The bill is titled the ``Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act.'' It \nis sponsored by Senators Feingold and Cochran and 33 additional \nSenators. It would simply require that the Senate campaign finance \nreports be filed electronically rather than in paper format, just as \neveryone else is doing now.\n  Currently, House candidates, Presidential candidates, political \naction committees, and party committees are all required to file \nelectronically. And they do. But Senators, Senate candidates, \nauthorized campaign committees, and the Democratic and Republican \nsenatorial campaign committees are exempt. As a result, we have a \ncumbersome system in which paper copies of disclosure reports are filed \nwith the Senate Office of Public Records, which scans them to make an \nelectronic copy and sends the copy to the FEC on a dedicated \ncommunications line. The FEC then prints the report and sends it to the \nvendor in Fredericksburg, VA, where the information is keyed in by hand \nand then transferred back to the FEC database at a cost of \napproximately $250,000 to the taxpayers. This is $250,000 which is \nneedlessly spent to continue an archaic system. It is long past time to \nbring the Senate into the modern era.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to let this bill go \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor to the author of the bill, the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, once again for being so committed to \ngetting this bill passed. It has been, as she said, over a week since \nwe came to the floor to try to get the Senate to pass the Senate \nCampaign Parity Act.\n  Last Tuesday, the senior Senator from Tennessee objected ``on behalf \nof a Republican Senator.'' Now we have waited to hear from that \nSenator, whoever he or she is, about his or her concerns about the \nbill. So far, not a word. It would not take very long to review this \nbill. It is very simple.\n  In fact, it seems as if the source of the objection is hoping never \nto be identified because a citizen effort to find out who the objector \nis, supported by a number of blogs from both the right and the left, \nhas so far come up empty.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in the press and the blogs about \nwhether the objection we heard last week constitutes one of those so-\ncalled secret holds, which have rightly come under attack in recent \nyears. Well, someone anonymously blocked the bill from being passed \nlast Tuesday, that person has made no effort to resolve his or her \nconcerns with us, and the Republican leadership will not tell us who \nthat person is. Now, that is a ``secret hold,'' in my book. It is time \nfor some sunshine here. If someone has a problem with this bill, he or \nshe should step forward and discuss it with us. I am hopeful that after \na week to take a look at the bill, the objector will have realized how \ncompletely noncontroversial it is and will let it go through this week.\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\n  This bill simply puts Senate campaigns under the same obligations to \nfile their reports electronically that House and Presidential campaigns \nhave been under for years. There is simply no reason the information in \nSenate campaign finance reports should remain less accessible to the \npublic than any other campaign finance report.\n  As the Senator from California said, we now have 37 bipartisan \ncosponsors, and not a single concern about the bill was heard in the \nRules Committee. The bill passed the committee by a voice vote, and no \none has come up to us with any concerns, even in this last week. So the \ntime has come to get this done.\n  I once again thank the Senator from California for her persistence. \nIt is a pleasure to work with her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to thank the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for his leadership and for his continuing interests. \nHopefully, this will pass today.\n  In that vein, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of calendar item No. 96, S. 223, a bill to \nrequire Senate candidates to file designated statements and reports in \nelectronic form, and that the committee-reported amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to, the bill as amended be read three times, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, on behalf of the Republican side, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. We will be back and back and back \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I was precluded from speaking prior to \nthe vote taken on the Iraq supplemental. I am going to speak for about \n15 minutes at this time and voice my strong opposition, as Senator \nShelby, to the conference report that just passed this body. This bill \nis a highly irresponsible bill showing both a disregard for taxpayer \nmoney and our American service people. It is probably the most \ndangerous bill I have seen in over 20 years of service in the Congress \nof the United States.\n  I don't say that lightly. Last month I came to the floor to voice my \nopposition to the emergency supplemental spending bill. I wanted a \nclean bill that the President could sign into law. Instead, today we \npassed a bill that ties troop funding to arbitrary withdrawal deadlines \nand billions and billions of dollars in unrelated spending.\n  Now, 3 weeks later, we find ourselves with essentially the same piece \nof legislation. It is an insult to the men and women who serve in our \narmed services. Funding our troops is not a political game. We are a \nnation at war. There are unexpected costs and needs that must be \ncontinued to promote our freedoms and troops at home and help them \nsucceed in Iraq. That is why we have emergency supplemental \nlegislation. It is used to meet the immediate needs of the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces on our frontlines.\n  The extra spending goes beyond emergency needs and, instead, adds \nadditional nondefense funds that are not necessary right now. There is \na lot of fat in this bill that the Senate should consider under the \nregular appropriations process. That is what appropriations bills are \nall about. The hurricanes of 2005 were truly devastating. I have \nsupported the Government's rebuilding efforts in the region. But the \nbill before us today includes billions of dollars in unrequested and \nunnecessary funding for the Corps of Engineers. These provisions are \ninappropriate for a wartime supplemental.\n  Another area of extra spending relates to agriculture. I have been a \nstrong supporter of America's farmers, but the programs in this bill do \nnot belong in a supplemental wartime bill. I cannot justify $20 million \nfor dairy farmers and $60 million for salmon fisheries in the Pacific \nNorthwest. This bill is about our troops, not our farmers. There are \neven more glaring examples in this conference report: $18 million for \ndrought assistance in the upper Midwest; $25 million for NASA \nfacilities in the gulf region; $10 million for historic preservation \nfunds. This bill doubles the 20 million I opposed for asbestos \nabatement at the Capitol powerplant. The list goes on.\n  I am ashamed that this Congress believes it can solve its own \nbudgetary problems on the backs of our fighting men and women.\n  Finally, instead of helping our troops, this supplemental bill only \nends up offending them. We ought to be sending a clear message of \nsupport for our men and women in harm's way. It should be clear that \nthis Congress and this country will make sure that the men and women of \nour Armed Forces have the necessary supplies and resources to carry out \ntheir missions. Unfortunately, this legislation only serves to \nundermine our military missions. It pulls the rug right out from under \nour troops, just as we are at a point of seeing some signs of increased \nsecurity in Baghdad.\n  To me, this bill is a strategy for defeat. It sends a detrimental \nmessage to our troops and only serves to embolden our enemies. It tells \nthe terrorists: Mark your calendars with our date for withdrawal from \nIraq; sit and wait for us to get out.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I had the opportunity to hear firsthand \nfrom my good friend, David Petraeus, yesterday about the current \nsituation in Iraq. I am sorry it was a very highly classified briefing \nor I would share those things with the Senate. But I want to give the \nmood of his report. He was very frank in his report. The situation in \nIraq is not any closer to being resolved than it was 2 months ago when \nhis mission started. The country still suffers from violent sectarian \nstrife and is at war with a cluster of enemies, including primarily al-\nQaida, Osama bin Laden, Sunni insurgents, and Shia radicals. The other \nside of the aisle has already said the war is lost. But we haven't even \ngiven the President's plan a chance to work. We still have a long way \nto go in Iraq, but sectarian killings have dropped dramatically since \nJanuary. There is greater cooperation between the U.S. forces and the \nIraqi Army, and we are beginning to see the Iraqi people work toward \ncomplete sovereignty.\n  We should not dictate arbitrary guidelines for the future. The Iraqi \nGovernment is still in a critical development stage. It must be given \nthe time and room to grow with our guidance. The same Senators and \nCongressmen calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq or setting an \narbitrary withdrawal date do not discuss the ramifications of such an \naction. It may be because they know that immediate withdrawal from Iraq \nwould be disastrous to the Middle East and threaten international \nstability and our national defense. Withdrawal is not a viable option. \nIf we leave Iraq prematurely, we lose. Peace-loving people in Iraq \nlose, and Islamic radicals and al-Qaida win. That is the situation we \nare in today. We need to be honest about it as we proceed forward.\n  I have voted against past withdrawal language and voted against it \nagain today. Setting a withdrawal deadline will have grave consequences \nfor the United States. It will put our national security at risk. After \nthe President vetoes this bill--and we sustain his veto--we need to \nrefocus our attention and our productive manner on how to best help our \ncommanders on the ground to achieve success in Iraq. No arbitrary \ntimetable, no billions of dollars in unrelated pork--we need a clean \nbill that funds our men and women in uniform and gives them a chance \nfor success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5156-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5156-S5157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HEROIC NEW YORK STATE TROOPERS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak on a very sad occasion \nthat occurred in my State in the last 2 days and to recognize the three \nheroic New York State troopers shot in an act of cold-blooded violence. \nSadly, one trooper, David C. Brinkerhoff, a member of the specially \ntrained mobile response team, has been killed. Tonight my thoughts and \nprayers are with his family, friends, and coworkers.\n  Trooper Brinkerhoff and Trooper Richard Mattson were shot at about\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\n8:45 a.m. Tuesday while searching for a gunman who was suspected of \nshooting a third trooper, Trooper Matthew Gambosi, during a traffic \nstop in nearby Margaretville, NY, a beautiful town in Delaware County. \nTrooper Mattson is in serious condition at a local hospital and, praise \nGod, Trooper Gambosi only suffered minor wounds as the bullet was \ncaught by his bulletproof vest. We pray for their speedy recoveries.\n  Law enforcement raided the farm where the gunman was holed up \nyesterday, and his body was recovered late last night. Now that this \nman is no longer a threat, we must turn our attention to the troopers' \nfamilies and friends who have been devastated by these tragic events.\n  New York State troopers represent the best of all of us. They are \nbrave, selfless heroes who put their lives on the line every day with \nunequaled character and dignity. They are tough, and they are just. The \nevents of the past 48 hours have devastated our entire State. Now we \nwill mourn together. The entire trooper community and the people of the \ngreat State of New York have suffered an enormous loss. The greatest \nway we can honor them is to remember their sacrifice always and to \npledge to rise above this tragedy by continuing to do exactly what they \ndid when they got into harm's way on our behalf. Of course, I speak of \nimpartial, courageous, and professional law enforcement.\n  Trooper Brinkerhoff was born and raised in the Southtowns area of \nwestern New York and was only 29. He was an 8\\1/2\\-year State police \nveteran and joined the mobile response team in early 2006. He is \nsurvived by his wife Barbara and a 7-month-old daughter. Brinkerhoff is \nthe second member of the New York State mobile response unit to be \nkilled in less than a year. Trooper Joseph Longobardo was killed by \nserial killer Ralph ``Bucky'' Phillips in the woods of Chautauqua \nCounty in the western end of our State. Far too often our troopers and \nlaw enforcement officers are struck down by senseless violence. \nHowever, every time their mettle is tested, they return stronger and \nmore determined to keep New York safe.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate will approve later today a \nresolution commemorating the sacrifice of the men and women of law \nenforcement who have lost their lives on the job. They are all true \nheroes. We honor each and every one of them.\n  My thoughts and those of my family are with Barbara and her daughter \ntonight, and I send them the full condolences of the Senate and the \npeople of the State of New York. We will not forget you or the \nsacrifice of Trooper Brinkerhoff.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5157-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5157-S5160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I want to take some time, as we \ncontemplate what is going to happen with the supplemental bill we just \npassed because, frankly, I am in a state of shock over the casual \ndismissal of the opinions of the American people, in huge majorities, \nwho say: We have had enough of this war, and we want to make a change. \nThey want us to start to position ourselves in a manner that would \nallow us to bring our people home.\n  Not far from this Senate floor, in the middle of the National Mall, \nis a place of stone and water, of strength and reflection. It is a \nplace that is important to me and, I think, important to the country as \na whole. It is where we honor those who served and those who died in \nWorld War II.\n  I proudly wore the uniform of my country during that war. I do not \nconsider myself a hero, but I did my duty to the best of my ability. I \nand 16 million others went to war because our mission was clear: defeat \nthe enemy who attacked us. And while the battles were fought across the \nocean, the entire country united. They all sacrificed. That was the \nmessage: sacrifice, sacrifice at home, use less gas, turn off the \nlights, reduce energy consumption, black out the beachfront places or \ncoastal areas so the enemy could not see the lights of the cities. Even \nwith rising injuries and casualties in World War II, America kept its \nresolve because we believed in our leaders.\n  How times have changed.\n  There is one simple reason the American people have lost faith in \nthis war effort: It has become clear our leaders are not providing us \nwith the truth. And the chief purveyor of misstatements is Vice \nPresident Cheney. He chooses to say whatever he wants to, to advance \nhis agenda. But the agenda has now, we know, resulted in the deaths of \nthousands of Americans, thousands of Iraqis. It is time to say: Enough \nis enough.\n  I want to review some of the outlandish statements the Vice President \nhas made about this war. On the eve of the invasion, in March 2003, \nVice President Dick Cheney assured the Nation that ``we will be greeted \nas liberators.''\n  I ask the question: How dare he make a statement such as that--\nwithout knowledge, without any idea of what the consequences of that \naction might be. We will be greeted as liberators?\n  He went on to say the fight would be ``weeks rather than months.''\n  In June of 2005, Vice President Cheney assured us the insurgency in \nIraq is ``in the last throes.'' That was almost 2 years ago. Ask our \npeople in uniform, ask our people in combat, ask those who are facing \nanother deployment after having been there once or even twice--ask them \nwhat they think about that statement, about the accuracy of those \nremarks.\n  Earlier this year, even after the Pentagon admitted there was no \nevidence at all of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida, \nthe Vice President said there was a connection. If you say it, maybe \nyou can convince people, even if it is not the truth.\n  And now, this week, we have our Vice President speaking out against \nthis bill we just passed, again making outlandish claims.\n  You have to ask yourself a question: Who is still listening to those \ncomments and giving them any credibility? Unfortunately, there are \npeople, despite his outrageous and unsubstantiated claims--claims such \nas the ``insurgency is in its last throes''--who tend to believe him. \nHe is, after all, the Vice President of the United States. It is a \nprestigious job. There is an automatic assumption that credibility goes \nto the occupant of that position.\n  We may never know the real motivation behind this administration's \ndrive to Iraq, but we do know the following: They presented false \nintelligence to the American people and our allies.\n  We have seen some of those responsible, credible people, who believed \nin the case that was being made by the intelligence reports--look at \none of the great figures in American contemporary history, Colin \nPowell--a general, Chief of Staff. I remember his speech at the United \nNations providing evidence of materials that confirmed there were \nweapons of mass destruction there. And now this man, who has a lifetime \nbuilt on honesty and credibility, has said he regrets those statements. \nBut we do not hear that pause, that reflection, coming from the \nPresident or the Vice President of the United States.\n  The administration knowingly misled the country about Iraq's nuclear \nambitions in President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address.\n  In a recent CBS News poll, 66 percent of the American people \ndisapproved of the way President Bush is handling this situation with \nIraq. That disapproval has continued to build. If you look at some of \nthe polling data we have seen over the last couple years, less and less \nof the people in the country believe we are doing a good job with the \nsituation in Iraq, as portrayed by the President.\n  On Monday, President Bush said:\n\n       There's been some progress.\n\n  That statement shows the President is living in an alternate reality.\n  On that same day--Monday--10 American troops were killed, 9 of them \nin a single attack. Since the beginning of this war, more than 3,300 of \nour people in uniform have died.\n\n  One of those people was a fellow from Toms River, NJ, Marine Cpl \nThomas Saba. He served with the Marines' Flying Tigers. He volunteered \nto extend\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nhis tour of duty after his squadron was deployed to Iraq. He died with \nhis comrades in February when their helicopter was shot down by \ninsurgents. Corporal Saba is one of 77 people from my home State of New \nJersey to see their last sunset in Iraq. Ten more have died in \nAfghanistan.\n  Beyond these casualties, nearly 25,000 of our troops have left the \ncombat theater with serious wounds. More than 800 of them have lost at \nleast one limb. We have spent mountains of taxpayer money in Iraq. We \nhave spent $400 billion, going now at the rate of $3 billion a week. \nWhat have we gotten for our investment? A disaster. That is the reality \nof Iraq, not the endless and empty picture of optimism the Vice \nPresident and others in the administration and the President continue \nto paint. ``Extend our victories.'' What victories are they talking \nabout? I don't see any victories. We see more threats. Not only to our \npeople--that is the most serious one--not only to our reputation, but \nto our leadership in the world as it disintegrates in front of us as \nthis conflict continues.\n  We need a new course, and we need it now. This supplemental provides \nthat new course. We hope the President will reflect a little bit, \ninstead of the braggadocio attitude and false stories about how \nDemocrats want to surrender. That is the most offensive thing. \nDemocrats want to surrender? Senator Inouye, a Medal of Honor winner \nhere, and other people who fought in Vietnam and other places. We want \nto surrender America? It is an outrage.\n  Outside my office, we have a memorial and it shows the ``Faces of the \nFallen''--photographs. Some of them are blank, but they have a name and \na location of the person--the faces of the fallen from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Typically it carries each picture, and we have about 3,000 \nof them. It takes a while to get the pictures together. People walk by, \nthey stop and pause and write notes in a journal we have there. It \nincludes the name and age, the rank and the battalion or company they \nserved in, the cause of death of each of the Nation's fallen \nservicemembers, inscribed with their photo on the memorial. Families, \nfriends, and visitors search those photos on a daily basis looking for \npeople from their State, from their area, people who many knew and \nloved and miss. One woman found a picture of her son up there and wrote \nan inscription in our journal.\n  As they search these pictures, some write notes in a book of \nreflections. I want to share two of those reflections. A person named \nPrudence Hart from New Jersey wrote:\n\n       We honor our soldiers for answering the call of their \n     Nation. We must honor them and this Nation by never allowing \n     another President to wage war as this one has.\n\n  Another person, Jay Miller from Rhode Island, wrote:\n\n       We are at a pivotal point in our country's history. Our \n     leaders must take a stand and use their constitutional powers \n     to end this madness.\n\n  To Prudence Hart, Jay Miller, and every American, I say: We are with \nyou. We do honor those who have bravely taken up their task, able and \nwilling to do it. Some of those troops are the third deployment away \nfrom a spouse, children, community, job. They are the ones making the \nsacrifice, and they are the ones whom we want to honor. We want to \nhonor them by remembering those who paid the ultimate price, but we \nwant to honor them further by bringing them home and giving them \nappropriate post-service treatment.\n  I wish we were treating our veterans in the same honorable manner in \nwhich they were recruited. We have failed in many instances. We failed, \neven as people criticize Democrats and those who disagree with them, \neven as they try to discredit us as wanting to surrender, when they \ndidn't provide the right equipment, whether the humvees were \nsufficiently armored, or whether they had the proper flak jackets.\n  I went to Iraq some years ago, and when I asked the people I met from \nNew Jersey: What is it we could do to make their job better and protect \nthem more, one of them said, Senator--and I was with four other \ncolleagues--Senators, the flak jackets you are wearing, the body armor \nyou are wearing is the latest and the best. We don't have it. People \nwho were in the coalition have that, but we don't. What else? They \nsaid: Our humvees are not sufficiently armored to protect us. We know \nwhat has happened.\n  So if we want to talk about honoring our troops, where was the \nadministration while Halliburton was stealing from the country with \nfood and shelter and had a fine of millions of dollars imposed by the \nauditors from the Defense Department? Shame on them. In the war I \nfought in, there wasn't anybody except a traitor who would do something \nthat might help the enemy like having a sham corporation in the Cayman \nIslands, a branch in Dubai where they then did business with Iran--\nIran, which supplies weapons and encouragement to insurgents who want \nto kill our people there. It is shocking that we see that, and when we \nhear these false tales coming from the Vice President of the United \nStates, when he talks about victory, and I am paraphrasing: victory \nwithin our grasp, within our reach. The American people don't believe \nit, and I tell my colleagues I don't believe it, and a lot of my \ncolleagues don't believe it.\n  We had a vote one day that was significant. It was 56 to 44, and it \nincluded seven of our colleagues from the Republican side, people who \nhad the courage to stand up and say: Look, we are not ashamed to be \nRepublicans, and we are not ashamed to be Democrats, but we think this \npolicy is wrong. We had enough votes--not to get cloture, but to \nestablish a significant majority. I know some of our colleagues over \nthere who are loyal to the party and to the President who don't like a \nbit what he is asking of the American people now, and asking of us, \nlabeling this bill as a porkbarrel thing.\n\n  I can't get the word ``surrender'' out of my mind.\n  I sit on the Appropriations Committee, and I was at a conference \ncommittee of the House and the Senate the other night, and the ranking \nRepublican on the House side said the Democrats want to surrender just \nwhen General Petraeus is coming in--surrender. This bill is our stand, \nthe American stand. It begins to set a timetable for us to come home--\nnot to run away from our responsibilities. Our responsibility has been \nmore than met. But we are even willing to leave enough of a cadre there \nto say: OK, we will help the Iraqis learn to defend themselves. We will \nhelp the Iraqis to reconstruct their society. We will help even to do \nsome counterterrorism and counterinsurgencies.\n  It is time to come home. It is time to come home, and I hope the \nPresident of the United States will follow the demands of the American \npeople and a major number of people who oppose where we are, a huge \nmajority.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I was in Iraq this weekend, and I was \nthere in December, right before Christmas, with my friend, Senator \nNelson of Florida. Our meetings at that time took place in the shadows \nof the 2006 Congressional elections and in the wake of the much \nanticipated Iraq Study Group report. During each of our visits at that \ntime, the atmosphere exuded a feeling of transition, a desire to get \nout of the constant struggle of lateral movement to a feeling of \nlonging for a new strategy, long overdue in Iraq. On January 10, we \nlearned the details of that new strategy. It wasn't exactly what many \nof us expected and it raised some particular concerns for me. Two weeks \nearlier when I was in Iraq, I met with the National Security Adviser \nfor the Prime Minister of Iraq, Dr. al-Rubaie, and he told Senator \nNelson and me he didn't think sectarian violence was the biggest \nproblem in Iraq. To express that kind of denial was incredulous. \nSenator Nelson and I kind of looked at each other. His comments \nreflected to me at that time that I didn't think the Iraqi Government \nhad the commitment to reconciliation needed to warrant an increase in \nU.S. forces in Baghdad and in an area wracked by sectarian civil war.\n  So at the time I stated the idea of sending an additional force of \n20,000 troops into Baghdad, into the lion's den of sectarian violence \nwithout any additional commitment from the Iraqi Government was \nsomething I did not feel I could support. Because of the duty we share \nas Members of this deliberative body, I put myself on record expressing \nmy views. I wasn't popular with a lot of my constituents. I joined\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nthe senior Senator from Virginia, a colleague whom I respect so deeply \non military matters, the former chairman of the Armed Services \ncommittee, and I cosponsored his resolution expressing the concern over \nthe proposed surge in Baghdad.\n  A slightly modified version of his resolution came before the full \nSenate on February 5, a little over 2 months ago. Although my \ncolleagues in the majority at that time sought to limit our opportunity \nto amend this legislation through procedural maneuvering, I believed I \nhad a duty to follow my conscience and I supported the procedural \nmotion to move forward on that resolution. I joined many of my \ncolleagues, mostly on the other side of the aisle, in voting for \ncloture on this resolution on February 5.\n  Here we are, 2 short months later, and how the debate has changed. I \nwill talk a little bit about what I have seen in Iraq but how the \ndebate has changed. I thought I would take a brief moment to remind \nsome of my colleagues across the aisle what they went on record as \nsupporting on February 5. On February 5, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle said: We respect what S. 470 said, we respect the \nconstitutional authorities given to the President, that the President \nshall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. \nHere we are 2 months later making an attempt to limit his \nconstitutional authority to exercise his fundamental constitutional \nduties.\n  On February 5, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said the \nresolution they supported should not be interpreted as precipitating \nany immediate reduction in, or withdrawal of, the present level of \nforces.\n  Here we are, 2 short months later, picking an arbitrary withdrawal \ndate without the consent of our commanders on the ground and advocating \na pullout.\n  On February 5, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stated \ntheir belief that ``the U.S. should continue vigorous operations in \nAnbar province.'' And here we are 2 short months later and we are \ntrying to pull our forces out and leave the Sunnis in Anbar alone to \ndeal with the terror of al-Qaida.\n  On February 5, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stated \ntheir belief that ``a failed state in Iraq would present a threat to \nregional and world peace.'' I don't know that many who have studied \nthis issue would disagree with that notion. And here we are 2 short \nmonths later essentially working to ensure that this frightening \nprospect materializes.\n  On February 5, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle commended \nour troops in the field, agreeing that they have served our country \n``with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the finest \ntraditions of the U.S. Armed Forces.'' But here we are today, \nreflecting on comments that they have ``lost'' the war in Iraq.\n  Most importantly, on February 5, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle stated their belief that the U.S. ``should not take any \naction that will endanger U.S. military forces in the field, including \nthe elimination or reduction of funds for our troops.'' Here we are 2 \nmonths later, conditioning that funding on withdrawal timelines to \nhandcuff our military leaders, delaying the delivery of resources our \nforces need.\n  One of the things I heard in Anbar Province from a Marine general was \nthat they needed these V-shaped humvee vehicles to protect against \nIEDs. Regular humvees are flat and they take the full force of a blast. \nWith the use of these V-shaped humvee bottoms, we have not had many \ncasualties. This bill the President will veto has about 8,000 of those \nV-shaped vehicles that we need.\n  I supported that resolution in February, but I did not support the \nbill before us today. It is unfortunate that the majority in this body \nhas decided to utilize this important piece of legislation to attempt \nto set us on a course for failure in Iraq. When I say that, it is true \nthis bill contains a lot of important things for our military, our \nveterans. But it is unconscionable that our veterans would be used as \npawns in a political game, where the majority seeks to ensure failure \nin Iraq at all costs. That is what happens when you say it is lost, \nwhen you tell the enemy this is when we are withdrawing. I think our \nsoldiers and our families deserve better.\n  My recent trip to Iraq underscored the fact that while we face \nformidable challenges, there are also glimmers of hope. General \nPetraeus said that to me in Baghdad on Saturday. He showed me the \ncharts of the declines in the death squads and sectarian violence in \nBaghdad. He talks about the sheiks in Anbar Province coming over and \nfighting shoulder to shoulder with us against al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  When I visited Iraq this weekend, I traveled to Taqaddum in Anbar \nProvince, between Fallujah and Ramadi, and Talil, in south central \nIraq. I also spent time in Baghdad. We have some Minnesota National \nGuard in Talil and Taqaddum. We have a long way to go. It is certainly \ntoo early to tell whether our new strategy, including the surge in \ntroops, is succeeding at the level set out by the President. Even \nGeneral Petraeus has said that. Certainly our headlines here at home \nstill echo the horrific suicide bombs and insurgent attacks we have \nsadly grown to expect when we read the morning paper. This is an enemy \nwith resolve. It understands the impact of those actions on the \nAmerican people.\n  General Petraeus told me and others in this body that he will come \nback to us in September--his troops are not all deployed at this point \nin time--and he can show the progress and the decline in the killings \nand sectarian violence. He talked about the elimination of some of the \nkilling cells and some of their leadership. He will come back in \nSeptember with the Ambassador, whom I also had dinner with that night, \nto discuss the situation. They will tell us whether they have succeeded \nin providing the stability in Baghdad that will allow the process of \nreconciliation to move forward more aggressively. He used the phrase \nmany times that ``the clock in Washington ticks much faster than in \nIraq.'' We know that. He did say military action cannot win this war. \nBut my colleagues on the other side, when they quote that, don't quote \nthe other half of the sentence. He said it is 20 percent military \naction, but you cannot do the other 80 percent unless you are \nsuccessful in the military action. He is clear about that. I believe \nGeneral Petraeus and the troops he commands deserve to be given the \ntime they need before we arbitrarily decide the war is lost.\n  I continue to have my doubts about the Iraqi leadership. I met with \nthe Prime Minister of Iraq, and he told me he was annoyed by a \nstatement by the Secretary of Defense regarding the need to bring \nSunnis more into their Government. His comment was that the Shia is a \nmajority and it would undermine the democracy, tell the majority what \nthey have to do. I said: Respectfully, I serve in the Senate. In the \nSenate, we protect in this country against one of the enemies of \ndemocracy, which is the tyranny of the majority. That is what has to go \ninto the reconciliation in Iraq. I don't believe, as I listened to him, \nthat he has the kind of commitment yet we need to make reconciliation \nsuccessful. So that is of concern.\n  For us in this body, it is hard to think that giving a voice to the \nminority would constitute undermining democracy. We know the perils of \na tyranny of the majority, which Alexis de Tocqueville defined in 1835, \nand that Madison and Hamilton alluded to in the Federalist Papers. The \nfact we are still trying to persuade the Prime Minister that he has to \ndo a better job of reaching out to his own countrymen makes it hard for \nme to be optimistic.\n  Despite these challenges, the atmosphere in my meetings last weekend \nwas so different than what I saw in December. The brave American \ncivilians who are executing the diplomatic components of our strategy \nhave a new sense of mission. I met with State Department folks--two of \nthem--at breakfast Saturday morning. They are part of the new PRT. They \nare about to go Anbar Province, and they are reading in the paper that \nthe war is ``lost'' and they are going out into Anbar Province to work \non the reconstruction of Anbar and Fallujah. They are just about to \nbegin their mission with a sense of hope, and shame on us if we dash it \nhere. Some of the Iraqi leaders I was with reacted strongly in an \nopposite direction from the Prime Minister and clearly understood our \ncommitment is not open-ended. Certainly, the courageous men and women \nin the field told\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\nme to relay to my colleagues this war is not lost. Let me be very \nclear. I sat in meetings with members of the Minnesota National Guard--\nby the way, I am unhappy about their tours of duty being extended. They \nand their families heard in the press that they were being extended. I \ncomplained about that to the Army and received an apology. In spite of \nthat, they stood up and said to me: Use our names. Tell the Senate the \nwar is not lost.\n  MAJ Brian Melton, from Moorhead, MN, said: Tell the Senate the war is \nnot lost. Lieutenant Martin of the \n1/34th Support Battalion in Talil, Iraq, wants the Senate to know the \nwar is not lost. These soldiers talked about at one point it being kind \nof the Wild West in Anbar Province and it is being transformed.\n  I wish my colleagues would have heard the story from LTC Gregg Parks \nof Walker, MN. He told me about a suicide bomber who came into a town \ncalled Habbaniyah, and he veered into a crowd coming out of a mosque, \nblew himself up, and wounded or killed many Iraqis. Not a single \nAmerican shed blood in that attack; yet our soldiers lined up to give \nblood. The next day, the mayor and local sheiks came in and gave the \nnames of al-Qaida operatives and pledged to work side by side with our \ntroops to drive al-Qaida out of Iraq. I wish my colleagues could have \nheard COL David Elicerio, commander of the 1/34 Brigade Combat Team of \nthe Minnesota National Guard. He told me about the ``adopt a highway'' \nprogram his men and women have implemented with the local Iraqis. He \nsaid the local sheiks came in and identified where there were two IEDs.\n  There are many challenges that lie ahead, probably too many to name \nhere. I don't see the situation in Iraq through rose-colored glasses \nand I am not trying to paint an unrealistic picture. The violence we \nhave see over the past weeks in places like Baqubah reminds us all too \nwell of the struggles we face.\n  I know the American public has run out of patience on this war. I \ndon't know what the next round of letters to the editor will look like, \nor the attack ads on moveon.org for the vote I cast; but I am committed \nto stemming the flow of terrorism, not handing al-Qaida a victory they \nwill be able to use to strengthen their forces and hurt and kill more \nAmericans.\n  This bill we passed, with the timeline for surrender, doesn't make \nAmerica safer. I am not for an open-ended commitment or a blank check, \nbut as General Petraeus has said, you have to have a plan B. If the \nIraqis don't do what they need to do for reconciliation, we are going \nto figure out a way to get Americans out of the crosshairs of that \ncivil war. Some say we will be in Kuwait or some other area. General \nPetraeus told me he has to refuel his helicopters three times to get \nback into Baghdad, and if there is a ``Rwanda'' in Baghdad, we are not \ngoing to be able to do anything about it. We will redeploy our troops \nif this surge doesn't work, put them outside the center area.\n  In the end, they may have to look at a plan B. But that decision will \ncome soon. General Petraeus said: Let me come back in September. \nPerhaps that is not soon enough for the American public, but the \ndecision we made today, the statement that the war is ``lost,'' the \ndecision to set into place a timetable for surrender, doesn't help us \nprovide an opportunity for reconciliation to occur in Iraq, or for \nthere to be greater stability in the region, and it will let al-Qaida \nhave a victory. A timetable for surrender hurts our warriors on the \nfront line. It is a path I could not follow, one America shall not \nfollow. Let us come back with a different supplemental and let us give \nour warriors the money they need to fight the war that has to be \nfought. Let us do that quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment \ntoday in loving memory and honor of Sgt. Joseph M. Tackett of \nWhitehouse, KY. Sergeant Tackett was tragically killed on June 23, \n2005, in Baghdad while serving his country in the U.S. Army. He was 22 \nyears old, and the recipient of numerous awards including the Bronze \nStar.\n  Not long after Sergeant Tackett's death, his body returned home to \nJohnson County, KY, and family, neighbors and friends came to pay their \nrespects at his flag-draped casket in the Johnson County Middle School \ngymnasium. Even the kindergarten students at his old elementary school \nto whom he wrote letters remembered him that day as a friend and a \nhero.\n  Joe ``was just very excited and enthusiastic about protecting a \ncountry he loved,'' says Nellie Bowen, Joe's third-grade teacher. ``He \nhad a pride in our country that we sometimes miss.''\n  It was Ms. Bowen's class of kindergartners that Sergeant Tackett \nwrote to, becoming their overseas pen pal even while serving in Iraq. \nHe replied to every letter they sent him, and even came to the school \nto speak to the children after his first tour of duty.\n  Mr. President, when you know this about Sergeant Tackett, you can see \nwhy so many in Johnson County turned out to support the Tackett family \nafter the loss of their brother and son.\n  That Sergeant Tackett excelled in the Army is no surprise. He \nembraced his duty to serve with the same vigor and passion he displayed \nfor so many activities in his short but full life.\n  ``He looked at everything with enthusiasm,'' Joe's mother, Kathy \nTackett, tells us. ``He was so looking forward to the future, [and] he \nwas always planning for the future.''\n  As a child, Joe turned this infectious enthusiasm to many activities, \nincluding music. He was the singer for a Christian band and also a \nbudding entrepreneur.\n  High-profile musicians didn't often include Whitehouse on their \ntours. But Joe filled the gap by producing rock concerts locally, \nshowcasing local bands.\n  His love for music persisted to his time in Iraq. While there, he \nbefriended Iraqi college students and introduced them to American rock \nmusic. Joe made friends so easily this way, he even exchanged emails \nwith Iraqis while back home in Kentucky between tours.\n  Joe graduated from Johnson Central High School in 2000 and even then \nheld dreams of one day becoming a soldier. He attended Big Sandy \nCommunity and Technical College, and then the terrorist attacks of 9/11 \nhappened. Joe enlisted a month later.\n  He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 76th Field Artillery, 4th \nBrigade Combat Team of the Third Infantry Division based at Fort \nStewart, GA. He saw the Army as a way to learn new things and gain new \nexperiences, and he devoured each new experience with excitement.\n  Sent to Iraq and Afghanistan for his first tour of duty, Joe learned \nnew skills and new proficiencies. He took online classes while serving \nin Iraq to get his college degree. He took any training that became \navailable and was always open to opportunities for self-improvement.\n  ``Joe wanted to travel . . . he was curious about other countries, \nother lands,'' Kathy Tackett says. Joe called his mother once from the \nMiddle East telling her he was standing in a mosque. ``There's not many \npeople who have ever done this, Mom,'' she remembers him saying with \npride.\n  Sergeant Tackett was deployed a second time in January 2005. His \nassignment was to escort visiting dignitaries through the heavily \nfortified Green Zone in Baghdad. Even while undertaking this important \nmission, he still found time to write e-mails to his family back home. \n``He was interested in so many things,'' Kathy Tackett recalls. ``I \ncan't imagine the person that he would have become, if he would've had \nmore years.''\n  Sergeant Tackett's families may never know the answer to that \nquestion. But I think we know Joe would have tackled anything he did \nwith energy and with enthusiasm, as he did throughout his life.\n  Sergeant Tackett leaves behind a loving family. He is loved and \nremembered by his mother, Kathy, his father, Wendell, his brother, Sam, \nhis sister, Michelle Spencer, his nieces Hailey Tackett and Shawna \nSpencer, and other beloved family members.\n  Mr. President, no words we can say today will ease the pain of the \nTackett\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nfamily. I know they are still searching for answers. But I hope the \nreverence and respect this Senate shows Sergeant Tackett will remind \nthem that he lived and served as a hero, and his country will forever \nhonor and remember his sacrifice.\n  I ask my colleagues to keep the family of SGT Joseph M. Tackett in \ntheir thoughts and prayers. I know they will be in mine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5161-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5161-S5164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      1st Lieutenant Shaun M. Blue\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude that I honor the life of a brave young man from Munster. \nShaun Blue, 25 years old, died on April 16 while deployed in Al Anbar \nProvince on Operation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, \nShaun risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to \nour hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Shaun was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating among the top 10 students of \nhis class from Munster High School in 2000. He joined the military \nbecause, as his high school principal said, ``He was one of those kids \nwho did things everyone else was afraid to do.'' His valor over the \ncourse of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. \nHis track and field coach at Munster High described Shaun as a mentally \ntough kid saying, ``The fact that he chose the career path that he did \ndidn't surprise me. It was perfectly suited for him.''\n  Shaun was killed by an improvised explosive device while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was a member of the 2nd \nBattalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine \nExpeditionary Force, based in Twenty-nine Palms, CA.\n  Today, I join Shaun's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Shaun, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Shaun was known for his dedication to his community and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Shaun will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shaun's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here. This \n     statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years \n     ago, as I am certain that the impact of Shaun's actions will \n     live on far longer that any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shaun M. Blue in the official \nRecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nShaun's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Shaun.\n\n\n                 Private First Class David Neil Simmons\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude \nthat I honor the life of a brave young man from Kokomo. Neil Simmons, \n20 years old, was killed on April 8th while deployed in Baghdad, when \nhis convoy encountered an improvised explosive device and insurgent \nfire. He had been in Iraq for less than 2 weeks. With his entire life \nbefore him, Neil risked everything to fight for the values Americans \nhold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Neil attended Kokomo's Northwestern High School and followed the \nexample set by his father and uncle by enlisting in the Army a few \nmonths before graduating in 2005. He enjoyed the structure of the \nmilitary and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and country. \nHis father described Neil as ``an avid outdoorsman who was happy and \nalways had plenty of friends.''\n  Neil was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, in Fort Benning, GA. Neil's father \nreflected on his son's death, asking, ``What's the odds of, among \n160,000 troops your only child is there 1 week and gets killed?'' \nPrivate First Class Simmons leaves behind his father, David, and uncle, \nJim Simmons.\n  Today, I join Neil's family and friends in mourning his death.

Beadles\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude \nthat I honor the life of a brave young man from La Porte. Jason \nBeadles, 22 years old, died on April 11th while deployed in Baghdad on \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Jason risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Jason has been a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from La Porte High \nSchool in 2003. He had been interested in technical engineering \nthroughout high school, earning his welding certificate from A.K. Smith \nCareer Center before graduating. Army Specialist Beadles enlisted in \nthe Army as an engineer after the attacks of 9/11. His valor over the \ncourse of his service in Iraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage. \nHe decided to enlist because as his welding instructor put it, ``he was \nalways concerned about other people.'' Jason enjoyed the military, and \nhe believed that throughout all the hardships they faced he and his \ncompany were helping the Iraqi people.\n  Jason died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He \nwas a member of the 887th Engineer Company, 326th Engineer Battalion, \n101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), in Fort Campbell, KY.\n  Today, I join Jason's family and friends in mourning his death.

Langenbrunner\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude \nthat I honor the life of a brave young man from Fort Wayne. Richard \nLangenbrunner, 19 years old, was killed on April 17 while deployed in \nRustamiyah, Iraq. With his entire life before him, Richard risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Richard was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Northrop High School \nin 2006. He completed basic training this past January and was deployed \njust a few weeks later. He is remembered for his love of people, life, \nand adventure. ``He was so happy and excited about his future before he \ngraduated,'' said a former classmate. ``He joined the military because \nhe wanted to drive a tanker.'' Richard enlisted in the Army just before \ngraduating high school. His valor over the course of his service in \nIraq exemplifies Hoosier values and courage.\n  Richard died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He \nwas a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade, \n3rd Infantry Division, stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia.\n  Today, I join Richard's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace.

King\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude \nthat I honor the life of a brave young man from Gas City. Bradley King, \n28 years old, was killed on April 2 while deployed in Al Amiriyah, \nIraq, when a roadside bomb exploded near his Humvee. With his entire \nlife before him, Bradley risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Bradley attended Mississinewa High School, enlisting in the National \nGuard in 1997, a year before his graduation in 1998. Bradley enjoyed \nthe military and felt a sense of duty to serve his community and \ncountry. The day before he was deployed, Bradley told his mother that \nhe felt ``called to serve in the military for his country.'' His aunt \ndescribed Bradley as ``a responsible young man determined to do his \nbest for the people he loved.''\n  Bradley was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was a member of the 2nd Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, \n76th Infantry Brigade, Marion, IN. Master Sergeant Bill Wallen, King's \nsupervisor, told local media, ``he was a heck of a human being, he's \nwhat everybody else needs to be in this world.'' Staff Sergeant King \nleaves behind his wife Adrian and 15-month-old son, Daethan.\n  Today, I join Bradley's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace.

Putman\n\n  Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude \nthat I honor the life of a brave young man from Lafayette. Cody Putman, \n22 years old, was killed on April 11th while deployed in Baghdad on \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. With his entire life before him, Cody risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Cody was a lifelong Hoosier, graduating from Twin Lakes High School \nin 2003. He is remembered for his love of\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\npeople, life, and adventure. ``He was someone who was always looking to \nhave a good time with others,'' said a former teacher. ``He joined the \nmilitary because of the teamwork.'' Cody enlisted in the Army after \nhigh school, and his valor over the course of his service in Iraq \nexemplifies Hoosier values and courage. A month before he died, Cody \nhad been home on leave for 2 weeks vacationing with his family in \nFlorida. Cody is survived by his father, Harry Putman, and his mother, \nPam Mow. He also leaves behind his wife, Molly Putnam, 20, and 3-year-\nold daughter Madelyn.\n  Cody died while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He \nwas a member of the 1st Squadron, 40th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade \nCombat Team, 25th Infantry Division, based in Fort Richardson, AK.\n  Today, I join Cody's family and friends in mourning his death.

Sieger\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to SPC Eric R. \nSieger of Layton, UT, who died of injuries suffered while conducting \noperations in Iraq. He was a remarkable young man who overcame much \nadversity in his life. On March 9 of this year, he would have turned 19 \nyears old.\n  Part of the 1st Cavalry Division, Specialist Sieger was also a member \nof a very special family. I understand that his parents, Wolfgang and \nKrista, have 15 children, 6 of whom were adopted, including the \nSpecialist. Early life was not easy for the Specialist but that all \nchanged when he was adopted at the age of 11 by the loving Sieger \nfamily.\n  I have been informed that Specialist Sieger enjoyed running, being \nwith his friends, building and fixing things. He had a girlfriend whom \nhe met while stationed at Fort Hood, TX. Shortly before his passing, \nSpecialist Sieger was able speak to his mother on the phone. His mother \nsaid, ``They spent most of the time laughing and joking with each \nother.''\n  Specialist Sieger's father said, ``He was dutiful in wanting to do \nwhat is right.''\n  Undoubtedly, this led him to become a member of the Civil Air Patrol \nas a teenager and enlist in the Army at 17. Military service is a \ncalling for other members of the Sieger family, as well. Currently, one \nof his sisters is also deployed to Iraq, another sister is preparing to \ndeploy, and a brother is a member of the Air National Guard.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by quoting the words of \nSpecialist Sieger's mother and father. Krista Sieger stated, ``He felt \nsince he was in the Army, since he took the oath, he has to do \neverything he was asked to do. And he did.'' Wolfgang Sieger said, ``I \nwould call him a hero. He is definitely a hero in my sight. I honor him \nas a hero.''\n  I do not know of any higher praise that parents could give a son in \nmilitary service. Specialist Sieger and his family will always be in my \nprayers.\n\n\n                 Sergeant First Class Douglas C. Stone\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor one of Utah's fallen sons, SFC First \nClass Douglas C. Stone.\n  SFC Stone had a lifelong connection to our Nation's military. His \nfather served in the Air Force. Yet, SFC Douglas Stone joined the Army \nReserve later in life. As his mother Dolores Feigley said about her \nson, ``I think he was the oldest at boot camp.''\n  However, his maturity was only to be an asset to his country, which \nwas affirmed when he became a full-time reservist. Over the past 6 \nyears, SFC Douglas Stone assisted in the preparation of reservists from \nthe 96th Regional Readiness Command for deployments in support of \nOperations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. As my good friend, MG \nPeter S. Cooke, the commanding officer of the 96th Regional Readiness \nCommand said about SFC Stone ``There wasn't a unit or individual sent \nfrom our headquarters that SFC Stone did not personally assist in \npreparing for their mobilization or deployment.''\n  This was not the first time SFC Douglas Stone had gone in harm's way \nfor his country. He also was a part of the fuel re-supply effort during \nthe First Gulf War.\n  However, his life's most important work undoubtedly was as a family \nman. Sergeant First Class Stone was husband to his wife, Mary, and \nfather to two boys Nathan, 13, and Cameron, 10.\n  SFC Douglas Stone was also a member of Fort Douglas's Honor Guard. I \nunderstand that Rick Edginton, one of his fellow Honor Guardsmen who \nparticipated at his friend's funeral said, ``for me, probably one of \nthe toughest moments was when I was standing at the head of the casket \nand I looked over to the side and I saw a note from his sister on the \nflowers that were there. It said, ``To Doug, my brother, and my \nHero.''''\n  No truer words have been written.\n  SFC Douglas Stone was a hero. He served his country with pride and \nanswered its call when it needed him most. All of Utah shall remember \nhim and will be praying for this hero and his family.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Brandon A. Parr\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to SGT Brandon A. Parr. \nSergeant Parr was a member of the 630th Military Police Company and \ngave his life with two other servicemembers when their vehicle was \nstruck by an improvised explosive device.\n  There are certain pictures that define a time and a moment in our \nNation's history. Such examples can be found in the raising of Old \nGlory over Mount Suribachi, Iwo Jima. I respectfully submit that a \npicture taken during Sergeant Parr's funeral should be added to that \ncategory. In that photo, Sergeant Parr's wife, Shannah, is seen holding \nthe hand of their young son, Nicholas. Nicholas, standing on some \nsteps, is wearing the camouflage uniform of an American soldier--a \nyoung son's tribute to his fallen father. This is an image that I will \nremember for all my days and a fitting tribute to a true hero.\n  Sergeant Parr enlisted in the Army in 2003, and this was his second \ntour in Iraq. He was involved in one of the most critical tasks in this \nwar: training Iraqi police and providing security to the Iraqi people. \nBy all accounts, Sergeant Parr preformed these assignments at the \nhighest standards of our Nation's military.\n  Shannah Parr said of her husband, ``He was very laid back and very \nfunny. He made everyone feel good.''\n  His mother, Teota Dangel said, ``I think he would have gone (to Iraq) \neven if he knew this was going to be the outcome.'' Words like this can \nonly be spoken of a true hero and patriot.\n  Sergeant Parr and his entire family will always be in my prayers.\n\n\n                       Corporal Stephen Kowalczyk\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to CPL Stephen Kowalczyk, a \nmember\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nof the 1st Calvary Division, who recently lost his life while on patrol \nin Iraq.\n  Upon learning of about his life, I was struck by all the adventures \nthat Corporal Kowalczyk had undertaken. He had been the captain of the \nswim team at Macalester College, traveled extensively throughout \nEurope, the Middle East, including working as a handyman in Jerusalem. \nI understand that he even leapt from an iceberg and swam in the frigid \nwaters of the Arctic Ocean. Clearly, this was a young man that seized \nall that life had to offer.\n  Three years ago, at the age of 29, he began a new adventure and \njoined the Army. According to his family he loved it.\n  During a recent memorial service in Iraq, one of his comrades SSG \nRichard Coombes stated: ``He was a man who taught me that there was \nstill beauty in our everyday life, even in Iraq. I looked at him and \nwondered if he had already figured life out. He was in such peace and \nharmony.'' CPT Kevin Bradley would often notice that Corporal Kowalczyk \nwould look from the roof-tops at the area around him. When asked why, \nhe reportedly would reply, ``You should see it up here. It's \nbeautiful.'' Another friend remembered him as ``a gentle, kind soul, I \ncannot think of anybody who did not love this man.''\n  And yet he never forgot why he was deployed to Iraq--to help the \nIraqi people. This commitment was reflected in the letters that he \nwould write home asking for history books that he could give to Iraqis \nthat he met, and pencils, notepads, and Hershey bars for Iraqi \nchildren.\n  What a fine man. What an extraordinary life.\n  I will always remember him and his family in my prayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Dorgan be recognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5164-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5164-S5167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I stand today in strong support of H.R. \n1591, the congressional supplemental bill. In casting our votes on this \nimportant measure, all of us must ask a fundamental question: Do we \nsupport a change in course in Iraq or do we want more of the same?\n  This supplemental bill delivers over $100 billion in necessary \nfunding, an increase of $4 billion over the President's request for our \nmilitary forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, fully meeting the President's \nrequest. More important, the bill establishes a change in course for \nour policy in Iraq by transitioning the mission of American troops away \nfrom involvement in a growing civil war to a more targeted mission, one \nfocused on counterterrorism, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and \nforce protection for American troops.\n  The supplemental bill that was voted on today offers a path away from \nthe current quagmire in Iraq, a state of bloodshed and chaos which is \nstraining the U.S. Army, diverting our attention from a resurgent al-\nQaida in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and finally sacrificing too many of \nour finest men and women.\n  We must never forget the enormous personal sacrifices our troops are \nasked to make every day. As of today, 162 Pennsylvanians and more than \n3,300 Americans as a whole have given their lives in Iraq, with tens of \nthousands more suffering lifelong injuries, including amputations, \nsevere burns, and traumatic brain injuries. On Monday, nine members of \nthe 82nd Airborne Division gave their lives when a suicide bomber \ninfiltrated their outpost in Diyala Province, the deadliest single \nattack on U.S. forces in Iraq since December 2005.\n  We pray today for our fallen heroes--today and always--but we also \npray for ourselves that we may be worthy of their valor.\n  Our troops have done all they can. They have deposed Saddam, and they \nfought insurgents and foreign terrorists. They spent the last 4 years \npartnering with their Iraqi counterparts in a courageous effort to \nestablish the foundation for democracy and a free society. They have \nbeen asked to mediate disputes and protect innocent civilians as \ntargets in a crossfire of a civil war.\n  So our troops have done their part. Now it is time for the Congress \nand the White House to do their part. As retired military generals, \nexperienced diplomats, and scholars with intimate knowledge of Iraq \nhave declared and as a bipartisan Iraq Study Group concluded just last \nwinter, any success in Iraq requires a political and diplomatic \nsolution and cannot be achieved through military might alone.\n  Just ask General Petraeus, who, upon assuming his new command in \nMarch, declared:\n\n       There is no military solution to a problem like that in \n     Iraq, to the insurgency of Iraq . . . A political resolution \n     of various differences . . . will determine, in the long run, \n     the success of that effort.\n\n  GEN Barry McCaffrey recently returned from his latest trip to Iraq. \nOne of our most widely respected former military officers, General \nMcCaffrey fought in Vietnam with distinction, commanded a division in \nthe gulf war in 1991, and led U.S. operations in Latin America. He \nsubmitted a formal report on his trip, which is very sober reading. One \nline stands out for me, and I quote from General McCaffrey's report:\n\n       No Iraqi Government official, coalition soldier, diplomat, \n     reporter, foreign nongovernmental organization, nor \n     contractor can walk the streets of Baghdad, nor Mosul, nor \n     Kirkuk, nor Basra, nor Tikrit, nor Najaf, nor Ramadi, without \n     heavily armed protection.\n\n  This supplemental bill provides the Congress and the White House a \nchance to do their part to ensure success in our mission in Iraq. It \nbrings to an end the ``stay the course'' mentality that defined our \napproach for the past 4 years in at least three ways.\n  First, the supplemental revises our mission in Iraq away from \npolicing a civil war toward training and equipping Iraqi security \nforces, protecting U.S. forces, and conducting targeted counterterror \noperations.\n  Second, it initiates a phased redeployment of our troops no later \nthan October 1 of this year, with a goal of removing all combat troops \nby April 1 of next year. These steps were called for in the bipartisan \nIraq Study Group and represent the will of the American people. I am \npleased that the Congress is finally following suit.\n  Third, the supplemental at least holds the Iraqi Government \naccountable by setting measurable and achievable benchmarks on the \nIraqi Government for ending the sectarian conflict, political \nreconciliation, and improving the lives of ordinary Iraqis.\n  If the Iraqi Government refuses to meet these benchmarks, they will \nput at risk future U.S. assistance and the continued presence of U.S. \ntroops. We have repeatedly seen past benchmarks established by the Bush \nadministration and the Iraqi Government come and go without progress \nand without consequence. Just this week, a revealing article in USA \nToday highlighted the growing lack of confidence among Iraqi \nParliamentarians in the al-Maliki government, and one legislator was \nquoted as saying:\n\n       This government hasn't delivered and is not capable of \n     doing the job.\n\n  This bill, once and for all, establishes a series of accountable \nbenchmarks.\n  Finally, the supplemental recognizes the toll this war has taken on \nour uniformed military, especially the Army and Marine Corps. It \nestablishes a set of troop-readiness standards that establish minimum \nlevels between deployments for our troops and limits the duration of \nthose deployments.\n  The legislation includes a Presidential waiver authority, but it \nwould require the President to certify that the continued strain on our \nmilitary forces is in our national interest. These provisions will \nforce the President to think long and hard about the impact of the Iraq \nwar on the readiness of our military to handle other pressing \nchallenges, including the need to fight and kill al-Qaida terrorists \nwherever we find them.\n  The congressional debate that has helped produce this supplemental \nbill has been attacked by the President and his supporters. However, \nour Secretary of Defense last week described our debate as helpful in \n``communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended \ncommitment.''\n  Two of my distinguished colleagues, on a recent visit to Baghdad, \nexplicitly\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\ninformed Iraqi leaders that growing congressional pressure on the need \nfor a phased redeployment signified that it was time for the Iraqi \nGovernment to get serious and start taking the hard steps needed for \npolitical reconciliation, including a fair distribution of oil \nrevenues. Without the steps this Congress has taken, without the \npressure it has applied, the Maliki regime would continue to be \nreceiving an open-ended blank check from the White House, with our \nsoldiers paying the ultimate price.\n  The President has regrettably chosen to distort and malign our \nintentions in sending him the bill that is before us today. I wish to \ntake a few minutes to briefly address those charges and demonstrate why \nit is the President--the President--and not the Congress who has \ncynically held hostage the funding and well-being of our troops.\n  First, the President has repeatedly charged that our military forces \nneeded the supplemental funding immediately and any delay to pass the \nsupplemental in his exact specifications would harm their readiness. A \nnumber of my colleagues already cited authoritative research from the \nCongressional Research Service that demonstrates that the needed \nfunding is available to the U.S. Army from mid to late July--let me say \nthat again, mid to late July--without jeopardizing the war effort. \nHowever, there is a much larger cynicism at play here. There would be \nno need for a supplemental bill at all if this President had submitted \nan honest, regular budget request for this fiscal year.\n  Four years into the war, this administration should be able to tell \nthe American people how much the war in Iraq cost. Yet the \nadministration has refused to incorporate wartime costs into his \nregular budget request, instead seeking to finance our operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan through a series of supplemental bills. Of course, \nthe President doesn't want to do that because regular appropriations \nrequests are subject to greater public and congressional scrutiny.\n  Financing the war through supplemental bills also allows the \nPresident to better hide the impact of the war on our Federal budget. \nIt is not surprising that a President who has run up the largest \ndeficits in modern history would want to hide that fact. Doing so on \nthe backs of our troops is outrageous.\n  So the President is plain wrong when he attacks the Congress on \nsupplemental funding for our troops in Iraq. The reality is that we \nhave exceeded the President's request and on a timetable which is \nquicker than that of the previous Congress controlled by the \nPresident's party.\n  If the President chooses to veto this bill, it is he--it is he--who \nis prolonging this process and denying necessary funds to our young men \nand women in uniform. If the President had been honest with the \nCongress and the American people on the true cost of this war from the \nvery beginning, we would not have needed this supplemental bill.\n\n  The second claim the President has made over and over again in recent \nweeks is that this supplemental bill is larded up with porkbarrel \nspending that is unrelated to our military operation in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Yet, once again, the President is distorting both his own \nactions and those of Congress for crude political gain. We should not \nforget that the President's original request for supplemental funding \nalso included funds not related to the war in Afghanistan and in Iraq. \nThe President's request included money for debt relief in Kosovo, \ncultural exchanges, and assistance to refugees in Burundi. The \nPresident keeps calling for a clean bill, yet his own request to the \nCongress included extra items with no connection to Iraq or \nAfghanistan. In light of the President's request, the Congress, acting \nas an independent and equal branch of Government, engaged in its own \ndeliberations and determined other emergency priorities that required \nfunding through this supplemental bill.\n  This President seems to think that the Congress exists merely to \nfollow his orders and that it should not exercise any independent \njudgment. This may have been the case with our predecessors but not \nwith this Congress and not with this Senator. We were elected by the \npeople of our States, and we report to them, not the President and not \nthe Vice President. So the Congress acted to ensure additional funding \nfor a number of key priorities.\n  The President has broadly tarred these projects as ``egregious \nporkbarrel.'' Does the President believe that label applies to the $1.2 \nbillion in funds for accelerated production of mine-resistent vehicles \nso our soldiers have a better chance of surviving IED attacks? Does he \nbelieve that label applies to $2.1 billion to better provide health \ncare for our veterans? Does he believe that $650 million to help with \nthe children's health insurance shortfall in 14 States is frivolous \nspending? I could also talk about the funding for victims of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita and our farmers and on and on.\n  This supplemental bill, agreed upon by the House and the Senate, is a \nresponsible effort that guarantees the funds our troops need, provides \nfunding for other critical emergency priorities, and sets a badly \nneeded change in course in Iraq.\n  In conclusion, our policy in Iraq is not working, and it must change \nif we are to salvage our mission and seek to leave behind a functioning \ngovernment in Baghdad that can defend its national borders and contain \ninternal violence. It is time to recognize the reality of Iraq as it is \ntoday, get our mission right, and allow our troops to begin coming home \nwith the honor they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nTester be recognized following my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate has passed a piece of \nlegislation that includes funding for our troops who are committed to \naction in Iraq and other parts of the world, especially Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I expect there will be no controversy about the issue of \nfunding, although we have provided more funding for the soldiers than \nrequested by the President, but there are other portions of the \nlegislation that are controversial. I understand that. But I wish to \ntalk about something that has not been talked about nearly enough as we \nsend our soldiers to war.\n  William Manchester wrote a book called ``The Glory and the Dream.'' I \nremember, when I read that book, thinking about what an unbelievable \ncommitment this country made during the Second World War. We have now \nbeen at war in Iraq longer than we were at war in the Second World War.\n  Let me take a couple of brief comments from ``The Glory and the \nDream,'' written by Manchester, about what this country did during the \nSecond World War.\n  This country geared up. Its factories were humming. Rosie the Riveter \nwas riveting, and we had output from our factories that was nearly \nunbelievable in support of the war effort. There was rationing. There \nwere all kinds of things happening in which the country supported the \nwar effort and supported the soldiers.\n  Let me quote:\n\n       From an initial keel-to-delivery time of over 200 days, \n     Henry Kaiser cut the average work time on a liberty ship to \n     40 days. In 1944, he was launching a new escort aircraft \n     carrier every week, and they were turning out entire cargo \n     ships in 17 days. During the first 212 days of 1945, they \n     completed 247 cargo ships, better than 1 a day.\n\n  That is what this country mobilized to do during the Second World \nWar.\n  From the same book, ``The Glory and the Dream,'' quote:\n\n       In the 5 years following the French collapse, America \n     turned out: 296,000 warplanes, 102,000 tanks, 2.4 million \n     trucks, 8,700 warships, and 5,400 cargo ships.\n\n  Now, why did that happen? Because this country mobilized. This \ncountry's factories were humming.\n  At a meeting, Joseph Stalin observed to the American President--the \nAmerican President, FDR, Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill. Stalin \nsaid: We couldn't win this war without America's production.\n  This country mobilized.\n  Now, let me read something. Just understanding that in 1944, we were \nproducing 4,000 warplanes a month, 50,000 warplanes a year, let me read \nsomething. Colonel Hammes came and testified last year at a policy \ncommittee hearing I chaired, and here is what he said:\n\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\n\n       Since the improvised explosive devices exploded in Iraq in \n     the summer of 2003, we as a country have known--\n\n  I am quoting him--\n\n     we have known there are better and safer vehicles available \n     than the armored HUMVEE--for instance, the M-1117 armored \n     security vehicle. Yet in 3 years, the Pentagon has purchased \n     less than 1,000 of them. I find it remarkable that a Nation \n     that could produce 4,000 warplanes a month during World War \n     II can produce 45 armored vehicles per month today.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       We didn't ask soldiers to invade France in 1944 with the \n     inferior equipment they had in 1941. Why are we asking our \n     soldiers and Marines to use the same armor that was \n     insufficient in 2003? It's simple. The administration has \n     refused to dedicate the resources necessary to make it \n     happen. It is content to let our troops ride in inferior \n     vehicles.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       The administration has failed to replace and maintain the \n     equipment necessary for the units to be ready for other \n     potential operations, although our units lack equipment to \n     train, our repair depots are working single shifts and 5 days \n     a week. The American people haven't refused to provide what \n     our people need in the battlefield, the administration has \n     refused to ask for the funding. The failure to provide our \n     best equipment is a serious moral failure on the part of our \n     leadership.\n\n  Now, why do I raise this question today? In the Second World War, in \n1944, we were producing 4,000 warplanes a month, and yet we have not \nmobilized. We have sent troops abroad to go to war, but the message \nhere at home is to go shopping. Troops go to the war, we go to the \nmall. We haven't mobilized.\n  Let me read to you a letter dated 1 March 2007. This is from the \nMarine Commandant about a vehicle called the MRAP vehicle, the mine-\nresistent ambush-protected vehicle, a vehicle that is much stronger \nthan the humvee, much safer than the humvee our soldiers are now riding \nin in Iraq on patrol.\n  This is from the Marine Corps Commandant, in his memorandum to the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\n       The MRAP vehicle has a dramatically better record of \n     preventing fatal and serious injuries from attacks by \n     improvised explosive devices. We estimate that the use of the \n     MRAP could reduce the casualties in vehicles due to IED \n     attacks by as much as 80 percent.\n\n  Now, think of that, 3,325 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq, and \n70 percent of those casualties have come as a result of IEDs. The \nCommandant of the Marine Corps says the MRAP vehicle would save 80 \npercent of those casualties. Eighty percent. No marines have died in \n300 separate attacks on MRAP vehicles by IEDs, according to BG John \nAllen, deputy commander of coalition forces in Anbar Province--300 \nattacks on MRAP vehicles and no marines have died.\n  Now, why do I raise all this? Well, we need about 6,700 of these MRAP \nvehicles if this country is intending to provide the best equipment for \nour troops who are on patrol in Iraq. Until recent months, we were \nproducing about 45 a month. Let me say that again. We are sending \nsoldiers to war, and there is a vehicle that the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps says will save 80 percent of the lives now being lost in \nthese IED explosions because this is a much safer vehicle than the \nhumvee. It is called the MRAP. But we are not mobilized to produce the \nMRAP. No one has said: This is urgent, let's provide the best equipment \nfor these soldiers.\n  So what did we do? Well, in the 2007 Omnibus appropriations bill, we \nadded money. Yes, we in Congress added money for it. In the bill we \njust voted for today, we added money for it because the President \nwasn't requesting sufficient money. We have a need for 6,700 of them. \nThe administration, with all of their requests, would fund less than a \nthird of that. In their 2008 budget request, which would take effect \nnext October, once again it is underfunded.\n  Let me show a picture, if I might, a photograph of what is called the \nMRAP vehicle. Three versions of the MRAP. The Defense Department \nexperts say that soldiers on patrol, riding in this version of the MRAP \n80 percent of the soldiers who would otherwise lose their lives from \nIED explosives will be saved. Think of that. With 300 attacks against \nthis vehicle, not 1 life has been lost. Yet we have soldiers patrolling \nin Iraq with vehicles much less safe, and 70 percent of the 3,325 \ntroops who have been killed have been killed as a result of IEDs, \nriding in vehicles that are not as safe as this vehicle, and until \nrecently we were producing 45 a month. That is unbelievable. A country \nthat could send everyone into its factories and have those factories \nhumming three shifts a day and produce 4,000 warplanes a month and a \nliberty ship a day, every single day, the country that won the Second \nWorld War with its prodigious productions, supporting its wonderful \ntroops, that country can't mobilize? This President can't ask that \ncountry to mobilize? We have to stick money in this supplemental bill \nabove the President's request in order to say that this is a priority, \nthis is urgent, this is about saving the lives of soldiers?\n  Again, I raise the question because we are at war. Yet you would \nhardly know it, with respect to the daily lives most of us lead. In the \nSecond World War, it wasn't that way. Yet we have been at this war \nlonger than the Second World War. In the Second World War, here is what \nwe produced--the might of American production, in which a nation came \ntogether to say that we are going to support our troops and beat back \nthe forces of fascism and defeat Adolf Hitler and where we produced \n296,000 warplanes--think of it--and 8,762 warships. We didn't do that \nworking one shift a day. We didn't do that making 45 MRAPs a month. \nThis country mobilized then, but it is not mobilized now.\n  So we passed a piece of legislation here today. It has some areas the \nPresident says will persuade him to veto it. I assume this is not one \nof those areas. The President didn't request this funding for MRAPs. He \nshould have. He didn't request enough funding in the coming fiscal \nyear. He should have. If this country is going to send its soldiers to \nwar, then we, all of us in this country, have an obligation to send \nthem to war with the very finest equipment available to protect them \nand to help them. Regrettably, that is not now the case.\n  Early on in this war, I received e-mail pictures, photographs from \nIraq, from soldiers showing me their humvees with welded pieces of \nmetal on the doors, metal they pulled out of a scrap heap and welded to \na door to try to strengthen it because those humvees weren't up-\narmored. Even now, much later, when all of the humvees on patrol are \nup-armored, we know there is a much safer vehicle that will save, we \nthink, 80 percent of the fatalities that now exist through IEDs. There \nis no excuse--no excuse, in my judgment--for our not having three \nshifts at every plant available to produce these vehicles and get them \nto our soldiers in Iraq and save these lives. That is what we did in \nthis supplemental appropriations bill.\n\n  When anyone talks about undercutting or undermining soldiers, I refer \nthem to this. This was the first time, today, in which this Congress \nsaid to the President and said to the country we are going to mobilize. \nWe insist that if we send soldiers to war, we want them to go to war \nwith the finest equipment available with the potential to save their \nlives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe conference report on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nwe passed early this afternoon. This bill needs to be signed by the \nPresident. It will do a lot of good for a lot of people in this great \ncountry. It will not only help our troops serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, but also millions of Americans who have suffered over the \nlast year due to drought and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  This bill has nearly $7 billion for cleanup and recovery on the gulf \ncoast, which is, 18 months later, still dealing with the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina. There is $1.8 billion for veterans health care in \nthis supplemental, to give our veterans the care they deserve when they \nreturn from serving our Nation. It contains $3.5 billion for \nagricultural assistance, assistance that is desperately needed. I have \nheard from several farmers in Montana about the drought and how it has \ndevastated their farms and how they are barely hanging on.\n  Tom Lightner, a farmer and rancher from north of Choteau, MT, grows\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\nwheat, barley, and alfalfa, and he used to run some cattle. But the \ncontinuing drought has hurt his operation. The reservoir near his \noperation, Bynum Reservoir, has been almost empty for the past 5 years \nbecause of this drought, and in 2005 Tom had to sell off his 120 head \nof cattle he used to run on his ranch. In February of this year, Tom \nwrote me this letter. What it says is:\n\n       I am writing to you in need of your assistance. I own and \n     operate a small farm and ranch north of Choteau. Because of \n     the continuing drought conditions in this area, making it \n     from one year to the next has been a real challenge. In my \n     present circumstances, it may become impossible [to stay in \n     business].\n\n  Now Tom is in danger of losing his crop insurance and is looking for \nhelp from me, and from us, and from the President, to help him through \nthese difficult times.\n  Another farmer in Montana, from Dagmar, wrote about conditions last \nyear during the growing season. He writes that it is a foggy morning, \nno meaningful precipitation, but it cooled down some, which is good \nnews in the heat of summer with little moisture. But the damage was \ndone. Some of the late seeding re-crop had the top half of the head \nburnt right off.\n  What does that mean, in a nutshell? He is not going to cut much of a \ncrop and it is not going to have much quality when he does get it in \nthe bin. What does that mean in reality? That means no money to pay \nexpenses, to pay for insurance, to pay for heating, to pay for seeding \ncosts; no money to buy groceries, to pay that operating loan or \nmortgage loan.\n  That is why it is so critically important that the President of the \nUnited States sign this supplemental. Farmers and ranchers in Montana \nand throughout this country have suffered long enough. They have \ndedicated their lives to feeding the world, and it is the very least we \ncan do to provide them with the assistance they need to keep going.\n  Before I finish, I want to talk a little bit about our great men and \nwomen who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have done \neverything we have asked and they have done it very well. This \nsupplemental bill also gives our troops all the funding they need, and \nmore, to meet the needs not addressed by the President's request. It \nprovides a plan to get our troops out of the Middle East in this civil \nwar they find themselves engaged in, and back to fighting the real war, \nthe war on terrorism.\n  It sets a goal, not a deadline, of being out of Iraq by the spring of \n2008. But it allows our troops to continue to train the Iraqi security \nforces, to conduct operations against terrorist groups, and to protect \nUnited States assets. This is hardly handcuffing the President of this \ncountry. This is a responsible plan to continue our fight against \nterrorism while getting our troops out of this Iraqi civil war.\n  For these reasons, I urge the President of the United States to sign \nthis emergency supplemental into law. No more excuses, sign the \nsupplemental. Our troops, our farmers, the people of this country, \ndeserve no less.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I understand we are in morning business, \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5167-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I came to the floor today to express my \nsurprise that any Member of this body could attempt to characterize the \ncurrent political situation as one in which the administration is \nfailing to work with Congress. Any realistic discussion of today's \npolitical climate must revolve around the fact that the current \nmajority has refused to work in any meaningful way with the minority \nparty. The most blatant example of this is in the use of cloture by the \nmajority leader to avoid consensus on the consideration of legislation.\n  In the 110th Congress, the majority leader so far has filed 24 \ncloture motions. During the same timeframe in the first session of the \n109th Congress, Republicans had only filed five cloture motions. In the \n108th Congress, by this date Republicans had only filed five cloture \nmotions.\n  Just as surprising were the circumstances that surrounded General \nPetraeus's briefing yesterday. What I found remarkable was the original \ninstinct of the Speaker of the House and our Senate majority leader was \nto avoid meeting the general here on Capitol Hill. Can you imagine \nthat? The most important issue of our day is Iraq and the man we \nunanimously approved to lead our efforts is not worth their time to \nhear from? The only explanation for this is that the disdain felt by \nthe majority in working with the minority and the administration was \nalso extended to working with our military.\n  Of course, once it was clear that there was public outcry in not \nmeeting General Petraeus, they relented. But what was also evident is \nthere was an effort to avoid actually believing anything the general \nhad to say about the situation on the ground. General Petraeus is not \ngiving us information that has been filtered through some political \nprocess. He is giving a factual and sobering account of what is \nhappening, block by block, in Iraq.\n  Yet the other side of the aisle, with a few exceptions, wants to \ncover their ears and not listen to the facts. They would rather pretend \nthey know what is going on in Iraq rather than hear it from the general \nagain.\n  The situation in Iraq is a dynamic and ever-changing one, and after \nyesterday's briefing, it is more clear to me than ever that we must \nresist arbitrary deadlines to our fight in Iraq.\n  But my Democratic colleagues would rather play politics with our men \nand women in the field and score a few points for the far left wing of \ntheir party. They would rather play politics on the Senate floor than \nwork to pass meaningful legislation.\n  I ask the majority leader and the other side of the aisle to put \npolitics aside and do the right thing, work in a truly bipartisan \nmanner to do what the American people expect us to do.\n  This obstruction and unwillingness to work in a truly bipartisan \neffort to provide funding to our troops who are even now in harm's way \nis outrageous and disappointing.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. KLOBUCHAR).

Madam President, I rise today to commemorate and pay \ntribute to the life of a great Washingtonian, a great American, and \nsomeone who in the State of Washington will be remembered for his great \ncontributions and who will be remembered across our country. I am \ntalking about our former Washington State Speaker of the House, John L. \nO'Brien, who died this past week at the age of 95. Speaker O'Brien \nactually passed away on the last day of this year's legislative \nsession, almost an appropriate dedication for him for the remembrance \nof his service in our State government.\n  I am proud to say John L. O'Brien was a good friend, a mentor, and \nsomeone who imparted a lot of political wisdom in the State of \nWashington. He served in our State legislature for 52 years, from 1939 \nto 1993, and he served as speaker of the house for a chunk of that \nperiod, 1955 to 1963. He served under nine different Governors. At one \npoint in time, I believe, he held the record in our country for the \nlongest serving State legislator.\n  He did a tremendous job as majority leader; I am sure at times as \nminority leader; as speaker, as I mentioned, speaker pro tem. I believe \nhe served on every single committee in our State legislature. He led \nour State's government through some great challenges\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nfor us and for our country. He literally was in office when the United \nStates went to declare World War II in 1954. He was speaker when the \nfirst flight of the Boeing 707 was completed. He saw the Space Needle \ncompleted for the World's Fair that was held in Seattle in 1962. He was \nthere when Microsoft was founded. He led our State through the \nchallenging times responding to Mount St. Helen's eruption in 1980. And \nhe was there to lead our celebration as Washington State celebrated our \n100th anniversary as a State in 1989.\n  But John O'Brien also was a man who thought about the future, and he \nhas an unending list of accomplishments that literally touched the \nlives of thousands of Washingtonians. He changed the course of history \nin our State by his generosity, by his leadership, by his commitment, \nhis inspiration.\n  I know my remarks will not do him justice, but I just want to say \nthat he did a lot in a time and period of making sure that despite the \nlofty position he held in the house, he never lost track of what the \nconstituents of his district and of our State cared about. He worked on \nproperty tax relief for seniors and low-income individuals. He fought \nfor prescription and over-the-counter drug information labeling so that \nseniors knew what kind of products they were purchasing. He was a \nchampion of State employee collective bargaining and workplace safety \nissues. He sponsored Washington State's first clean air act. That might \nsound like something lots of people do, but he actually sponsored that \nlegislation in 1940. So he was ahead of his time in thinking about \nWashington State's environment and how to preserve the pristine quality \nof life that is so important to us.\n  He helped to establish one of the first programs in the Nation to \ncommit a percentage of our construction budget for the creation of art. \nHe helped save and restore Franklin High School. He worked to make sure \nwe established a drug-free zone and got legislation passed removing the \nsales tax from items sold at charitable auctions.\n  John O'Brien represented one of the most diverse neighborhoods in \nSeattle, an area called the Rainer Valley. The Rainer Valley began as \nan Irish and Italian community of immigrants, and with Speaker \nO'Brien's leadership, it helped to incorporate various waves of new \nimmigrants from various communities: the Chinese-American community, \nJapanese, Filipino, African American, Orthodox Jews, Vietnamese, East \nAfrican, and Hispanic citizens. Now, it is, as I said, one of the most \ndiverse areas of our State.\n  When the Seattle Times ran a story about Speaker O'Brien's life and \nhow his values were shaped, they said:\n\n       Mr. O'Brien was just 7 years old when his Irish immigrant \n     father, a detective with the Seattle Police, came home after \n     a particularly tough day on the job. He turned to his eldest \n     son and asked, rhetorically, ``What will ever become of you \n     if something happens to me?''\n\n  Two years later his father was shot and killed while on duty. That \nleft the young Mr. O'Brien to help his mother, also an Irish immigrant, \ncare for their siblings. By the time he was a teenager, he was bringing \nhome a paycheck as a truckdriver for Keefe's Grocery in Rainier Valley. \nHe went on to start his own accounting firm.\n  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted former Governor Dan Evans, who \nknew John O'Brien well, who said:\n\n       He knew how to lead and occasionally when things got \n     rambunctious, he had to have a heavy gavel to get things back \n     in order.\n\n  Evans remembered one time when he challenged an O'Brien ruling, \nO'Brien slammed his gavel down so hard the head snapped off.\n  While O'Brien was a fiscally conservative Democrat, he understood \nwhat the role of the speaker required of him. He was always ready to \nhave a good time.\n\n  I remember that if there was ever anybody who captured the saying, \n``when Irish eyes are smiling,'' it was John O'Brien because he had a \ntwinkle in his eye and a way to get people engaged. When I entered the \nState legislature at the age of 28, I was the youngest member at the \ntime, and he was the most senior member of our legislature. Knowing of \nmy Irish heritage background, he got me to commit to him that I would \nparticipate in St. Patrick's Day celebrations in his office by doing \nthe Irish jig if, in fact, he produced someone with a bagpipe.\n  Well, unbeknownst to me, our secretary of state, Ralph Monroe, of \nScottish heritage, had such bagpipes stored in his office and was quite \nfrequently seen in the halls of Olympia playing the bagpipes. So on St. \nPatrick's Day I did participate in Speaker O'Brien's St. Patrick's Day \ncelebration, as did our secretary of state, Ralph Monroe, and many \nothers.\n  I hope to this day that there is not a picture of my rendition of my \nIrish heritage dance. But I know I will always remember on St. \nPatrick's Day John O'Brien and his great service and his heritage in \nour State.\n  On the last two pages of his biography, ``Speaker of the House,'' \nSpeaker John O'Brien sums up his philosophy on how to survive in a \nlegislature. He said:\n\n       Do your best, count the votes, and, win or lose, move on to \n     other pressing issues.\n\n  He said:\n\n       It might stay with you for a while, but as far as being \n     disappointed, you cannot let it remain as a personal matter \n     because there's always another rollcall. There's always \n     another day.\n\n  We can find inspiration in Speaker O'Brien's service as we face tough \nlegislative issues here and as we face our vote today. No matter on \nwhat side of the political aisle you stand, we can all join in honoring \nthe inspiration from others who have served and honoring the life of \nSpeaker John L. O'Brien for his lifetime of public service.\n  My thoughts are with his family: his wife Mary, their six children, \nJohn O'Brien, Jr., Laurie, MaryAnn, Karen, Jeannie, and Paul, and to \ntheir grandchildren.\n  John O'Brien was a great Washingtonian, a great citizen of our \ncountry, and we will miss him, and we will try to live up to his \naccomplishments and to his legacy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntake a couple of minutes to speak and to honor the life and legacy of a \ngreat leader from my home State of Washington. He was the former \nSpeaker of the House, John O'Brien, and he passed away just this past \nweekend.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that John O'Brien had one of the longest \nand most accomplished careers of anyone who served in our Washington \nState Legislature. I was really lucky to have an opportunity to work \nwith him when I was in the Washington State Senate and he was serving \nin the House. He was one of those people whom, whenever he walked into \na room, everyone noticed. I always thought he was just so tall, but \nthen I am only 5 feet tall, so to me he was tall. But it is amazing to \nme how many people say that his stature brought the respect of everyone \nwho ever met him, and it certainly was true for me and for so many of \nus.\n  As Speaker of the House, he was known to be very tough but always \nfair. He was always firm, and he was always compassionate. I think I \nlearned most from him that when you know the rules and use them for the \nbetterment of all people, that is the kind of power which leaves you \nwith a legacy everybody admires.\n  John leaves us many legacies. He leaves us a record of long and \ndistinguished service in the State legislature. There is a building on \nour capitol grounds in Washington State that bears his name. He leaves \nbehind laws that made our State a better place to work, to live, and to \nraise a family. Most importantly, he left a legacy of service that \nlives on in all of us who were lucky enough to serve with him and to be \ninspired by his leadership. It is the kind of legacy that any elected \nofficial would be proud of.\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n  On this sad occasion, I extend my condolences to his family, to his \nmany friends, and to all of us who served with him. We will not forget \nhis legacy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, recently we learned the Ohio National \nGuard could face early redeployment. We learned the National Guard is \nbeing asked to train without the proper equipment. Our Guard will do \nthe job well regardless of the circumstances, but it is wrong to send \nthem to Iraq with incomplete training and inadequate equipment and with \ninsufficient downtime.\n  The supplemental passed today echoes what many of us in Congress and \nmilitary families across the country have been saying: We need a new \ndirection for Iraq. Make no mistake, we take a backseat to no one in \nsupporting the brave men and women fighting in Iraq. We absolutely \nsupport their families. However, more of the same is not a plan for our \ntroops and will not end this war in Iraq. This war has made our world \nand our country less safe. The Iraq war has cost 142 Ohioans their \nlives. It has wounded another 1,000 Ohioans.\n  Congress will continue to fight for our Nation's military by working \nto see they have the resources and support they need and leadership \nthey deserve. The supplemental did that today. The supplemental fully \nfunds and fully supports our troops, while establishing conditions that \nwill bring our troops home. It provides desperately needed funding to \nthe VA, something the President simply has not asked for, to help care \nfor the hundreds of thousands of new veterans created by this war.\n  In the Veterans' Committee yesterday, we heard from families about \ntragedy after tragedy, from families who have lost loved ones in this \nwar, who didn't get the proper care from the VA because of \nunderfunding, who didn't get the proper direction when they returned \nhome from Iraq because the White House simply did not schedule in the \nway they should have the kind of help for returning Iraqi veterans. If \nthe President won't take responsibility for those failures and lead our \ntroops home, then Congress must. We owe it to our soldiers, sailors, \nair men and women, our marines, and especially to their families.\n  The President should listen to the military leaders and listen to the \nAmerican people and work with Congress to change course in Iraq instead \nof threatening vetoes. I hope the President reads this legislation \nbefore he makes his final determination whether to sign it or whether \nto veto it. Vetoing this legislation would deny funding that our \nmilitary needs and that our veterans desperately need, such as $99 \nbillion in emergency Department of Defense spending--$4 billion more \nthan the President requested; $3 billion for mine-resistant, ambush-\nprotected vehicles; $4.8 billion in military construction in part to \nfund BRAC--$3.1 billion will go to funding the BRAC 2005 account, and \nwe know all over the country how important that is; and $1.6 billion \nfor individual body armor.\n  The President and the Pentagon and civilian leaders of this country \nhave fallen shamefully short in their failures to provide the body \narmor for our troops. We have all heard too many stories. I have heard \nthem in Steubenville and Toledo and Dayton about soldiers' families \ntelling us they didn't have the proper body armor they needed.\n  The VA would get $1.7 billion more than the President's VA proposal. \nWe know the VA is underfunded at least that much. They have increased \nonly about 10 percent in terms of employees but have a workload of \nreturning Iraqi war veterans of at least 2.5 times that number. There \nis $39 million in our supplemental budget for polytrauma-related \nfunding. There is $10 million for blind veterans programs. There is \n$100 million--and this is essential--for VA mental health services and \n$25 million for prosthetics. None of those did the President include in \nhis request, and none of those have we prepared for properly in the \nprevious Congress and in the White House.\n\n  When we add up the numbers and we see 3,300 soldiers and marines in \nour country have lost their lives in the Iraq war, when you understand \nthe tens of thousands of injuries, we see that our VA is simply not \nprepared. They are not prepared for this year and next year, let alone \nfor the 50 years down the road when taxpayers are going to be taking \ncare of these deserving veterans, giving the kind of care that we \nshould be providing. We are going to see we are not prepared over the \nnext 50 years to do that, either for health treatment or for treatment \nof mental health injuries.\n  In addition to the Iraq spending and the spending for our Nation's \nreturning veterans, there are other things in this emergency spending \nbill, as there were in Republican bills in the past, drafted by the \nWhite House, passed by the Republican House and Senate. There is other \ncrucial emergency spending that needs to be dealt with: $1.3 billion \nfor Katrina relief, $100 million for FEMA and emergency management \nperformance grants, $425 million for securing rural schools, $13 \nmillion for mine safety. We have seen some of the most dangerous times \nin our Nation's mines in the last couple of years. There is $625 \nmillion for pandemic flu response, something public health authorities \nwarn us about every week or so here. There is $400 million for LIHEAP \nto take care of deserving elderly and indigent who simply cannot afford \ntheir heating and cooling bills and another $683 million for emergency \nrelief grants--all that this Congress needs to do.\n  The President has set our Nation on a path that leads in the wrong \ndirection in Iraq and fails to meet the needs of our returning \nveterans. It is time to change paths. I ask again that the President of \nthe United States read this bill, understand this bill, and understand \nhow the supplemental bill addresses the needs our country faces in the \nyears ahead.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5169-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5169-S5170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SEPARATION OF POWERS\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, the Founders of our country did not \nbelieve in monarchy. They put up with one king for a while and didn't \nwant to have to put up with another one down the line. Meeting in \nPhiladelphia about 220 years ago, about 30 miles from my home in \nWilmington, DE, our Founding Fathers did not invest all power over \nnational affairs in our national destiny in the hands of any one \nperson. Rather, they created a separation of powers. They created, as \nwe all know, three coequal branches of Government.\n  I don't sit down every day or night and actually open the \nConstitution and read it. But every now and then I think a review of \nsome of it and its parameters is instructive. For those who take the \ntime--particularly looking at the debate we have had in recent days on \nwhether it is appropriate for us to provide some guidance and \nexpression with respect to the expenditure of these moneys in the \nsupplemental appropriations, especially in Iraq--it is helpful to look \nat the Constitution and get a sense of what our Founding Fathers had in \nmind.\n  In looking at article II in this copy of the Constitution, section 2, \nthere is about a sentence where it talks about the power of the \nPresident. This is what it says:\n\n       The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and \n     Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several \n     States, when called into the actual Service of the United \n     States.\n\n  That is what it says. You can go back a couple pages before that to \narticle I, section 8, and our Founding Fathers talk about the powers \nand responsibilities of the legislative branch in this regard. Here is \nwhat it says, in part:\n\n       The Congress shall have the power To . . .\n\n  Then there are all kinds of things listed, such as lay and collect \ntaxes, borrow money, regulate commerce, and so forth, with foreign \nnations. It also says the Congress shall have the power:\n\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\n\n       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal and \n     make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;\n       To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money \n     to that Use shall be for a longer term than two years;\n       To provide and maintain a Navy;\n       To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land \n     and naval Forces;\n       To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the \n     Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions;\n       To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the \n     Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States.\n\n  It goes on and on.\n  The point I am trying to make is that the Constitution makes it clear \nthat there is a division of responsibility, a sharing of \nresponsibilities. Part of it lies with the executive branch, and a \ngreat deal lies with the legislative branch. For those of us who are \ntrying to figure out which is the right side to come down on with \nrespect to these issues, keep in mind the words of the Constitution.\n  When it comes to charting our Nation's course in Iraq, all three \nbranches of Government do have responsibilities. For the President to \ngo to war in Iraq, he had to come to us in Congress for approval, for \nauthorization. Now, to continue that war he has had to come back to the \nCongress each and every year to request and receive approval for more \nfunding.\n  Both Congress and the Supreme Court have exercised oversight over \nthis President's war policies--Congress through oversight hearings, and \nthe Supreme Court through rulings on constitutional questions \nconcerning the detention and interrogation of prisoners. That Congress \nact as a coequal branch of Government, and not a rubberstamp for \ndecisions made by the President, is what the Founding Fathers wanted in \n1787. I believe it is what most of the American people want today. It \nwas, in part, because Congress failed in recent years to exercise \nadequate oversight over the President's policies in Iraq that the \nAmerican people went to the polls last November and demanded a change \nin this body and in the folks in the House of Representatives.\n  Let's not debate today, at this moment, whether Congress has a role \nto play in charting our course in Iraq. We do. Let's not kid ourselves \nthat Congress can meet its responsibilities in this regard by \ncontinuing to rubberstamp the decisions of the President.\n  The President has come to Congress once again to request continued \nfunding for the war in Iraq. To put matters in the most basic of terms, \nCongress has three options: We can say yes, we can say no, or we can \nsay yes, but.\n  To simply to say yes, after U.S. policy and conditions on the ground \nhave drifted in the wrong direction for more than 3 years, I believe \nwould be to abdicate our responsibility as a coequal branch of \nGovernment.\n  To simply say no, when we have troops on the ground in harm's way, \nwould be a betrayal of the very Army this Congress is charged by the \nConstitution to raise and support.\n  The responsible action is to respond to the President's request by \nsaying yes, but. It is to provide our troops with the support they need \nto perform their assigned mission but at the same time to exercise our \npower as a coequal branch to begin to change the nature of that \nmission.\n  The first part of our response to the President--funding the troops--\nshould not be controversial. I don't believe it is in this body. The \nPresident has requested the funding. We are providing that funding for \nour troops. Indeed, we are not only providing what the President \nrequested, we are making some additions, particularly to improve the \ncare of the wounded when they come home.\n  The second part of our response to the President--seeking a change in \nthe nature of our mission in Iraq--should not be controversial either.\n  There is an old saying: The definition of insanity is doing the same \nthing over and over again and expecting different results. We have been \napproaching the challenges we face in Iraq in essentially the same \nmanner now for close to 4 years. Over that time, conditions on the \nground have grown progressively worse. It is clearly time that we \nchange our approach.\n  Last year, the minority in Congress called for such a change. In \nresponse, the American people, the voters of this country, made that \nminority in Congress last year a majority this year. That majority--\nthis majority--has a responsibility to the people who elected us and \nwho pay our keep to follow through and demand change from the \nPresident, from the executive branch.\n  The changes that we seek are not sudden nor are they rash. They \nreflect the sober assessments and the unanimous recommendations of the \nbipartisan Iraq Study Group, cochaired last year ably by Jim Baker, a \nprominent Republican, and former Representative Lee Hamilton, a highly \nregarded Democrat who also served as Vice Chair of the 9/11 Commission.\n  The Iraq Study Group said we need to make it clear to the leaders of \nthe various factions in Iraq that we are not going to be there forever. \nThat is the first message we are sending with this legislation.\n  The President, and some around him, equate this with surrender. But \nhis own Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, said otherwise last \nweek. He said the fact that Congress is beginning to send this message \nto the leadership in Iraq is having a beneficial effect on the ground \nin Iraq. His words, not mine.\n  Last year the Iraq Study Group said a political settlement between \nthe factions in Iraq is needed to quell the sectarian violence. The \nlegislation Congress will send to the President today or tomorrow \nestablishes benchmarks by which Congress and the American people can \nmeasure the progress of the administration and the leadership in Iraq \ntoward achieving this political settlement.\n  The Iraq Study Group said that a diplomatic settlement is needed \namong Iraq's neighbors to ensure regional stability. The legislation \nCongress will send to the President this week creates a window of \nopportunity, while our forces are transitioned to a new mission for a \nregional diplomatic offensive aimed at containing Iraq's sectarian \nviolence and preventing a broader regional conflict.\n  The President does not want to change the mission in Iraq. I believe \nhe wants to do more of the same. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group \nrejected that approach, the American people have rejected that \napproach, and now the Congress of the United States is rejecting that \napproach.\n  For all who wonder what this debate is really about, it comes down to \ntwo points--one a point of agreement, the other a point of \ndisagreement.\n  On one point, the Congress and the President do agree that we should \nsupport the troops. The way to support the troops is for Congress to \npass this bill and I believe for the President to sign it. The funding \nis all there.\n  On one point, Congress and the President disagree. Congress wants to \nbegin to change the mission in Iraq. Unfortunately, the President \napparently wants to do more of the same. We disagree on the second \npoint of whether the time has come for a change. The question is whose \nview should ultimately prevail. The answer is the will of the American \npeople should prevail. They are the ones paying for this war, not only \nwith their dollars, they are paying for it by sending their sons and \ndaughters to fight, in some cases to be wounded, in some cases to die \nin this war. As they told us loudly and clearly at the ballot box last \nfall, the American people want a change. Provide our troops with the \nsupport they deserve and provide the American people with the change \nthey demand.\n  I realize the conventional wisdom around here is the President will \nveto this bill, he will send it back to us, and then we will all get \nserious about hammering something out that can become law.\n  With all due respect, Mr. President, this legislation should become \nlaw. I urge you to drop your veto threat, pick up your pen, and sign \nit.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the shootings last week at Virginia Tech\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\ntouched every American, indeed people around the world. Those who were \nmost deeply affected, of course, were the family and friends of the \nvictims, the students who were injured, the entire Virginia Tech \ncommunity. Our hearts go out to them as we read each day in the papers \nacross this country about young lives ended too soon. We mourn with the \nfamilies and their friends and students at Virginia Tech. But the \nripples of pain of this terrible incident reach far beyond Blacksburg, \nVA.\n  Among the others who care are the people of the Republic of South \nKorea, Korean Americans and Korean immigrants in our Nation. In Seoul, \nSouth Korea, more than 1,000 people gathered last week to sing hymns \nand pray for the victims. Closer to home in Chicago, in my State of \nIllinois, leaders of the Korean-American community held a candlelight \nvigil last Thursday at the headquarters of the Korean-American \nAssociation to express their condolences to the families of those who \ndied. These vigils were everywhere--from Illinois to California to \nKorea. Around the world, sympathy and compassion was felt for the \nvictims, their families, and Virginia Tech and its community.\n  In addition, a coalition of Korean-American organizations has joined \ntogether to form a foundation to assist the families and the Virginia \nTech community in this time of healing. The Korean American Coalition, \nthe Korean American League for Civic Action, the Korean American \nStudents Conference, the Mirae Foundation, the Southern California \nKorean College Student Association, the Korean Academy for Educators, \nthe Network of Korean American Leaders, and others have joined to \ncreate the Virginia Tech Memorial Fund to support those who have been \naffected by the recent tragedy. This is another example of the amazing \ncompassion communities throughout our Nation and the world feel for \nthese victims.\n  Sadly, some members of the Korean community have also shared feelings \nof guilt that they are somehow responsible simply because the Virginia \nTech gunman, Seung Hui Cho, was Korean. Last week, South Korea's \nAmbassador to the United States, Lee Tae Sik, spoke at a candlelight \nvigil in Fairfax County, VA. Through tears, Ambassador Lee said that \nthe Korean-American community needed to repent. He even went so far as \nto suggest that a fast by individuals in his community, 1 day for each \nof the victims of the Virginia Tech gunman, would prove that Koreans \nwere ``a worthwhile ethnic minority in America.''\n  But Korean Americans do not need to apologize for the tragedy at \nVirginia Tech. To those members of the Korean-American community who \nhave been so pained by this terrible tragedy, I repeat what one young \nwoman said in the Washington Post Special Edition last week. She said:\n\n       The actions of Seung Hui Cho are no more the fault of \n     Korean Americans than the actions of the Washington area \n     snipers were the fault of African Americans.\n\n  I agree with what she said. The actions of this 23-year-old young man \nis no more the fault of Korean Americans than the fault of every 23-\nyear-old young man in our Nation. When will we move away from racial \ntensions that sometimes threaten to break apart our national community? \nWe are all part of a greater community that feels tremendous sorrow and \ngrief, as Americans and as human beings, no matter what our nationality \nmay be.\n  If there are any glimmers of hope to come out of these horrible \nevents at Virginia Tech, they are, first of all, the great courage, \nfaith, and compassion demonstrated by these Hokies and the extended \nVirginia Tech family.\n  One other glimmer of hope is the fear many Korean Americans and \nKorean immigrants have expressed of being persecuted and blamed are not \nbeing realized. Rather than blaming a group of people, Americans of all \nethnic backgrounds are showing a deeper understanding of what it means \nto be one community to mourn together, to work together so that this \nmay never happen again.\n  One man was responsible for the tragedy at Virginia Tech, but we all \nshare responsibility to do what we can to prevent such a horrific loss \nfrom ever occurring again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5171-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5171-S5173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in April, students all across the Nation \nwill make final decisions about where they want to go to college, and \nwith college costs higher than ever, they are figuring out how they are \ngoing to pay for school. For most, the financial aid office at their \nchosen school is their only guide through the complex world of higher \neducation funding.\n  Students are making financial decisions and choosing their colleges. \nThey are making decisions, though, that will affect them for 20 or 30 \nyears after they graduate. They are making these decisions based on \nwhat they believe to be impartial advice from their future school's \nfinancial aid officers. Unfortunately, we have learned over the last \nfew weeks, the advice given to many may not have always been passed on \nwith the student's best interest in mind.\n  Where is the student loan industry today? Here is where we are: \nStudent loans are an $85 billion industry. Lenders have been clamoring \nto be placed on schools' preferred lenders' list. Financial aid \nofficers of prominent schools have been placed on leave over \nallegations of holding significant financial interest in the parent \ncompany of a lender they have been recommending to students.\n  A top official at the Department of Education's Federal student aid \noffice has been placed on leave after it was disclosed that he held a \nsignificant amount of stock in a parent company of a lender.\n  Let's go back in history for a moment to 1965, the year that Congress \nbegan guaranteeing loans to needy students and paying the interest \nwhile the student was in school. To entice the financial industry to \nloan money to students without a credit history, lenders were given a \nhelping hand from the Government. Congress created the Federal family \neducation loan program, the FFEL program, which subsidizes lenders and \nguarantees them against default. Congress also chartered the \nGovernment-sponsored entity then known as the Student Loan Marketing \nAssociation, euphemistically called Sallie Mae, to create a secondary \nmarket for lenders participating in the loan program. Sallie Mae would \npurchase loans from the lenders, thereby providing liquidity so that \nthe FFEL lenders could continue loaning money to each new class of \nstudents.\n  Now fast-forward to 1994 when the Direct Loan Program went into \neffect and the Federal Government began loaning money directly to \nstudents. The General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, even President Bush found that the Direct Loan Program cost the \nFederal Government a lot less than the FFEL program. Using the \nPresident's numbers, for every $100 private lenders loaned to students \nin 2006, it cost the Federal Government $13.81 for the FFEL Government \nloans, while the same amount borrowed through the Direct Loan Program \ncost the Federal Government only $3.85--$13.81 for the private lenders, \n$3.85 per $100 for the direct loans.\n  For a few years, the Direct Loan Program grew quickly, capturing one-\nthird of the student loan market. My predecessor in office, Senator \nPaul Simon of Illinois, was one of its strongest advocates. However, \nthe private lenders weren't going to go down without a fight. They were \nmaking too much money on these students. They didn't want to lose this \nopportunity. They wanted this market to be there for years to come. \nCollege costs were on the rise, students needed to borrow more and more \nmoney, and private lenders saw potential profits in student debt. So \nthey began to offer money to schools to pull out of the Direct Loan \nProgram.\n  Even though the program cost the Federal Government less money, these \nprivate lenders went to the universities and said, well, why don't you \njust use our private lending operation. Don't go the direct loan route. \nOf course, they had a profit motive in doing that. They sued to prevent \nthe Direct Loan Program from becoming more competitive. Their efforts \npaid off. The direct loan market is now down to less than a quarter of \nthe student loan market. It is shrinking.\n  It is about this time that Sallie Mae, led by a man named Albert \nLord, decided to become independent of the Federal Government so it \ncould offer student loans, not just purchase loans on the secondary \nmarket. It successfully shed its GSE status in 1997 and\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nnow is one of the most dominant players in the student loan market in \nAmerica. Its shareholders and executives have benefitted handsomely.\n  Let me show what has happened to the stock price of Sallie Mae, SLM \nif you are looking for a way to look it up on the Internet. Stock \nprices from 2001 to the present have appreciated 281 percent. This is \nthe industry loaning money to our students around America. Doing quite \nwell. Company revenues went from $3.5 billion in 2001 to $8.75 billion \nin 2006.\n  One would like to think these Federal subsidies would at least make \ncollege more affordable if we are putting this much money into this \nprivate corporation that is loaning money to students. Let's see what \nhappened to college costs. Tuition, fees, and room and board at 4-year \npublic schools have followed a similar trajectory, increasing by 42 \npercent since the year 2001.\n  The remarks I am going to make today have a lot to do with the people \nwho are loaning money to students across America, how profitable it has \nbecome, how well they have done, and how poorly the students are doing. \nThe debt is being heaped on them. They end up graduating from college, \nif they are lucky, with a debt as big as the mortgages most of us faced \nwhen we bought our first home. Now we say to these students: \nCongratulations, here is your diploma and your book to pay back your \nloan. Good luck in America.\n  I don't want to absolve the colleges and universities from this \nconversation. The fact is, they have been a party to the dramatic \nincrease in the cost of higher education during this same period of \ntime. We will save that topic, as important as it is, largely for \nanother day.\n  Speaking to the student loan industry, with higher government \nsubsidies and higher college costs, something is wrong with this \npicture. Remember Mr. Albert Lord I mentioned earlier, the former CEO \nand now chairman of the company called Sallie Mae? Mr. Lord has done \npretty well loaning money to students across America, so well that he \nrecently got into a little controversy in the Washington area. He \nproposed the construction of a golf course, and people in Anne Arundel \nCounty didn't like the idea much. They didn't want the traffic that \nmight be associated with the golf course, so they started complaining. \nMr. Lord, however, disabused them of the notion that this would cause \ntraffic congestion when he told them that the 244 acres he was setting \naside for the golf course was for his own personal and private golf \ncourse.\n  Doing quite well, isn't he, at the expense of students across \nAmerica? He had enough personal wealth to lead a serious but \nunsuccessful bid to purchase the Washington Nationals baseball team. In \n2002, Mr. Lord, appropriately named, was ranked first in the Washington \nPost's executive compensation survey of local companies, and Sallie \nMae's current CEO, Thomas Fitzpatrick, was ranked second. What a \nterrific business it is loaning money to students struggling to get \ntheir education.\n  In 2004, Mr. Lord was ranked second on the list, with $41.8 million \nin total compensation. Not a bad year. Yes, Sallie Mae's executives \nhave come quite far from the days when they worked as a quasi-\ngovernmental operation. Sallie Mae's dramatic financial growth didn't \nhappen without some financial help. Since the start of the Bush \nadministration, Federal officials have turned a blind eye to problems \nsurrounding private lenders. And why wouldn't they? The Bush \nadministration rewarded loan industry officials with key positions in \nthe Department of Education.\n  There isn't anything inherently wrong having people with experience \nin the loan industry working in the Department of Education. What I am \nasking, though, is whether the cozy relationship that developed between \nthe Bush administration, the Republican-led Congress, and the lenders \nhave left the loan industry essentially unregulated.\n\n  If I was a lender who heard Representative Boehner, former chairman \nof the House Education Committee, say to the loan industry, ``know that \nI have all of you in my two trusted hands,'' what do you think I would \ndo? Exactly what the lending industry has done--do whatever it takes to \npush the student loan industry in my favor--especially at a time when I \nknew no one would be there to stop me.\n  This is when revenue-sharing arrangements between colleges and \nlenders began. Sallie Mae led the way with one of the most offensive \nschemes called ``opportunity pools.'' Here is how it works. A lender \nprovides a school with a fixed amount of private loan money the school \ncan lend a student who otherwise wouldn't qualify for loans. These \nloans come at higher interest rates. In return, the college agrees to \nmake the lender its exclusive provider of federally backed loans.\n  Some of Sallie Mae's competitors complained to the inspector general; \nhowever, Department officials chose not to take any action, insisting \nthat the loan industry could regulate itself. What do you think Sallie \nMae's competitors did with this tacit approval of opportunity pools? \nThey did what any business would do to compete--they began offering \nsimilar deals to schools.\n  But they didn't stop at opportunity pools. Lenders have loaned \nfinancial aid offices staff and have operated call centers on behalf of \nschools. Students and their families seeking information and advice on \ntuition financing options are talking to individuals they believe to be \nschool officials but are actually employees of the lenders. Lenders \nhave long provided schools with little office trinkets, such as post-it \npads and pens. No harm done. However, in recent years the little \ntrinkets have turned into gifts, such as iPods and trips to exotic \nlocations for so-called educational conferences.\n  Let me give you one example. Last year, EduCap, a nonprofit lender \nwho offers loans under the name, Loan to Learn, invited financial aid \nofficers and their spouses or guests from all across the Nation to an \neducational, all-expense paid ``summit'' held at the luxurious, \nbeachfront Four Seasons Resort in Nevis in the West Indies.\n  This resort, by the way, has been rated as one of the top luxury \nresorts by Travel and Leisure magazine.\n  Between symposiums, forums, and roundtable discussions on the \nimportance of addressing the cost of higher education, guests could \nenjoy snorkeling, water and beach sports, sailing, kayaking, \nvolleyball, sailboarding, access to an 18-hole championship golf \ncourse, a 10-court tennis complex, beachfront pools, and a luxury spa. \nNot a bad deal for college officials being entertained by the student \nloan industry. News of the trip generated such negative response from \nthe public that EduCap had to cancel it, unfortunately, before it \noccurred.\n  After reading about the West Indies trip, I asked the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Education to investigate whether lenders \nare offering kickbacks or inducements to school officials in return for \nloan business. My staff passed along information provided to us by \nconstituents regarding these inducements. You can imagine my \ndisappointment when a member of my staff received an e-mail response \nfrom the inspector general's office. The e-mail merely described the \nresults of the inspector general's conversations with my constituents. \nMy staff didn't think the e-mail could possibly be the inspector \ngeneral's official response and followed up to confirm. Even with all \nthe recent news stories, I am still waiting to hear from the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Education as to whether they are going to \ninitiate an investigation into these lender inducements.\n  Sallie Mae recently agreed to be bought out and turned into a private \ncompany. Is this a good deal? Is it good for taxpayers that subsidize \nstudent loans? Is it good for students? It certainly is a good deal for \nSallie Mae's executives and shareholders.\n  The buyers, two private investment funds, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank \nof America, have agreed to pay $25 billion for this company at $60 a \nshare for its stock. In case you are wondering how much that is over \nthe stock price that is published, it is 50 percent, a 50-percent \npremium over Sallie Mae's share prices before news of the buyout was \nreported. Let's see how much Mr. Lord and Mr. Fitzpatrick are going to \ndo if this deal goes through.\n  Well, it looks like Mr. Lord is going to end up with $47.2 million, \nand Mr. Fitzpatrick, a little better, with $58.6 million. They are \nriding high. They are riding high at the expense of students all across \nthis country.\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\n  There was a time when this Congress cared enough about students in \nthis country to create a program called the National Defense Education \nAct. It was a time when Sputnik had been launched. We were afraid of \nthe Soviet Union and what it might do with its satellite capacity, and \nCongress, for the first time, said let's create a student loan program, \nthe first time ever.\n  I know a little about this program because I happened to be one of \nthe recipients, one of the borrowers. I borrowed money to go to college \nand law school from the National Defense Education Act and paid it back \nafter graduation at 3 percent interest. I couldn't have asked for \nbetter treatment and better consideration from those who were lending \nmoney.\n  Those were the early days when we were just thinking about students \nand education and the future of America. Now we are talking about big \nbusiness, fat profits, basically indefensible compensation for the CEOs \nwho run these companies. I hope someone is able to uncover what other \nfees and payments Sallie Mae's executives may be receiving to help take \nthe company private.\n  Will this deal be good for students? Sure, Sallie Mae and many other \nlenders have long touted that they have been able to offer better deals \nfor students through loan fee and interest rate discounts. Of course, \nthey can offer a discount. They are obviously still making enough money \noff student loans. Look at their profitability. Look at what has \nhappened to their stock price. Look at how much they are being paid. \nYet they made sure the Direct Loan Program, cheaper for the Federal \nGovernment, better for the students, could not compete.\n  Now we know why they have been able to make money off students. The \nWashington Post recently reported that some lending companies with \naccess to the National Student Loan Data System, which includes \nconfidential information on 60 million student loan borrowers, have \nrepeatedly searched the database in ways that violate the Federal rules \non privacy. It appears the lenders were giving unauthorized users, such \nas marketing firms, collection agencies, and loan brokerage firms, \naccess to this database.\n\n  Lenders are allowed to access information contained in the database \nonly if they have the permission of the student or have a financial \nrelationship with the student, but the Department of Education recently \ndecided to cut off outside access to the database. Were lenders using \nthis information gathered from the database to sell other nonrelated \nloan products to students? We don't know for sure, but I intend to find \nout. I have sent letters to the largest student loan companies asking \nthem to reveal how many times they have accessed the database in the \nlast 4 years and explain what they subsequently did with the \ninformation.\n  I am concerned about the proposed sale of Sallie Mae. A private \nSallie Mae could lead to even less information being disclosed to the \npublic. Sure, lenders are required to provide certain information in \norder to participate in the Federal loan program, but we should make \nsure all lenders are held to the same standard of disclosure, \nregardless of whether the lender is a school or a nonprofit, a private \nor a publicly traded company.\n  Let me conclude by saying that tuition at 4-year public institutions \nhas risen by 42 percent in the last 5 years. Students and their \nfamilies are struggling to pay off college debt. Students are leaving \ncollege, on average, with nearly $20,000 in debt, and many much more. \nWe must take serious steps to help these students achieve the American \nDream.\n  On the Democratic side of the aisle we are proposing a $1,090 \nincrease in the maximum Pell grant over 5 years, a cap on loan \nrepayments at 15 percent of an individual's income, and reducing the \nstudent loan interest rate. How will we pay for it? By cutting $22.3 \nbillion from the lenders' subsidies, which we give to those like Sallie \nMae. Sure, it is more than President Bush's proposed cut, but only a \nlittle bit, $2.3 billion. Of course, lenders are claiming that the \nproposed cut goes beyond what they think is sustainable and that \nlenders will decide to leave the student loan business. It is difficult \nto be moved by these claims when a company like Sallie Mae is worth $25 \nbillion and its buyers are willing to pay a 50-percent premium, knowing \nthat the lenders' subsidies will likely be cut.\n  It is time we return to the day where the Federal Government makes a \nserious investment in one of its most valuable assets, its children. \nThe future of our country depends on it. We need to be asking those who \nare involved in this business of student loans to keep in mind first \nthese students and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5173-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE RETIREMENT OF JOHN C.

Mr. President. I want to explain why I missed two \nvotes early during yesterday's session, Senator DeMint's amendment No. \n930 and Senator Coburn's amendment No. 918 on S. 761, America COMPETES \nAct, a bill that I cosponsored. I was confident that my vote would not \nchange the outcome, and the DeMint amendment failed by a vote of 22 to \n79 and the Coburn amendment failed by a vote of 27 to 67. If I had been \nable to come to the floor, I would have voted against both amendments, \nbut the outcome would have been the same.\n  The reason I missed the votes was that I was attending a very special \nhearing in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on mental health \nissues for our returning soldiers. The first panel included a recent \nIraq veteran with PTSD, parents of an Iraq veteran who committed \nsuicide after returning home, and parents of an Iraq veteran soldier \nwho died of an overdose of his own prescription drugs while in VA care. \nOne of the families had come from Iowa and the other from California to \ntalk about the tragedy of each son's death and to seek ways to ensure \nthat other families might avoid such tragedies. The Iraq veteran, a \ncombat medic, spoke eloquently on his own problems acknowledging and \ntreating his PTSD and the similar problems of fellow soldiers in his \nplatoon.\n  One father testified that after his son died of an overdose in VA \ncare, he and his wife went to claim his son's personal effects, and the \nitems were handed to them in a plastic garbage bag. I was shocked and \noutraged. I knew that it would seem heartless to cut their panel short \nand not let these parents and this veteran share their full story so I \nvolunteered to stay and listen so that the full story could be given in \ncommittee. These families already feel that parts of our Government do \nnot care, and that is sad. I needed to stay to chair the hearing and \nlet these courageous witnesses continue their testimony.\n  I am very glad I did. Despite the tragedy and grief these individuals \nface, they are speaking out boldly in hopes of changing the current \nsystem so other veterans and other families do\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nnot face the same ordeals they have faced. These are stories that must \nbe told and, more importantly, must be heard in public by those who can \nand must make changes. These witnesses had good ideas and suggestions \non how to change the delivery system for the mental health care of our \nreturning veterans. They spoke passionately about how soldiers are \ntrained to serve bravely and not show weaknesses. I could not walk away \nfrom this important hearing about issues crucial to our combat veterans \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I am very grateful to veteran Patrick Campbell, Mr. and Mrs. Randall \nOmvig, and Mr. Tony Bailey for their compelling personal testimonies. I \nam committed to push hard for action to change the VA system for future \nveterans and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5174-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On January 5, 2006, in Fairfax County, VA, Leslie Carver was charged \nwith murder for killing Marvin Greenwell. Greenwell was one of nine gay \nmen murdered in what was known as the ``pickup murders'' of 1993 and \n1994. The ``pickup murders'' were a series of attacks against gay men \nin the Washington, DC area. While most of these murders remain \nunsolved, DNA evidence was able to link Carver to the Greenwell murder.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5174-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5174-S5175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I firmly believe that the death penalty \nshould be abolished, at all levels of government. Just a few months \nago, I introduced the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2007 \ntoward that end. The bill would abolish the death penalty at the \nFederal level; it would put an immediate halt to executions and forbid \nthe imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of \nFederal law.\n  I first introduced my bill in 1999, and since then only a few Members \nof the Senate have been willing to join me in this cause. Not too long \nago, some believed that opposition to or criticism of the death penalty \nwas politically dangerous. But times have changed. The American people \nare expressing greater and greater concerns about the death penalty. A \nMay 2006 Gallup poll reported that for the first time, when given a \nchoice between the two sentencing options, more Americans choose the \nsentence of life without parole than the death penalty. The American \npublic understands that the death penalty raises serious and complex \nproblems.\n  Leaders across the country are publicly expressing their opposition \nto the death penalty--leaders such as Governor Corzine of New Jersey, \nGovernor O'Malley of Maryland, and Governor Kaine of Virginia. State \nlegislatures in Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, and New Mexico have all \ngiven serious consideration to abolition bills in the past 3 months \nalone. In fact, each of these four measures failed to move to the next \nstep of the process by only one vote. In Maryland, an abolition bill \nfailed to pass out of a Senate committee by one vote. In Montana, a \nbill to repeal the State's death penalty passed the senate and then \nfailed by just one vote to move out of a house committee. In Nebraska, \nthe unicameral legislature failed to move an abolition bill forward by \njust one vote. And in New Mexico, an abolition bill passed the house \nand then lost in a senate committee by just one vote.\n  Other States have taken important steps. Pennsylvania recently \ncreated a commission to study the administration of the State's death \npenalty, joining many other States that have already done so. \nMoratoriums on executions remain in place in Illinois and New Jersey \nand are under consideration in other States. New York's death penalty \nwas overturned by a court decision in 2004 and has not been reinstated \nby the legislature. Along with New York, four other States that still \nhave the death penalty technically on their books have not executed any \nindividuals since 1976. In addition, there are 12 States, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, whose laws do not provide for capital punishment \nat all. And in 11 more States, executions have been halted while the \ncourts grapple with the issue of whether the lethal injection process \nused by these States is unconstitutional.\n  At the same time, the number of executions, the number of death \nsentences imposed, and the size of the death row population have \ndecreased for the second year in a row. In the prosecutors' offices, \njury boxes, and legislative chambers, it seems that consensus is \ngrowing that it is time for a change.\n  In this connection, I think it is significant that the editorial \nboards for two major newspapers in very geographically diverse \nlocations, Chicago and Dallas, recently called for an end to the death \npenalty. The Chicago Tribune's editorial page has been a leader for \nyears in calling for reforms to the capital punishment system, yet it \nhas never called for abolition--until now. Explaining its decision to \nrenounce the death penalty, the editorial board stated, ``The system is \narbitrary, and the system just plain gets it wrong.'' And the Dallas \nMorning News reversed its century-old stance on the death penalty, \nwhich is particularly notable because Texas has long been a bedrock of \nsupport for the death penalty and is the State with the dubious \ndistinction of leading the Nation in executions. Even in a jurisdiction \nwhere support for the death penalty runs deep--even there--this strong \nvoice of dissent rose to proclaim, ``we do not believe that any legal \nsystem devised by inherently flawed human beings can determine with \nmoral certainty the guilt of every defendant convicted of murder.''\n  For these editorial boards, opposition to the death penalty sprang \nfrom concerns that mistakes might be made and innocent individuals \nexecuted. Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the \nSupreme Court, there have been 1,060 executions across the country, \nincluding three at the Federal level. During that same time period, 123 \npeople on death row have been exonerated and released from death row. \nThese people never should have been convicted in the first place.\n  Consider those numbers. One thousand and sixty executions and one \nhundred and twenty-three exonerations in the modern death penalty era. \nHad those exonerations not taken place, had those 123 people been \nexecuted, those executions would have represented an error rate of \ngreater than 10 percent. That is more than an embarrassing statistic; \nit is a horrifying one, one that should have us all questioning the use \nof capital punishment in this country. In fact, since 1999 when I first \nintroduced the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act, 46 death row \ninmates have been exonerated throughout the country.\n  The continued use of the death penalty in the United States is \nbeneath us. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It \nis wrong and it is immoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a \nright'' applies here in the most fundamental way. Our Nation has long \nago done away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting \noff the ears of criminals. Just as we did away with these punishments \nas contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death \npenalty. It is not just a matter of morality. The continued viability \nof our criminal justice system as a truly just system that deserves the \nrespect of our own people requires that we do so, as does our Nation's \ncommitment to freedom, liberty, and equality.\n  I applaud those leaders, be they in State government or in the media, \nwho are stepping forward to challenge a practice that has no place in \nthis day and age. Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy \ntask. It will take patience, persistence, and courage. As each new \nvoice joins us, we become\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\nstronger, and together we will one day find success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5175-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5175-S5176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING SMALL BUSINESSES WITH TARGETED TAX RELIEF AND REGULATORY \n                                 REFORM\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate ``National \nSmall Business Week, which President Bush designated for April 22-28, \n2007. As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I simply cannot understate the vital role of small \nbusiness in our Nation's economy. There was a time when ``what was good \nfor General Motors was good for America.'' But the fact is what's truly \ngood for this country--what built it, what sustains it, what drives it, \nand what represents its core--are the small businesses that each and \nevery year create nearly three-quarters of all net new jobs. In my home \nState of Maine, small businesses comprise 97.5 percent of all \nbusinesses.\n  First, I would like to discuss the unfair and onerous tax and \nregulatory burdens that continue to impede the ability of our Nation's \nsmall businesses to compete in an ever-increasing global marketplace. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, \nsmall businesses spend an astounding 8 billion hours each year \ncomplying with government rules and regulations. Eighty percent of this \ntime is spent on completing tax forms. Furthermore, businesses \nemploying fewer than 20 employees spend nearly $1,304 per employee in \ntax compliance costs, nearly 67 percent more than the comparable cost \nto larger firms. Despite the fact that small businesses are the primary \njob-creators for our economy, the tax system is not working because \nsmall companies spend their money and time satisfying their tax \nobligations.\n  For that reason, I have introduced a package of proposals that will \nprovide not only targeted, affordable tax relief to small business \nowners, but also simpler rules under the tax code. By simplifying the \nTax Code, small business owners will be able to satisfy their tax \nobligation in a cheaper, more efficient manner, allowing them to be \nable to devote more time and resources to their business.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 269, in response to the repeated \nrequests from small businesses in Maine and from across the Nation to \nallow them to expense more of their investments, like the purchase of \nessential new equipment. My bill modifies the Internal Revenue Code by \ndoubling the amount a small business can expense from $100,000 to \n$200,000, and make the provision permanent as President Bush proposed \nthis change in his fiscal year 2007 tax proposals. With small \nbusinesses representing 99 percent of all employers, creating 75 \npercent of net new jobs and contributing 51 percent of private-sector \noutput, their size is the only ``small'' aspect about them.\n  By doubling and making permanent the current expensing limit and \nindexing these amounts for inflation, this bill will achieve two \nimportant objectives. First, qualifying businesses will be able to \nwrite off more of the equipment purchases today, instead of waiting 5, \n7, or more years to recover their costs through depreciation. That \nrepresents substantial savings both in dollars and in the time small \nbusinesses would otherwise have to spend complying with complex and \nconfusing depreciation rules. Moreover, new equipment will contribute \nto continued productivity growth in the business community, which \neconomic experts have repeatedly stressed is essential to the long-term \nvitality of our economy.\n  Second, as a result of this bill, more businesses will qualify for \nthis benefit because the phase-out limit will be increased to $800,000 \nin new assets purchases. At the same time, small business capital \ninvestment will be pumping more money into the economy. This is a win-\nwin for small business and the economy as a whole and I am please to \nhave Senators Lott, Isakson, Chambliss, and Collins join me as \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  Another proposal that I have introduced, with Senators Lincoln and \nLott, the Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2007, S. 270, will \npermit start-up small business owners to use a taxable year other than \nthe calendar year if they generally earn fewer than $5 million during \nthe tax year. Specifically, the Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of \n2007 will permit more taxpayers to use the taxable year most suitable \nto their business cycle. Until 1986, businesses could elect the taxable \nyear-end that made the most economic sense for the business. In 1986, \nCongress passed legislation requiring partnerships and S corporations, \nmany of which are small businesses, to adopt a December 31 year-end for \ntax purposes. The Tax Code does provide alternatives to the calendar \nyear for small businesses, but the compliance costs and administrative \nburdens associated with these alternatives prove to be too high for \nmost small businesses to utilize.\n  Meanwhile, C corporations, as large corporations often are, receive \nmuch more flexibility in their choice of taxable year. A so-called C \ncorporation can adopt either a calendar year or any fiscal year for tax \npurposes, as along as it keeps its books on that basis. This creates \nthe unfair result of allowing larger businesses with greater resources \ngreater flexibility in choosing a taxable year than smaller firms with \nfewer resources. This simply does not make sense to me. My bill changes \nthese existing rules so that more small businesses will be able to use \nthe taxable year that best suits their business.\n  To provide relief and equity to our nation's 1.5 million retail \nestablishments, most of which have less than five employees, I have \nintroduced a bill, S. 271, with Senators Lincoln, Hutchison, and Kerry, \nthat reduces from 39 to 15 years the depreciable life of improvements \nthat are made to retail stores that are owned by the retailer. Under \ncurrent law, only retailers that lease their property are allowed this \naccelerated depreciation, which means it excludes retailers that also \nown the property in which they operate. My bill simply seeks to provide \nequal treatment to all retailers.\n  Specifically, this bill will simply conform the tax codes to the \nrealities that retailers on Main Street face. Studies conducted by the \nTreasury Department, Congressional Research Service and private \neconomists have all found that the 39-year depreciation life for \nbuildings is too long and that the 39-year depreciation life for \nbuilding improvements is even worse. Retailers generally remodel their \nstores every five to seven years to reflect changes in customer base \nand compete with newer stores. Moreover, many improvements such as \ninterior partitions, ceiling tiles, restroom accessories, and paint, \nmay only last a few years before requiring replacement.\n\n  Finally, I joined Senator Bond in introducing S. 296 that will \nsimplify the tax code by permitting small business owners to use the \ncash method of accounting for reporting their income if they generally \nearn fewer than $10 million during the tax year. Currently, only those \ntaxpayers that earn less than $5 million per year are able to use the \ncash method. By increasing this threshold to $10 million, more small \nbusinesses will be relieved of the burdensome record keeping \nrequirements that they currently must undertake in reporting their \nincome under a different accounting method.\n  Earlier this year, I was very pleased when the Senate passed small \nbusiness tax relief that included portions of my proposals on small \nbusiness expensing, cash method accounting, and accelerated \ndepreciation for improvements to retail-owned property. Sadly, I must \nreport that on the very same week of ``National Small Business Week,'' \ncash method accounting and my proposal to bring depreciation equity for \nretailer-owned property were stripped from the small business tax \nrelief package in conference negotiations between the House and Senate. \nThis is extremely unfortunate especially when one considers that the \nSenate-passed package, which was fully offset, was both modest and \nfiscally responsible. In the coming months, I will continue to fight \nfor these proposals and am hopeful that Congress will enact them into \nlaw.\n  This package of proposals are a tremendous opportunity to help small \nenterprises succeed by providing an incentive for reinvestment and \nleaving them more of their earnings to do just that. Notably, providing \ntax relief by passing these simplification measures will also help us \nreduce the tax gap by increasing compliance. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting these proposals.\n  In addition to reforming the tax code, we in Congress should level \nthe\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\nregulatory playing field for small businesses. Over the past 20 years, \nthe number and complexity of Federal regulations have multiplied at an \nalarming rate. For example, in 2004, the Federal Register contained \n75,675 pages, an all-time record, and 4,101 rules. These rules and \nregulations impose a much more significant impact on small businesses \nthan larger businesses.\n  To illustrate this conclusion, a recent report prepared for the SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy that said that in 2004, the per-employee cost of \nFederal regulations for firms with fewer than 20 employees was $7,647. \nIn contrast, the per-employee cost of federal regulations for firms \nwith 500 or more workers was $5,282, which results in a 44 percent \nincrease in burden for smaller businesses compared to their larger \ncounterparts. Clearly, we must find ways to ease the regulatory burden \nfor our nation's small businesses so that they may continue to create \njobs and drive economic growth. All too often, small businesses do not \nmaintain the staff, or possess the financial resources to comply with \ncomplex Federal rules and regulations. This puts them at a disadvantage \ncompared to larger businesses, and reduces the effectiveness of the \nagency's regulations. If an agency can not describe how to comply with \nits regulation, how can we expect a small business to figure it out?\n  This is why I have offered bipartisan legislation, the Small Business \nCompliance Assistance Enhancement Act, S. 246, with Senators Kerry, \nEnzi, and Landrieu, which would clarify small business requirements \nthat exist under Federal law. Our measure is drawn directly from \nrecommendations put forth by the Government Accountability Office and \nis intended only to clarify an already existing requirement under the \nSmall Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, which \nunanimously passed the Senate in 1996. Specifically, our bill clarifies \nwhen a small business compliance guide is required, how a guide shall \nbe designated, how and when a guide shall be published, and that the \nagency make the guide available on the Internet. It would not create \nany new rules or requirements. This commonsense, good government reform \nwould provide a major regulatory reform for small businesses at \nvirtually no cost to the Federal Government.\n  It is clear that in order to ensure our small businesses are able to \ngrow, thrive, and, most importantly, create jobs, we need to simplify \nthe tax code and reduce the regulatory burden. Over the coming months, \nI will continue to fight to accomplish these commonsense objectives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5176-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Saturday, April 28, is Workers Memorial Day. \nTomorrow, working men and women around the world will gather to \nremember their millions of brothers and sisters who have been injured \nor killed on the job. I join them in their grief-and in their \ndetermination to secure a safer future.\n  Work-related accidents kill Americans with a regularity that calls us \nto question the very word ``accident.'' Fifteen deaths every day, and \nmore than 11,000 injuries: They are grimly predictable and often \npreventable.\n  Today is for men like Eleazar Torres-Gomez, a laundry worker who was \ndragged by a conveyor belt into a 300-degree industrial dryer, where he \nburned to death. Sadness at his death is matched by an equal anger-\nespecially when we learn that, in the two years preceding it, his \nemployer was cited more than 170 times for unsafe, illegal working \nconditions. We remember Eleazar today.\n  Today is for the 12 miners killed last year in Sago, West Virginia, \nwhen an explosion trapped them underground for two days. Only a few \nyears before, the Mine Safety and Health Administration struck down 17 \nnew safety rules for trapped miners--rules that might have saved the \nminers in Sago. We remember them today.\n  Today is for the 28 union construction workers killed in Connecticut, \n20 years ago this month, when the apartment towers they were building \ncollapsed with a roar, within seconds, into ruined concrete and steel. \nIn the wake of their deaths, we outlawed the dangerous lift-slab \nconstruction method that led to the collapse. But we can never replace \nthose lives; today we remember them, too.\n  How can we honor them? I know this much: Words alone would be an \ninsult. The men and women we remember this Saturday risked their lives \nso we could lie down and wake up in health and safety and comfort, and \nmerely speaking our gratitude would be emptier than doing nothing. We \nowe them action.\n  We owe them action equal to the historic Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act (OSHA), which was passed 37 years ago tomorrow and has saved \nan estimated 350,000 lives. We need to cover more workers--because more \nthan 8.5 million are not protected by OSHA. We need more resources for \ninspection and enforcement--because, at the current rate, federal \ninspectors are only able to examine workplaces, on average, once every \n133 years. We need stiffer penalties for employers who knowingly put \ntheir workers' lives at risk--because employers like those who \ncompromised Mr. Torres-Gomez's life now face a maximum penalty of a \nsimple misdemeanor.\n  And we need the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to take \nits work more seriously--because, according to a New York Times report \nreleased this week, ``the agency has killed dozens of existing and \nproposed regulations and delayed adopting others.''\n  Taking these vital steps for workers adds up to more than increased \nresources or stronger oversight--ultimately, it translates to respect. \nWe owe their memories nothing less. Five thousand seven hundred workers \nwere killed on the job last year, and our economic prosperity is built \non their flesh and blood.\n  More than half a century ago, George Orwell remarked on the disregard \nthat so often greets manual labor: ``It keeps us alive, and we are \noblivious of its existence. . . . We are capable of forgetting it as we \nforget the blood in our veins.''\n  Today we pledge ourselves as the exception to that rule. And if we \nmean our words, we will be the exception tomorrow, and the day after \nthat. For America's working men and women deserve nothing less than our \neternal gratitude and diligence in preventing future workplace \ntragedies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5176-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5176-S5177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INTERNET GAMBLING\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to express concern that serious \nviolations of the law appear to be occurring and should be aggressively \npursued by the IRS and, in turn, prosecuted by the Department of \nJustice.\n  Specifically, numerous Internet gambling websites may be violating \nstatutes such as 26 U.S.C. 4401 et seq. Section 4401 requires an excise \ntax equal to 2 percent of the amount of unauthorized wagers. Section \n4404 makes clear that the tax applies to wagers ``placed by a person \nwho is in the United States with a person who is a citizen or resident \nof the United States.''\n  I applaud the indictment in United States v. BETonSPORTS.COM and the \ninclusion of tax evasion charges in counts 14, 15, and 16.\n  These counts charge that the defendants attempted to ``evade and \ndefeat the . . . wagering excise tax'' in three ways: (1) by failing to \nmake any wagering excise tax returns on or before the last day of the \nmonth following the month the wagers were accepted, as required by law, \nto any proper officer of the Internal Revenue Service, (2) by failing \nto pay to the Internal Revenue Service said wagering excise tax, and \n(3) by directing that the wagering funds be sent outside the United \nStates--all in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7201, \nand Title 18, United States Code, Section 2.\n  I firmly support the decision of the Department of Justice to enforce \nthe wagering excise tax and pursue any persons in violation.\n  Additionally, it is important to note that extremely large sums of \nmoney are at issue: count 14 charges that from January 29, 2001 to on \nor about February 3, 2002, the sum of approximately $1,094,669,000.00 \nin taxable wagers were had and received; count 15 charges that from \nFebruary 4, 2002 to on or about February 2, 2003, the sum of \napproximately $1,228,874,000.00 in taxable wagers were had and \nreceived; and count 16 charges that from February 3, 2003 to on or \nabout February 1, 2004, the sum\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nof approximately $1,235,374,000.00 in taxable wagers were had and \nreceived. That is over $3.5 billion in three years, and Internet \nbetting has increased significantly in the last two years.\n  I would like to point out that significant income taxes and excise \ntaxes appear to be owed by numerous persons. Collecting these amounts \nwould be an important component of the Administration's efforts to \naddress the ``tax gap.''\n  Further, with such large sums at issue, the IRS and the Department of \nJustice should see if money laundering is involved.\n  The State Department has expressed strong concern that Internet \ngambling operations could be used not only for tax evasion, but also \nfor other criminal activities such as money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing:\n\n       Internet gambling is particularly well-suited for the \n     laying and integration stages of money laundering, in which \n     launderers attempt to disguise the nature or ownership of the \n     proceeds by concealing or blending transactions within the \n     mass of apparently legitimate transactions. Due in large \n     measure to the volume and speed of transactions, as well as \n     the virtual anonymity offered by the Internet, offshore \n     gambling websites are an area of considerable money \n     laundering concern. The Internet gambling operations are, in \n     essence, the functional equivalent of wholly unregulated \n     offshore banks with the bettor accounts serving as bank \n     accounts for account holders who are, in the virtual world, \n     virtually anonymous. For these reasons, Internet gambling \n     operations are vulnerable to be used, not only for money \n     laundering, but also for criminal activities ranging from \n     terrorist financing to tax evasion. (State Department, \n     International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, released \n     March 2004.)\n\n  The Department of Justice has echoed these concerns. At a hearing \nbefore the Senate Banking Committee, John G. Malcolm, Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General, Criminal Division, testified:\n\n       Another major concern that the Department of Justice has \n     about on-line gambling is that Internet gambling businesses \n     provide criminals with an easy and excellent vehicle for \n     money laundering, due in large part to the volume, speed, and \n     international reach of Internet transactions and the offshore \n     locations of most Internet gambling sites, as well as the \n     fact that the industry itself is already cash-intensive.\n       It is a fact that money launderers have to go to financial \n     institutions either to conceal their illegal funds or recycle \n     those funds back into the economy for their use. Because \n     criminals are aware that banks have been subjected to greater \n     scrutiny and regulation, they have--not surprisingly--turned \n     to other non-bank financial institutions, such as casinos, to \n     launder their money. On-line casinos are a particularly \n     inviting target because, in addition to using the gambling \n     that casinos offer as a way to hide or transfer money, \n     casinos offer a broad array of financial services to their \n     customers, such as providing credit accounts, fund \n     transmittal services, check cashing services, and currency \n     exchange services.\n       Individuals wanting to launder ill-gotten gains through an \n     on-line casino can do so in a variety of ways. For example, a \n     customer could establish an account with a casino using \n     illegally-derived proceeds, conduct a minimal amount of \n     betting or engage in offsetting bets with an overseas \n     confederate, and then request repayment from the casino, \n     thereby providing a new ``source'' of the funds. If a gambler \n     wants to transfer money to an inside source in the casino, \n     who may be located in another country, he can just play until \n     he loses the requisite amount. Similarly, if an insider wants \n     to transfer money to the gambler, perhaps as payment for some \n     illicit activity, he can rig the game so the bettor wins.\n       The anonymous nature of the Internet and the use of \n     encryption make it difficult to trace the transactions. The \n     gambling business may also not maintain the transaction \n     records, in which case tracing may be impossible. While \n     regulators in the United States can visit physical casinos, \n     observe their operations, and examine their books and records \n     to ensure compliance with regulations, this is far more \n     difficult, if not impossible, with virtual casinos. (John G. \n     Malcolm, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal \n     Division, Department of Justice, March 18, 2003.)\n\n  Again, there should be strong enforcement efforts to ensure that \nInternet gambling entities are not violating the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5177-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA COMPETES ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Bingaman and Senator \nAlexander for the passage of America COMPETES, legislation which they \ncrafted carefully to enhance American innovation and competitiveness. I \nalso thank them for accepting three amendments which I offered, which \nwill help expand the range of innovative possibilities by which America \nfaces its competitive challenges.\n  Let me explain this. The president of the National Academy of \nEngineering once said that innovation is a profoundly creative process, \nand that like other creative processes, it depends on the life \nexperiences of the people involved. If we include a more diverse sample \nof our population, we will derive more varied and more innovative \ndesign options. We become more competitive by embracing our diversity, \nby involving a more representative cross-section of our populace in \nscience, technology, and engineering endeavors.\n  To increase participation, I have offered three amendments that have \nbeen accepted into America COMPETES. The first establishes a mentoring \nprogram to support women and underrepresented groups as they progress \nthrough science and technology education programs, increasing the \nlikelihood of their success. I also propose that groups representing \nwomen and minority scientists and engineers be involved as strategies \nare developed to increase America's competitiveness.\n  Also accepted was an amendment to increase the math and problem \nsolving skills of young learners, by providing summer learning \nopportunities for students in elementary grades. This amendment springs \nfrom legislation I introduced earlier, with Senator Mikulski, the STEP \nUP Act, S. 116. This legislation responds to evidence showing that \nstudents may lose several months equivalent of math skills during the \nsummer, if not provided learning opportunities when not in school. This \nis particularly important for children of poverty, for whom summer \nlearning losses are greatest. Summer programs combat this loss in \nknowledge and skills, and well-designed programs can fuel the curiosity \nof children, helping them become active problem solvers and learners \nwhen they return to school in the fall.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of these amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5177-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5177-S5180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \nplays a major role in ensuring that the American people have access to \nthe safe and effective medicines that they need. In fact, FDA-regulated \nproducts account for about 25 cents of every consumer dollar spent. At \nthe heart of all FDA's regulatory activities is a judgment about \nwhether a product's benefits to users will outweigh its risks. These \njudgments must be science-based to allow the agency to provide the most \nhealth promotion and protection at the least cost to the public. As we \nwork on FDA legislation this year, we need to keep that science-based \nmission at the forefront of our decision making.\n  Last week, the HELP Committee reported S. 1082, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Act, FDARA. The bill couples must-pass reauthorizations \nof the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, PDUFA, and the Medical Device \nUser Fee and Modernization Act, MDUFMA, with tour additional pieces of \nlegislation that I am unable to support at this time. It is my hope \nthat we can continue to work in a bipartisan way to improve this bill \nas it moves to the floor.\n  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, PDUFA, first enacted in 1992, \ngives the FDA the authority to collect user fees from pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers in order to enhance their ability to ensure timely access \nto safe and effective medicines. By reducing the length of review time \nrequired to approve a drug, PDUFA has clearly been a success.\n  Following the success of PDUFA, Congress enacted the Medical Device \nUser Fee and Modernization Act; MDUFMA in 2002. Like with prescription \ndrugs, MDUFMA funds have been essential to reducing the length of time \nof the approval process and other improvements critical to the success \nof the device review process.\n  This year, both the PDUFA and MDUFMA reauthorizations have been \nnegotiated between the FDA and industry and are worthy of support. In \nfact, I believe these agreements improve both programs and will improve \nthe safety of these products in the marketplace. If we do not renew \nthese programs by September 30, we risk losing this essential source of \nfunding and patients will face longer review times and\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\ndiminished access to much needed medicines and devices.\n  However, the Kennedy-Enzi language also includes provisions on drug \nsafety and pediatric medicines and devices. All are important issues, \nbut each title of the bill includes provisions that I believe could do \nmore harm than good.\n  Originally, drug safety legislation was intended to address \nlegitimate concerns many had about how long it took FDA to identify \nunexpected complications after a drug was approved and to provide FDA \nwith additional authorities to act in those instances.\n  The Kennedy-Enzi language attempts to address the length of time it \ncan take to identify problems by including language that directs the \nFDA to establish an active surveillance system. This is essential to \naddressing any potential problems with postmarket drug safety. I \nstrongly support this in concept but feel the language needs to be \nstrengthened to ensure that the FDA has the direction it needs to \nimplement a robust system in an expedited timeframe. Information \ncollected must be standardized, and the overall system should be \nvalidated. Without these and other important benchmarks included in my \nSafer DATA bill, we are essentially setting the FDA up for failure.\n\n  While not going far enough on drug surveillance, the bill goes too \nfar on providing FDA with new authorities. The Kennedy-Enzi language \nimposes new requirements on manufacturers to develop Risk Evaluation \nand Mitigation Strategies, REMS, and gives the FDA the authority to \nrequire them in both the preapproval and postmarket settings. \nImportantly, the standards by which FDA can impose REMS are very broad \nand lack specific requirements through which this standard is \ntriggered. This gives the FDA excessive discretion on imposing REMS on \nmanufacturers even when a drug has a low risk profile.\n  While clearly the FDA needs new authorities, it is critical to strike \na balance, and I fear the Kennedy-Enzi language has gone too far and \nwill slow the approval of new medicines and thereby reduce access.\n  Instead, the language should be modified so that REMS only applies \nwhen the Secretary determines that the new active surveillance system \nhas signaled a risk. At that point, FDA should have the authority to \nrequire manufacturers to judiciously minimize risks without encumbering \ndrug availability or interfering with drug research, development, and \ndelivery. Any expansion of FDA authority should respect this approach.\n  The Kennedy-Enzi language also gives the FDA the authority to require \nprereview of direct-to-consumer advertising, specific drug advertising \ndisclosures, and a 2-year moratorium on direct-to-consumer advertising. \nAs drafted, these provisions raise a variety of first amendment issues, \nspecifically the 2-year ban on advertising. Much can be done to ensure \nthat consumers receive information that is not false or misleading \nwithout banning patient access to health care information.\n  The Kennedy-Enzi language also includes three separate pediatrics \nbills: the reauthorization of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children \nAct, BPCA, the reauthorization of the Pediatric Research Equity Act, \nPREA, and the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act.\n  To encourage the study of more drugs in the pediatric population, \nBPCA as originally enacted as part of the Food and Drug Administration \nModernization Act in 1997, and reauthorized in 2002, grants an \nadditional 6 months of patent life to a product or pediatric \nexclusivity in exchange for the voluntary studies of prescription drugs \nconducted on children. Since its enactment, BPCA has been viewed as a \nhighly successful program and has produced at least 132 completed \nstudies, leading to at least 115 pediatric label changes.\n  Under the Kennedy-Enzi language, the pediatric exclusivity would be \ncapped at 3 months if annual sales for all drugs with the same active \ningredient are over $1 billion in any year. This cap for \n``blockbuster'' drugs unfairly segments patent protection regimes by \nmaking more successful drugs subject to reduced incentives. Our health \ncare system needs to enhance research into children's drugs, not reduce \nthe incentives for manufacturers that produce them. Simply put, the \ncurrent program is working, and imposing a ``cap'' on the pediatric \nexclusivity award will reduce the incentive to conduct pediatric \nstudies and, however formulated, would significantly complicate the \nadministration of the program.\n  Enacted in 2003, PREA gives the FDA authority to require pediatric \nstudies on the same approved indication of a certain drug in adults. \nBPCA and PREA work hand in hand to encourage the further study of \nprescription drugs in pediatric populations. It is because of the great \nsuccess of these two programs that I am pleased that the bill requires \nboth programs to be reauthorized together in 2012. This joint sunset \ndate allows for further reauthorizations to continue to balance the \nincentives and authorities that drive pediatric study.\n  One troubling aspect of the BPCA and PREA reauthorizations is the \ncreation of an internal review committee. Nobody would argue that \npediatric populations should not get special consideration within the \ninner workings of the agency; however, as drafted, the internal review \ncommittee conflicts with the current staff functions of the FDA.\n  The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act aims to \nimprove the process for approving pediatric medical devices and \nencourages research, development, and manufacture of pediatric devices \nthrough demonstration grants and incentives. It modifies the human \ndevice exemption for medical devices to allow manufacturers to earn a \nprofit for HDE-approved pediatric devices but maintains the requirement \nthat a humanitarian use device is limited to one that treats and \ndiagnoses diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 \nindividuals in the United States. This is a good policy, which will \nhelp foster the development of pediatric devices. Unfortunately, the \nbill also expands FDA's authority to require companies to conduct \npostmarket studies of adult devices, even in circumstances in which the \nmanufacturer has no intent to market the device to pediatric \npopulations. Forcing companies to conduct studies on their products for \nunintended and unapproved use diverts resources that could be used for \nfurther innovation, research, and development.\n  Of additional concern is that at this time, many provisions of the \nbill have never been scored by CBO. The provisions in this bill have a \nsignificant impact on the FDA and require a number of changes at the \nagency that will require significant dollars. Because PDUFA and MDUFMA \nare based on negotiations between industry and the administration, any \nchanges that impact that careful compromise need to be fully vetted and \nunderstood. Unfortunately, at this time we do not have that \ninformation.\n  It is clear to all that there are numerous complicated issues \ninvolved. Some provisions provide a great benefit, while others may \nhave graver consequences than even the bill's sponsors would intend. It \nis my hope that as we deal with these issues, we can do so in a manner \nthat is science based and favors patient access over regulatory burden.\n  I ask that the following statement of HHS Secretary Leavitt be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Secretary of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: I am pleased to share the \n     Department's views on the Chairman's mark to S. 1082, the \n     Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act. We \n     appreciate the commitment of you and the Committee in \n     addressing many of the critical issues facing the Food and \n     Drug Administration. We support many of the provisions of the \n     bill and note the many changes made in response to HHS \n     comments. However, we continue to have significant concerns \n     with a number of provisions and hope to work with you to \n     address these before the measure is considered on the floor.\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The Administration strongly supports the reauthorization of \n     the prescription drug user fee and medical device user fee \n     programs. These user fee programs expire at the end of the \n     current fiscal year and their timely reauthorization is \n     critical to the ability of FDA to continue to speed new \n     drugs, biologics and devices to market to benefit the health \n     of the American people.\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n       We are pleased that the bill is consistent with our PDUFA \n     IV proposal by providing the sound financial footing for FDA, \n     enhancing premarket review, creating a new program for review \n     of television advertisements, and significantly strengthening \n     the post-market drug safety system. However, we are troubled \n     by the proposal to fund drug safety activities in Title II \n     with user fees. In our view, the amount that could be raised \n     through user fees may be inadequate, but we are concerned \n     with reopening the PDUFA IV proposal.\n       We also thank the Committee for including language that \n     reflects the draft MDUFMA II proposal. However, we want to \n     work with you to address any concerns once the public comment \n     process has been completed and we are able to transmit the \n     final package to Congress.\n       There are other provisions in the bill that raise serious \n     concerns. In particular, both BPCA and PREA have been very \n     successful in providing the necessary incentives for drug \n     companies to conduct pediatric clinical trials to improve \n     drug labeling for children, thus enhancing the quality of \n     their medical care.\n       We support the extension of the Best Pharmaceutical for \n     Children's Act. However, the provisions in the substitute \n     bill would reduce the incentive to conduct clinical trials \n     for children, thus reducing the effectiveness of the program \n     and changes are made that make the program virtually \n     unworkable. For these reasons, we favor a straight extension \n     of current law over the enactment of the BPCA provisions in \n     this bill.\n       In addition, the PRIA, as drafted, would make this program \n     burdensome for FDA to the point that we would instead propose \n     a straight extension of current law.\n       Finally, as demonstrated by proposed increases for drug \n     safety in the President's FY 2008 Budget Request and the drug \n     safety enhancements in our PDUFA IV proposal, we have a \n     strong commitment to improving the FDA drug safety system. In \n     our view, the core issues of drug safety are better tools for \n     surveillance of drug events, improved scientific tools for \n     evaluating drug safety problems, and better means of \n     communicating drug safety problems to providers and patients. \n     However, the bill as drafted is overly onerous in terms of \n     process and structural changes and could actually have the \n     unintended effect of slowing down drug approvals--while doing \n     little to address the core issues of drug safety. In \n     addition, this would be extremely resource intensive.\n       Now, I would like to turn to more detailed comments on the \n     substitute bill.\n\n                  Title I--Prescription Drug User Fees\n\n       FDA's review of new drug applications (NDAs) and biologics \n     license applications (BLAs) is central to FDA's mission to \n     protect and promote the public health. In 1992 Congress \n     enacted PDUFA, intending to reduce the time necessary for new \n     drug application review, and subsequently has reauthorized it \n     twice. As you know, the current user fee program is scheduled \n     to expire on September 30, 2007.\n       PDUFA has produced significant benefits for public health, \n     including providing the public access to 1,220 new drugs and \n     biologics. During the PDUFA era, FDA reviewers have approved: \n     76 new medicines for cancer; 178 anti-infective medications \n     (including 56 for treatment of HIV or Hepatitis); 111 \n     medicines for metabolic and endocrine disorders; 115 \n     medicines for neurological and psychiatric disorders; and 80 \n     medicines for cardiovascular and renal disease.\n       In addition, PDUFA implementation efforts have dramatically \n     reduced product review times. While maintaining our rigorous \n     review standards, we now review drugs as fast as or faster \n     than anywhere in the world. The median approval time for \n     priority new drug and biologic applications has dropped from \n     14 months in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to only six months in FY \n     2006.\n       The most recent reauthorization of PDUFA directed FDA to \n     consult with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the \n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \n     appropriate scientific and academic experts, health care \n     prefessionals, patient representatives, consumer advocacy \n     groups, and the regulated inustry in developing \n     recommendations for PDUFA reauthorization. We have complied \n     with these requirements in preparing our PDUFA IV proposal, \n     and we are pleased that the draft bill reflects the \n     Administration's PDUFA IV proposal. We believe that the \n     proposal places PDUFA on a sound financial footing, enhance \n     premarket review, and create a modern post-market drug safety \n     system that follows products across their life cycle. \n     Importantly, the proposal also supports new user fees to \n     support the review of direct-to-consumer television \n     advertisements voluntarily submitted to FDA for review prior \n     to airing.\n\n                         Title II--Drug Safety\n\n\n      Subtitle A--Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies [REMS]\n\n       New drugs, biologics, devices, and diagnostics present the \n     greatest opportunities currently available to improve health \n     care and the way medicine is practiced. The number of lives \n     saved are prolonged by new therapies outweighs the risks that \n     the treatments themselves pose. It is also true that all such \n     products pose potential risks. Thus, a drug safety system of \n     the highest possible quality should not be confused with a \n     system in which drugs are risk free. Because there are risks \n     whenever anyone uses a medication, safety considerations \n     involve complex judgments by the healthcare provider \n     community, patients, and consumers, who must constantly weigh \n     the benefits and assess the risks before deciding to use a \n     medical product.\n       Attempts to address these risks must balance access and \n     innovation with regulatory steps to improve the approach to \n     safety issues. We need to make sure that such steps do not \n     impede access to new medical products that can be used safely \n     and effectively by patients suffering from unmet medical \n     needs today. Many of these bill provisions seem fixed on \n     process changes and structural changes in government \n     programs, and not on making fundamental improvements in the \n     science of drug safety. Some changes prescribe specific \n     Agency action when the science of drug safety may not require \n     such intervention, such as the requirement to present all new \n     molecular entities to advisory committees for discussion. \n     Such changes could limit access to needed medicines and slow \n     down new innovations while doing little to address the core \n     issues of drug safety.\n       Improved drug safety is not simply a matter of extending \n     new legal authorities to FDA or requiring the Agency to \n     engage in certain detailed activity. Indeed, extending these \n     interventions or expanding the use of REMS is unlikely to \n     result in improvements in drug safety as desired by the \n     bill's sponsors.\n       The better overall strategy is to ensure that FDA has \n     appropriate resources and the capacity to develop better \n     scientific tools and approaches to drug review, including (1) \n     improving information available to the Agency; (2) improving \n     its ability to evaluate this information; and (3) improving \n     how that evaluation is communicated to the public.\n       Accordingly, the Administration's proposed PDUFA IV \n     recommendations support improvements with respect to: the \n     information that the Agency receives, and with which it makes \n     drug-safety related decisions, including the spontaneous \n     reports we get from sponsors and providers as well as our \n     ability to tap into epidemiological data sets to probe more \n     routine questions; our analytical tools and approaches for \n     evaluating this information and turning raw data about drug-\n     safety related questions into practical medical facts that \n     can be communicated to providers and patients to help them \n     better inform their decision making; and the way in which we \n     can effectively communicate these findings, as well as \n     communicate the Agency's response once we draw a conclusion \n     about the data we have, or we are made aware of a potential \n     drug safety problem or an emerging safety issue.\n       We support the addition of provisions for an active drug \n     safety surveillance system that would be established through \n     a public-private partnership and we want to work with you on \n     this provision to ensure the most effective implementation.\n       We continue to oppose the breadth of the proposed \n     requirements for risk evaluation and mitigation strategies \n     outlined in the bill. We believe it is unnecessarily \n     burdensome on FDA and industry to require routine active \n     surveillance and periodic reassessments for all drugs, as the \n     legislation now does.\n       Even as modified in the substitute bill, the REMS approach \n     would duplicate and overlap elements of the extensive adverse \n     event reporting system already required by FDA (which \n     includes incident-specific, quarterly, and annual reporting). \n     It would also duplicate existing FDC Act labeling \n     requirements, which provide for MedGuides, package inserts, \n     and other materials which convey information to physicians \n     and pharmacists (as well as patients) to address and minimize \n     risk. Moreover, FDA and industry already engage in efforts \n     with respect to implementation of risk minimization action \n     plans (``RiskMAPs'') for those products that warrant such \n     additional risk minimization protocols. In addition, FDA \n     already has authority to require post-approval studies in \n     select circumstances. Codifying new authority to these same \n     ends is unnecessary and redundant.\n       We are also concerned about the adequacy of resources \n     proposed for the significant increase in work that the \n     legislation would entail (e.g., active surveillance, REMS-\n     related activities, the Drug Safety Oversight Board \n     activities, compliance work, and public meetings). Moreover, \n     we are particularly concerned that the proposal would support \n     all of these activities by PDUFA user fees, although this was \n     not part of the industry agreement. Reopening negotiations at \n     this time would risk the timely reauthorization of PDUFA.\n       Finally, the Drug Safety Oversight Board [DSOB] would be \n     used to review disputes between the sponsor and the FDA \n     concerning REMS. Not only does the DSOB not have the \n     necessary expertise to handle dispute resolutions, the bill \n     proposes the disputes be raised directly to the DSOB \n     bypassing the existing dispute resolution process specified \n     in current law [Section 562 of the Act] thus eliminating the \n     possibility of resolving disputes at a lower level. Since \n     the DSB would be the primary source of dispute resolution, \n     this requirement would so overburden the DSB that they \n     will be unable to conduct their other important functions.\n\n\n       subtitle b--reagan-udall foundation for the food and drug \n                             administration\n\n       This subtitle would amend chapter VII of the Federal Food, \n     Drug and Cosmetic Act to\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\n     establish the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug \n     Administration, for purposes of advancing the FDA's mission \n     to modernize the medical, veterinary, food, food ingredient, \n     and cosmetic product development, accelerate innovation, and \n     enhance product safety. We believe that the proposed \n     Foundation may accelerate the national effort to modernize \n     product-related sciences with some additional changes. \n     Another se10us concern is the creation in statute of the \n     Office of the Chief Scientist. This is redundant and the \n     functions would duplicate and conflict with the functions of \n     the current Chief Medical Office position. We look forward to \n     working with you to continue to refine this section.\n\n\n                      subtitle c--clinical trials\n\n       Subtitle C would establish a publicly available database to \n     improve opportunities for enrollment in clinical trials and \n     to enhance access to clinical trials results for the benefit \n     of patients, health care providers and researchers.\n       We support the goal and concept of enhancing access to \n     information on clinical trials and providing a mechanism to \n     enable health care professionals and the public to obtain \n     information about trial results. We believe that such efforts \n     should: emphasize transparency; minimize costs and \n     administrative burdens and build on current efforts; utilize \n     available technology to streamline and minimize the need for \n     new funding; ensure that such activities improve the public \n     health; and recognize legal or funding limitations of the \n     affected federal agencies.\n       In addition, we have concerns with the mandated negotiated \n     rule making process which is time consuming and resource \n     intensive.\n       The draft language takes important steps to addressing \n     concerns previously raised by the department, and we look \n     forward to continuing to work with the Committee on these \n     issue.\n\n\n                   subtitle d--conflicts of interest\n\n       FDA's advisory committees play an essential role in FDA's \n     activities to protect and promote public health through the \n     regulation of human and animal drugs, biological products, \n     medical devices, and. foods: It is important that any \n     legislation concerning review of conflicts of interest for \n     advisory committee members and criteria for eligibility for \n     participation in meetings afford FDA the flexibility to \n     obtain needed external expertise while minimizing the \n     potential for a conflict of interest. We appreciate the \n     improvements to the draft legislation to address these \n     important issues. We note that some concerns remain regarding \n     the scope and applicability of the waiver provision, the \n     limitation on waivers if a member's own scientific work is \n     under consideration, prescreening requirements and the scope \n     of financial disclosures by advisory Committee candidates and \n     members. We hope to work further with the Committee to \n     address these remaining issues.\n\n                  Title III--Medical Device User Fees\n\n       FDA's review of medical device applications is essential to \n     FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health. In \n     2002 Congress enacted MDUFMA, intending to reduce the time \n     necessary for new medical device application review. As you \n     know, the current user fee program is scheduled to expire on \n     September 30, 2007.\n       Similar to PDUFA, FDA was directed to consult with \n     stakeholders in developing recommendations for MDUFMA \n     reauthorization. We have complied with these requirements in \n     preparing our MDUFMA II proposal, and we are pleased that the \n     draft bill is consistent with the Administration's draft \n     MDUFMA II recommendations as laid out in the Federal Register \n     notice.\n       As we announced on April 16, FDA is holding a public \n     meeting on April 30 and providing the public with a 30-day \n     period in which to comment on the Administration's \n     legislative recommendations in accordance with Section 105 of \n     MDUFMA. We look forward to sending you the Administration's \n     final recommendations shortly after the public comment period \n     closes.\n\n                  Title IV--Pediatric Medical Products\n\n\n             Subtitle A--Best Pharmaceuticals for Children\n\n       The Administration supports reauthorization of the Best \n     Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. The incentive for pediatric \n     studies provided in this legislation has had a powerful \n     impact on providing important safety, efficacy, and dosing \n     information for drugs used in children. It has created an \n     environment that promotes the study of drugs in children, \n     fostered an infrastructure for pediatric clinical trials that \n     was previously non-existent, and enabled FDA to obtain \n     important pediatric information and numerous labeling \n     changes.\n       However, the substitute bill contains several provisions \n     that we believe will have a severe negative impact on this \n     successful program. The incentive to conduct clinical trials \n     for children will be compromised and the creation of an \n     internal review committee and other program changes will make \n     the BPCA virtually unworkable. For this reason, the \n     Administration would favor a straight reauthorization over \n     the enactment of these provisions. I will now review some of \n     our specific concerns.\n       First, as mentioned above, the current incentive of the 6 \n     month period of exclusivity has worked well and should be \n     maintained. Through this legislation, FDA has been able to \n     effect important labeling changes on 122 different products. \n     Any weakening of this incentive can only have the effect of \n     reducing its effectiveness. Accordingly, the proposal to \n     shorten this incentive or to only provide exclusivity to \n     drugs with one or more year left of patents and exclusivity \n     life are of significant concern.\n       FDA supports greater internal cooperation; however, the \n     draft bill's creation of an internal review committee is of \n     concern for a number of reasons. First, a legislative \n     requirement for what are primarily staff functions is in \n     direct conflict with the expertise, flexibility and \n     efficiency needed to ensure rapid review of pediatric product \n     development. We have concerns about the structure and \n     composition of the committee. Second, the proposal assigns \n     the dual function of approving written requests and granting \n     exclusivity, which may result in conflicts between the \n     subjective intent of the written request and the objective \n     evaluation as to whether the studies fairly respond to the \n     actual terms of written request. We recommend keeping the two \n     functions separate. Third, we believe that tracking pediatric \n     studies are responsibilities more appropriately assigned to \n     agency staff, since they are routine functions that do not \n     require a decision-making body.\n       There are a number of critical technical provisions which \n     affect the submission of reports, labeling changes, and \n     disclosure of information which needs to be modified to \n     ensure the process works as intended.\n\n\n             Subtitle B--Pediatric Research Improvement Act\n\n       As noted above, we support the efforts to improve internal \n     consistency and efficiency. However, the bill's creation of \n     an internal review committee for Pediatric Research Equity \n     Act [PREA] assessments is also of concern similar to the \n     reasons stated above. A legislative requirement for what are \n     primarily staff functions is in direct conflict with the \n     expertise, flexibility and efficiency needed to ensure rapid \n     review of pediatric product development. We do have serious \n     concerns about the structure and composition of the committee \n     as well as the potential impact on the current process given \n     the number and extent of assessments.\n       There are technical provisions which affect the submission \n     of reports, labeling changes, and disclosure of information \n     which needs to be modified to ensure the process works as \n     intended. As stated above with regard to BPCA, we feel that \n     the changes in the substitute bill will make the Pediatric \n     Research Equity Act program unworkable and the Administration \n     would rather have a straight reauthorization of PREA than \n     enactment of the substitute bill.\n\n\n                 Subtitle C--Pediatric Medical Devices\n\n       With regard to Subtitle C-Pediatric Medical Devices, while \n     we support measures to stimulate the increase availability of \n     pediatric devices, we have major concerns with these \n     provisions.\n       In the area of pediatric device research, NIH has a number \n     of research efforts underway in this area and we believe it \n     would be more efficient and effective to utilize current \n     research initiatives at NIH rather than embark on a new \n     private sector initiative. The funding of a private consortia \n     would siphon off dollars for administrative expenses [that \n     could otherwise go for pediatric device research. In \n     addition, we oppose having a private entity making the \n     decisions on research priorities.\n       The amendment to the Humanitarian Device Exemption would \n     remove the profit-making restriction for HDEs approved for \n     pediatric indications on the theory that allowing profit will \n     stimulate the production of more pediatric devices for \n     limited populations. Allowing profits up to a sales cap is an \n     impractical policy tool. Our view is that this amendment to \n     the HDE exemption would be administratively burdensome and \n     costly for industry and the FDA, and would have a \n     questionable impact on the incentive to develop new pediatric \n     devices.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       In conclusion, this letter has cited many problems with \n     provisions included in this bill--some we believe will not \n     achieve their policy objectives; some are unduly burdensome \n     on the industry and the FDA. Still others appear to be \n     unworkable or potentially costly. In addition to these \n     concerns, the Administration may have additional concerns in \n     connection with this legislation.\n       We have raised many serious objections in our comments \n     above and it is our hope that we can work with you and others \n     to resolve these before the bill is considered on the floor. \n     Our support of this legislation is contingent on the \n     satisfactory resolution of these concerns.\n       OMB advises that from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program there is no objection to the \n     transmittal of this letter. We look forward to our \n     collaboration with you on this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael O. Leavitt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5180-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5180-S5181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANNUAL CRAWFISH BOIL IN GILLETTE, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to speak about community \nspirit. In the Senate, we work day in and day out to pass good policy \nthat will provide for the safety, security, and health of\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nthe Nation, but we are not alone in our effort to make our country \nbetter. In fact, we are but a small part. There are great events taking \nplace every day in our country that are examples of neighbor helping \nneighbor, people who do not wait and do not ask for help but take it \nupon themselves to act. I would like to tell you about one such example \nthat has been going on for years in Wyoming right in the small \ncommunity I call home.\n  When people think about my hometown of Gillette, WY, many images come \nto mind--sagebrush as far as the eye can see, coal trucks, and cattle \nherds. We have deer, antelope, and some buffalo in the neighboring \ncommunity of Wright. Our kids are great basketball players, and we work \nhard to get the methane gas and minerals that power this country. The \nlist goes on. But after living in Gillette for more than three decades, \nwhat stands out about home are the people themselves, their character, \ntheir sense of community, and how they come together to help each \nother. And then there is the crawfish. Yes, I said crawfish.\n  This week, Gillette will be kicking off a 24-year tradition of flying \nin 10,000 pounds of crawfish for the annual Crawfish Boil. The event \nraises money for local families with medical hardships and was started \nin 1983 by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The event raised \n$117,000 last year to help people get medical treatment. This weekend \nwe hope to top that number.\n  Wyoming may be small in population, but our families know how to help \neach other out more than any other State in the Nation. Wyomingites do \nnot just rely on government for help--they talk to neighbors, they come \nup with a good idea, they organize, and they follow through. The \ncrawfish feed is an example for the Nation on how to pull yourself and \nyour neighbor up by the bootstraps and have fun doing it.\n  Gillette not only raised $117,000 at last year's Crawfish Boil, the \nFestival of Trees raised $51,500 for hospice and lifeline services, the \nChili Cook-Off raised $28,800 for the Council of Community Services, \nthe Black Cat Ball raised $26,000 for the Hospice Hospitality House, \nthe Chuckles for Charity event raised $24,000 for the Gillette Area \nRefuge, and the Rotary Ball raised $40,000 for education and other \nprograms in Gillette. Mr. President, $287,000 in 1 year, in one \ncommunity with roughly 25,000 residents. I could not think of a better \nplace to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5181-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             CODY CARITHERS\n\n Mr. PRYOR.

Since kindergarten at Cherokee Elementary School in Highland \nuntil now, never missed a day.\n  This accomplishment has not been easy. Cody was diagnosed with a \nbrain tumor near his optic nerve a little over 2 years ago. This caused \nfrequent headaches and required many trips to Arkansas Children's \nHospital in Little Rock. Cody was adamant about maintaining his perfect \nattendance, and the hospital worked with him to schedule his \nappointments on school holidays or in the evening so he wouldn't miss a \nday of school. What a determined young man.\n  Cody is involved in a number of school activities, clubs and \norganizations. He is an active member of Future Farmers of America and \nis president of the Rebels Against Drugs Program at Highland High \nSchool. He has also participated in sports.\n  During the summer, Cody volunteered at the Sharp County Library. He \nhas been employed for the past 2 years at Ivey's Automotive Center in \nHighland. Cody's plans after graduation are to attend Black River \nTechnical College and pursue a degree in aviation maintenance or \nautomotive technology.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Cody Carithers for his \ndetermination, drive and incredible school attendance record. He \nexemplifies Highland High School's motto, ``A tradition of \nexcellence.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5181-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Since its founding in 1969, the college has \nserved more than 10,000 students representing 75 federally recognized \ntribes.\n  During his tenure as president, Dr. Gipp has spearheaded an \nincredible transformation of the college and in higher education for \nAmerican Indians. Dr. Gipp was the first executive director of the \nAmerican Indian Higher Education Consortium and later he served as its \npresident. He was instrumental in the formulation of the Tribal \nColleges or Universities Assistance Act, which started to address the \nFederal Government's obligation in providing higher education for \nAmerican Indians.\n  Under Dr. Gipp's leadership, UTTC has grown from just over 100 \nstudents and 12 programs of study to more than 1,018 students for the \n2006-2007 school year with 24 different 2-year and certificate programs \nand bachelor's programs. In this time, Dr. Gipp has led the college's \ntransition from traditional vocational trades to programs geared toward \nthe labor needs of Indian Country. He also propelled UTTC into becoming \nthe first tribal college in the Nation to be authorized to offer full \nonline degree programs. In recent years, Dr. Gripp has led the fight to \nrestore funding for the college that was cut from the Department of \nInterior's budget.\n  Dr. Gipp has been an agent of positive change in the lives of \nthousands of students who have attended United Tribes Technical \nCollege. He is a true champion for higher education and a powerful \nnational advocate for the tribal colleges. His passion is infectious, \nand he has empowered individuals to reach to their goals no matter how \nsmall or large.\n  John Quincy Adams once said ``[I]f your actions inspire others to \ndream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.'' \nDr. Gipp is a leader in every sense of the word. I want to extend my \ncongratulations to Dr. Gipp on 30 years as president of United Tribes \nTechnical College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5181-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5181-S5182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CECIL E. WILLIAMS, JR.\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of a \nman revered as the most influential man in Arkansas agriculture. Cecil \nE. Williams, Jr., who passed on April 12, was respected by his peers \nand seen as an unparalleled advocate for farmer's interests, where he \ntried to save not only their lives, but also their jobs and livelihood.\n  Undoubtedly, agriculture is the backbone of rural Arkansas and rural \nAmerica. Today, Arkansas agriculture provides nearly one in every five \njobs in my State, and we rank in the top 10 nationally in the \nproduction of many commodities, including rice and cotton, where we \nrank No. 1 and No. 2 respectively. Much of Arkansas' success in \nagriculture can be directly attributed to Cecil Williams and his hard \nwork. Mr. Williams worked hard during his lifetime to make Arkansas \nagriculture a force to be reckoned with while establishing workable, \nsensible, and sound farm policy. For nearly 40 years, Cecil Williams, \nknown as the ``Dean of Farm Bills,'' served as the director of the \nAgricultural Council of Arkansas, ACA, where he took great pride in \nserving what he considered a worthwhile cause: farmers and agriculture.\n  After receiving an agribusiness degree in 1960 from Louisiana State \nUniversity, Mr. Williams began his career as a fieldworker for the \nNational Cotton Council and gained valuable insight into the \nproduction, business, and policy angles of agriculture. After an \nimpressive 5 years with the National Cotton Council, the Agricultural \nCouncil of Arkansas recognized his talents and heavily recruited him to \njoin their ranks. Once at the council, he quickly ascended to a \nleadership role with the organization and went on to fight for farm \npolicy that made sense for Arkansas, improve checkoff programs for\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\ncrops, and provide better insurance programs. One of Williams' most \nstoried accomplishments was getting the average farmer involved in the \nleadership and policy development process, most notably by developing \nthe National Cotton Council's Producer Steering Committee. To this day, \nthe Steering Committee continues to ensure producers have an active \nvoice on policy issues. He never underestimated the knowledge and \ninfluence carried by the producer. Farmers all over Arkansas \nappreciated that and never forgot the respect he gave their opinions.\n  Cecil Williams took each event in stride and persevered with \nleadership and optimism. His ability to develop and foster leadership \namong the producer ranks was and still is an impressive feat. His \nrelentless defense of agriculture, and the years he spent cultivating \nactive and knowledgeable producers in Arkansas will be long remembered \nby those whose lives he touched through his tireless devotion. I am \nalways proud to see Arkansas farmers when they make their way to \nWashington or when I am traveling the state. These are, without a doubt \nin my mind, the best farmers in America thanks to the leadership of \npeople like Cecil Williams.\n  During his lifetime, Williams always led by example and stayed true \nto his cause; rarely will you find such a noble and grounded leader. \nThis was a man who could see the big picture and still thoroughly \nunderstand the components needed on the ground. He believed firmly in \nwhat he represented and remained active in production agriculture and \nthe legislative arena up until his last days.\n  Arkansas agriculture has suffered a great loss with the passing of \nCecil Williams, but we will continue to remember this great man and \nbenefit from his foresight and leadership. During his lifetime, Cecil \nWilliams saw the passage of numerous farm bills and agricultural laws. \nFrom his active role in production agriculture and agricultural policy, \nhe was also able to see the consequences of both good and bad farm \npolicy. As Congress works on drafting the 2007 farm bill, let us not \nforget the legacy Cecil Williams left behind and take heed from the \nwisdom of his decades of experience.\n  I pay my tribute to this legend of Arkansas agriculture and express \nmy greatest condolences to his family. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5182-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5182-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5182-3", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 1591) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2007, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5182-4", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 521.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nreauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when we enacted the Children's Health \nInsurance Program a decade ago, we made a promise to low-income working \nfamilies to assist them in obtaining health insurance coverage for \ntheir children, and we must continue to keep that promise. Today, with \nSenators Rockefeller and Snowe, I am pleased to introduce The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.\n  CHIP has been a significant success, and has made a real difference \nin many children's lives. Over the past decade, the percentage of \nuninsured children has dropped dramatically, even though more and more \nof their parents have been losing coverage because employers decide to \nreduce it or drop it entirely.\n  In its first year, the program enrolled nearly a million children, \nand enrollment has grown ever since. Average monthly enrollment is now \n4 million, and over 6 million have been enrolled for at least part of \nthe year.\n  We know CHIP has made a difference in the lives of millions of \nchildren, but we also know that this is no time to rest on past \nsuccess. We can and must do more to enroll the 6 million uninsured \nchildren who are eligible but not enrolled for CHIP and Medicaid, and \nto expand coverage so that all children can obtain the health care they \nneed.\n  The bill we are introducing today reauthorizes the program and it \nwill make sure that states have enough funds to provide health care to \nall children who need this assistance. No parents should be faced with \nthe impossible decision of whether they can afford to take their sick \nchild to the doctor.\n  The bill establishes a strong, reliable financing structure for CHIP. \nIt more than doubles the Federal resources currently available over the \nnext 5 years for covering children through CHIP. It ensures that all \nstates will have the Federal matching funds needed both to sustain \ntheir existing programs and to move forward to cover the millions of \nchildren who are eligible for CHIP and Medicaid but remain unenrolled.\n  Millions of uninsured children in America isn't just wrong. It's \nunacceptable. We need to act now in getting to guarantee them the \nhealth coverage they need.\n  This bill adopts a variety of approaches to help states increase \ntheir enrollment. It strengthens CHIP by expanding the current program, \nimproving its outreach, and making sure that all children have access \nto dental care and mental health services, so that good health care can \nbe a reality for every child in America.\n  Quality health care for children isn't just a good option or a nice \nidea. It's not merely something we wish we could do. It's something we \nhave to do. It's an obligation. We started earlier this year by \npledging what is needed in the budget, but we also need a CHIP \nreauthorization that gives children the coverage we've promised them \nfor the healthy future they deserve. The bill we're introducing today \ndoes that.\n  There's a reason the CHIP program has always enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport.\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nIt's because all of us know how important it is that all children have \nthe chance to get a healthy start in life. I look forward to working to \nmake sure all children get the health care they need, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this week is Cover the Uninsured \nWeek. And, I cannot think of a more appropriate time to introduce the \nlegislation that Senators Olympia Snowe, Ted Kennedy, and I introduced \nyesterday--the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) \nReauthorization Act of 2007 (S. 1224). There are more than 45 million \nuninsured people in our country today, and 9 million of them--20 \npercent--are children. This is an embarrassing statistic for the \nwealthiest country in the world, and it has catastrophic consequences \nfor our children.\n  In 1964, when I first came to West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer in \nEmmons, I was shocked to learn that many of the school-age children \nliving there had never been to a dentist before. I made raising health \ncare standards one of my first priorities in Emmons, and we ultimately \ngot a bus to bring children to the Tiskelwah grade school in Charleston \nfor dental care. Now, more than 30 years later, there are still \nchildren in West Virginia and throughout the Nation without access to \nadequate dental care.\n  Several weeks ago, millions across the country mourned the death of \ntwelve year old Deamonte Driver, whose lack of dental care led to fatal \nbrain infection. His death was a sad reminder of how our country \ncontinues to fail in its efforts to ensure access to vital medical care \nfor our nation's youth. Yet, Deamonte was not the only child to succumb \nto the perils of inadequate health coverage. There are countless other \nchildren who have suffered the same fate. We must make universal \ncoverage for children a national priority and reauthorization of CHIP \nis the first step in that process.\n  When CHIP was established in 1997, nearly 10 million children were \nuninsured. Congress responded by making a landmark, bipartisan \ncommitment to help states provide comprehensive health insurance \ncoverage to millions of these children. As a result, 6 million children \nhave access to medical benefits through CHIP that they would have \notherwise been forced to do without. I am proud to have been a part of \nCHIP's creation, and I am especially proud of the progress this program \nhas made in providing working families an affordable and dependable \noption for protecting the health and well-being of their children. A \nhealthy start in life is a necessary component in preparing our \nchildren to lead healthy, happy and productive lives in the future.\n  Today, however, we find ourselves in a situation strikingly similar \nto the dilemma we faced in 1997--more than 9 million children are \ncurrently without health insurance in this country. In fact, in 2005, \nthe number of uninsured children increased for the first time since \nCHIP was enacted. This means that, despite our best efforts, we have \ntaken a step backwards in terms of covering children. We cannot allow \nthis trend to continue. Instead, we must make covering children a top \npriority--just like we did in 1997.\n  The CHIP Reauthorization Act makes health insurance coverage for \nchildren a priority. Not only does this important legislation renew and \nstrengthen the commitment we made to our working families 10 years ago; \nit also provides significant new Federal resources for states to reach \nthe 6 million additional children who are currently eligible for \nMedicaid and CHIP, but unenrolled. With many states already leading the \ncharge on children's health and the additional federal support this \nlegislation provides them, the Nation will be able to take another \nsubstantial step forward toward ensuring that all of America's children \nhave comprehensive health insurance.\n  Our bill strengthens the underlying CHIP financing formula to provide \nstates a stable and reliable source of funding for their efforts to \ncover more uninsured children. It also combines a variety of \napproaches, such as Express Lane eligibility, to help states enroll \nmore uninsured kids who are currently eligible for CHIP or Medicaid. \nThese innovative approaches will allow states to reach millions of \nadditional children, particularly in rural parts of the country.\n  I am especially proud of our efforts to permit states to provide more \nmeaningful coverage for children by including other vital benefits like \ndental care and mental health services. I have already talked about the \nimportance of oral health for a child, but I'd also like to say \nsomething about children's mental health. I spend a lot of time with \nveterans, many who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), \nand when those veterans get home, their children often suffer as well. \nWe also need to consider the mental health of our children more \nbroadly. Children are living in very tough times. They face enormous \namounts of mental pressure from a variety of sources. If the Virginia \nTech tragedy taught us anything, it taught us that we need to hug our \nchildren everyday and that we need to get appropriate help for our \nchildren when they have mental health needs, no matter how big or \nsmall.\n  While I had hoped that we could require Early Periodic Screening \nDiagnostic and Treatment (EPDST) services as part of this bill, I \nbelieve we were able to reach an appropriate compromise that will help \nus to achieve broad bipartisan support. I am still as committed as I \never have been to including EPDST services in CHIP. However, Senators \nSnowe, Kennedy, and I wanted to craft a bill that could pass the \nSenate, and we believe we have achieved that objective.\n  A final component of our legislation that I would like to highlight \nare the important steps we take to develop child-focused quality \nmeasures that will directly improve the coverage provided to children \nenrolled in CHIP. We establish a new child health quality initiative to \nenhance data collection, identify best practices, develop a pediatric \nelectronic medical record, and disseminate health quality information. \nWe hope this new initiative will greatly improve the health outcomes of \nchildren.\n  In closing, I'd like for our country to get to the point where we \nnever have to have another Cover the Uninsured Week again. Of course I \ngreatly appreciate all the wonderful work the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation has done over the years to raise awareness about the \nuninsured problem. My hope is that we will eventually have universal \ncoverage for all. Certainly, we can take the first step toward \nachieving that goal by providing health care coverage for all of our \nNation's children.\n  With this reauthorization bill, Congress now has an opportunity to \nmake profound positive changes in the lives of millions of American \nchildren and their families. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting the passage of the CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2007.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The state children's health insurance program (chip) \n     and medicaid have greatly improved children's coverage rates \n     and access to needed health care services.--\n       (A) CHIP and Medicaid serve as the critical health care \n     safety net for 34,000,000 children over the course of a year, \n     with 28,000,000 children enrolled in Medicaid and more than \n     6,000,000 children enrolled in CHIP.\n       (B) CHIP and Medicaid have accounted for a \\1/3\\ decline in \n     the rate of uninsured low-income children since 1997.\n       (C) During the recent economic downturn, and as the number \n     of uninsured people has climbed to the highest number ever \n     recorded in the United States, CHIP and Medicaid offset \n     losses in employer-sponsored coverage that affected children \n     and parents alike.\n       (D) While the number of children living in low-income \n     families increased between 2000 and 2005, the number of \n     uninsured children fell due to Medicaid and CHIP.\n       (E) Children enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid are much more \n     likely to have a usual source of care than uninsured \n     children, and are much more likely than uninsured children to \n     receive well-child care, see a doctor during the year, and \n     get dental care. Studies have found that children enrolled in \n     public insurance programs experienced significant improvement \n     in measures of school performance.\n       (F) Since CHIP was created, coverage rates have increased \n     significantly among children of all ethnic and racial groups.\n       (G) According to one Federal evaluation of CHIP, uninsured \n     children who gained coverage through the program received \n     more preventive care, and their parents reported better \n     access to providers and improved communications with their \n     children's doctors.\n       (2) Even with the success of chip and medicaid, more needs \n     to be done to improve the health status of our nation's \n     children.--\n       (A) There are currently 9,000,000 uninsured children under \n     age 19, accounting for nearly 20 percent of our Nation's \n     uninsured.\n       (B) Approximately 7 out of every 10 uninsured children are \n     eligible for CHIP or Medicaid.\n       (C) The cost of unmet health needs among children extends \n     beyond measurable health system costs. For example, problems \n     that could be prevented, managed, or treated with regular \n     access to care can become more serious, resulting in lower \n     school attendance and increased health care costs.\n       (D) Reducing the number of uninsured children in our \n     country is an essential first step to improve health status. \n     CHIP reauthorization presents an opportunity to secure health \n     care coverage for more children who are eligible for CHIP or \n     Medicaid but not yet enrolled.\n       (3) We must maintain coverage for the children currently \n     enrolled in chip.--\n       (A) When CHIP was created in 1997, Congress allocated \n     $40,000,000,000 for the 10-year authorization.\n       (B) At current funding levels, nearly 2,000,000 children \n     are at risk of losing their CHIP coverage over the next 5 \n     years because the current CHIP financing structure is \n     inadequate and States are facing CHIP funding shortfalls.\n       (C) We must eliminate Federal funding shortfalls by \n     providing States with significant new Federal resources for \n     children's health coverage.\n       (D) CHIP reauthorization offers an opportunity to increase \n     CHIP funding and to provide stable, predictable Federal \n     funding so that States not only have the ability to maintain \n     their current caseloads but also to expand coverage to \n     currently unenrolled children.\n       (4) We must reach the uninsured children who are already \n     eligible for chip or medicaid but unenrolled.--\n       (A) More than 6,000,000 uninsured children are eligible for \n     CHIP or Medicaid at any point during the year.\n       (B) In some States, it is estimated that up to 50 percent \n     of children covered through CHIP do not remain in the program \n     due to reenrollment barriers.\n       (C) Difficult renewal policies and reenrollment barriers \n     make seamless coverage in CHIP unattainable. Studies indicate \n     that as many as 67 percent of children who were eligible but \n     not enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid had applied for coverage but \n     were denied eligibility due to procedural issues.\n       (D) States have tools at their disposal to streamline \n     enrollment procedures, but further Federal changes would help \n     States reach more children.\n       (E) Insuring parents is an effective way to increase \n     children's participation in public programs and to increase \n     children's access to health care services.\n       (F) To reduce the number of uninsured children, improve our \n     children's health, and continue our progress in reducing \n     health disparities, the reauthorization of CHIP should \n     provide States with the tools and resources necessary to \n     identify, enroll, and maintain coverage for children who are \n     eligible for CHIP or Medicaid.\n       (5) We must support and encourage states that are leading \n     the way with initiatives to cover more children.--\n       (A) States in every region of the country are seeking to \n     move forward in covering more children, either by reaching \n     already eligible children or further expanding eligibility.\n       (B) The Federal government should serve as a partner in \n     these efforts by providing sufficient funding to solidify and \n     strengthen this momentum.\n       (6) We must promote high-quality health care that promotes \n     children's healthy development.--\n       (A) Children and adolescents deserve better quality care \n     than what they currently receive.\n       (B) Most States report using some kind of measure to \n     evaluate and improve the quality of care children receive \n     through their CHIP and Medicaid programs. However, State \n     efforts are often hampered by budget constraints, limitations \n     on information technology systems, and a need for improved \n     measurement tools and performance measurement standards.\n       (C) As we improve access to health coverage as part of CHIP \n     reauthorization, Congress also has an opportunity to enhance \n     quality by improving and standardizing data collection \n     efforts.\n       (7) We must support policies that strengthen and expand \n     health insurance coverage.--\n       (A) There are more than 46,000,000 uninsured Americans \n     today.\n       (B) No one who is currently covered should lose coverage \n     because of changes to CHIP or Medicaid as part of the \n     reauthorization of CHIP.\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\n       (C) Coverage of parents through family coverage waivers \n     furthers the objectives of CHIP in that it promotes \n     children's enrollment, positively impacts children's \n     utilization of services, and improves family well-being.\n       (D) Coverage of parents through family coverage waivers is \n     also consistent with long-standing CHIP policy - the explicit \n     authorization in the CHIP statute for the Secretary to grant \n     waivers that are consistent with the objectives of CHIP, the \n     parent waiver guidelines for CHIP issued by the Secretary, \n     and the flexibility broadly accorded states through CHIP.\n       (E) Parent coverage waivers have been granted to States \n     that have made a commitment to cover children first and then \n     to use funding to cover low-income parents.\n       (F) Research indicates that having an uninsured parent not \n     only decreases the likelihood that a child will have a well-\n     child visit, it also decreases the likelihood that a child \n     will see any medical provider at all.\n       (G) We strongly support maintaining the current flexibility \n     under CHIP that permits family coverage through waivers to \n     cover parents, while assuring that children remain the \n     primary focus of CHIP.\n\n     TITLE I--MAKING CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE A NATIONAL PRIORITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Campus Law \nEnforcement Emergency Response Act of 2007. This legislation takes \nseveral important steps to enhance the security of college and \nuniversity campuses, including ensuring that schools have created and \ntested emergency response procedures and notification systems.\n  We will never forget the tragic events at Virginia Tech on April 16, \n2007, when a mentally ill gunman brutally murdered 32 men and women \nover a period of several hours. This horrible incident demonstrated the \nneed for colleges and universities to develop and test procedures for \nresponding to emergency situations that pose a large-scale threat to \npublic safety. In the era we live in today, college campuses may be \nviewed as inviting targets for those who seek to terrorize or kill. We \nhave to be prepared for the possibility of mass-casualty attacks on our \ncollege campuses, and we have to be ready to respond to them if they \noccur.\n  Many schools in my home State of Illinois and elsewhere have taken \nmeasures, both before and after the Virginia Tech shootings, to \nsafeguard against such emergency incidents. However, there are nearly \n4,300 colleges and universities in the country, serving over 17 million \nstudents and millions more faculty, staff and campus visitors each \nyear. We need to ensure that all of these institutions have effective \nlaw enforcement emergency response procedures in place, and we need to \nprovide guidance and assistance for schools that need it.\n  The Campus Law Enforcement Emergency Response Act would ensure that \ninstitutions of higher education meet baseline preparedness and testing \nrequirements for law enforcement emergencies. The bill would expand the \nfocus of the Clery Act, an existing law that requires colleges and \nuniversities to issue annual reports on campus crime and crime security \nmeasures, to cover ``law enforcement emergency'' situations. The term \n``law enforcement emergency'' as defined in the bill would include \nsituations that occur on a college campus that involve a law \nenforcement response and that pose a potential threat of continuing \ndanger. Such situations would include ``a shooting, the presence of an \narmed and dangerous person, a bomb threat, the presence of an \nunauthorized hazardous or toxic material that poses a threat to health \nand safety, a lock-down, a reverse evacuation, or any other comparable \ntype of incident on the campus . . . that involves the participation of \none or more law enforcement agencies.'' Because of the threat of large-\nscale dangers that these types of emergency incidents pose to the \ncampus community, additional preparations should be made for them.\n  First, the bill would require higher education institutions to \ndevelop and distribute policies regarding the institution's law \nenforcement emergency response program. These policies would have to \nspecify the procedures students and employees should follow if a law \nenforcement emergency occurs and the procedures that the school and its \npartner law enforcement agencies would follow to inform and guide \nstudents and employees in case of such an emergency. Under this bill, \nschools are encouraged to establish notification procedures such as e-\nmail alerts, telephone alerts, text-message alerts, radio \nannouncements, television alerts, audible alert signals, and public \naddress announcements.\n  The bill would also require institutions to test their law \nenforcement emergency response procedures at least annually. Such \ntesting is crucial for ensuring the efficient and effective \ncoordination of law enforcement response activities with the actions of \nthose on campus.\n  In addition, this legislation would require institutions to provide \nnotice to the campus community through its notification procedures no \nlater than 30 minutes after the discovery of a law enforcement \nemergency. Many have pointed out that over 2 hours passed between the \ndiscovery of the first shootings on the Virginia Tech campus and the \ninitial threat notification to the Virginia Tech community. In the \ninterim period, the Virginia Tech gunman moved across campus and shot \nmany more victims. A 30-minute notification requirement provides enough \ntime for law enforcement agencies to assess an emergency situation and \nto issue, at minimum, an alert notifying the campus community about the \npossibility of further danger.\n  The bill would give the Departments of Education and Justice joint \nauthority to review, monitor, and ensure compliance with the bill's \nrequirements. Given the Department of Justices experience in dealing \nwith law enforcement emergencies, joint authority and coordination with \nthe Department of Education will provide a significant benefit to \nschools. Additionally, the bill would authorize the Education and \nJustice Departments to advise schools on model law enforcement \nemergency response procedures and to disseminate information about \nthese procedures. The bill would further require schools to report \nstatistics on the actual occurrence of law enforcement emergencies at \neach school.\n  Finally, the bill would create a competitive grant program, to be \nadministered by the Department of Education, to help institutions \ndevelop, implement, operate, improve, test, and disseminate campus law \nenforcement emergency response programs. The program would be \nauthorized for 5 years, at $5 million for the first year and for such \nsums as may be necessary thereafter.\n  The tragedy at Virginia Tech should cause us to reassess numerous \nlaws in an effort to prevent such tragedies from happening in the \nfuture. We need to reevaluate the State and Federal laws that allowed a \nman to purchase guns and ammunition despite a prior determination of \nmental illness by a court. We need to take a hard look at mental health \nin this country and to craft policies that identify and provide support \nfor those with signs of mental illness. We must also work to strengthen \nthe security of our primary and secondary schools in order to safeguard \nagainst shootings and other dangerous incidents on those school \ngrounds. These issues will be the subject of discussions in the days to \ncome, and enhancing the preparedness of our college campuses for law \nenforcement emergencies must be a part of those discussions as well.\n  Sadly, we cannot guarantee that a mass tragedy will never occur again \non an American campus. But it is imperative that the Government, law \nenforcement agencies, and school administrations work together to guard \nagainst mass-casualty threats as best we can and to be ready to respond \nif they occur. The Campus Law Enforcement Emergency Response Act will \nhelp ensure that those who live, work, and study at our colleges and \nuniversities can do so more safely. I urge the Congress to pass this \nimportant and critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1230. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable credit for contributions to qualified tuition programs; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the College Saver's \nCredit Act, a bill designed to open the dream of higher education to \nmany more Americans.\n  Few choices in life have the economic consequence as the decision to \nenter college. Compare college-educated workers to their high-school-\neducated peers: those with a college diploma will earn $1 million more \nover\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\nthe course of a lifetime than their peers without one. That million-\ndollar difference lays bare the power in college access.\n  And yet there are literally hundreds of thousands of young men and \nwomen who want to choose a college education, and cannot. These young \nmen and women are prepared to enter into our college-educated middle \nclass--prepared in intellect, prepared in maturity, prepared in \nambition--and are shut out by the cost of tuition.\n  This year, 400,000 high school seniors whose families have low or \nmoderate incomes will be priced out of college. Of those, nearly \n200,000 will never attend college at all. They will lose their chance \nat higher education, and as a consequence, they will face almost twice \nthe odds of unemployment.\n  And unless we take action, the number of excluded Americans is only \nlikely to increase. Over the past 10 years, the cost of attending a 4-\nyear public college has increased by more than $2,800, or 96 percent, \nand the cost of attending a four-year private college has increased by \nmore than $9,000, or 71 percent. These costs continue to rise today.\n  We must take steps to break down these barriers to access, starting \nby making it easier for families to save for higher education. The \nrefundable College Saver's Credit created by this act would do just \nthat--even as it boosts personal and national savings, at a time when \nthese rates are setting new lows. It would provide a powerful \ncomplement to the other forms of financial aid available to students, \nwhich, I might add, we should also continue to work to strengthen.\n  The College Saver's Credit would be available to low- and moderate-\nincome taxpayers who save in Section 529 college savings plans: \nspecifically, to joint filers making up to $60,000, heads of households \nmaking up to $45,000, and all other taxpayers making up to $30,000, \nwith all numbers indexed for inflation. In other words, the credit is \ndesigned to provide the greatest benefit to those who have the greatest \ndifficulty affording college.\n  Taxpayers could claim a 50 percent credit for Section 529 plan \ncontributions, up to a maximum credit of $2,000. The College Saver's \nCredit would be fully refundable--meaning that even taxpayers who do \nnot make enough money to have a high tax liability would be eligible to \nclaim the credit's full value--provided that the refunded amount is put \ntowards qualified higher educational expenses. Any refund would be \ndeposited directly and automatically into the taxpayer's or taxpayer's \nbeneficiary's designated 529 college savings plan, taking advantage of \nthe IRS's new ``split refund'' option. Funds attributable to refunds \nfrom the College Saver's Credit could accumulate earnings tax-free \n(like the rest of the taxpayer's savings in a 529 plan), but may only \nbe distributed to pay college costs--otherwise, they must be returned \nto the Treasury.\n  In his budget this year, President Bush proposed expanding the \nSaver's Credit for retirement savings to section 529 college savings \nplans. Establishing the refundable College Saver's Credit would \naccomplish this goal in a way that provides the greatest value to those \nAmericans who need it most.\n  And in doing that, this bill accomplishes two worthy, and linked, \ngoals: It encourages Americans to plan and prepare for the future; and \nit truly widens the doors to college.\n  Savings and education: They are pillars of our prosperity--prosperity \nthat will grow even as it is shared more widely.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title II of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965 to enhance teacher training and teacher preparation \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Preparing, \nRecruiting, and Retaining Education Professionals (PRREP) Act to \nimprove education and student achievement through high-quality \npreparation, induction, and professional development for teachers, \nearly childhood education providers, principals, and administrators.\n  Improving teacher quality is the single most effective measure we can \ntake to increase student achievement. As Congress turns to the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we must ensure that \neducators receive the training and support necessary to thrive in our \nnation's early childhood programs, elementary schools, and secondary \nschools. We have an opportunity to support the development of educators \nso they not only have the credentials to be considered a ``highly \nqualified teacher'' under the No Child Left Behind Act, but also the \nskills and training to be truly effective in the classroom. By \nstrengthening the teacher preparation grants in Title II of the Higher \nEducation Act, my legislation will accomplish both of these important \ngoals.\n  Teacher attrition undermines teacher quality and creates teacher \nshortages. According to the National Commission on Teaching and \nAmerica's Future, one-third of beginning teachers leave the profession \nwithin three years, and nearly one-half leave within five years. In \nhigh poverty schools turnover rates are even worse--approximately one-\nthird higher than the rate for all teachers. The PRREP Act would create \na year-long clinical learning experience for prospective teachers, and \nestablish a comprehensive induction program, including high quality \nmentoring, for new teachers in at least their first two years of \nteaching. Research consistently shows that induction programs reduce \nthe number of teachers who leave their schools or the profession. \nComprehensive induction programs can cut that number by half or more.\n  Additionally, my legislation strengthens teacher preparation programs \nso that teachers will reach their maximum potential to positively \naffect student achievement. A focus on scientific knowledge of \neffective teaching skills and methods of student learning will equip \nteachers to understand and respond to diverse student populations, \nincluding students with disabilities, limited-English proficient \nstudents, and students with different learning styles or special \nlearning needs. The legislation also seeks to ensure that teachers have \nthe ability to integrate technology into the classroom, use assessments \nto improve instructional practices and curriculum, and communicate with \nand involve parents in their children's education.\n  My legislation further focuses on teaching skills and learning \nstrategies by including in the partnership grants academic departments \nsuch as psychology, human development, or one with comparable expertise \nin the disciplines of teaching, learning, and child and adolescent \ndevelopment. The PRREP Act also would include early childhood educators \nfor the first time in teacher preparation programs.\n  Teacher preparation grants under Title II of the Higher Education Act \nare currently funded at only $60 million a year--far too small of an \ninvestment for this critical enterprise. The stakes are too high, not \njust in terms of meeting the highly qualified requirements of the No \nChild Left Behind Act, but also for real students in real classrooms. \nMy bill significantly boosts this funding, authorizing $500 million for \nthese vital programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work for its \ninclusion in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nin consultation with the Secretary of Education, to develop a voluntary \npolicy for managing the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis in \nschools, to establish school-based food allergy management grants, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Food Allergy \nand Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2007. Food allergies are an \nincreasing food safety and public health concern in this country, \nespecially among young children. I know firsthand just how frightening \nfood allergies can be in a young person's life. My own family has been \npersonally touched by this troubling condition and we continue to \nstruggle with it each and every day. Sadly, there is no cure for food \nallergies.\n  In the past 5 years, the number of Americans with food allergies has \nnearly doubled from 6 million to almost 12 million. While food \nallergies were at one time considered relatively infrequent, today they \nrank 3rd among common chronic diseases in children under 18 years of \nage. Peanuts are among several allergenic foods that can produce life \nthreatening allergic reactions in susceptible children. Peanut \nallergies have doubled among school age children from 1997-2002.\n  Clearly, food allergies are of great concern for school age children \nnationwide, and yet, there are no federal guidelines concerning the \nmanagement of life threatening food allergies in our Nation's schools.\n  I have heard from parents, teachers and school administrators that \nstudents with severe food allergies often face inconsistent food \nallergy management approaches when they change schools. Too often, \nfamilies are not aware of the food allergy policy at their children's \nschool, or the policy is vastly different from the one they knew at \ntheir previous school, and they are left wondering whether their child \nis safe.\n  Recently, Connecticut became the first State to enact school-based \nguidelines concerning food allergies and the prevention of life \nthreatening incidents in schools. I am very proud of these efforts, and \nI know that the parents of children who suffer from food allergies in \nConnecticut have confidence that their children are safe throughout the \nschool day. States such as Massachusetts and Tennessee have enacted \nsimilar guidelines and Vermont, New Jersey, Arizona, Michigan and New \nYork have either passed or have pending legislation to enact statewide \nguidelines. But too many States across the country have food allergy \nmanagement guidelines that are inconsistent from one school district to \nthe next. The result is a patchwork of guidelines that not only may \nvary from state to state, but also from school district to school \ndistrict.\n\n  In my view, this lack of consistency underscores the need for \nenactment of uniform Federal policies that school districts can choose \nto adopt and implement. For this reason, I am introducing the Food \nAllergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2007 today to address the \ngrowing need for uniform and consistent school-based food allergy \nmanagement policy. The bill I am introducing today closely mirrors \nlegislation I introduced last Congress with former Senator Frist. I \nthank him for his past leadership and commitment to this important \nlegislation.\n  The legislation does two things. First, it directs the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of \nEducation, to develop and make available voluntary food allergy \nmanagement guidelines for preventing exposure to food allergens and \nassuring a prompt response when a student suffers a potentially fatal \nanaphylactic reaction. The guidelines developed by the Secretary are \nvoluntary, not mandatory. Under the legislation, each school district \nacross the country can voluntarily choose to implement these \nguidelines. The intent of the legislation is not to mandate individual \nschool policy, but rather to provide for consistency of policies \nrelating to school-based food allergy management by providing schools \nwith consistent guidelines at the Federal level.\n  Second, the bill provides for incentive grants to school districts to \nassist them with adoption and implementation of the federal \ngovernment's allergy management guidelines in all K-12 public schools.\n  I would like to recognize the leadership of Congresswoman Nita Lowey \nwho is introducing companion legislation today in the House of \nRepresentatives. She has been a longstanding champion for children and \nfor awareness of the devastating impact of food allergies. I also wish \nto acknowledge and offer my sincere appreciation to the members of the \nFood Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network for their commitment to this \nlegislation and for raising public awareness, providing advocacy, and \nadvancing research on behalf of all individuals who suffer from food \nallergies.\n  This legislation is supported by the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis \nNetwork and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. I \nask unanimous consent that letters of support from these organizations \nbe printed in the Record.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate and in the House will \nconsider and pass this important legislation before the end of the year \nso that the Department of Health and Human Services can begin work on \ndeveloping national guidelines as soon as possible. Schoolchildren \nacross the country deserve nothing less than a safe and healthy \nlearning environment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                      American Academy of Allergy,\n\n\n                                          Asthma & Immunology,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) to express \n     our strong support for your legislation, the Food Allergy and \n     Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2007, which would make \n     available to schools appropriate guidelines for the \n     management of students with food allergy who are at risk of \n     anaphylactic shock. The AAAAI is the largest professional \n     medical specialty organization in the United States \n     representing allergists, asthma specialists, clinical \n     immunologists, allied health professionals and others \n     dedicated to improving the treatment of allergic diseases \n     through research and education.\n       The number of schoolchildren with food allergies has \n     increased dramatically in recent years. The policy developed \n     under your bill would assist schools in preventing exposure \n     to food allergens and assuring a prompt response when a child \n     suffers a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction.\n       Strict avoidance of the offending food is the only way to \n     prevent an allergic reaction as there is no cure for food \n     allergy. Fatalities from anaphylaxis often result from \n     delayed administration of epinephrine. The importance of \n     managing life-threatening food allergies in the school \n     setting has been recognized by our own organization as well \n     as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, and the National Association of School Nurses.\n       The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology \n     applauds your efforts to address the need to assist schools \n     with the policies and information needed to improve the \n     management of children with food allergy and avoid life-\n     threatening reactions. We are pleased to endorse your \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas B. Casale, President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  The Food Allergy\n\n\n                                        & Anaphylaxis Network,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2007.\n     Senator Christopher Dodd,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the Food Allergy and \n     Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), I write to express strong support \n     for the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2007. \n     This important piece of legislation directs the Department of \n     Health and Human Services to develop guidelines for schools \n     to\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n     prevent exposure to food allergens and assure a prompt \n     response when a child suffers a potentially fatal \n     anaphylactic reaction.\n       FAAN was established in 1991 to raise public awareness, \n     provide advocacy and education, and advance research on \n     behalf of the more than 12 million Americans affected by food \n     allergies and anaphylaxis. FAAN has nearly 30,000 members \n     worldwide, including families, dietitians, nurses, \n     physicians, and school staff as well as representatives of \n     government agencies and the food and pharmaceutical \n     industries.\n       An estimated 2 million school age children suffer from food \n     allergies, for which there is no cure. Avoiding any and all \n     products with allergy-causing ingredients is the only way to \n     prevent potentially life-threatening reactions for our \n     children. Reactions often occur at school including severe \n     anaphylaxis, which can kill within minutes unless epinephrine \n     (adrenaline) is administered. Deaths from anaphylaxis are \n     usually a result of delayed administration of epinephrine. \n     Nevertheless, there are no current, standardized guidelines \n     to help schools safely manage students with the disease.\n       The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network applauds your \n     effort to address the seriousness of food allergies and \n     create a safe learning environment for those children who \n     deal with these issues on a daily basis. We are pleased to \n     endorse your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anne Munoz Furlong,\n     Founder and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis \n     Management Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Food allergy is an increasing food safety and public \n     health concern in the United States, especially among \n     students.\n       (2) Peanut allergy doubled among children from 1997 to \n     2002.\n       (3) In a 2004 survey of 400 elementary school nurses, 37 \n     percent reported having at least 10 students with severe food \n     allergies and 62 percent reported having at least 5.\n       (4) Forty-four percent of the elementary school nurses \n     surveyed reported that the number of students in their school \n     with food allergy had increased over the past 5 years, while \n     only 2 percent reported a decrease.\n       (5) In a 2001 study of 32 fatal food-allergy induced \n     anaphylactic reactions (the largest study of its kind to \n     date), more than half (53 percent) of the individuals were \n     aged 18 or younger.\n       (6) Eight foods account for 90 percent of all food-allergic \n     reactions: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, \n     wheat, and soy.\n       (7) Currently, there is no cure for food allergies; strict \n     avoidance of the offending food is the only way to prevent a \n     reaction.\n       (8) Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction that can \n     kill within minutes.\n       (9) Food-allergic reactions are the leading cause of \n     anaphylaxis outside the hospital setting, accounting for an \n     estimated 30,000 emergency room visits, 2,000 \n     hospitalizations, and 150 to 200 deaths each year in the \n     United States.\n       (10) Fatalities from anaphylaxis are associated with a \n     delay in the administration of epinephrine (adrenaline), or \n     when epinephrine was not administered at all. In a study of \n     13 food allergy-induced anaphylactic reactions in school-age \n     children (6 fatal and 7 near fatal), only 2 of the children \n     who died received epinephrine within 1 hour of ingesting the \n     allergen, and all but 1 of the children who survived received \n     epinephrine within 30 minutes.\n       (11) The importance of managing life-threatening food \n     allergies in the school setting has been recognized by the \n     American Medical Association, the American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and \n     Immunology, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and \n     Immunology, and the National Association of School Nurses.\n       (12) There are no Federal guidelines concerning the \n     management of life-threatening food allergies in the school \n     setting.\n       (13) Three-quarters of the elementary school nurses \n     surveyed reported developing their own training guidelines.\n       (14) Relatively few schools actually employ a full-time \n     school nurse. Many are forced to cover more than 1 school, \n     and are often in charge of hundreds if not thousands of \n     students.\n       (15) Parents of students with severe food allergies often \n     face entirely different food allergy management approaches \n     when their students change schools or school districts.\n       (16) In a study of food allergy reactions in schools and \n     day-care settings, delays in treatment were attributed to a \n     failure to follow emergency plans, calling parents instead of \n     administering emergency medications, and an inability to \n     administer epinephrine.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide and enhance intervention, rehabilitive \ntreatment, and services to veterans with traumatic brain injury, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I, along with my good friend and \nranking member, Senator Craig, introduce comprehensive legislation to \nimprove the capacity of the Department of Veterans Affairs to care for \nveterans with traumatic brain injuries, otherwise referred to as TBI.\n  TBI has become the signature wound of the Iraq war. Blast injuries \naccount for over 60 percent of all combat wounds suffered by U.S. \nforces in Iraq. The brain can be harmed by the shock of an explosion, \nor by rattling or striking of the head as a consequence of the \nexplosion. The high incidence of powerful explosive attacks means that \npotentially thousands of OIF/OEF veterans have incurred some form of \nbrain damage or impairment. Many servicemembers who would have perished \nfrom their wounds in earlier conflicts are now saved by modern body \narmor and rapid medical evacuation. Although these individuals survive, \nmany of them suffer brain damage in addition to other injuries. There \nmust be new approaches to best meet the health care needs of these \nveterans.\n  On March 27, 2007, I chaired a Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing \non VA's ability to deal with war injuries, including TBI. The \nprovisions of this bill are a direct outgrowth of that hearing and the \ntestimony given by those who suffer with TBI.\n  This bill addresses the immediate needs of veterans with TBI for \nhigh-quality rehabilitation in their communities, and provides VA \nclinicians with increased resources to develop the expertise and \ncapacity to meet the lifelong needs of these veterans. The bill has \nseven core provisions, and authorizes a total of $63 million over 6 \nyears to support new TBI-related initiatives. While this amounts to \nsignificant new funding, every dollar was included in our Committee's \nViews and Estimates Letter to the Budget Committee, and was \nsubsequently included in the Senate-passed Budget Resolution.\n  I will highlight a few of the provisions of this legislation:\n  First, VA health care providers would be required to develop a \ncomprehensive rehabilitation and community reintegration plan for each \nveteran with TBI. A diverse team of VA health care providers would be \nrequired to review and refine the plan to adapt to the needs of the \nveteran. Giving an injured veteran or their caregiver an opportunity to \nrequest a review of the rehabilitation plan would ensure VA's \nresponsiveness to the needs of these individuals. This provision stems \ndirectly from the hearing testimony of Denise Mettie, whose severely \ninjured son Evan went for months without a coherent, well-thought-out \nrehabilitation plan.\n  Second, as we heard from the story by ABC news anchor Bob Woodruff, \nwho himself suffered a TBI, VA's four lead polytrauma centers have \ndeveloped significant expertise in rehabilitative care, but most other \nVA facilities lack capacity for specialized TBI services. The bill \nwould require VA to implement the individualized plan through outside \nproviders in cases where VA is unable to provide the required intensity \nof care or the veteran lives too far away to make VA treatment \nfeasible. This provision is inspired by the hearing testimony of Dr. \nBruce Gans, who called for greater private sector involvement in \nveterans' rehabilitation in those cases where VA lacks capacity or \ngeographic reach. Our goal is to ensure that VA care is the finest in \nthe country. When VA cannot adequately serve veterans with TBI, \ncommunity providers need to be utilized.\n  Third, care for veterans with severe TBI often leads to nursing home \ncare. This legislation would give VA providers, in collaboration with \nthe Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, the ability to conduct \ninnovative research and treatment to ``re-awaken'' veterans with severe \nTBI, by making $15 million available for research and care over 5 \nyears.\n  Finally, the legislation makes available $48 million over 6 years for \nVA to maximize the independence, quality of life, and community \nreintegration of veterans with TBI who are unable to manage routine \nactivities of daily living. These funds would be available for an \nassisted living pilot program for those with TBI, so that veterans who \nmight otherwise be forced into institutional long-term care will \ninstead have an opportunity to live in group homes or under other \narrangements. The bill also requires special consideration for rural \nveteran participation in this pilot program.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this innovative and \ncomprehensive legislation, which will bring hope and progress to many \nbrain injured veterans and their families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today as the Ranking Member of the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Akaka, who serves as the Chairman of the Committee, \nin introducing this important legislation to assist veterans who suffer \nfrom a traumatic brain injury.\n  Every so often an issue of incredible importance confronts this \ninstitution and government as whole. And when it does, it is critical \nthat we here in Congress cut through the politics of this institution \nand the red tape of government and do what is right and necessary for \nAmericans in need. The bill Senator Akaka and I are introducing today \nis one of those times and veterans with traumatic brain injury is one \nof those issues.\n  Sadly, hundreds and perhaps even thousands of our dedicated \nservicemen\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nand women are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with mild, moderate, \nand even severe head trauma. Improvised Explosive Devices detonating \nregularly throughout Iraq have exposed our soldiers, sailors, airmen \nand Marines to countless instances in which a TBI can occur. The long-\nterm consequences of these injuries are, in many ways, unknown to us. \nThere's so much modern medicine doesn't know about how the brain \nfunctions, let alone how little we know about the consequences of small \nchanges in its functioning.\n  Still, it is incumbent on us to do everything in our power to provide \nthe best care and services to those servicemembers and veterans in need \nof TBI care and rehabilitation. To that end, Senator Akaka and I \nbelieve that quality TBI care must include certain elements, which this \nlegislation would impose on VA.\n  Most important among these new requirements is the directive for VA \nto provide every veteran who has an inpatient stay for a TBI with an \nindividual plan for rehabilitation and reintegration. This may sound to \nmany of my colleagues like a very simple, and thus unimportant, \nrequirement. But, I believe it is a critical component of recovery.\n  It is a requirement that patients, families, doctors, nurses, social \nworkers, etc., sit down and develop a detailed plan to maximize the \nchances of recovery and independent living at some point in the future \nfor an injured servicemember or veteran. In short, it is the start of \nthe road to recovery.\n  In addition to the requirement for individual plans, VA must be given \nsome flexibility to seek out private care services when the situation \nor the severity of the traumatic brain injury calls for it. This \nlegislation would establish the parameters for receipt of that care and \nI believe send an important message to VA and our wounded veterans that \nwe want the best care possible regardless of whether it is obtained \nthrough a door with the letters V-A over them or through a door with a \ndifferent name.\n  Also, this bill would establish a research, clinical care, and \neducation program for traumatic brain injury. The program would be \nmodeled on VA's very successful Mental Illness Research, Education and \nClinical Care program as well as the special programs for Parkinson's \ndisease and geriatric medicine. The nation must invest in learning more \nabout the debilitating conditions that accompany a traumatic brain \ninjury so that one day we might look forward to better treatment and, \nmost importantly, a better quality of life for these heroes.\n  Finally, the legislation would create a pilot program for assisted \nliving for veterans with severe traumatic brain injury. I recognize \nthat generally assisted living is not a program that VA has embraced in \nthe past. But, the sheer number of those suffering with TBI and the \nseverity of those conditions demand that we once again consider \nassisted living as a viable means of providing some quality of life to \nveterans and their families. And I am proud that assisted living will \nonce again be a component of care provided by VA.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. The \nChairman and I are very proud of the work we've done together in this \nlegislation. I see a lot of progress in VA with respect to the care \nthey are providing all of our wounded soldiers and veterans. But, more \ncan be done.\n  I think this bill will move VA further in the direction they are \nheading and provide veterans with traumatic brain injuries an \nopportunity to achieve a full and productive life.\n  With that, again, I want to again thank Chairman Akaka for his work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1234. A bill to strengthen the liability of parent companies for \nviolations of sanctions by foreign entities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Stop \nBusiness With Terrorists Act of 2007. Senator Clinton is joining me as \nan original cosponsor of this important bill. This bill will shut down \na source of revenue that flows to terrorists and rogue regimes that \nthreaten our nation's security.\n  President Bush has made the statement that money is the lifeblood of \nterrorist operations. He could not be more right. Amazingly, some of \nour corporations are providing revenue to terrorists by doing business \nwith these rogue regimes. My bill is simple. It closes a loophole in \nthe law that allows American companies to do business with our enemies.\n  Our current sanctions laws prohibit United States companies from \ndoing business directly with Iran, but the law contains a loophole. It \nenables an American company to create a foreign-based subsidiary that \ncan do business with that prohibited country. As long as this loophole \nis in place, our sanctions laws have no teeth.\n  My bill will close this loophole once and for all and will cut off a \nmajor source of revenue for terrorists. It will require foreign \nsubsidiaries that are majority controlled by a U.S. parent company to \nfollow U.S. sanctions laws. For those companies that would need to \ndivest from such a situation, they would have 90 days to do so. This is \na simple concept with significant impact.\n  It is critical that we starve these rogue regimes and the terrorists \nthey support at the source. Of the companies that are taking advantage \nof this loophole, the country that has benefited the most has been \nIran. And as we know, Iran funds Hamas, Hezbollah, the Palestinian \nIslamic Jihad, and other terrorist organizations.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n1965 regarding highly qualified teachers, growth models, adequate \nyearly progress, Native American language programs, and parental \ninvolvement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing entitled the School Accountability Improvements Act. We all \nknow about No Child Left Behind, the Federal legislation that was \nintroduced in 2001. We recognize that NCLB made significant changes to \nFederal requirements for school districts in our States. Many of these \nchanges have been very positive and truly quite necessary. Because of \nNo Child Left Behind, there is clearly more national attention being \npaid to ensure that school districts and the States are held \naccountable for the achievement of students with disabilities and for \nthose who are economically disadvantaged and for minority students.\n  In Alaska, this has meant, for example, that more of our urban school \ndistricts are paying closer attention than ever to the needs of our \nAlaska Native students. People across the Nation are also more aware \nthat a teacher's knowledge of the subject matter and his or her ability \nto teach that subject are perhaps the most important factors in a \nchild's achievement in school. Teachers, parents, administrators, and \ncommunities have more data now than they have ever had, more data about \nthe achievement of the individual students and the subgroups of \nstudents and about our schools. With that data, we are making changes \nto school policies and procedures, and more students are now getting \nthe help they need to succeed.\n  While these are just a few of the positive effects of No Child Left \nBehind, we recognize there have been problems. This is not surprising, \nas it is quite difficult to write one law that will work for a large \nurban city such as New York City in the East and have that be made \ngenerally applicable to a small remote rural community such as \nNuiqsuit, AK.\n  My bill, the School Accountability Improvements Act, is meant to \naddress five issues that we have identified in Alaska that are of \nparticular concern to our State and of equal concern to other States. \nThe first area we are focusing on would give flexibility to States \nregarding NCLB's highly qualified teacher requirements. In very small \nrural schools, particularly in my State, we will see a school where you \nhave one teacher who is tasked with teaching multiple course subjects \nin the middle and in the high school grades.\n  Under NCLB, the requirement is that the teacher must be highly \nqualified in each of these subject matter areas. But I have been \nlistening to some of the teachers out in my remote communities. They \nmay be hired to be the English teacher, but in a remote community with \na small school, something may happen during the year. Say, the science \nteacher or the math teacher has left in the middle of the school year--\nnot an uncommon situation--they are not able to get anyone into that \nschool to help. So now the English teacher is tasked to teach another \nsubject.\n  Under NCLB, he or she would then be required to be highly qualified \nin every subject they teach. So what my legislation would allow is for \nmiddle and high school teachers who work in schools with fewer than 200 \nstudents and that have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified \nteachers in these areas to be deemed to be ``highly qualified'' if they \nhave a degree or they pass a rigorous subject matter test in one of the \ncore subjects they teach, as long as they can demonstrate they are \nhighly effective at delivering instruction on a State-developed \nperformance assessment.\n  We are doing this in the State of Alaska now, where essentially a \nteacher can demonstrate, through the use of a video, their teaching \nmethodology. But we must recognize we will have situations in our \nsmaller schools, in our rural schools, where in order to be highly \nqualified in every core subject area they are teaching, we simply are \nnot able to meet that. So we are asking for a level of flexibility for \nthe States.\n  We recognize it is vital that the teachers know the subjects they \nteach. This is critical. But it is also unreasonable to expect teachers \nin these very tiny schools to meet the current requirements in every \nsingle subject they may end up teaching. It is almost impossible for \nschool districts to find and then hire such teachers. So this provision \nis offered as a compromise in these limited situations.\n  The second area the legislation focuses on is how we determine or how \nwe calculate Adequate Yearly Progress. My legislation would require the \nU.S. Department of Education to approve a State's use of a growth model \nfor calculating Adequate Yearly Progress if that model meets the core \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind.\n  Now, we know it can be useful for teachers, certainly for the \nadministrators, to know how one group of third grade students, how one \nclass compares to, say, the next year's class. But it is much more \nuseful for educators, students, and parents to know how well each \nindividual child has mastered each year's State standards.\n  As a parent, yes, I want to know how my son's class is advancing as a \nwhole. But as a parent, I want to know how he is doing from year to \nyear, not just how his third grade class did and how the next class \ncoming up behind him is going to do. I want to know what it means for \nme and my child as an individual.\n  Schools should be held accountable for how well they are addressing \neach child's needs. Is the child proficient? Is he or she on track to \nbe proficient? Or is he or she falling behind? These are things parents \nwant to know. Are the schools making great progress in bringing all \nchildren to great proficiency, or are they maybe just missing the mark, \nor are they having very systemic difficulties? We know so many of the \nStates now have very robust data systems that will allow them to track \nthis information. NCLB should allow them to use the statistical model \nthat is going to be most useful. It will actually be the best indicator \nof how each child is doing.\n  Another area the legislation addresses is the issue of school choice \nand tutoring. As you know, No Child Left Behind gives parents an \nopportunity to move their children out of a dysfunctional school. If \nthe school fails to meet AYP 2 years running, then the next choice that \nis offered the parent is your child can go to another school. In some \nparts of my State, that is geographically, physically impossible, and \nwe have made accommodations around that. In the more urban school \ndistricts in Alaska, what we have found is parents are not choosing, as \na general rule, to exercise that option. They are looking for something \nelse. The law requires school districts to offer the school choice and \nto set aside funds to pay for the transportation in year 2 of \nimprovement status. Then, in year 3, schools are required to offer \ntutoring if they reach that needs improvement status then.\n  What I am suggesting in my legislation as to school choice is that \nmoving children in year 2, if we fail to meet Adequate Yearly Progress, \nis too early in the process. Schools should be given the opportunity to \naddress their deficiencies first, addressing them first within the \nschool before they transport the students all over town. I think most \nparents agree with this. This is why, at least in Alaska, we are seeing \nfewer than 2 percent of parents choosing to transfer their children to \nanother school. They would rather have those supplemental services \noffered in the school to see if they can't help address the needs of \nthe child. Then if it still does not work, let's look to the next \noption.\n  So my bill would flip the school choice and the tutoring. It would \nalso limit the requirement for schools to offer these options to \nstudents who are not proficient rather than to all the children, \nincluding those who are being well served by the school. It would also \nallow the school districts to provide tutoring to students even if they \nare in improvement status. It is recognizing, again, we should look at \nthe individual child and see if we can't tailor this to make it more \nresponsive.\n  As you know, assessing whether a child is proficient on State \nstandards in a reliable and valid way is difficult. It is even more \ndifficult when the child has a disability or has limited \nEnglish proficiency. Research has not caught up with assessments for \nthese subgroups, and no one is completely sure\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nwhether the tests they are giving these students are measuring what \nthey know. Yet, NCLB requires that if a school does not make AYP for \nany subgroup for 6 years, the school district has the option to \ncompletely restructure that school. Similarly, a State has the option \nto restructure an entire school district.\n\n  For those truly dysfunctional schools and districts, that may be \nappropriate as determined by the individual district or State. But if \nwe do not even know if the assessment scores are valid and reliable, \nhow do we justify taking over a school, firing its teachers, turning \nits governance over to another entity, or other such drastic measures? \nWe cannot. But we recognize that each child with a disability, and each \nchild who is limited English proficient deserves the best possible \neducation.\n  So that is why my bill would not allow a school or a school district \nto be restructured if: No. 1, the school missed AYP for one or both of \nthose subgroups alone; and, No. 2, the school can show through a growth \nmodel that the students in those two subgroups are on track to be \nproficient.\n  Another area in the legislation we focus on is our Native heritage \nlanguages. In Alaska, Hawaii, and several other States, Native \nAmericans are working hard to keep their heritage languages and their \ncultures alive. Teachers will tell you, and the research backs them up, \nthat Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, and American Indian students \nlearn better when their heritage is a respected and vibrant part of \ntheir education. This is true of any child, but I think particularly \ntrue for these groups of Americans.\n  Many schools around the country that serve these students have \nincorporated native language programs into their early curriculums--the \ncurriculums in grades K-3. The problem is that in many instances, there \nis no valid and reliable way to assess whether the students have \nlearned their State standards in that language. Neither is it valid to \ntest what a student knows in a language they do not speak well.\n  The example I will give you is that in the Lower Kuskokwim School \nDistrict, in many of the schools, in an effort to get the children to \nconnect with their education and to connect with their Yupik heritage, \nYupik is taught in grades K-3. It is an immersion level program. If you \ngo out there, the children are reading in Yupik. They are doing their \nmath in Yupik. They are doing science experiments in Yupik. But then, \nin grade 3, they are required to test, under NCLB, in English.\n  Now, not surprisingly, the children are not doing well on these \ntests. We need to anticipate the results. If you have not taught a \nchild in a language in which they are going to be tested, perhaps, \ninitially, they are not going to be performing at the level we want.\n  I want to impress upon my colleagues the importance I believe we \nshould place on allowing for those heritage languages to be preserved, \nto encourage our students in languages. Our research tells us--and I \ncan tell you from a very personal experience with my two boys, who were \npart of a Spanish immersion program from the time they were in \nkindergarten through 8th grade in the public schools in Anchorage, they \nlearned their sciences and math and geography and all their subjects in \nSpanish as well as English. Initially, you are a little anxious \nbecause: Are the test scores going to measure up? But what we can tell \nyou is that by the time the children are being tested, certainly up in \nmiddle school, they are not only testing strong--very strong in both \nlanguages--but they know a second language very well.\n  What my legislation will do in this area is allow schools with Native \nAmerican language programs in States where there is no assessment in \nthat heritage language to count the third graders--the first time they \ntake the standardized tests--to count the students for participation \nrate only. It would then allow the school to make AYP if those students \nare proficient or on track to be proficient in grades 4 through 7.\n  Then, the final area of my legislation is what I am calling the \nparent piece. As a parent, we know--you know; my colleague from the \nState of Washington was very involved with education before she came to \nthe Senate as well--we all know as parents how important it is to be \ninvolved in our children's education.\n  At the end of the day, not only did my husband and I check on our \nboys' homework, we asked them: What happened today? What is going on? I \nwas PTA president at my kids' elementary school.\n  NCLB recognizes that in many ways it is very important that parents \nare part of a child's education. But we also recognize we can be doing \nmore. My bill would amend title II of NCLB, which authorizes subgrants \nfor preparing, training, and recruiting teachers and principals, to \nallow--but not mandate--these funds to be used to develop parental \nengagement strategies, to train educators to communicate more \neffectively with parents, and better involve parents in their schools.\n  We all know how great our Nation's teachers are. But our reality is, \nvery few of them graduate from college having had a course on how to \neffectively communicate with parents. They know how important it is, \nbut they are taught no techniques. Teachers are busy people. When a \nparent shows up at a classroom door and says: Hey, I am here to help, \nteachers often do not know how to react, how to allow them to help. \nMany teachers have difficulty communicating with parents, who may be \nworking two jobs or have a different cultural background or language. \nThis section of the bill would allow schools to spend some of their \nteacher training funds on these sorts of issues if they feel it would \nbenefit their students.\n  I know these five issues are not the only ones my colleagues and \nAmericans may have with the No Child Left Behind Act. I have been \ntalking with Alaskans all over the State about NCLB since I first came \nto the Senate. I look forward to working very hard on the \nreauthorization of the law this year with my colleagues. These, though, \nare the five issues that educators and parents in Alaska have told me \nare the most urgent for them, and I look forward to working to include \nthem in the reauthorization as we move forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the provision by hospitals receiving \nFederal funds through the Medicare program or Medicaid program of \nemergency contraceptives to women who are survivors of sexual assault; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, in recognition of National Crime \nVictim's Week, I am proud to reintroduce the ``Compassionate Assistance \nfor Rape Emergencies Act,'' a bill that will help rape and incest \nsurvivors across the country get the medical care they need and \ndeserve.\n  Women deserve access to emergency contraception. For millions of \nwomen, it represents peace of mind. For survivors of rape and incest, \nit allows them to avoid the additional trauma of facing an unintended \npregnancy. This bill makes emergency contraception available for \nsurvivors of rape and incest at any hospital receiving public funds.\n  Every 2 minutes a woman is sexually assaulted in the U.S. and each \nyear, 25 to 32,000 women become pregnant as a result of rape or incest. \nAccording to a study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics \nand Gynecology, 50 percent of those pregnancies end in abortion.\n  By providing access to emergency contraception, up to 95 percent of \nthose unintended pregnancies could be prevented if emergency \ncontraception is administered within the first 24 to 72 hours.\n  I am proud that for 4 years, this has already been law in New York \nState. Survivors of rape and incest receive information and access to \nemergency contraception at every hospital in the State. In New York \nCity, women are benefiting from Mayor Bloomberg's significant \ninitiative to expand access to emergency contraception and family \nplanning services and improve maternal and infant outcomes. I applaud \nthis focus on increasing awareness about emergency contraception--to \nall women--so that we can work together at decreasing the rate of \nunintended pregnancy in this country.\n  Last year, the FDA made emergency contraception available over the \ncounter for women 18 years of age and older. Despite the ideologically \ndriven agenda against Plan B, research shows that emergency \ncontraception is safe and effective for preventing pregnancy. More than \n70 major medical organizations, including the American Academy of \nPediatrics, recommended that Plan B be made available over the counter. \nThis bill will make sure hospitals provide women in crisis with the \nnecessary information to evaluate this option for themselves. In \naddition, the bill ensures that patients can receive post-exposure \ntreatment for sexually transmitted infections for which the deferral of \ntreatment either would significantly reduce treatment efficacy or would \npose substantial risk to the individual's health.\n  Public health employees at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention include access to emergency contraception as a protocol and \nviable option for these victims. The U.S. Department of Justice \nguidelines, however, make no reference to emergency contraception as a \npotential option for rape and incest victims. This is why I'm \nintroducing this legislation today.\n  It is my sincere hope that my colleagues join me in the fight to \nbetter protect and serve our Nation's rape and incest survivors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1241.

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act and Farm \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nand Rural Investment Act of 2002 to establish a biofuel pilot program \nto offer crop insurance to producers of experimental biofuel crops and \na program to make loans and loan guarantees to producers of \nexperimental biofuel crops; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise here today to introduce the Biofuel \nCrop Insurance Act to provide a safety net to innovative American \nfarmers.\n  America's addiction to foreign oil is one of the greatest threats to \nour national security and our economy. At the same time climate change \nis threatening the world as we know it. We are experiencing wildly \nshifting weather patterns, prolonged drought, intense hurricanes and \nmelting glaciers and icecaps. We need to do something to change our \nenergy sources to clean and domestic options, and our farmers and rural \ncommunities are leading the way.\n  Unfortunately, some of the best potential crops for biofuel \nproduction lack the same government safety nets like crop insurance and \nloans that our commodity crops have. This legislation is designed to \nchange that by allowing the USDA to expedite the process for approving \ninsurance to dedicated biofuel crops.\n  In the last few years the ethanol industry has experienced explosive \ngrowth. Ethanol is good for farmers, rural communities and our \nconsumers. I for one would rather buy my fuel from farmers in the \nMidwest than dictators in the Mideast.\n  Corn will continue to be king of ethanol for some time. But we need \nto start using other crops for ethanol and biodiesel production, \nbecause if there is one thing that our recent energy crisis has taught \nus it is that diversity is critical. We need to expand the use of crops \nthat don't compete with our food system that can be grown in different \nparts of the country, are more affordable, and require fewer inputs \nthan corn.\n  In Montana, farmers are planting an oil seed crop called camelina \nbecause it can be grown on marginal lands, with few inputs, and high \nprofits. Its oil can be crushed and made into biodiesel on farms and \nsmall communities' rural landscapes. Camelina can be used in rotation \nwith other crops such as wheat and barley and bring new money and new \ndevelopment to rural States like Montana, Washington, Idaho, and the \nDakotas. Montana State University is one of several academic \ninstitutions that have done extensive research into the crop in regards \nto what it needs to grow, where to grow it, and what farmers can expect \nit to produce. All their tests are positive and this year we expect \nthat up to 20,000 acres of camelina will be planted in Montana alone. \nUnfortunately, farmers are hesitant to seize this opportunity because \nthey lack an insurance safety net, and their banks won't loan them \nmoney to plant crops that aren't insured.\n  Being a farmer myself, I know how agriculture is beholden to Mother \nNature. A dry year, a bad hail storm or a late frost can destroy a \nyear's worth of work. Farmers need safety nets, not handouts. Crop \ninsurance is a market mechanism that can mitigate risk for farmers. The \nlegislation I'm introducing today will be directly responsible for \nextensive growth of camelina, and the emergence of a biodiesel industry \nfor States like Montana.\n  If I wasn't here right now, I would be sitting on my tractor in Big \nSandy, MT, planting oil seed crops on my farm and learning how to \nprocess and crush oil seeds to make biodiesel. I use 3,000 gallons of \ndiesel fuel a year on my farm, and anxiously await the day when I can \nuse fuel grown on my land or bought from my neighbors instead of \nimported from overseas.\n  This bill sets up a pilot insurance program for dedicated biofuel \ncrops that displace petroleum products, and provides loans for \nstabilization of farm income and marketing assistance. It also creates \ngrants for research into planting and harvesting techniques and grants \nto study the use of biofuel meal used as animal feeds.\n  I believe this bill will spark a biodiesel industry across the \nNorthern Great Plains and I encourage my colleagues to support this \nlegislation as it moves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Brown, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Biden, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Casey, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 1244.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nProtecting America's Workers Act.\n  This week, on Workers' Memorial Day, we remember those who have been \nkilled or injured on the job, and we reaffirm our commitment to workers \nand their families to do all we can to end these senseless tragedies.\n  We've made progress in protecting worker safety since we passed the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act in 1970.\n  But too many workers still are not safe. In 2005 alone, over 5,700 \nworkers were killed on the job. Over 4 million became ill or were \ninjured. That's nearly 16 deaths and 12,000 workplace injuries or \nillnesses each and every day.\n  Last year, the tragic deaths of miners at Sago and Alma mines showed \nus the gaps and shortcomings in mine safety. Across the country, \nAmerica saw the senseless deaths of workers and the suffering of their \nfamilies and friends. Every day, workers in other industries are facing \nequally dangerous conditions. Those dangers may not make headlines, but \nthey continue to threaten workers' health, their lives, and their \nfamilies' security.\n  One of the most obvious problems is that literally millions of \nemployees today are not covered by our safety laws. Too many other \nfirms blatantly ignore the law and refuse to do what is necessary to \nkeep their employees safe.\n  Too often, as well, we find that those responsible for administering \nour safety laws aren't doing their job--not issuing new safety \nstandards, not vigorously enforcing the law, and not even going after \nthe worst offenders.\n  Many companies are doing too little to deal with this challenge. Some \nemployers blatantly ignore the law, but are rarely held accountable, \neven when their actions or neglect kill a loyal employee who works for \nthem. Criminal penalties are so low that prosecutors don't pursue these \ncases. And employers who repeatedly violate the law--time and time \nagain--pay only minimal fines, which they treat as just another cost of \ndoing business.\n  American workers and their families are paying the price. This \nincludes people like Mike Morrison, who was killed while installing \npipes at a construction site in Florida, when the nine-foot-deep trench \nhe was working in collapsed. An OSHA investigation found that the \ntrench had not been secured properly before workers were sent into it. \nThe employer whose failures had killed Mike was fined a mere $21,000, a \nslap on the wrist. Two years earlier, the company had been cited and \nfined for other safety violations. As Mike's step-daughter Michelle \nsays, ``If the penalties had been more substantial two years ago, maybe \nMike's company would have complied with the law and protected him \nproperly, and maybe he'd still be with us today.''\n  Or Eleazar Torres-Gomez, who was killed working at a laundry facility \nin Tulsa, OK, where he had been employed for seven years. Eleazar was \ndragged into an industrial dryer, where the temperatures were near 300 \ndegrees. The company he worked for had been previously fined for not \ninstalling protective guards on a similar dryer and belt at one of its \nother plants. Eleazar's eldest son Emanuel said, ``If the company had \nadded the guards, which it knew were required by OSHA, my father would \nbe alive today. The sorrow we feel is overwhelming.''\n  And they include workers like Tracee Binion, a science teacher in \nPinson, AL. Tracee became ill after renovations on her school exposed \nher to chemicals in unventilated classrooms. She developed chemical \npneumonitis and chemically-induced asthma, lost weeks of school and to \nthis day must manage her asthma with medication. In Alabama, Tracee and \nthousands of\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nteachers like her are not covered by our safety laws. They have no one \nto call when they need protection from workplace hazards.\n  We need to do everything we can to see that other workers and their \nfamilies don't have to suffer the same grief.\n  Congress can take concrete steps to address many of these failures. \nThat's why today we are reintroducing the Protecting America's Workers \nAct. This legislation will do several key things:\n  It expands the coverage of our safety laws to protect 8.6 million \npublic employees and transportation workers.\n  It requires OSHA to investigate every case where a worker is killed \nor seriously injured. And it gives family members greater rights to be \npart of accident investigations.\n  It also protects workers who speak up about unsafe conditions on the \njob, by bringing OSHA whistleblower laws in line with protections in \nother areas.\n  It puts real teeth in our safety laws by increasing penalties. These \npenalties have not been raised since 1990. This bill sets a minimum \npenalty of $50,000 for a worker's death caused by a willful safety \nviolation. And it increases the maximum criminal penalty for killing or \nseriously injuring a worker to ten years of prison, instead of six \nmonths.\n  Beyond this legislation, we must also find new and smarter ways of \nkeeping workers safe. We must shine a light on OSHA to ensure that our \nsafety laws are implemented the way they were intended--to protect \nworkers by preventing hazards on the job. The administration needs to \nput workers first and get the job done.\n  It's time to send a message to those who put their employees in \nharm's way that life and health must be valued above profit and greed. \nIt's time to redouble our efforts and make our commitment a reality. \nIt's time for Congress to act, so that the hardworking men and women of \nour country get what they deserve at last--the security of a safe and \nhealthy workplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for safe workplaces for \nall of America's workers. The best way for Congress to honor the \nNation's hardworking men and women on this Worker's Memorial Day is to \nend our complacency and see that the full promise of OSHA becomes a \ngenuine reality for every working family in every community in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1245. A bill to reform mutual aid agreements for the National \nCapitol Region; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S5220, April 26, 2007, the following appears: ``S. 1245. \nA bill to reform mutual aid agreements for the National Capitol \nRegion; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.''\n  \n  The online version was corrected to read: ``S. 1245. A bill to \nreform mutual aid agreements for the National Capitol Region; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill improve mutual aid agreements for the National Capitol Region. \nSenators Mikulski and Warner are original co-sponsors of my bill.\n  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 contains \nprovisions for cooperation among the National Capital Region's \njurisdictions in the event of a regional or national emergency. Since \nthat time, a model mutual aid agreement has been approved by 20 of the \n21 jurisdictions in the Washington Council of Governments, the State of \nMaryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority, and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \nAuthority. The model mutual aid agreement is designed to append \noperational plans across the spectrum of public safety disciplines, \nincluding police, fire and rescue, public health, water supply, and \ndebris removal, among others. This has opened the way for the region's \ngovernments to begin hammering out the details of how emergency \nresponses will actually be executed.\n  As the jurisdictions began working on the mutual aid agreements, \nconcern arose that drinking water and wastewater utilities were not \nincluded in the original language. The Metropolitan Washington Council \nof Governments brought this issue to my attention. Today's legislation \nwill remedy the situation by providing a commonsense solution that will \nallow our drinking water and wastewater facilities' staffs to \nparticipate as appropriate in the mutual aid agreements.\n  Current law allows the jurisdictions in the Washington metropolitan \narea to share their personnel freely in the event of a national \nemergency. Firefighters in Fairfax County, for example, could be \nenlisted to support their counterparts in the District of Columbia or \nin Maryland in the event of a national or regional emergency. \nSimilarly, emergency responders in Montgomery and Prince George's \ncounties could support their counterparts in Alexandria or Arlington.\n  This legislation simply extends that same commonsense approach to \ndrinking water and wastewater treatment authorities. If a drinking \nwater plant were to become disabled because of a natural disaster or \nterrorist attack, this bill would allow licensed engineers to cross \njurisdictional boundaries to come to the aid of the disabled system and \nthe thousands of regional residents who depend on these vital systems \nfor safe drinking water.\n  This legislation has the support of the Metropolitan Washington \nCouncil of Governments and the National Capital Region Water Security \nWorkgroup, chaired by the Fairfax County Water Authority.\n  One section of the legislation requires some explanation. That \nsection relates to the terms ``agent'' and ``volunteer.'' It is \nanticipated that the region's localities will rely on a variety of \nauthorized agents and volunteers to assist in fulfilling their mutual \naid response obligations. The act currently includes agents and \nvolunteers in the definition of ``employee'' and requires that all \nagents and volunteers be ``committed in a mutual aid agreement'' to \nprepare for or respond to an emergency. It has become apparent in \ndeveloping operational plans, however, that it is not likely that a \ncomplete list of agents and volunteers will be identified and become \nparties to a mutual aid agreement with one or more of the region's \nlocalities. Instead, it is more likely that agents and volunteers will \nbe associated with a locality through a mechanism other than an actual \nmutual aid agreement. Moreover, it is probable that the association \nwith an agent or volunteer will arise only in direct response to a \nparticular emergency. For example, a locality may find it necessary to \ncall upon volunteer fire companies to respond to a particular fire-\nrelated event that threatens to overwhelm the localities' resources. In \nsuch an instance, the agent and volunteers, as well as the locality \nthat has called upon them, should be accorded the liability protections \nof the act. Perhaps more importantly, it is preferred by the region's \nlocalities that a list of agents and volunteers not be brought within \nthe scope of the act prospectively and on a continuous basis, but only \nas the need arises on a case-by-case basis.\n  The legislation I am introducing today simply strikes ``agents and \nvolunteers'' from the definition of ``employee'' and expressly extends \nthe liability protections of the act to agents. This term, consistent \nwith common dictionary usage, would encompass authorized volunteers. \nThe proposed language was drafted and approved by members of the \nCouncil of Governments' Attorneys Committee, consisting of the lead \ncounsel of all 21 COG jurisdictions, with participation by the two \nState's Attorneys General offices.\n  In short, this legislation will give local jurisdictions the ability \nto respond fully and appropriately to the full range of emergencies \nthat they may face. I urge the Senate to pass this bill as \nexpeditiously as possible so that we can give these local and State \ngovernments the tools they need to meet the challenges that the future \nmay present.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1245\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish and maintain a wildlife global animal \ninformation network for surveillance internationally to combat the \ngrowing threat of emerging diseases that involve wild animals, such as \nbird flu, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, Senator Brownback, Senator \nAkaka, and I are introducing legislation that establishes a wildlife \nglobal animal information network for surveillance to enhance \npreparedness and awareness of emerging infectious diseases.\n  More than 60 percent of the approximately 1,400 currently known \ninfectious diseases are shared between wildlife and humans. Over the \npast 30 years we have had many emerging infectious disease outbreaks, \nincluding hantavirus, plague, ebola, HIV/AIDS, SARS, and H5N1 \ninfluenza. In fact, more than 35 new infectious diseases have emerged \nin humans since 1980, which means that approximately one new infectious \ndisease in humans has appeared every 8 months. These diseases have \nresulted in many deaths and billions of dollars in costs.\n  Millions of wild animals are traded globally and come into contact \nwith humans and dozens of other species, contributing to the \nintroduction of new diseases in humans. There are numerous examples of \nthese spreading viruses that pose significant threats across the globe. \nFor instance, the spreading H5N1 virus, a highly pathogenic avian \ninfluenza (HPAI) strain, is a significant threat to global human \nhealth, the global poultry industry, and the global economy more \ngenerally. The emerging infectious disease HIV/AIDS, whose origin has \nbeen traced back to the human consumption of African nonhuman primates, \nhas had a devastating impact in the developing world, with over 40 \nmillion people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS and 3 million AIDS deaths \nglobally in 2006. Despite the threats that these and future diseases \npose, we lack a comprehensive and coordinated approach to monitoring \nthese emerging infectious diseases and the nexus between wildlife, \npeople, and domestic animals.\n  Our legislation would establish a Wildlife Global Animal Information \nNetwork for Surveillance (GAINS). This Wildlife GAINS system would \ninclude Federal and State agency partners, multilateral agency \npartners, conservation organizations with expertise in wildlife \nmonitoring and surveillance, veterinary and medical schools, and other \nnational and international partners. The legislation encourages the \nestablishment of critical public-private partnerships because of the \nunique strengths and capabilities that NGOs have in developing \ncountries. They will play a key role in assisting developing countries \ndevelop much needed surveillance mechanisms and in facilitating the \ndissemination of critical data to all partners.\n  USAID has taken a leadership role and already committed $192 million \nfor avian influenza preparedness and response activities in developing \ncountries affected by the H5N1 virus. Congress must support these \nefforts establishing a comprehensive worldwide wildlife health \nsurveillance system to detect and track emerging infectious diseases.\n  Wildlife GAINS would be a comprehensive tool to prevent the outbreak \nand spread of new diseases that have no treatments or cures. We must \nprevent and detect the next generation of infectious diseases to \nprevent the pain and suffering that diseases such as HIV/AIDS and H5N1 \nhave caused millions all over the world.\n  Mr. AKAKA. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators \nLieberman and Brownback in introducing legislation establishing a \nwildlife global animal information network for detection of emerging, \nhighly contagious diseases in non-agricultural animals. This bill is an \nimportant part of efforts to prevent and respond to natural or \nintentional pandemic disease outbreaks in the U.S.\n  Our legislation focuses on the source of nearly all pandemic disease \noutbreaks over the last 30 years--zoonotic diseases, or diseases that \noriginate in animals, either agricultural or non-agricultural, and, \nthrough mutation, are passed to humans. Avian influenza, West Nile \nVirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are all zoonotic \ndiseases originating in animals and subsequently transmitted to humans. \nThe prevalence of such diseases underscores the need to link veterinary \nhealth and public health arenas. America's infrastructure for pandemic \nflu preparedness and response should therefore include the ability to \nmonitor zoonotic diseases, creating an early warning and response \nsystem which will alert public health officials and animal health \nexperts at the emergence of highly contagious diseases before they are \npassed to humans.\n  The global animal information network for surveillance proposed in \nthis bill has its roots in the activities of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) to assist countries dealing with the \nmost recent outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. In close \ncooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \nthe Departments of State, Defense, Agriculture, Homeland Security and \nthe Wildlife Conservation Society, USAID is providing assistance to \nthose countries most hard hit by avian influenza. To date, animal \noutbreaks have been reported in 55 countries, and 12 countries have had \nconfirmed human cases. A total of 291 humans have been infected, \nresulting in 172 deaths. This translates into a case fatality rate of \nroughly 60 percent.\n  To date, USAID has committed a total of $192 million for avian \ninfluenza assistance activities in these countries for preparedness and \nresponse. The goal of its activities is to lower the amount of \ncirculating virus and limiting the opportunity for people to become \ninfected with avian flu.\n  Despite these efforts, many of which have demonstrated the \neffectiveness of interventions being used to control the spread of \navian flu, this zoonotic disease continues to mutate and as such, \npersist as a threat, both to animals and to people. The animal \nsurveillance network being proposed in this bill is one critical tool \nto detect other wildlife-based emergent contagious diseases before they \nimpact humans and agricultural animals.\n  While detecting and preventing these highly contagious diseases is \ncritical for human health and economic stability, I would like to \nemphasize that, as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) observed \nin a 2000 report entitled ``West Nile Virus Outbreak: Lessons for \nPublic Health Preparedness'', on the West Nile Virus outbreak in New \nYork City, ``Because a bioterrorist event could look like a natural \noutbreak, bioterrorism preparedness rests in large part on public \nhealth preparedness.'' Creating early warning tools such as this one \ncan aid efforts to protect the U.S. from natural outbreaks and \ndeliberate bioterrorist attacks. While the network alone does not \nprotect us, it does contribute to the mosaic of homeland security \nactivities designed to protect Americans, and those in other countries \nmost vulnerable to bioterrorist attacks.\n  It is for this reason that I am pleased to join Senators Lieberman \nand Brownback in introducing this bill and urge its support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5221-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5221-S5222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 173--DESIGNATING AUGUST 11, 2007, AS ``NATIONAL \n                              MARINA DAY''\n\n  Ms. STABENOW submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

and\n       (3) vigorously exercising in its parliament, the Knesset, a \n     democratic government that is fully representative of its \n     citizens;\n\n       Whereas Israel has bravely defended itself from terrorist \n     and military attacks repeatedly since Israel declared its \n     independence;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel has successfully worked \n     with the neighboring governments of Egypt and Jordan to \n     establish peaceful bilateral relations;\n       Whereas, despite the deaths of over 1,000 innocent citizens \n     of Israel at the hands of murderous suicide bombers and other \n     terrorists since 2002, the people of Israel continue to seek \n     peace with their Palestinian neighbors;\n       Whereas several Israeli soldiers remain hostages of \n     terrorist groups, and were unable to celebrate the \n     Independence Day of Israel with their families and friends;\n       Whereas successive leaders of Israel have sought peace in \n     the Middle East;\n       Whereas the United States and Israel enjoy a strategic \n     partnership based on shared democratic values, friendship, \n     and respect;\n       Whereas the people of the United States share an affinity \n     with the people of Israel and view Israel as a strong and \n     trusted ally;\n       Whereas Israel has made significant global contributions in \n     the fields of science, medicine, and technology;\n       Whereas the Independence Day of Israel on the Jewish \n     calendar coincides this year with April 24, 2007;

which was referred to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas even though African-Americans were excluded from \n     playing in the Major Leagues of their time with their white \n     counterparts, the desire of many African-Americans to play \n     baseball could not be repressed;\n       Whereas Major League Baseball did not fully integrate its \n     leagues until July 1959;\n       Whereas African-Americans began organizing their own \n     professional baseball teams in 1885;\n       Whereas the skills and abilities of Negro League players \n     eventually made Major League Baseball realize the need to \n     integrate the sport;\n       Whereas 7 separate baseball leagues, known collectively as \n     the ``Negro Baseball Leagues'', were organized by African-\n     Americans between 1920 and 1960;\n       Whereas the Negro Baseball Leagues included exceptionally \n     talented players who played the game at its highest level;\n       Whereas on May 20, 1920, the Negro National League, the \n     first successful Negro League, played its first game;\n       Whereas Andrew ``Rube'' Foster founded the Negro National \n     League on February 13, 1920, at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas \n     City, Missouri, and also managed and played for the Chicago \n     American Giants, and was later inducted into the Baseball \n     Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Leroy ``Satchel'' Paige, who began his long career \n     in the Negro Leagues and did not make his Major League debut \n     until the age of 42, is considered one of the greatest \n     pitchers the game has ever seen, and during his long career \n     thrilled millions of baseball fans with his skill and \n     legendary showboating, helping the Cleveland Indians win the \n     pennant in his first big league victory beginning with his \n     first game on July 15, 1948, and was later inducted into the \n     Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Josh Gibson, who was the greatest slugger of the \n     Negro Leagues, tragically died months before the integration \n     of baseball, and was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of \n     Fame;\n       Whereas Jackie Robinson, whose career began with the Negro \n     League Kansas City Monarchs, became the first African-\n     American to play in the Major Leagues in April 1947, was \n     named Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947, \n     subsequently led the Brooklyn Dodgers to 6 National League \n     pennants and a World Series championship, and was later \n     inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas Larry Doby, whose career began with the Negro \n     League Newark Eagles, became the first African-American to \n     play in the American League in July 1947, was an All-Star 9 \n     times in Negro League and Major League Baseball, and was \n     later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame;\n       Whereas John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil was a player and \n     manager of the Negro League Kansas City Monarchs, became the \n     first African-American coach in the Major Leagues with the \n     Chicago Cubs in 1962, served on the Veterans Committee of the \n     National Baseball Hall of Fame, chaired the Negro Leagues \n     Baseball Museum Board of Directors, and worked tirelessly to \n     promote the history of the Negro Leagues;\n       Whereas James ``Cool Papa'' Bell played, coached, and \n     managed in the Negro Leagues from 1922 to 1950, discovered, \n     trained, and assisted numerous Negro League players into the \n     Major Leagues, and was later inducted into the Baseball Hall \n     of Fame;\n       Whereas Minnie Minoso played in the Negro Leagues for \n     several years before being allowed to play in the Major \n     Leagues and was denied admission to the Hall of Fame, because \n     during his prime years, he was a victim of racial \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas the talents of such players as Josh Gibson, James \n     ``Cool Papa'' Bell, and Oscar Charleston earned them \n     recognition in the Baseball Hall of Fame as well as the \n     Sporting News List of Baseball Greatest Players, but they \n     were denied admission to the Major Leagues due to the color \n     of their skin;\n       Whereas Autozone Park in Memphis, Tennessee, hosted the \n     inaugural Civil Rights Game between the defending World \n     Champion St. Louis Cardinals and the Cleveland Indians in \n     commemoration of the civil rights movement, on March 31, \n     2007; and\n       Whereas by achieving success on the baseball field, \n     African-American baseball players helped break down color \n     barriers and integrate African-Americans into all aspects of \n     society in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the teams and players of the Negro Baseball \n     Leagues for their achievements, dedication, sacrifices, and \n     contributions to both baseball and our Nation; and\n       (2) encourages the observation of Negro Leaguers \n     Recognition Day on May 20 of each year.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I, along with Senators Reid, \nLeahy, Specter, Obama, Clinton, Brownback, and Martinez, have proudly \nsubmitted a concurrent resolution honoring the Negro Baseball Leagues \nand their players by encouraging the recognition of Negro Leaguers \nRecognition Day May 20 of each year. My relationship with the Negro \nLeagues players began when I successfully worked to persuade Major \nLeague Baseball to give pension benefits to former players. In 2004, \nMajor League Baseball agreed to put up $1 million for monthly payments \nto 27 former Negro Leaguers. Last year, I worked with the families of \nseveral of the most notable Negro Leaguers to pass a Senate resolution \ndesignating May 20, 2006--the date on which the Negro National League \nplayed its first game--as Negro Leaguers Recognition Day.\n  I am submitting a resolution honoring the Negro Leaguers again this \nyear--in cooperation with Representative Cohen in the House--to \ndemonstrate the support in both Chambers for recognizing Negro Leaguers \nRecognition Day on May 20 of each year. I hope that this will be a day \nwhen Negro Leaguers and their families will return to the ballpark to \nbe honored for their historic contributions to the game of baseball and \nto bridging racial divisions in our country.\n  Since 1885, long before Major League Baseball was integrated in 1947, \nAfrican-Americans organized their own professional leagues. These \nleagues did not succeed because of racial prejudice and lack of \nadequate financial backing. However, this changed dramatically with the \ninception of the first successful Negro league--the Negro National \nLeague. Its creation was the result of the efforts of an African-\nAmerican player and manager named Andrew ``Rube'' Foster. Mr. Foster's \nsuccess inspired the formation of other leagues.\n  As a result, on October 3, 1924, the first Negro League World Series \ngame was played between the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National \nLeague and Hilldale of Philadelphia of the Eastern Colored League. This \nhistoric and exhaustive first series lasted 10 games, covered a span of \nalmost 3 weeks, and was played in four different cities. In the end, \nKansas City claimed the championship.\n  Some of the names we know and some we don't. Among them are Jackie \nRobinson, the first African-American to break the baseball color \nbarrier; Satchel Paige, who was considered one of the greatest pitchers \nof all time; Josh Gibson, who was a prolific home-run hitter; Larry \nDoby, the first African-American to play in the American League in July \n1947; Buck O'Neil, who was the first African-American coach in the \nMajor Leagues and who went on to head the Negro Leagues Baseball \nMuseum; Cool Papa Bell, who was known as the fastest man in baseball; \nand Minnie Minoso; the ``Cuban Comet,'' who played on the New York \nCubans when they won the Negro League World Series, and broke the color \nbarrier on the Chicago White Sox when he joined the team in 1951.\n  It is important that we remember and honor these players and their \nteammates in the Negro Leagues. In breaking down baseball's color \nbarrier, these pioneers dealt a blow to hatred and prejudice across \nAmerica. Today, we can honor them by recognizing May 20 each year as \nNegro Leaguers Recognition Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5223-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5223-S5224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DEEMED EXPORTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) United States government policies related to deemed \n     exports should safeguard United States national security and \n     protect fundamental research.\n       (2) The Department of Commerce has established the Deemed \n     Export Advisory Committee to develop recommendations for \n     improving current controls on deemed exports.\n       (3) The Administration and Congress should consider the \n     recommendations of the Deemed Export Advisory Committee in \n     its development and implementation of export control \n     policies.\n\n     SEC. 5007. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CAPITAL MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) United States capital markets are losing their \n     competitive edge in the face of intensifying global \n     competition, posing a risk to economic growth, a problem that \n     is well-documented in initial public offerings (IPO), over-\n     the-counter (OTC) derivatives, securitization, and \n     traditional lending;\n       (2) according to the Senator Charles E. Schumer and Mayor \n     Michael R. Bloomberg report, entitled ``Sustaining New York's \n     and the US's Global Financial Services Leadership'', ``In \n     looking at several of the critical contested investment \n     banking and sales and trading markets--initial public \n     offerings (IPOs), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and \n     debt--it is clear that the declining position of the US goes \n     beyond this natural market evolution to more controllable, \n     intrinsic issues of US competitiveness. As market \n     effectiveness, liquidity and safety become more prevalent in \n     the world's financial markets, the competitive arena for \n     financial\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\n     services is shifting toward a new set of factors--like \n     availability of skilled people and a balanced and effective \n     legal and regulatory environment--where the US is moving in \n     the wrong direction.'';\n       (3) further, the report referred to in paragraph (2) stated \n     that--\n       (A) ``The IPO market also offers the most dramatic \n     illustration of the change in capital-raising needs around \n     the world, and US exchanges are rapidly losing ground to \n     foreign rivals. When looking at all IPOs that took place \n     globally in 2006, the share of IPO volume attracted by US \n     exchanges is barely one-third of that captured in 2001. By \n     contrast, the global share of IPO volume captured by European \n     exchanges has expanded by more than 30 percent over the same \n     period, while non-Japan Asian markets have doubled their \n     equivalent market share since 2001. When one considers mega-\n     IPOs--those over $1 billion--US exchanges attracted 57 \n     percent of such transactions in 2001, compared with just 16 \n     percent during the first ten months of 2006.''; and\n       (B) ``London already enjoys clear leadership in the fast-\n     growing and innovative over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives \n     market. This is significant because of the trading flow that \n     surrounds derivatives markets and because of the innovation \n     these markets drive, both of which are key competitive \n     factors for financial centers. Dealers and investors \n     increasingly see derivatives and cash markets as \n     interchangeable and are therefore combining trading \n     operations for both products. Indeed, the derivatives markets \n     can be more liquid than the underlying cash markets. \n     Therefore, as London takes the global lead in derivatives, \n     America's competitiveness in both cash and derivatives flow \n     trading is at risk, as is its position as a center for \n     financial innovation.'';\n       (4) on March 13, 2007, the Department of the Treasury \n     convened a conference on United States capital markets \n     competitiveness, where--\n       (A) key policymakers, consumer advocates, members of the \n     international community, business representatives, and \n     academic experts, each with different perspectives, discussed \n     ways to keep United States capital markets the strongest and \n     most innovative in the world; and\n       (B) conference delegates examined the impact of the United \n     States regulatory structure and philosophy, the legal and \n     corporate governance environment, and the auditing profession \n     and financial reporting on United States capital markets \n     competitiveness;\n       (5) the foundation of any competitive capital market is \n     investor confidence, and since1930, the United States has \n     required some of the most extensive financial disclosures, \n     supported by one of the most robust enforcement regimes in \n     the world;\n       (6) a balanced regulatory system is essential to protecting \n     investors and the efficient functioning of capital markets; \n     and\n       (7) too much regulation stifles entrepreneurship, \n     competition, and innovation, and too little regulation \n     creates excessive risk to industry, investors, and the \n     overall system.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress, the President, regulators, industry leaders, \n     and other stakeholders should take the necessary steps to \n     reclaim the preeminent position of the United States in the \n     global financial services marketplace;\n       (2) the Federal and State financial regulatory agencies \n     should, to the maximum extent possible, coordinate activities \n     on significant policy matters, so as not to impose \n     regulations that may have adverse unintended consequences on \n     innovativeness with respect to financial products, \n     instruments, and services, or that impose regulatory costs \n     that are disproportionate to their benefits, and, at the same \n     time, ensure that the regulatory framework overseeing the \n     United States capital markets continues to promote and \n     protect the interests of investors in those markets; and\n       (3) given the complexity of the financial services \n     marketplace today, Congress should exercise vigorous \n     oversight over Federal regulatory and statutory requirements \n     affecting the financial services industry and consumers, with \n     the goal of eliminating excessive regulation and problematic \n     implementation of existing laws and regulations, while \n     ensuring that necessary investor protections are not \n     compromised.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5254-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5254-2", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5254-S5255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 174) honoring the entrepreneurial \n     spirit of small business concerns in the United States during \n     National Small Business Week, beginning April 22, 2007.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support during National \nSmall Business Week a bipartisan Senate resolution honoring the \nentrepreneurial spirit of small business owners throughout the United \nStates. I am privileged to work every day with ranking member, Senator \nSnowe and other members of my committee on behalf of small businesses \nand I am gratified to introduce this legislation with them here today.\n  Twenty-six million small businesses are currently operating in the \nUnited States. They represent 99.7 percent of all employers and account \nfor two-thirds of all new jobs created each year. In addition, they \ncontribute over 50 percent of the Nation's nonfarm gross domestic \nproduct. Small businesses are the Nation's innovators, producing 13 to \n14 more patents per employee than large businesses, and they account \nfor 97 percent of all exporters.\n  It is clear that small businesses are a powerful force in the \neconomic vitality that makes America strong, and small businesses would \nnot have this success\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\nwere it not for government programs which support them. The Small \nBusiness Administration was created to support and protect small \nbusiness concerns, and they have worked hard to do so. Millions of \nentrepreneurs have received loans or business counseling, allowing them \nto start or expand small businesses. Staples, Intel, Nike, and America \nOnline are just a few of the most well-known businesses who received \nassistance through at least one of the SBA's programs.\n  Craig A. Bovaird from Princeton, MA, who I met this week when he was \nhonored in Washington as the Massachusetts Small Business Person of the \nYear, is president of the Built-Rite Tool and Die, Inc. based in \nLancaster which specializes in developing and manufacturing \nthermoplastics for the aerospace, medical, defense and high-tech \nindustries. He is a pillar of his community--proud father of three \ndaughters, involved in his town's finance committee, renovating the \npublic library, and a leader of his church. He had an idea and he had \nthe technical expertise and knowledge about the industry. Craig is \npassionate about his business. As Craig said, ``I enjoy watching an \nidea go from mind to paper through construction to a finished \nmasterpiece.''\n  But it was John Rainey, a counselor at Clark University's Small \nBusiness Development Center in Worcester, who guided Craig through the \ndevelopment of a solid business plan. Craig's business is a success \ntoday--against the odds--because his manufacturing business grew and \nprospered at a time when other plastics companies were on the decline. \nThis is thanks to Craig's hard work, and also thanks to a key SBA \nprogram that got him the business counseling he needed.\n  However, despite these national and local successes, there are a \nnumber of issues which continue to be a problem for small businesses, \nand, in order to encourage continuing economic growth, it is important \nthat Congress take steps to address them. Unfortunately, this \nadministration has repeatedly reduced efforts to support small \nbusinesses. A report from the House Small Business Committee notes that \nthe fiscal year 2008 budget would cut or terminate funding for 90 of \nthe 110 Federal programs that were designed to support \nentrepreneurship. In addition, since 2001, the administration has cut \nthe SBA budget by more than 30 percent. When disaster loan funding is \nincluded, the President's fiscal year 2008 budget request is a cut of \n45 percent since taking office. The SBA needs adequate funding in order \nto meet the needs of small businesses.\n\n  The administration has also repeatedly called for the reduction or \nelimination of important loan programs, such as the Microloan program. \nThe Microloan program is a small, efficient, cost-effective program, \nwhich provides very small loans and counseling to small businesses. \nSupporters in Congress and advocacy groups are requesting very little \nto fund this program--$3.2 million for the Microloan program and $20 \nmillion for technical assistance. That is minuscule when compared with \nU.S. funding for small businesses in other countries. In 2005, the \nUnited States spent more than $200 million on microloan programs in \nother countries. In 2006, the United States spent more than $54 million \non microloans in Iraq, according to U.S. Ambassador Khalilzad. And, in \nthe President's fiscal year 2007 emergency funding request for the war \nin Iraq, the administration as requested about $160 million in \nmicrocredit initiatives.\n  The management assistance programs, such as the Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, the Women's Business Centers, and the SCORE \nprogram, have also suffered under continuing flat or reduced funding. \nFor instance, when taking account into inflation, SBDCs have \nexperienced a 19 percent cut since 2001, despite the fact that this \nprogram returns $2.82 dollars to the Federal Government for every \nFederal dollar spent. Counseling hours and the number of clients \ncounseled began declining in 2003 and 2004 and have continued to do so. \nAdequate funding for these programs is essential to prevent further \nloss of assistance to small businesses.\n  I also continue to be concerned about the Federal Government's \ninability to meet the procurement goals set forth in law. The Federal \nGovernment has simply done an abysmal job of ensuring that small \nbusinesses get their fair share of Federal contracts. For instance, the \nDepartment of Defense's 0.5 percent procurement with service-disabled \nveteran owned firms is significantly below the 3 percent stated goal \nand is unacceptable. These shortcomings are harming small businesses, \nand I will continue to push to make sure small businesses get a fair \nchance at selling to the Federal Government.\n  Nearly 2 years after Hurricane Katrina, small business owners and \nhomeowners are struggling just to keep their doors open. Many of them \nwere turned down or simply gave up on the SBA when they needed \ngovernment assistance the most. The Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship recently reported a bill that would \ncomprehensively reform the disaster loan program, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of this important legislation. This \ncritical legislation will help all small businesses who are faced with \na catastrophe through no fault of their own.\n  Patrick Turley, president of Turley Publications, Inc., in Palmer, \nMA, is the face of why we need an efficient disaster loan program that \nis a handup, not a handout. Patrick was also honored this week in \nWashington with the Phoenix Award for Small Business Disaster Recovery. \nWhen his business faced massive flooding in October 2005, which caused \n$993,000 in property losses, Patrick rallied his employees and still \nprinted two university newspapers on time. With the help of an SBA \ndisaster loan, Patrick was able to resume running his plant at full \ncapacity just 5 months after the storms.\n  Patrick's perseverance, leadership and courage in the wake of a \ndisaster are commendable. By keeping his plant running, he kept people \nworking and showed the people of Palmer that they too could overcome \nadversity.\n  I am proud of the many hardworking Americans like Craig and Patrick \nand the millions of others who face the risk and uncertainties inherent \nin opening and running a small business each day, and I applaud the \nachievements of the owners and their employees. Their hard work and \ndedication contribute tremendously to the economic well-being of this \ngreat Nation and deserve to be supported by the Federal Government.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 174\n\n       Whereas the 25,800,000 small business concerns in the \n     United States are the driving force behind the Nation's \n     economy, creating more than \\2/3\\ of all net new jobs and \n     generating more than 50 percent of the Nation's nonfarm gross \n     domestic product;\n       Whereas small business concerns are the Nation's \n     innovators, advancing technology and productivity;\n       Whereas small business concerns represent 97 percent of all \n     exporters and produce 28.6 percent of exported goods;\n       Whereas Congress established the Small Business \n     Administration in 1953, to aid, counsel, assist, and protect \n     the interests of small business concerns in order to preserve \n     free competitive enterprise, to ensure that a fair proportion \n     of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for \n     property and services for the Federal Government be placed \n     with small business concerns, to ensure that a fair \n     proportion of the total sales of Government property be made \n     to such small business concerns, and to maintain and \n     strengthen the overall economy of the Nation;\n       Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small \n     business concerns access critical lending opportunities, \n     protected small business concerns from excessive Federal \n     regulatory enforcement, played a key role in ensuring full \n     and open competition for Government contracts, and improved \n     the economic environment in which small business concerns \n     compete;\n       Whereas for over 50 years, the Small Business \n     Administration has helped millions of entrepreneurs achieve \n     the American dream of owning a small business concern, and \n     has played a key role in fostering economic growth; and\n       Whereas the President has designated the week beginning \n     April 22, 2007 as ``National Small Business Week'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the entrepreneurial spirit of small business \n     concerns in the United States during National Small Business \n     Week, beginning April 22, 2007;\n       (2) applauds the efforts and achievements of the owners of \n     small business concerns and their employees, whose hard work \n     and commitment to excellence have made them a key part of the \n     Nation's economic vitality;\n       (3) recognizes the work of the Small Business \n     Administration and its resource partners in providing \n     assistance to entrepreneurs and small business concerns;\n       (4) strongly urges the President to take steps to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) the applicable procurement goals for small business \n     concerns, including the goals for small business concerns \n     owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, small \n     business concerns owned and controlled by women, HUBZone \n     small business concerns, and small business concerns owned \n     and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged \n     individuals, are reached by all Federal agencies;\n       (B) guaranteed loans, including microloans and microloan \n     technical assistance, for start-up and growing small business \n     concerns and venture capital are made available to all \n     qualified small business concerns;\n       (C) the management assistance programs delivered by \n     resource partners on behalf of the Small Business \n     Administration, such as small business development centers, \n     women's business centers, and the Service Corps of Retired \n     Executives, are provided with the Federal resources necessary \n     to do their jobs; and\n       (D) reforms to the disaster loan program of the Small \n     Business Administration are implemented as quickly as \n     possible; and\n       (5) urges that, as was the case in the President's budget \n     for fiscal year 2008, the Small Business Administration \n     continue to be designated as a major agency in the \n     President's budget submitted pursuant to section 1105 of \n     title 31, United States Code, and that the Administrator of \n     the Small Business Administration have an active role as a \n     member of the President's Cabinet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/04/26/senate-section/article/S5257-1", "month": "04", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE 59TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE STATE OF \n                                 ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. REID.
