Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the growing food \nsecurity crisis which faces the United States and countries around the \nworld. The short-term challenges we face as a result of this food \nsecurity crisis are economic, strategic, political, and humanitarian. \nAll of these challenges we face are already being faced by the most \nvulnerable in our society.\n  Here in the United States, this crisis comes on the heels of so many \nother trying circumstances confronting poor and working families across \nAmerica. Our Nation is facing an economic recession and ever-rising \nunemployment rates. Many of those who remain employed find themselves \nworking more hours and yet earning less because their wages have not \nkept up with inflation.\n  While their incomes have declined, the unprecedented cost of food and \nhome energy has continued to soar. Many of these same families are also \nfacing a mortgage and housing crisis which may force them to forego \nownership of the house they once considered their slice of the American \ndream.\n  In short, many families, who years or even months ago were living \ncomfortably, are now struggling to get by. As a result, the increase in \nfood prices over the last several months has added one more pressure to \nalready overburdened American families.\n  Increasingly, these families are stretched to the breaking point and \nare turning to Federal food assistance programs and food banks for some \nmeasure of relief. I have seen this trend repeated firsthand at food \nbanks and in headlines across Pennsylvania.\n  A couple of examples. This is the headline of the Allentown Morning \nCall: ``Heavy Demand at Food Banks, Kitchens Is a Grim Economic \nIndicator for Valley'' [meaning the Lehigh Valley].\n  The Scranton Times Tribune: ``More Seeking Food Stamps: Recipients in \nPennsylvania Rise 9.5 percent.''\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer: ``Working Poor Struggle to Get By.''\n  The Pittsburgh Tribune Review: ``Demand for Food Stamps `Very Close' \nto Record.''\n  All across the State and across the country, it is the same \nheadlines, the same story, the same economic trauma, because of a food \nsecurity challenge we face. The data shows evidence of this disturbing \ntrend. The demand for food stamps in Pennsylvania is skyrocketing.\n  Back in December of 2000, before this current President took office, \napproximately 757,000 Pennsylvanians--1 out of every 16--were enrolled \nin the food stamp program. But this past December, 7 years later, that \nnumber has risen dramatically to 1.4 million Pennsylvanians, accounting \nfor 1 out of every 10 State residents. This trend shows no sign of \nstopping.\n  From December 2007 to March of 2008, Pennsylvania enrolled an average \nof 10,000 new individuals in food stamps every month, bringing the \ntotal enrollment to 1.18 million. But the situation in our State is far \nfrom unique. All across the country the number of individuals enrolling \nin the Food Stamp Program continues to rise at historic rates. From \nDecember 2006 to December 2007, more than 40 States saw recipient \nnumbers rise, and in seven of those States the 1-year rate of growth \ntopped 10 percent. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that \nstarting in fiscal year 2009, 28 million Americans will be enrolled in \nthe Food Stamp Program, the most ever enrolled in this program since \nits inception 40 years ago.\n  For the millions of Americans struggling from the effects of economic \nrecession and rising food prices but making too much to qualify for \nfood stamps, food banks can provide some measure of respite by \nproviding food to those who could not otherwise afford it. \nUnfortunately, these food banks are struggling as well from a \ncombination of increasing food prices, decreasing donations, and \nincreased demand.\n  Wholesale prices for such foods as eggs, flour, rice, fruits, \nvegetables, and dairy products have dramatically spiked in the last 8 \nyears. For food banks this price spike resulted in diminished \npurchasing power, translating into the availability of fewer supplies \nto meet an ever-increasing demand. While there is no accurate \nnationwide or even statewide data to show the effects increased prices \nand increased demand are having on food bank supplies, we know from \nnews articles, television stories, and firsthand reports from those \nworking at food banks that this food security crisis has adversely \naffected emergency food assistance programs in every State.\n\n  The Senate-passed version of the 2007 Food and Energy Security Act, \notherwise known as the farm bill, includes several measures intended to \nshore up Federal antihunger assistance programs. In fact, 67 percent of \nthe funding of this bill is dedicated to protecting Americans from \nhunger. Provisions incorporated in the bill combat hunger, and they \ninclude measures to increase the value of food stamp benefits and \nlanguage to increase the annual level of Federal commodity purchases \nfor food banks from $140 million to $250 million.\n  Unfortunately, while the House and Senate are making strides in \nbringing their differences together, the longer it takes to complete \nthis bill, the longer struggling Americans must wait for some measure \nof relief. Rising food prices and their effect on poor and working \nfamilies are only part of the food security equation. While part of the \nincrease in food prices can be attributed to the rising fuel and energy \ncosts needed to produce and distribute these products, the far bigger \ndriver behind those increased costs is lack of supply. Internationally, \nas well as domestically, food prices have been affected by severe \nshortages and record inflation of major food commodities such as corn, \nrice, soybeans, and wheat.\n  The head of the World Food Program has called the global food crisis \na ``silent tsunami,'' affecting the world's most vulnerable without \nregard to geography or traditional borders. World Bank President Robert \nZoellick has said that surging food costs could translate into ``seven \nlost years'' in the fight against worldwide poverty.\n  Weather disasters and crop losses have caused devastating shortages \nacross Africa and the Asia-Pacific, leading to historically low levels \nof world stocks of key commodities. Australia, one of the leading \nworldwide wheat producers and exporters, has endured several \nconsecutive years of drought and last year lost 60 percent of its total \nwheat harvest. Floods in Asia have destroyed global production centers \nof wheat and rice as well.\n  The rapid economic growth of China and India have lifted millions out \nof poverty, but it has also succeeded in creating a new middle class \ncomplete with Western appetites for a diet of meat and protein. While \nfoods such as rice and wheat remain a staple of the traditional diet, \nincreased demand from China and India for meat produced from grain-fed \nanimals is putting a strain on global supply and will only grow over \ntime. Many of the commodity supplies these countries once exported are \nnow being used for domestic production. Threatened by shortages at \nhome, many countries have\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\nbanned exports of critical foodstuffs, disrupting supplies for \nneighbors and trading partners and sending shock waves through the \nglobal markets.\n  Import-dependent countries such as the Philippines are left with no \nchoice but to pay top dollar to forestall future crises. Others have \nadded artificial incentives to attract food imports. These \ncounterproductive actions only exacerbate food shortages and foster a \nbeggar-thy-neighbor approach. The United States must work with the U.N. \nand other international actors to press countries against adopting such \ncounterproductive measures. We must start looking at mid- and long-term \nstrategies for helping countries deal with this crisis.\n  Higher food prices not only increase the potential for humanitarian \ndisasters, they can also spark political instability and impact U.S. \nforeign policy. We have seen the devastating effect the food shortage \nhas had on developing nations around the world, sparking violence and \nriots and putting added pressure on already fragile and underresourced \ngovernments.\n  Last week we saw protesters in Haiti chanting ``we are hungry'' and \nforcing out the Prime Minister. Food riots erupted in Egypt and \nEthiopia, and troops were used in Pakistan and Thailand to protect \ncrops and storage centers. According to the U.N. Food and Agricultural \nOrganization, 37 countries are now facing a food security crisis and \nare at risk of a food-related upheaval.\n  In areas of vital concern to U.S. national security, such as \nAfghanistan, the food crisis threatens hard-fought progress we have \nachieved in peace, stability, and reconciliation. In Darfur, where the \nrefugees and internationally displaced have already suffered under war, \nfamine, and genocide, the international community may be forced to cut \nfood supplies. The United States can serve its national security and \nhumanitarian objectives by fully funding overseas emergency food \nassistance programs.\n  In March, I sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee along with \nSenator Durbin and a number of other Members of the Senate calling for \na $200 million increase in the fiscal year 2008 supplemental budget \nrequest to address the predicted shortfall in U.S. food assistance \nprograms. Although President Bush directed the Agriculture Secretary to \ntake out $200 million from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust to help \nwith the crisis, this is only a short-term fix. The United States must \ndo more by increasing our bilateral and multilateral contributions in \nfunding to replenish the trust.\n  Supplemental funding in PL 480 title II programs is essential to \nmaintain current food aid programs at current levels and meet the \nincreased cost of food, freight, and fuel production. America can do \nmore, and we must. While I don't claim to have all the answers to this \nmounting domestic and international crisis, I do believe this is an \nissue deserving the full attention of the Senate. We need to begin this \neffort with final passage of the 2007 Food and Energy Security Act and \ncontinue by including funding for domestic and international food aid \nin the supplemental appropriations bill. But these measures in and of \nthemselves will not be enough.\n  We must act, we must legislate. The moral gravity of this food \nsecurity crisis cannot be overstated. It is a matter of economic \njustice. It is also about preserving human life and alleviating \nsuffering. It is also a matter of national security.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that time under the quorum call be evenly divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I just got back from Wyoming. I am in \nWyoming almost every weekend. I travel to a different part of the State \neach time so I can see all the people. As a result, I do not do any \npolls. If you talk to more people in a weekend than pollsters cover \nwhen they do something, you can get a pretty good feel for what is \nhappening.\n  I did run across a national poll, and the poll said the No. 1 concern \non the minds of people in America was jobs and the economy. They said \nthe No. 2 concern was health care. There is an interesting little \nanomaly in No. 1 and No. 2, which is when you talk to people about No. \n1, jobs and the economy, one of the reasons they are concerned about \njobs and the economy is because they don't want to lose their health \ninsurance. If their job disappears, they are out there in the market \nand they don't have the coverage.\n  So I am going to talk about health care today. I have been talking to \na lot of folks about health care, which isn't difficult because it is \non everyone's mind these days. During the last work period--and we \nsometimes call it a recess, but I prefer to call it a work period \nbecause I usually travel from 1,000 to 5,000 miles around my State \nduring that time--I went on a 10-stop tour of Wyoming. In just over 3 \ndays, we drove over 1,200 miles and visited 10 towns and I met with \nlots of Wyomingites. I even spoke to people at several stops who live \noutside those 10 communities but drove miles and miles to come to our \nmeeting. Wyoming does have miles and miles of miles and miles--about \n400 miles on a side--and it is a long way between towns.\n  The dedication and passion of the people who live in the towns and \nthe people who drove all those miles strengthens my commitment to \ngetting something more done about health care. We need to do something. \nA lot of people feel more economically secure when they have health \ninsurance. They know that if they have health insurance and something \nhappens or they get sick, they will be able to get the care they need \nwithout mortgaging their home or going bankrupt. That is another \nconcern on their mind. Nobody should have to worry about that. \nEverybody should be able to carry a health insurance card in their \nwallet.\n  The news isn't all bad, however. There have been plenty of wonderful \nthings that have come from our health care system in recent years. Each \nyear, new technologies are being invented and new drugs are being \ncreated that allow people to live longer and healthier lives. \nResearchers are finding cures for diseases, and parents are able to \ntake care of sick children. They are able to take them to clinics in \nshopping centers and pharmacies to get throat cultures and flu shots. \nPlenty of good things are happening, but we can do better.\n  Now, during my Wyoming work periods, my wife Diana and I travel \naround and talk to folks about health care. I listen to what they tell \nme about the problems they are having and I bring that information back \nand I compare it to what my colleagues are saying. One of the things I \ndo is to teach the East about the West. So when I am in DC, I usually \nhave to explain to folks how Wyoming is different, how a plan designed \naround New York or Massachusetts would not work for Wyoming. I have to \ntell them it can be hard to get doctors and nurses to come to Wyoming. \nThe smaller the town, the harder it is to attract good people. I remind \nthe people in the East that we have a lot of people who work at the \nmines and in the oil patch and in the natural gasfields. They work hard \nfor their hourly wages doing difficult and dangerous tasks. The type of \nhealth care they need is different than the type someone working at a \ncomputer needs. How do we help the construction worker and the computer \ntechnician both get better health care that fits their unique needs at \na more reasonable price?\n  My position on the Senate Health Committee has allowed me to do a lot \nof research on this subject. I have talked to patients, health care \nproviders, scientists, and financial advisers. You name it and we came \nup with a plan that I think is flexible enough to work for everybody.\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\n  The bill I have put together is called Ten Steps to Transform Health \nCare in America. The bill would get everyone an insurance card to carry \nin their wallets and purses. If you already have an insurance card, the \nbill will make sure you get to keep the card by wrangling in health \ncare costs until they are affordable. The biggest danger people who \nhave an insurance card have is costs are going to become so \nastronomical that it would not be offered anymore. We have to see that \ndoesn't happen.\n  Why 10 steps? Well, I have discovered, over the course of the years I \nhave been in the Senate, that if you put together one massive, \ncomprehensive bill that solves everything, you will get a lot of \ndiscussion, but you would not get many results because one piece will \nhave 5 people who don't like it, another piece will have 8 people who \ndon't like it, and another piece will have 11 people who don't like it, \nand another piece will have 3 people who don't like it, and pretty \nquickly you are at 51 votes against you and you cannot get the bill \ndone. When you try to do something comprehensively, it often looks \nrevolutionary. We don't do things ``revolutionarily'' in the Senate. We \ndo them ``evolutionarily.'' So I put together 10 pieces. If we don't \nget all 10, or even if we only get one, it is not a problem because any \n1 step gets us closer to having every American insured. All 10 together \nwould get every American insured. I will briefly walk you through all \n10 steps.\n\n  In order to understand how the bill works, it is important to review \na few facts of the history of health care insurance in our country. \nRight now, about 60 percent of the people under age 65 are getting \ntheir health insurance through their jobs. The question is, why are 60 \npercent of Americans getting their health insurance through their jobs? \nThe short answer to that question is because of the way employer-\nsponsored health care insurance is treated for tax purposes.\n  Our current health insurance system is biased toward employer-based \ncoverage due to a historical accident. The wage controls of World War \nII increased competition among employers for recruiting the best \nemployees and incentivized employers to offer health benefits instead \nof increased wages. They weren't allowed to offer increased wages. In \n1954, Congress codified the provision declaring that such a \ncontribution would not count as taxable income. This tax policy made it \nvery favorable for individuals to get their health benefits through \ntheir employers and, consequently, has penalized individuals who get \ntheir coverage through the individual market.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that removing this tax bias \nand a few related health care tax policies will save the Federal \nGovernment $3.6 trillion over the next 10 years. That is real money--\neven in Washington. That is a lot of money that can and should be used \nto expand choices and access and give individuals more control over \ntheir health care. Ten Steps ensures every American can benefit from \nthese savings--whether they get health care from their employers, from \nthe individual insurance market, or they decide they want to get off \nMedicaid and switch to private insurance. That is one of the options.\n  How does this bill do it? The plan gives all Americans that have at \nleast a certain amount of health insurance a standard tax deduction. \nThe national above-the-line standard tax deduction for health insurance \nwill equal $15,000 a year for a family and $7,500 for an individual. \nThe bill also gives low-income folks a tax credit equal to $5,000 for a \nfamily and $2,500 for an individual. The subsidy amount phases out as \nincomes get higher, so some folks would not be eligible for the \nsubsidy, but everyone is eligible for the standard deduction I \nmentioned first.\n  The bill takes this hybrid approach of coupling the standard \ndeduction proposal with the tax credit proposal because I think it is \nthe best way to ensure no particular group of people is adversely \naffected. I know some folks are advocating for just a standard \ndeduction, and other folks are advocating for a tax credit. My plan \ndoes both, but I am supportive of all approaches. I am pleased so many \ncolleagues agree we need to fix the flawed Tax Code. The bottom line is \nwe need to get something done. Correcting the flawed Tax Code will make \nit easier for working Americans to buy health insurance. Jobs don't \nneed insurance; people do.\n  One of the things this tax policy would do is encourage more \ncompanies in the insurance business to provide more options to the \npeople. The options would vary in price, bringing prices down through \nmore competition. We talked about Medicare Part D and got that \ninstituted in the United States for the cost of pharmaceuticals to \nseniors to go down. I was concerned about how that would work. Wyoming \nhas a low population. I think it will be about half a million in the \nnext census. I wasn't sure we would be able to attract competition to \nour State. There is a little provision in Medicare that says if there \nisn't any plan interested in bidding, the Federal Government will \nprovide a plan. In Wyoming, we had 49 companies bidding for each \nperson's pharmaceutical work. It gave a lot of options and, more \nimportantly, it brought the price down about 20 percent before we ever \ngot started. That is what competition does. We also need to make sure \nthe insurance is portable; that when one person changes jobs, they can \nbe sure they still have their insurance. Some people are locked into \njobs because they, or a family member, have a preexisting condition \nthat will preclude them from getting insurance if they change.\n  The fourth step gives small businesses greater purchasing power to \nreduce the cost of insurance plans. Right now, a lot of rules are in \nplace that prohibit groups of businesses from getting together and \npooling their purchasing power across State lines--in fact, across the \nwhole United States--so they can negotiate better deals on insurance \ncards. That doesn't make sense. If a group of shoe stores in Wyoming \nwants to get together with other shoe store owners in Montana and \nColorado and the rest of the United States and band together to get a \ngreater discount on health insurance, they should be allowed to do so. \nThis isn't a brand new concept. Some States have enough population that \nthey are able to do this anyway within their State borders. Ohio is a \ngreat example. They have been intensely interested in this piece of \nlegislation. They have put together the small business health plan \nwithin their State, and it has saved a tremendous amount of money. They \nwere inventive enough to do it in the first place and smart enough to \nknow if they can expand across State borders and across the United \nStates, they can reduce those prices a lot more. We should not be \nkeeping them from doing that.\n  I mentioned earlier that jobs don't need health insurance, people do. \nRight now, when a small business wants to get health insurance for \nemployees, they contact the health insurance agent and tell the agent \nhow many are employed and they give information about the employees and \nthen the agent quotes a price for offering health insurance to those \nemployees.\n  Right now, there are some Federal rules in place that govern that \nprocess for small groups of employees and make sure the groups are \nfairly treated by insurance companies. The protections provide \nassurances to consumers that insurers will deal with preexisting \nconditions fairly and provide coverage--even to small groups. This has \nhelped keep costs down for small businesses, but more needs to be done, \nespecially given that none of these rules apply to individuals who \npurchase health insurance on their own. At a minimum, we need to make \nsure individuals get treated the same way groups get treated.\n  The fifth step blends the individual and group market to extend \nimportant HIPAA portability protections to the individual market so \ninsurance security can better move with them from job to job.\n  The sixth step is possibly the most critical and one we must take to \nreduce medical costs across the board. This step moves our system from \none that provides sick care to one that provides health care. That is \nan important distinction. As Ben Franklin said: ``An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure.'' We need an innovative system \nthat will do more to help Americans prevent and manage chronic illness, \nso they can live healthy lives with fewer medical costs. The Ten Steps \nplan would do that.\n  The seventh step gives individuals the choice to convert the value of \ntheir\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nMedicaid and SCHIP program benefits into private health insurance, \nputting them in control of their health care, not the Federal \nGovernment. The rationale for this step is simple: If the market can \nprovide better coverage at a lower price, then why not allow Americans \nto access that care?\n  This gives low-income individuals more options about where they can \nreceive care and what care is available. It is time for people to start \nmaking decisions about their care. Let's get the Government out of the \ndoctors' offices.\n  The eighth step is one that Congress has come close to passing in \nyears past--a bipartisan plan to encourage the adoption of cutting-edge \ninformation technologies in health care. The health care industry is \nthe last industry to go digital. Think about what technology has done \nto revolutionize every other industry and how it has led to a more \nefficient use of time and resources. The health care industry should \nnot lag behind. The time has come for health information to go digital \nso we can save thousands of lives and billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, did you know that you own your own health care record? \nI would like to know how many of my colleagues have theirs with them. I \nam willing to bet none not even me. Try to get your health care record \nsome time. But you ought to have your health care record on a card you \ncarry with you that has everything about you so if you come from \nWyoming out to Washington, DC, and you get in a wreck, the doctor who \nis taking care of you can have all of the information he needs to make \nsure that while he is taking care of you, he is not hurting you another \nway. Right now, some of that technology is available in Wyoming, and \nsome of that technology is available here. The difficulty is the card \nin Wyoming cannot be read here, and the card here cannot be read in \nWyoming. Of course, we hope people will come out to Wyoming for a \nvacation, and we hope they do not get in an accident. If you are in \nYellowstone Park, Grand Teton Park, or other beautiful places in \nWyoming, if you get sick, we want the doctor there to have all the \ninformation he needs to be sure you are taken care of. That is possible \nnow. We just need a standard of getting that information from one part \nof the country to another. You can take your ATM card anywhere in the \nworld and get cash, but you cannot take your medical records anywhere.\n  There is another big problem with medical records. You go to one \nprovider, and he has a test done. He sends you to a specialist. The \nspecialist says it is going to take too long to get the test over here, \nthis is important, and it is an emergency, so they do the test again. \nDo you know how much the tests cost? Sometimes $3,000, $4,000, $10,000, \nand they are duplicated. The RAND Corporation said duplication of tests \nmay be costing us as much as $140 billion a year. That is real money. \nThat is real money that could be spent on health care and health IT.\n  Some are concerned about the impact of health IT and electronic \nhealth records on the security of personal data, data security. Let me \nassure my colleagues that protecting patient information is a very high \npriority of mine, and nearly every section of this bill demonstrates \nit.\n  The health IT bill does a lot to build on protections we already have \nin place. The bill establishes the American Health Information \nCommunity which is made up of experts representing a complete cross \nsection in health care, consumer, and technology communities.\n  The American Health Information Community is charged with providing \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services recommendations concerning \nnational policies for adoption by the Federal Government to ensure that \npatient data remain secure. But there is another important part to \nthis. The companies that are putting together these programs that we \nassume will have standardization so they can be used in all parts of \nthe country have a real desire and a real need, if their product is \ngoing to be lasting, to be sure there is data security. They work on \nthat every day, just as the banks work on your ATM card every day to \nmake sure somebody is not getting your money. It should not be a worry.\n  The ninth step of the bill is one of the most important steps for \nfrontier areas such as Wyoming. An insurance card in your wallet will \nnot do any good if there is not a doctor or hospital around when you \nneed care. If there are not enough nurses working in that hospital or \nno one is working at the desk to admit you, a health insurance card \nwill not help you very much.\n  The 10-step plan addresses this problem by helping future providers \nand nurses pay for their education and encouraging them to serve in \nareas of great need. The plan provides competitive matching grants for \nStates to encourage nurses to return to the profession after having \nleft the workforce for 3 years or more.\n  People are living longer. People can be active longer. We need to \nencourage more people to stay in the workforce longer. This will do it \nfor nurses and help solve a tremendous problem seniors are going to \nhave.\n  The plan also boosts the current programs we have that are working \nwell--the Community Health Centers Program and the loan repayment \nprograms for the National Health Service Corps. Those community centers \nare providing a lot of health care to a lot of people who would not be \nable to get health care otherwise. We have the reauthorization ready to \ngo on that issue and almost complete.\n  Another piece that is critical to Wyoming, the 10-step plan builds on \nthe success of the current rural health care programs by ensuring the \nappropriate development of rural health systems and access to care for \nrural patients.\n  One of the things that continues to be very important to me as I work \non this 10-step plan is listening to real folks about what they want \nfrom their health care. One thing I heard over and over is that seniors \nwant to stay in their homes longer. They do not want to go to nursing \nhomes if they don't have to. Sadly, because of the way our laws are \nwritten and the way our reimbursement policies are structured, folks \nare sometimes left with no option but to go to a nursing home. If the \npolicies were different and there were more options and there were more \nflexibility, seniors could stay in their homes longer.\n  My plan works to do just that by putting the emphasis on community \nand home-based care, which is often much preferred, less costly and \nproven to increase the quality of life. One way to do this is by \nsupporting programs such as the Greenhouse Project which creates a \ncommunity setting rather than an institutional setting.\n  The final step of the 10-step plan decreases the skyrocketing costs \nof health care by restoring reliability in our medical justice system \nthrough State-based solutions. No one--not patients or health care \nproviders--is appropriately served by our current medical litigation \nprocedures.\n  Right now, many patients who are hurt by negligent actions receive no \ncompensation for their losses. Those who do receive a mere 40 cents of \nevery premium dollar, given the high cost of legal fees and \nadministrative costs. That is simply a waste of medical resources.\n  Additionally, the likelihood and the outcomes of lawsuits and \nsettlements bear little relation to whether a health care provider was \nat fault. Consequently, we are not learning from our mistakes. Rather, \nwe are simply diverting our doctors, and they are spending more time in \nthe courtroom. When someone has a medical emergency, they want to see a \ndoctor in an operating room, not in a courtroom.\n  Those are the 10 steps. As I mentioned before, I worked on 10 steps \nso we can break the steps into separate bills and move them one at a \ntime in a moveable, reasonable piece. Despite the intentions of \nCongress, we have to work in incremental doses rather than monumental \ndoses in order to get anything done.\n  Some of the steps I have mentioned are newer ideas that still need \nsome time to be worked out and will still need some tinkering around \nthe edges, but some of the steps I went over today are ready to go. \nHealth IT could be done any day this week. Those bills are drafted, \nthey are stand-alone bills, and they are ready to move through Congress \nat any time. We need to do it.\n  Some people say this is a Presidential election year; what do the \ncandidates think about it? What do they think about it? They are \ncovering that a little bit. I think Senator McCain made a speech \nearlier today about\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nhealth care and some of the things he intends to do with it. I have \nheard other speeches from other candidates. We do not need to wait for \na Presidential election to do something in health care, to do anything \nin health care. When a person gets elected President, they give us \npretty good suggestions, but they no longer get to vote on any of the \nissues. We have to do the votes. We have to draft the legislation. We \nhave to do the debate. There is no reason to wait until we have a \nPresident, no need.\n  There is a need--a critical need, an understood need--by the people \nof America that we need to do something on health care and we need to \ndo it right now. It is such an issue of great concern to the American \npeople that it transcends politics as usual.\n  I never ask when I am in Wyoming whether a person is a Republican or \nDemocrat when they bring me an idea or a problem. I just want to know \nwhat the idea is or what the problem is, and I do like it when they \nprovide a solution with it as well. If it is doable, we do it. That is \nwhat we need to do on health care.\n  If we make sure that we transcend politics, if we get away from the \npolarization of a political year, we will have an opening to get \nsomething done that will help patients and doctors.\n  I am going to suggest we use my 80-percent rule. I came to Washington \nas a firm believer in the 80-percent rule. That is, we can reach \nagreement on 80 percent of the issues and we are probably never going \nto reach agreement on the other 20 percent. By focusing on 80 percent \nof the issues we can agree on, we can get something done. If we \ncontinue to let the 20 percent we disagree on serve as a roadblock, we \nwill let some great opportunities pass. That is something we cannot \nafford to have happen again and again.\n  I truly hope this is the year we stop talking about health care and \nstart doing something about it because Americans cannot wait another \nyear. They do not want to wait for an election to see some changes. \nThey certainly do not want to wait another year to stop their health \ncare costs from going up and up. They want to see change, and they want \nto see change now.\n  Our small business owners, our working families, our millions of \nuninsured cannot afford to wait, and we can do it. We can do it now, \nand we can do it together.\n  Last week, we passed the genetic nondiscrimination bill. That has the \npotential to provide health care as opposed to sick care. That has the \npotential to let people have their blood tested to find out what \npossibilities there are to what could happen to them based on their \ngenetic information so they can keep that from happening.\n  What the bill does is make sure that the information you get from \nthat testing cannot be used against you by your insurance company or \nyour employer. That should give you encouragement to find out more \nabout yourself so if there is something that could be a preexisting \ncondition, you can keep it from becoming a preexisting condition and \nyour insurance company cannot make it a preexisting condition until it \nactually happens.\n  We have a chance to do a lot of things in health care. We have done \nsomething in health care. I hope we will get health IT done in health \ncare this week or next week. There is no reason we cannot. The small \nbusiness health plans, to let the companies group together over State \nlines, there is no reason that cannot get done. There are several ideas \nout there that have been put together well that can be combined to get \nsomething done. I hope it goes through the regular process, which means \nthrough committee. I also noticed legislation that does not go through \na committee around here does not get done, and that is because it has \nnot had that chance to be worked on in a very individual way. When we \nare in committee and doing a markup and there is a problem three or \nfour people have, they can go off and work on that problem and come up \nwith a solution. Sometimes it is a compromise; sometimes it is leaving \nsomething out; sometimes it is a brandnew way. That is where the \ninnovation happens, in committee. Whenever we avoid the committee, what \nwe are saying is: We have this legislation we want to shove down your \nthroat. It will help make each side take some bad votes, and this is an \nelection year, so maybe we should have some bad votes. I don't think \nthat is necessary. I think there are solutions out there, solutions we \ncan reach agreement on, solutions we can finish, and what is more, I \nthink the American people expect it and, more importantly, demand it. \nWe can do it. Let's do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent agreement \nwith respect to the order of speaking or the time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no consent with respect to \nthe order of speaking.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding there is 39 minutes remaining on \nthe Democratic side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, so much of the debate here in the Senate \nis consumed by the seemingly endless war in Iraq. I just left a hearing \nof the Democratic policy conference. It was the 13th hearing relative \nto the waste and abuse that took place during the course of this war. \nTo think that we have spent almost $700 billion in the course of this \nwar and how much of it has been wasted. We asked those who were \ntestifying who were actually on the ground a few years ago in charge of \nallocating equipment and watching conduct. The estimates ranged from 30 \npercent to 80 percent of the money spent being wasted--taxpayers' \ndollars, dedicated to make a safer place for our troops--actually \nwasted and stolen. Unfortunately, little or nothing has been done about \nit.\n  The hearing from the Democratic policy conference began with Senator \nDorgan back when the Republicans were in control of Congress and \nrefused to hold the same hearings in the official committee structure. \nNow there are more hearings and more investigations both on the House \nand Senate side. But we can only hope, when a new President is elected, \nthat President will decide it is time for a thorough investigation of \nthe billions of dollars, taxpayers' dollars, that have been wasted in \nthis war in Iraq--money not spent to make our troops safer, not spent \nto achieve our objectives but, rather, to line the pockets of greedy \npeople.\n  This isn't the first war in which this has happened, but it is \ncertainly the only time I can recall when an administration has been so \ncavalier when it comes to this occurrence.\n  We talk a lot about the war in Iraq. We should not forget what is \nhappening in Afghanistan. This is a war that was declared shortly after \nSeptember 11, unanimously in the Senate. Given how much blood and \ntreasure has been lost in Iraq, it is easy to forget the stakes in \nAfghanistan.\n  Afghanistan was the original home for al-Qaida. It is where Osama bin \nLaden planned his attack on the United States. He may very well still \nbe alive in the border area of Afghanistan or nearby in Pakistan. If \nTaliban hosts freely allowed al-Qaida terrorists to train in camps \nthere, we understand the threat that could pose. The Taliban also \nruthlessly suppressed its own people, particularly its women.\n  Let's remember what the 9/11 Commission said about Afghanistan:\n\n       Bin Ladin appeared to have in Afghanistan a freedom of \n     movement he lacked in Sudan. Al-Qaida members could travel \n     freely within the country, enter and exit it without visas or \n     any immigration procedures, purchase and import vehicles and \n     weapons. . . . The Taliban seemed to open the doors to all \n     who wanted to come to Afghanistan to train in the camps. The \n     alliance with the Taliban provided al-Qaida a sanctuary in \n     which to train and indoctrinate fighters and terrorists, \n     import weapons, forge ties with other jihad groups and \n     leaders, and plot and staff terrorist schemes.\n\n  Why revisit this history? Because the Taliban and al-Qaida have been \nregrouping along the Afghan and Pakistan border. In fact, now, more \nthan 6 years into the war in Afghanistan, we are at risk of losing some \nof our hard-\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\nfought gains, gains paid for with the blood of American soldiers.\n  Recently, Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nstated the obvious--that the U.S. military has too many troops tied \ndown in Iraq to send reenforcements needed in Afghanistan. It is clear \nagain this President decided before he won the war in Afghanistan to \nstart a new war in the Iraq, at the expansion of our original mission. \nAccording to Admiral Mullen, ``There are force requirements [in \nAfghanistan] that we can't currently meet.'' He said, ``Having forces \nin Iraq at the level they're at doesn't allow us to fill the need that \nwe have in Afghanistan.''\n  The GAO just released an assessment of U.S. efforts to counter \nterrorist activity in the border area of Pakistan. The report concluded \nthat the United States has not met its national security goals in \nPakistan's tribal areas and that ``. . . al-Qaida has established a \nsafe haven near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.''\n  A top Army commander, MG Jeffrey Schloesser, warned that Afghanistan \ncould see record levels of violence this year.\n  Just the other week, the British charity Oxfam released a report \nnoting that Western countries have failed to deliver $10 billion of \nnonmilitary assistance pledged to Afghanistan since 2001. The United \nStates is responsible for one-half of that shortfall. Despite the \nbillions that have been spent in Iraq, we have failed to keep our \npromises when it came to humanitarian assistance, nonmilitary \nassistance, in Afghanistan.\n  This is not isolated. The World Bank has spent approximately half of \nits commitments to Afghanistan; the European Commission and Germany, \nless than two thirds; and the Asian Development Bank in India, a third.\n  Take another example--support for the National Solidarity Program, \nwidely regarded as one of the most successful development efforts in \nAfghanistan. The 5-year-old program is funded by international donors, \nadministered by the Government of Afghanistan. It is one of the few to \nreach into rural areas. In this program, village residents work \ncollaboratively with local governments to identify developing needs. \nThere is a feeling of ownership, of participation. Women are actively \ninvolved. Because of the sense of ownership, the Taliban is less likely \nto destroy these local projects.\n  Take for example the recent example profiled in the Washington \nMonthly. In the village of Dadi Khel, residents came together to decide \non developing a small hydroelectric turbine for the nearby river. When \nfinished, it will be able to provide electricity to about 300 families \nin the village.\n  Next to the site is a poster nailed to a tree that clearly shows to \nall the disbursement of funds for the project. A local teacher told the \nreporter, ``This is our money. All the time we are checking whether \nit's spent correctly.''\n  Yet this novel program is facing a shortfall of hundreds of millions \nof dollars to continue work in existing communities--let alone to \nexpand into Afghanistan's remaining 7,000 villages. While Canada, \nGermany, and the U.K. have all increased financial support for this \nprogram, U.S. funding was reduced between 2006 and 2007.\n  It's not surprising therefore that the Oxfam report said that \ninternational development aid to Afghanistan remains ``woefully \ninadequate.'' Oxfam noted that only $7 is spent in international \ndevelopment assistance in Afghanistan for every $100 in U.S. military \nexpenditures.\n  That translates into less development aid per capita in Afghanistan \nthan the world spent in postconflict Bosnia or East Timor.\n  How could we let this happen? How could we take our eye off the ball?\n  Of course, part of the answer is that this administration diverted \ncritical military, intelligence, and civilian assets from Afghanistan \nto Iraq.\n  Just imagine how much more progress we could have made in Afghanistan \nif we had not gone into Iraq.\n  But another part of the problem is that we have not done enough to \nsupport long term development efforts so critical in winning the hearts \nand minds of the Afghan people.\n  I remember during a visit to Afghanistan last year that there were \nonly six American agricultural experts for the entire country--I think \ntoday there are eight. That is right, for a nation with an agricultural \neconomy and record poppy harvest, only a handful of agricultural \ndevelopment experts.\n  Sadly, I suppose this is not really surprising. USAID has seen its \nnumber of full time Foreign Service officers drop from a historic high \nof over 5,000, to only 1,000 today. The Peace Corps has seen its budget \nin real dollars drop by almost 40 percent since its inception in 1961.\n  America's strength comes not just from its military might, but from \nthe power of its ideas, from its generosity, and from its ability to \nserve as a beacon of hope, human rights, and democracy. I fear in \nrecent years a measure of this leadership has been lost.\n  We must ensure that the efforts in Afghanistan, and in Pakistan, \nreceive the resources they deserve. We must invest in development \nactivities that work to develop economic and educational opportunities. \nWe must help with agricultural and democratic development.\n  And, we must work with our allies to ensure that the Taliban and al-\nQaeda do not reemerge.\n  I hope all Members of the Senate will understand that as this \nadministration comes to an end in just another 8 or 9 months, there \nwill be a temptation on the other side of the aisle to blame this \nwoeful state of affairs somehow on the Democratic Party. But this war \nin Iraq was initiated by this President with the overwhelming support \nof his party. This President has refused to change the policy in Iraq, \nand we continue to see an endless war, costing us dramatic sums of \nmoney, creating sacrifice in the United States, still endangering our \ntroops, with no end in sight. That is the legacy of the Bush \nadministration in Iraq, and that is why the war in Afghanistan, today, \ncontinues to be a challenge to the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the summer travel season rapidly \napproaches, the cost of gasoline continues to skyrocket and the \nAmerican people are left to wonder whether Congress has any plans to do \nanything about it. Unfortunately, every ``commonsense solution'' that \nhas been offered seems to be far from common sense or a solution \nbecause most of those that have been offered within the last year would \nonly serve to raise, not lower, gasoline prices.\n  So far, Congress has offered the American people little more than \nnewsclips and sound bites from hours of endless hearings lambasting, \nusually, the oil companies. The result, of course, has not been any \nreduction in gasoline prices but proposal after proposal to raise taxes \non America's energy companies, which--guess what--would ultimately be \npassed on to the consumer, thus raising prices and not lowering prices. \nThis policy posture reminds me of a quip from former President Ronald \nReagan, who said, ``Congress' approach is that if it moves, tax it; if \nit keeps moving, regulate it; if it stops moving, subsidize it.''\n  History has shown that a tax increase ultimately has the effect of \nnot only passing along costs to the ultimate consumer but of \ndrastically reducing supply. From 1980 to 1988, this same tax idea, so-\ncalled windfall profits tax, actually caused a decline in oil \nproduction, reducing domestic oil by as much as 8 percent--that is \nright, reducing America's supply of its own natural resources and \nincreasing our dependence on foreign sources of oil. The result, of \ncourse, was not eliminating a perceived windfall but, rather, causing a \nprecipitous fall in production of American oil and, as I said, an \nincreased dependence on foreign oil.\n  The problem, then, is the same as the problem today--not a cabal of \noil executives conspiring to swindle the American people but a shortage \nof oil around the world. With burgeoning economies such as those in \nChina and India, demand for oil has skyrocketed, while the supply has \nlagged behind. Raising a tax on domestic energy companies only takes \naway from the capital that could be used to reinvest in domestic energy \ndiscovery and production. It does nothing to address the world's \nstagnant supply of oil.\n  We can pass a lot of laws here in Congress, and we can actually \nrepeal a law\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\nevery now and then, but we can't repeal the law of supply and demand. \nThis is the law that for some reason Congress just refuses to learn. In \nfact, one of the leading contributors to oil shortages in America is \nactually Congress itself, which refuses to allow our domestic oil \ncompanies to tap into American natural resources.\n  Revisiting failed policies of past decades and trying to beat the \nsame old dead horse will not address our current energy challenges. \nInstead, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nsuggested a new solution, one of their new ``commonsense'' solutions: \nThey will simply sue OPEC for more oil. Aside from the almost comical \nimage of suing OPEC and somehow finding some court somewhere in the \nworld that will accept jurisdiction of that lawsuit and somehow then \ndirect OPEC to produce more oil so that American consumers can enjoy \nlower prices for that oil, I would be concerned, first of all, how OPEC \nmight respond to such a threat. Would they simply laugh it off or would \nthey turn off the spigot? But let's say the proponents of suing OPEC \nwere successful. Would that make us more dependent or less dependent on \nimported oil from foreign sources? I think it is obvious that it would \ncontinue to make us more dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  We simply have to get out of this mindset that we can tax, regulate, \nand litigate our way to greater energy independence.\n  At the same time, one of the things we can all agree on is the need \nfor America to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil. We need to \nremember how much of an impact our energy policies have on the lives of \nour constituents, of 300 million American citizens. High gas prices are \ndriving up the cost of living, they are raising the cost of driving to \nwork, driving your children to school, they are driving up the price of \nfuel for the airline industry that is hitting American travelers even \nharder.\n  While it is important that we increase our supply of energy from all \nsources, we need to recognize too that the heavy hand of the Federal \nGovernment can sometimes have unintended consequences. Our \nsubsidization of ethanol as a fuel source is driving up food prices, as \nlimited supplies of corn are being split between fuel, food, and \nlivestock feed.\n  At the same time, rising prices at the pump are hitting families at \nthe dinner table as well, as transportation costs continue to drive up \nfood prices. Now, there is no question that in the long term, renewable \nfuels are an important answer to the energy crisis we face today. But \nit is also irrefutable that oil, whether from American sources or \nforeign sources, will continue to be a large part of our energy supply \nin the near to midterm.\n  Our solution to increasing the supply of oil must begin here at home, \nusing America's vast natural resources. We can develop environmentally \nresponsible oil production here at home if Congress would simply get \nout of the way and allow American companies to do so. In short, the \nmajority's response to high gasoline prices appears to be summed up in \nthree words: Posturing, suing, and raising taxes, none of which is \ndesigned to provide effective solutions to the problems that confront \nworking families in America today.\n  The end result is an energy policy that shuts off the valve of \nAmerican energy, while desperately awaiting the last drops from the \ntrickling pipeline of foreign oil. This schizophrenic approach to gas \nprices is best summed up in a cartoon I saw recently which I wish to \nshare with my colleagues. This is from Investor's Business Daily \nearlier this month.\n  While Democrats demand energy companies solve their problem, they \nsimultaneously have rejected every responsible solution. As this \ncartoon points out, the first segment says, ``We demand you energy \ncompanies do something about these high energy prices,'' to which they \nrespond, ``We can drill in ANWR.'' That is in Alaska. The answer: \n``Forget it.''\n  ``How about offshore?'' The answer: ``Are you crazy?''\n  ``How about clean coal?'' ``Out of the question.''\n  ``Nuclear power?'' ``You are joking, right?''\n  ``Well, don't just sit there, do something.''\n  That is what Congress keeps telling the energy producers in this \ncountry time and time again. But every proposed solution, whether it is \ndrilling in Alaska, whether it is developing offshore resources from \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, whether it is investing America's \ningenuity and know-how in using clean coal technology or nuclear energy \nor nuclear power, Congress seems to answer: No, no, a thousand times, \nno. And the price of oil and the price of energy for American consumers \nkeeps going up, up, and up. With this kind of response from Congress, \nno wonder energy prices are so high.\n  At every turn, we handcuff American producers while at the same time \ndemand they fix the problems that Congress is creating. The only real \ncommonsense solution is to finally take advantage of the resources we \nhave in this country with which we have been richly blessed. It is \nestimated that if the Congress stopped penalizing and handcuffing our \ndomestic energy supply, we could produce as much as 2.7 to 3 million \nbarrels of oil a day in addition to what is being produced now.\n  Does that not make more sense than continuing to rely on countries \nsuch as Venezuela and Hugo Chavez, and enriching our enemies and those \nwho use that oil wealth to invest in military weapons and the like?\n  Allowing American companies to begin producing this oil would send a \nstrong message to the American people and to the market, which has run \nup the price of oil to about $120 a barrel because of speculation that \nCongress intends to do nothing about it, and this static supply and \nincreasing demand continues to drive up the price of oil and refined \npetroleum products.\n  But the message, if we were to pass some of this commonsense \nlegislation, would be to tell the marketplace and the speculators we \nare serious about addressing this by producing as much as 3 million \nadditional barrels of oil here in America each day. It would bring down \nthe price, I believe precipitously, and I believe nearly immediately.\n  Demonstrating our commitment in this way would have an immediate \nimpact, but, unfortunately, we find ourselves locked into the same old \n``he said, she said'' sort of arguments and nothing seems to happen, to \nthe detriment of the American consumer.\n\n  We find that sound energy policies continue to be blocked that would \nprovide access to our vast natural resources here at home. If we are \ntired of relying upon other nations for our energy needs, along with \nthe national security and economic risks that that entails, if we are \ntired of paying high prices for their low production, is it not time we \ndid something about it here at home?\n  It would be nice to see a ``Made in America'' sticker on the side of \na gas pump for once. Aside from demonstrating our independence and \nlowering gas prices, it would provide a boom to our economy. What \nbetter stimulus to our economy could there be than creating new jobs \nhere in America as a result of increased activity, exploring and \ndeveloping our natural resources right here at home?\n  We have a potentially enormous domestic energy industry waiting to be \npermitted by Congress to start going to work. Once we give them that \nopportunity, it will mean the creation of thousands of new jobs as well \nas more affordable gasoline and less dependence on foreign oil and gas \nfrom dangerous parts of the world.\n  While opening American resources would be beneficial, it will not \nhave the full intended effect unless we also encourage companies to \nbuild new refinery capacity here in America. Of course, 70 percent of \nthe cost of gasoline is due to the cost of oil. But a lack of adequate \nrefinery capacity to take that oil and to make it into gasoline is \nanother reason why the supply has been limited and prices continue to \ngo up.\n  We have not built any new refineries in America since the 1970s, \nprimarily because of burdensome regulation by the Federal Government. \nSince we have that limited capacity, we once again run in that pesky \nold law of supply and demand; the only law that, try as some of my \ncolleagues might, we cannot repeal and we cannot ignore.\n  If we do not increase refinery capacity, prices will only continue to \ngo\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nhigher. While we increase American oil production and lower our gas \nprices, we should also pursue technological developments and good old \nAmerican know-how that will allow us to take advantage of the energy \nresources we do have here and are available.\n  We should not forget conservation efforts, and this has been one area \nwhere Congress has gotten it right by passing commonsense fuel \nefficiency requirements for automobiles and conserving this scarce \nresource.\n  We need to also be good stewards of the environment and ensure that \nwe are doing all we can to use our resources wisely and not wastefully.\n  Finally, we need to pursue alternative energy solutions that will \nensure our future energy production is secure. We need to start now to \nutilize and develop energy production methods that will work alongside \nof oil and gasoline to power America's economy into the future, sources \nsuch as, as I mentioned a moment ago, clean coal, nuclear energy; even \nbiofuel and wind can be part of the answer to the overall fuel and \nenergy mix our country needs.\n  But we need to give all of these potential power sources a free and \nopen chance to develop and to reach their potential in the marketplace. \nWe must encourage American innovation and technology to help us develop \nthe ability to use these in a way that is compatible with a good \nenvironment.\n  We must be careful not to play favorites, as unfortunately we have, \nand are now seeing the consequences come home to roost and turn these \nindustries into political tools. Different energies will work better in \ndifferent areas, and all of them can work together to provide America \nwith cost-efficient energy and the strong energy industry we need in \norder to fuel our growing economy.\n  But our future energy production starts today with removing the \nroadblocks that this cartoon indicates that Congress has thrown in \nfront of every opportunity to increase energy supply and bring down the \ncost ultimately to the consumer.\n  We cannot make up for lost time, but we can start today by \nrecognizing the mistakes of the past and what that has actually done to \nrun up the cost of gasoline at the pump and made us even more \ndependent. We need to act now to build a strong American energy policy, \nbring down the price of gasoline, and free ourselves from foreign oil-\nproducing nations, many of which want to do us harm.\n  Every day we delay brings a heavier burden on American families with \nthe cost of gasoline. We cannot ask the American people to foot the \nbill for our inaction any longer. It is time for Congress to take \nresponsibility for gas prices in America, by allowing our industries to \nutilize the American resources that are available to us that will \neventually help bring that price down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3423-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAXING THE RICH\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague for his \ncogent analysis and remarks just now. He is absolutely right about the \nway we need to deal with our energy crisis today.\n  I wish to talk very briefly about another subject, frankly the \nchallenge and a refrain that we have often heard from the other side; \nthat is, that the so-called rich are an endless well that can be tapped \nto fund limitless spending priorities.\n  My colleagues across the aisle frequently argue that the 2001 and \n2003 tax cuts were a giveaway to the so-called rich and that that \nshould be allowed to expire, in effect, raising the tax rates to their \npre-2001 level.\n  The marginal rate cuts enacted in 2001 and accelerated in 2003 \nreduced the tax burden for all Americans. In fact, the effective tax \nrate for the middle fifth quintile of taxpayers dropped more than 2 \npercentage points, from 16.6 to 14.2 percent as a result of these cuts.\n  Let's assume that the other side would not only let the tax cuts \nexpire but actually repeal them this year. How much would taxing the \nso-called rich raise? The 2005 Internal Revenue Service Statistics of \nIncome report notes that those earning over $349,700, putting them in \nthis top marginal tax rate of 35 percent, earned a total of $1.1 \ntrillion. Of that amount, $565.4 billion was taxed at the top rate.\n  These 950,000 taxpayers, or the top .9 percent, paid a total of \n$315.4 billion in taxes, $198 billion at the top marginal rate. So if \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were repealed today, taxes on those filers \nwould increase $26 billion, an increase of $27,300 per top marginal \ntaxpayer, not an insignificant sum for those taxpayers, but clearly not \nenough to offset the cost of the Democratic spending plans.\n  What about broadening the definition of the ``rich'' by including \nthose taxpayers in the upper middle class, or those in the second \nhighest tax bracket of 33 percent? Would that bring in enough money?\n  Well, these 1.5 million taxpayers, or 1.4 percent of filers, paid \n$92.4 billion in taxes; $26.1 billion was paid at the marginal rate. If \nyou increased their tax rate from 33 percent to the pre-2001 level of \n36 percent, it would raise $2.4 billion in additional taxes.\n  Reinstating the 39.6-percent and 36-percent tax rates for the \ntaxpayers in those two top brackets raises $28.4 billion more than \nunder current rates, still just a fraction of what my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle want to spend.\n  What if one reaches down a little deeper and includes the middle \nclass by increasing taxes on people in the 25- and 28-percent tax \nbrackets?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. A back-of-the-envelope calculation using the same data shows \nthat raising the top four marginal rates would increase taxes for 28 \nmillion Americans, increasing revenue on a static basis $37 billion \nthis year and $111 billion over the next 5 years, not even enough to \noffset the cost of the additional discretionary spending assumed in the \nDemocratic budget resolution.\n  When someone claims to want to increase taxes only on the rich, \ntaxpayers should view such a proposal with a healthy dose of \nskepticism. Our experience with the AMT should convince us of that. \nTaxing the so-called rich never raises as much revenue as the other \nside claims and usually manages to hit a lot more taxpayers than just \nthe rich. Invariably, when one talks about raising taxes to pay for new \nspending, a lot of people who would otherwise not consider themselves \nto be wealthy end up paying more in taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, I wanted to discuss two things today. One \nis a hearing I have just concluded of our policy committee, and then I \nwant to talk about the price of gasoline and oil.\n  Let me talk first about the hearing I just concluded of the \nDemocratic policy committee. It is the 13th hearing I have done on the \nissue of contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, especially waste, fraud, \nand abuse of contracting in Iraq. I have held a good many hearings. I \nam not easily surprised any longer about what I hear at these hearings \nof the unbelievable waste and fraud and abuse in Government \ncontracting, where American taxpayers are being fleeced and where our \nsoldiers are being disserved by waste and fraud and abuse.\n  I do get surprised, even though I say it is hard to surprise me. \nToday I hear about the stealing of artwork and rugs and crystal, the \nstealing of gold in Iraq in some of the palaces by contract employees, \nthe stealing of gold and melting down of gold to make spurs for cowboy \nboots--something I hadn't heard before--the charging of a 100-percent \nmarkup on a little thing like a laptop computer. There is testimony \ntoday of the purchase of 300 laptops to be delivered to DynCorp in \nIraq. They were purchased for $1,400 apiece, and then the Government is \ncharged $2,800. That is a 100-percent markup.\n  A witness told us that a colleague of his was killed in a car in Iraq \nin a high-risk area. He was on an official assignment in an unarmored \ncar and that car\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nwas hit with an ambush and he lost his life. He said that colleague \nshould have been in the armored car, but the armored car was being used \nto transport prostitutes from Kuwait back to Baghdad for the enjoyment \nof this particular contractor's employees. So I say, I try not to be \nsurprised, but the depth of incompetence and waste and fraud and abuse \nin contracting in Iraq is unbelievable.\n  I started the hearing today by describing again, as I have a couple \nof times, a piece of work done by the New York Times that I wish \nperhaps would have been done by the Pentagon or by the Congress in \nterms of oversight.\n  This is Efraim Diveroli, the CEO of a firm awarded $300 million in a \ncontract by the Pentagon to arm the Afghani fighters. Our Pentagon \nwanted to provide weapons and ammunition to the Afghan fighters, a \nperfectly reasonable thing to do because they are taking on the Taliban \nand al-Qaida in Afghanistan. To arm the Afghan fighters, they \ncontracted with a company who had a 22-year-old CEO. This company was \nlargely a shell company established by this young 22-year-old's father. \nIt had been an inactive shell company, but now it is behind an unmarked \ndoor in Miami Beach, FL. So a 22-year-old CEO gets a contract with the \nPentagon. His 25-year-old vice president is a massage therapist, a \nmasseur. So you have a 22-year-old and a 25-year-old massage therapist \nrunning a company, and they get, we are told, a third of a billion \ndollars in contracts from the Pentagon.\n  By the way, the contracts were to provide ammunition to the Afghan \nfighters. Here is a photograph, again, crediting the New York Times. It \nis first-rate reporting by three reporters. Here is an example of what \nthey shipped to the Afghan fighters, ammunition including 40-year-old, \nChinese-made cartridges, and the pictures of what the Afghan fighters \nreceived from this $300 million contract--boxes taped up, bulging at \nthe seams and bursting at the side with bad ammunition. It is \nunbelievable.\n  The question is, How is it the Army Sustainment Command in Illinois \nprovided a $300 million contract to a company that had a 22-year-old \npresident of a company that used to be a shell company for most of its \nexistence and a 25-year-old massage therapist as a vice president and \nthey run off with a third of a billion dollars of the Pentagon's money?\n  Actually, the taxpayers' money, isn't it? So who is going to answer \nto that?\n  After the New York Times did their story, the Pentagon then suspended \nthis contract. But my understanding from a discussion with a high-\nranking Army official in the last week or so, that high-ranking Army \nofficial was saying privately: No, the contracting with that company \nwas perfectly logical and legitimate. It is just that the goods that \nwere provided the Afghanis didn't meet standards.\n  You tell me how a general in charge of this kind of contracting can \ndecide to take what had been a shell company and give a 22-year-old and \na 25-year-old masseur a third of a billion dollars. You justify that to \nthe American taxpayer. It is not going to happen. That cannot be \njustified.\n  It is long past the time for this Congress to do something about it. \nWe now have a very large urgent supplemental appropriations request in \nfront of Congress. How much of that money is for this purpose? How many \nof those contracts would be as embarrassing as this contract? How many \nof those contracts will go to allow the kinds of things I heard for 2 \nhours this afternoon at a hearing I just held in the Dirksen Building? \nWhen are we going to have some feeling that some of this stuff is going \nto be straightened out?\n  I have described before what we should do about it. Some of my \ncolleagues have put in place a piece of legislation called the Truman \nCommission. I fully support that. But that is a commission of people \noutside of our Government that will study and make recommendations on \nGovernment contracting. It is a good thing to do. I fully support it, \nbut the President is not implementing that commission, despite the fact \nit was passed into law. But what we really should do as well, because \nyou cannot delegate accountability for this, we really need what is \ncalled a Truman committee. That is a committee, a select committee, \nbipartisan committee in the Senate similar to the Truman committee of \nthe 1940s. Harry S. Truman created a bipartisan select committee in the \nSenate. It cost $15,000 at the start of the Second World War.\n  They held 60 hearings a year. It was bipartisan. It had subpoena \npower. With a $15,000 cost as they started it, it saved the American \ntaxpayers $15 billion. This Congress needs a Truman committee. Three \ntimes we have voted on it. Three times the minority voted against it. \nBecause it takes 60 votes, we do not now have a Truman committee.\n  In nearly every other major war, every other conflict, we have had \nsome kind of select committee to do the kind of oversight, to provide \nthe focus on the waste and fraud and abuse. But that has not been the \ncase now. We need to fix that. We need to make that happen. We have \nvoted on it three times, and we will be voting again because the \nAmerican taxpayers deserve that kind of oversight, that kind of \naccountability, and so, too, do the America soldiers who are being \ndisserved by this waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3424-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3424-S3426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a comment about \nenergy, the price of gasoline, and the price of oil.\n  It is not surprising to people what is happening in this country. We \nsee the price of oil and the price of gasoline, especially the price of \ngasoline, go up, up, and up because the price of oil has gone \nskyrocketing in recent months. I have a chart that shows what has \nhappened to the price of oil.\n  You can see from April of 2007 to April of 2008 the increase in the \nprice of oil. One might say, there must be something in the supply and \ndemand--the need for oil relative to the supply of oil--that causes \nthis to happen. After all, it is the market system, isn't it? No, it is \nnot the market system. There is no free market here. There is nothing \nabout a free market here.\n  A substantial portion of the oil is on the other side of the world, \ncontrolled by OPEC countries. That is not a free market. They sit in a \nroom with a closed door, and the oil ministers of the OPEC countries \nthen make decisions about supply and the effect on price that reflects \ntheir self-interest. So this is not some natural result of a market \nsystem.\n  I made the point a couple days ago that Saudi Arabia, which has the \nlargest known reserves of oil in the world, is producing 800,000 \nbarrels a day of oil less than they did 2 years ago. Think about that. \nThe largest producer of oil in the world has cut back production by \n800,000 barrels a day. Is it surprising that the price goes up and up? \nThat is one reason, isn't it? The largest supplier of oil has cut back \nproduction.\n  What is another reason? Another reason is this administration--a \nsmaller reason but nonetheless a reason--is taking oil from the Gulf of \nMexico as royalty-in-kind oil and putting it underground. Here is what \nthis administration is doing. At a time when oil is $110 to $120 a \nbarrel, bouncing around like a yo-yo, this administration is taking \n62,000 barrels of oil every day and sticking it underground in what is \ncalled the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nis 97 percent filled. Yet when oil is at a record high, this \nadministration is continuing to stick oil underground, taking it out of \nsupply and putting it underground. That is an unbelievably inept policy \nbecause it puts upward pressure on oil prices and upward pressure on \ngas prices.\n  The fact is, this isn't just any oil. This is sweet light crude which \nis a subset of oil, the most valuable subset of oil. And we have had \ntestimony before the Energy Committee saying this activity does affect \nthe price of oil and the price of gasoline in a negative way.\n  When I say putting it in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, this chart \nshows where they are putting it. This is what it all looks like. This \nis the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The oil goes underground. \nThey had a choice with that oil. The choice would have been to put it \nin the marketplace and perhaps reduce some of these prices. Instead \nthey stick it underground. It is a bad policy. I aim to change it in \nour appropriations process, in the supplemental. One way or another, we \nare going to vote on this.\n  Do you really think that at $115 to $120 a barrel, we ought to be \nsticking\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\noil underground and increasing the price? I don't.\n  There is another thing happening with respect to the price of oil. I \njust mentioned the Saudis cutting production back 800,000 barrels a day \nover the last 2 years. I just mentioned putting nearly 70,000 barrels \nunderground every single day by this administration. That further cuts \nthe amount in the supply line.\n  But there is something else happening with the price of oil. An orgy \nof speculation is occurring in the futures market for oil and gas. This \ndidn't used to happen. The futures market is necessary. It is necessary \nto hedge. It is necessary to provide liquidity. I understand all that. \nBut the futures market has become something unbelievably speculative. \nWe have hedge funds neck deep in the futures market. Do they want oil? \nThey don't want any oil. They just want to bet on oil. They want to \ngamble on oil. These are people who want to buy something they will \nnever get from people who never had it and make money on both sides of \nthe transaction in a futures market. We have hedge funds making big \nbets on oil in the futures market. We have investment banks making big \nbets on oil. Investment banks didn't used to be engaged in the futures \nmarket, but they are now.\n  In addition to that, in addition to the investment banks working in \nthe futures market, we have investment banks that are actually buying \noil storage for the purpose of taking oil off the market and putting it \nin storage until oil is more valuable later.\n  That is what is happening. We have not previously had that occur. So \nwe have this binge of speculation in the futures market that has \nnothing at all to do with the supply and demand of oil. Why is this \nhappening? At least in part it is happening because in the stock \nmarket. If you want to buy stock on margins, you have to pay 50 percent \nof the margin. You have to come up with half the money. If you want to \nbuy stock on the margin, come up with half the money. If you want to \nbuy oil on margin in the futures market, all you need to come up with \nis 5 to 7 percent. If you want to control 100 million dollars' worth of \noil contracts, $5,000 to $7,000 will do it for you.\n  It is almost unbelievable what has happened with respect to the \nspeculation in these futures markets. My belief is, we should change \nthe margin requirements on the futures markets. When there is excess \nspeculation, it injures this country's economy. It damages the American \neconomy. This excess speculation has been pushing up oil prices in a \nvery significant way.\n  Yes, there is a combination of things that are happening. One is, as \nI said, the Saudis cut back production by 800,000 barrels a day. Our \nGovernment, the Department of Energy, is sticking nearly 70,000 barrels \na day underground of sweet, light crude. But it is also the case that a \nsignificant part of this, in my judgment, comes from a binge of \nspeculation on the futures markets. I believe we should increase the \nmargin requirement at least to 25 percent.\n  I want to go through a couple of observations.\n  On April 1 of this year, Stephen Simon, a senior vice president of \nExxonMobil testified that:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-$55 per barrel.\n\n  Oh, really? Then why isn't it? This is from an oil expert saying: I \nthink the price of oil should be around $50 or $55 a barrel.\n  Well, this company is making plenty of money off of the current price \nof oil. The price is double. That company must grin all the way to the \nbank. That company, the Saudis, the OPEC countries, and the other large \noil companies, they must be smiling all the way to the bank. But Mr. \nSimon says the price of oil should be about $50 or $55 a barrel.\n  Mr. Clarence Cazalot, Jr., the CEO of Marathon Oil said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  That was during a question-and-answer period with reporters. He said \na more reasonable range for crude oil prices was between $55 and $60 a \nbarrel. Now, understand what he said. He said: ``$100 [a barrel] oil \nisn't justified by the physical demand in the market.'' He is the CEO \nof one of the large oil companies in the country.\n  This price is not justified by supply-demand.\n  Well, we are told the market system works; supply-demand determines \nthe market price. I used to teach a little economics in college, and \nyou teach supply-demand curves. You also talk about a free market, \nthere is no free market here, of course.\n  As I started to say earlier, we have the OPEC countries, that is a \ncartel. We have the big oil companies--all with two names now. \nExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips--they all have two names because they found \nthey like each other and they wanted to marry up. So they merged. So \nthey have much more muscle in the marketplace. Then we have the futures \nmarkets which have become a binge of speculation.\n  A New Jersey Star Ledger article from January of this year said:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of Exxon Mobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds 20 to 30 percent or \n     more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  Fadel Gheit is a man who came to testify before the Senate Energy \nCommittee. Fadel Gheit is an energy analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. I \nthink he has been with them for 25 or 30 years. He knows this business. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. . . . I'm \n     absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime \n     above $55 a barrel. . . . Oil speculators include ``the \n     largest financial institutions in the world.''\n\n  He said:\n\n       Call it the world's largest gambling hall. . . . It's open \n     24/7. . . . Unfortunately, it's totally unregulated. . . . \n     This is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit, and \n     everybody's going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  Now, here is a picture of NYMEX, the New York Mercantile Exchange, \nwhere you can trade commodities such as oil. You will see the trading \npits. A lot of people have made a lot of money in those trading pits. \nIn fact, I have a Wall Street Journal story that describes this that is \ntitled: ``Trader Hits Jack Pot in Oil, as Commodity Boom Roars On.'' \nThis describes Mr. Andrew Hall. Mr. Andrew Hall has earned a lot of \nmoney, about $250 million--a quarter of a billion dollars. It says:\n\n       The commodities market's historic surge is generating huge \n     paydays on Wall Street. One of the biggest beneficiaries has \n     been Andrew Hall, an enigmatic British-born trader who, five \n     years ago, anticipated an important shift in the way the \n     world valued oil--and bet big.\n\n  The point of this is, here is a man who made a lot of money. I do not \nbegrudge a man making a lot of money. But he made a lot of money by \nbetting. He bet big. Isn't that interesting? As I said before, the \nnotion of buying something you will never get from somebody who never \nhad it--that is the futures market. It provides liquidity, yes. But \nwhen it goes way beyond liquidity and encompasses a binge of \nspeculation, that is damaging and harmful to this country, then it \nseems to me it is not anything about the market system.\n  Anybody who has studied history and knows economics knows we have \nseen binges of speculation before. Go back four or five centuries, and \nyou will read about a tulip bulb--one tulip bulb being sold for $25,000 \nbecause there was a speculative binge which, in the rearview mirror, \nlooks completely irrational with respect to the price of tulip bulbs.\n\n  Well, we have seen over the centuries many of these binges of \nspeculation. We now see it in the futures market, in my judgment, in \npart because the margin requirement is so unbelievably low: 5 to 7 \npercent. We now see binges of speculation that are driving up the price \nof oil and causing the American consumers an enormous amount of lost \nincome and great difficulty.\n  There is a group of truckers who have come to Washington, DC, today. \nI was talking to somebody who was a little disadvantaged--He said he \ngot slowed down on some travel up Constitution Avenue. I said: Well, \nthat is an inconvenience, but think of what truckers are going through \nright now--a whole lot more than inconvenience. When it costs a \nsubstantial amount of money--one trucker talked about that it cost \n$1,000 to fill his truck with fuel. That is a lot more than an \ninconvenience.\n  I talked a week or two ago about how I think there are three \nairlines--perhaps now four--that have announced bankruptcy as a result \nof fuel prices.\n  We have working folks who will drive up to the gas pump tonight to \ntry to\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\nfill their tank, trying to figure out how to get the money. Where does \nthe money come from to pay for the gas?\n  At the same time, we have people who are engaged on the futures \nmarket and who are going to the bank with the largest profits ever \nseen.\n  I think we have a right to ask in this country--when we have a market \nthat is not a free market; when we have a perverted market, first by \nOPEC, a cartel, second by excessive speculation on futures markets--\ndon't we have a responsibility to do something? I think the answer to \nthat is clearly yes.\n  So my hope is we will, first, decide to support an amendment that I \nwill offer to the supplemental that immediately shuts down placing \nnearly 70,000 barrels of oil every single day underground at a time \nwhen we need that in the supply pipeline. Why should we allow the \nDepartment of Energy to be taking oil at the highest possible price and \nsticking it underground? We can fix this, and we can fix it soon, \nwithin a matter of weeks, if we had the will to do it.\n  Second, while we have not previously legislated on the issue of a \nmargin requirement for engaging in speculation on the commodities \nexchanges, I think if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or other \nentities will not do it, I think Congress should. After all, Congress \ncreated the mechanism by which these exchanges exist. We created the \nreferee for the exchanges, and if it does not work, then we have a \nresponsibility to fix it.\n  I recall--and it does not relate to the oil companies--but I chaired \nthe hearings on Enron over in the Commerce Committee. I had the CEO of \nEnron come and testify in front of me and take the fifth amendment. Ken \nLay came and said he could not speak and took the fifth amendment. But \nwhen he did speak later he said he did not know anything about what was \ngoing on.\n  The fact is, there was unbelievable speculation going on on the west \ncoast on wholesale electricity prices and the manipulation of markets, \nand it cost tens of billions of dollars to west coast consumers who \nwere bilked out of that money.\n  When the system does not work, when regulatory authorities are not \nwilling to regulate, when those who are supposed to be referees in this \nfree market system are not making sure a perverted system is changed to \nmake sure it works, then we have a responsibility in Congress to deal \nwith it and to respond to it.\n  So I believe very strongly there are a few things we can do. First, \nstop SPR oil from going underground; second, find ways to increase the \nmargin requirement on the futures market. There are several other \napproaches we can use as well.\n  But I would conclude by saying this: I am just a little tired of \npeople talking about the free market. There is no free market here. I \nwant oil companies to do well. I want them to find more oil. I was one \nof four people in this Chamber who led the fight--successfully, I might \nadd--to open Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico where there is substantial \noil and gas reserves. I believe we should produce more, and I witnessed \nthat by being one of four Members of the Senate who helped get that \ndone.\n  We should conserve more. We should provide much greater efficiency \nwith all the things we use. We should provide much greater effort to \nrenewable energy. We should do all of those things. But even as we do \nthem, in my judgment, we have a responsibility to address this issue of \noil and oil pricing. Even the oil companies say there is no \njustification, given the current supply and demand, for the price of \noil to be above $60, $65 a barrel. We have heard it in the statements \nof people who run our major oil companies.\n  The rest of it is going up to the hedge funds and the investment \nbanks and others who are making massive amounts of money at the expense \nof truckers, at the expense of airlines, at the expense of the ordinary \nAmerican drivers who are trying to figure out: How on Earth do I pay \nthis bill?, and stopping excessive speculation.\n  We need to fix this, and the sooner the better because I believe it \nis damaging our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at 5:30 this afternoon, the Senate will \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nreauthorization of the airport and airway trust fund, also known as the \naviation trust fund. I urge my colleagues to support getting to this \nimportant bill.\n  Before getting to the specifics of the bill, however, I would like to \ngive some perspective on our current aviation system. And I will start \nwith the story of Sir Robert Watson-Watt.\n  Robert Watson-Watt was born in Scotland in 1892. He was a descendant \nof the steam-engine pioneer James Watt. Robert was a student of \nscience, with a fascination for radio waves and how they might be used \nto transmit information. After finishing school, he got a job as a \nmeteorologist at the Royal Aircraft Factory, not far from London. He \nworked on developing methods of using radio waves to help British \nairmen locate and avoid thunderstorms.\n  After years of work, in 1935, Watson-Watt produced a report called \n``The Detection of Aircraft by Radio Methods.'' The report suggested a \nnew idea. The idea was that people could use shortwave radio to detect \nnot only bad weather, but also aircraft, including bombers.\n  Watson-Watt's superiors tested his theory, and it worked. They called \nhis new gizmo RADAR, an acronym for radio detection and ranging.\n  By the time that World War II broke out in September 1939, the \nBritish Government had installed radar all along the English Channel \nand the North Sea coasts. That gave the British advance warning of \nHitler's bombers. Acclaimed historian A.J.P. Taylor said he doubted \nthat Britain could have survived the Second World War without Watson-\nWatt's invention.\n  Next, radar was ready for commercial application. All civil aviation \nneeded for dramatic growth was a faster set of planes. That happened \nwith advent of the jet engine in the 1950s and 1960s.\n  In 1952, what is now British Airways introduced the de Havilland \nComets. Those were 36-seat British-made jets that could fly as fast as \n500 miles an hour. Six years later, the Boeing 707 entered commercial \nservice. Pan Am flew it from New York to Paris in just under 9 hours--\ntwice as fast as a propeller plane.\n  It took Charles Lindberg 33 hours--almost four times longer.\n  Seven years after that, in February 1969, the world's first wide-body \njet--the Boeing 747--made its inaugural flight. With seating for up to \n450 passengers, the 747 was 80 percent bigger than the largest jet of \nthat time. The era of mass aviation was in full swing.\n  But as air travel flourished, growing pains ensued. And by the late \n1960s, public concern over air-traffic had spilled into the headlines: \nHere's a news story from 1967.\n\n       Thicket in the Skies. . . . When a passenger hops a \n     commercial plane to get from here to there quickly, he soon \n     discovers that man does not live by one means of \n     transportation alone. The Labor Day weekend congestion and \n     peril underscores the point. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\n\n  And here's another story, from May 1969:\n\n       FAA Predicts Summer Air Jam. . . . [The FAA] forecast \n     yesterday that, despite Federal restrictions that would limit \n     flights at five major airports beginning June 1, air \n     travelers might have another summer of frustrating delays.\n\n  In short, the air transport system had grown beyond anyone's \nexpectations. Change was needed. Congress responded by passing \ngroundbreaking legislation.\n  In May 1970, Congress passed the aviation trust fund. Congress built \non a Nixon administration proposal to adopt a law in which users of the \naviation system paid for its upkeep. The new law imposed taxes on \ntickets, fuel, cargo, and the like. And the law established the \naviation trust fund to provide a stable source of funding for our \nNation's aviation needs.\n  Despite some ups and downs over the last 38 years--including a lapse \nof the Trust Fund in the early 1980s--this system of funding air \ntraffic has by and large succeeded. The rates of the taxes have \nchanged. And some--like those on aircraft tires--have been phased out. \nBut generally, this Trust Fund has managed to finance the needs of the \nair-traveling public.\n  Not anymore. Our system needs modernization, to improve efficiency \nand safety. Our 2008 trust fund, born in the 1970s, is paying for 1930s \ntechnology. That will change with passage of this bill. That will \nchange with the adoption of NextGen.\n  And that brings us to the bill in connection with which we will vote \nthis afternoon--the reauthorization of the airport and airway trust \nfund, also known as the aviation trust fund. The trust fund finances \nthe U.S. aviation system, with about $12 billion per year in user-based \ntaxes. The Senate substitute amendment would provide an additional $800 \nmillion to the trust fund over the next 3 years. The bill would provide \nneeded funds to modernize our aviation system.\n  The Senate substitute amendment is a compromise product. It \nrepresents months of work on the part of the Finance and Commerce \nCommittees. Its passage promises improvements in safety and efficiency \nfor air travelers.\n  Key to that improvement is NextGen. NextGen is the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's plan to modernize the Nation's air-traffic system. \nNextGen would address the effect of air traffic growth. It would \nincrease air-traffic capacity and efficiency. And it would improve \nsafety and reduce the effect of air travel on the environment.\n  Generally speaking, NextGen involves the use of satellite-based \ntechnology. This includes items like Automatic Dependent Surveillance \nBroadcast. ADS-B would allow aircraft to continuously transmit \nlocation, speed, and altitude to other planes, pilots, and controllers. \nAnd that would improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic.\n  Instead of using Watson-Watt's radar to tell where they are, planes \nequipped with ADS-B get their exact location from Global Positioning \nSystem satellites. They then broadcast their flight number, speed, and \nheading--automatically and continuously--to ground control and other \nplanes within 150 miles. This is a sea change in air-traffic \ntechnology. And we need to invest in it now.\n  So how do we pay for NextGen? The Finance Committee passed a bill to \npay for NextGen this way:\n  First, we set the tax for General Aviation jet fuel at 36 cents a \ngallon. That is up from the current 21.9 cents a gallon. This proposal \nwas agreed to by the General Aviation community. And it will raise \nabout $240 million a year in additional funds for NextGen. Note that \nthis proposal does not affect those who fly planes using ``avgas,'' \nsuch as a propeller-powered Cessna.\n  Second, we moved partially owned planes--known as ``fractional'' \naircraft--from the commercial taxation regime to that of General \nAviation. Fractional owners expressed concern that without this change, \ntheir ability to fly and land in Europe would be hampered. The European \nUnion has strict rules governing which airports commercial flights can \nuse. And this change should allow fractional aircraft to be considered \nas general aviation not commercial aviation. This change comes with a \ncost to the fractional users.\n  The Senate substitute amendment drops a proposed increase on the tax \non international departures and arrivals. The Finance Committee bill \nproposed raising that rate--currently at $15.40--by $1.55 each way. \nThat is just over $3 roundtrip. We argued that if someone had the \nwherewithal to travel overseas, then the cost of a Starbucks at the \nairport was a reasonable price to pay for contributing to a modernized \nair traffic system.\n  But given the state of the commercial airline industry, Senator \nRockefeller and I agreed to drop this provision. In the face of \ndramatically higher fuel prices and mounting financial losses, we \nagreed that this was not the time to raise extra funds from the \ncommercial industry.\n  All told, the package in the Senate substitute amendment raises an \nadditional $800 million over the next 3 years. More may be needed, \nespecially given the rapid state of technological change. I know that \nboth the Finance Committee and Commerce Committee plan to monitor \nNextGen's implementation. And since this is just a 3-year \nreauthorization, we will be back at this again before long.\n  Finally, I will note that this bill is not just about aviation. The \nFinance Committee package also contains other critical infrastructure \nitems, including a direly needed fix to the highway trust fund. The \nhighway trust fund will run a deficit in 2009, unless Congress acts to \nrepair that deficit.\n  In a time when our surface transportation suffers as much as--if not \nmore so--than our air transport system, it is imperative that Congress \nact to restore needed monies to the highway trust fund. We need to \nfinance construction and repair of our Nation's roads and bridges.\n  Taxes on gasoline, diesel, and heavy trucks finance the highway trust \nfund. The highway trust fund is thus sensitive to changes in the use of \nthese items. As Americans drive less, and as vehicle fuel-efficiency \nincreases, the highway trust fund's balance has taken a significant \nhit.\n  A highway trust fund deficit is projected for 2009. And even worse \nprojections are expected for 2010 and beyond. As we get nearer to the \nnext highway bill, it's important that we at least make the highway \ntrust fund whole going into 2009. The Senate substitute amendment would \ndo that. And I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, we'll have a vigorous debate this week. And I look \nforward to it.\n  But before that debate begins in earnest, I want to thank my \ncolleagues--particularly Senators Rockefeller and Inouye--for their \nwillingness to seek common ground. I think that the Senate substitute \namendment is a good package.\n  So let us help to bring air travel from Robert Watson-Watt's 1935 \nidea into the 21st century. Let us adopt NextGen to improve safety and \nefficiency in the skies. And let us vote to move to this bill this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time during the quorum call be equally divided between \nthe two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe it is absolutely crucial \nand probable, perhaps, but crucial that we have a vibrant and strong \naviation industry and aviation industry discussion on the floor of the \nSenate. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Nation's economic \nwell-being depends on the Federal Aviation Administration and the \naviation industry moving millions and millions of people and tons of \ncargo every single day.\n  I just landed at Washington National Airport, and it was absolutely \njammed. I am trying to think what it will be like in 10 years. Even on \nthe very best day, the Federal Aviation Administration struggles to \noperate the most complex airspace system in the world, a job made \nharder by an extremely antiquated air traffic control system which \nnobody else in the industrial\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\nworld has, but we do. It is akin to using an x ray instead of an MRI. \nIt is antiquated, it is pathetic, it wastes a lot of time, and it \ncreates a lot of waiting for passengers.\n  Bad weather, mechanical problems, lax oversight by the Federal \nadministrators can end up stranding hundreds of thousands of \npassengers--and it has--increasing jet fuel costs and making it harder \nand harder for airlines to operate. I particularly refer to legacy; \nthat is, to the commercial airlines, which is the heart and soul of our \nsystem. All this amounts to a perfect storm that can and very may well \nwreck our aviation system.\n  An aviation expert predicts the situation is going to get much worse \nand very soon. By the year 2015, delays will become so bad that none of \nthe 1 billion people predicted to fly that year will ever get to their \ndestinations on time. More planes will be needed, and that will lead to \ngreater congestion in the skies, a meltdown of the air traffic control \nsystem, and it will put passenger safety at extreme risk. If the FAA \ncannot manage the current situation, how can we expect them to deal \nwith the challenges of the future.\n  Clearly, we need to take steps to turn this situation around. We must \nbe prepared to take bold action and chart a course toward modernizing \nour aviation system and improving passenger safety. Again, I remind my \ncolleagues, we are far behind every other industrial country in the \nworld in our capacity. Toward that end, the Aviation Investment and \nModernization Act truly lives up to its name. It is called S. 1300. It \nwill establish a roadmap for the implementation of the next generation \ntraffic control system. That is a GPS digitalized instead of an analog, \nx-ray type of system we have now. It will adequately and fairly fund \nthis system, invest in our Nation's airport infrastructure, and \ncontinue to improve small community access to the Nation's aviation \nsystem.\n  S. 1300 is a product of compromises, not all of them pleasing to me. \nIt is a good bill that has been made stronger. I have no doubt it will \nbe further strengthened as it is considered by the full Senate.\n  In crafting this legislation, then-Senator Lott and I listened to the \nindustry stakeholders. Each had their own opinion on how to best \nimprove the aviation infrastructure, which was basically based upon the \npremise that they did not want to pay any more for anything. The one \ncommon theme from everyone was the urgent need to modernize our air \ntraffic control system to meet the growing surge of passengers and to \ndeal with the enormous increase in general aviation, particularly high-\nend jet aircraft. I will have a lot more to say about that in the next \nfew days.\n\n  However, in recent months, that sense of urgency has been replaced \nwith a debate over who should pay and how much as we work through how \nbest to fund the modernization of our air traffic control system. The \nfar more critical point of just how severe the problem has become, \ntherefore, has been lost. Everyone is looking at how much they are \ngoing to do about this or do about that, and the general situation, the \ncrisis we are facing all across this country, is not being looked at. \nOur air traffic control system relies on radio and radar to direct the \nhundreds of thousands of planes in the skies. It is a relic of the \n1950s. The sad truth is that the GPS device in our cars or cell phones \nis more sophisticated than the hardware used to guide passenger and \ncargo planes in the air. That should not make Americans happy.\n  In this Senator's judgment, our air traffic control system is a \nnational embarrassment. Unfortunately, the administration does not \nshare this view. They seem to be prepared to accept the status quo. \nMore to the point, they don't seem to care and have not shown up. \nBefore Senator Murray assumed control of the Appropriations \nTransportation Subcommittee, the administration, in fact, proposed a \n$600 million cut in the FAA's--and this is just a technical term--\nfacilities and equipment account, which funds the whole question of a \nnew air traffic control system, a digitalized GPS-based one.\n  To reverse this course, S. 1300 provides over $12 billion to \nmodernize the Nation's aging air traffic control system to allow the \nFAA to meet the projected increase in passengers over the next 10 \nyears. Overall, this will probably cost between $40 and $60 billion in \nthe long run. I believe S. 1300 lays the necessary foundation for \ndeveloping the next-generation air traffic control system. We create a \nstable and guaranteed level of funding for FAA's capital investment \naccounts. That is what the current situation desperately needs. As a \nresult, passenger safety should improve, commerce will flow more \nefficiently, and air carriers will see their fuel costs reduced. I say \nthat with my fingers crossed.\n  What should not get lost in all this talk about runways and air \ntraffic control systems and financing is the human element of air \ntravel. The U.S. aviation system is, in fact, the safest in the world. \nBut underneath those statistics lie lurking a lot of danger. We have to \nstay vigilant if we want that record to continue. This act, called the \nAIM Act, includes a number of provisions to improve safety by providing \nthe FAA with the resources to conduct thorough oversight of air \ncarriers and foreign repair stations and upgrade the existing \ninfrastructure at our airports. It is arcane stuff, but at the heart of \nour commerce system.\n  S. 1300 authorizes approximately $65 billion for all of FAA's \noperations and programs and provides approximately $16 billion for \nairport infrastructure grants to meet airport safety and capacity \nneeds.\n  The bill also reaffirms our commitment to rural America, and it \nincreases the authorized funding level for the Essential Air Service \nProgram. Most won't know what that is, but those of us who live in \nrural areas know that we have no connection with the outside world \nwithout the Essential Air Service Program. If we want to connect with \nthe rest of the world, we have to have that.\n  This bill extends the Small Community Air Service Development Program \nfor 4 more years. What is that? I will not explain it fully now, but \nthis program has provided dozens of communities with the resources \nnecessary to attract and retain air service.\n  As a Senator from West Virginia, I know how incredibly crucial both \nof these programs are in keeping our rural communities connected with \nthe national aviation system. We have to be a part of that blood flow \nor else we shrink up. Without these important subsidies, air carriers \nwould have no incentive to operate in and out of the most rural parts \nof many States--not just West Virginia, not just Iowa, but Texas, \nCalifornia, all kinds of places--New York. Rural is everywhere. Rural \nairports are everywhere. People should not be discriminated against \nbecause they come from rural areas as opposed to urban areas.\n  These two subsidies--the Essential Air Service Program and the \nCommunity Air Service Development Program, the airport development \nprogram--have made an incredible impact on the economic development in \nWest Virginia. Having flights connected with Atlanta, Dulles, even \nDetroit, have helped attract international investors to our State--for \nexample, Toyota. It is absolutely essential, moving forward, that we \nraise the authorization for these two programs so that people \neverywhere can continue flying and get to where they need to go.\n  Our bill strengthens passenger protections by incorporating elements \nof the Passenger Bill of Rights to deal with the most egregious flight \ndelays and cancellations. For example, the industry would be required \nto provide passengers with information regarding ontime arrivals and \nchronically delayed flights.\n  Aviation incorporates so many of the things that are so critical to \nus. It connects people to distant family members, links businesses to \nbusinesses, and joins the world which has already shrunk and allows \npeople easily to interact on a global scale. It is still amazing to me \nto be able to board a plane one morning in West Virginia and to be \nhalfway around the world that same day. But really, what railroads and \nhighways were to the 19th and 20th century air transportation is to the \n21st century. But I know that if we do not make investments in our \nNation's aviation system now, then we will fall far behind the rest of \nthe world. Falling far behind the rest of the world is a relative term. \nI just want us to be good and safe. I want us to be good and safe. We \nare not now. Our commercial airlines are just barely hanging on--\nbarely.\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed to S. 1300, \nthe Aviation Investment and Modernization Act of 2008.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask the distinguished Senator how \nlong his presentation is?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As I told the Senator, I have to be upstairs in 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized immediately following the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, transportation is an important part of \nthe American economy. It is vital to all rural and urban communities \nthat people are able to travel in a timely, safe, and cost efficient \nmanner. Whether it is the businesswoman traveling to meet her clients \nor visit her company's plants, the tourist who wants to experience the \nbeauty and uniqueness of our country, or the grandparents visiting \ntheir grandchildren; efficient, affordable, and safe travel is \nimperative.\n  For several years we have been working on reauthorizing the aviation \nbill. While this process has not always been easy, I am pleased that we \nreached a bipartisan agreement and have a good bill before the Senate.\n  All of us have a vested interest in ensuring a stable, dependable, \nand predictable revenue flow to the airport and airways trust fund. \nAviation has changed since the last time Congress considered aviation \nlegislation. This bill reshapes our system to better reflect today's \nrealities. It provides more funding to further modernize our air \ntraffic control systems, airports, and facilities. It also provides for \nmore efficient and safe travel to reduce delays and ease congestion in \nour skies.\n  While the United States has one of the best records for aviation \nsafety, we need to continue to do better. We are back to the level of \nair traffic that we saw before 9/11 and we will likely see this number \ngrow tremendously.\n  In light of these capacity issues and the 1950s equipment being used \nto manage our skies, our Nation needs to move as quickly and prudently \ntowards the next generation of air traffic control systems. This bill \nprovides more funding towards this project. Now is the right time to \nreplace the old radar technology with real time GPS technology. The \nAmerican people deserve our investment in this new system.\n  This bill also takes an honest look at the diversity of our airport \nsystem. It structures funding for the safety and fairness of every \nairport in America.\n  Rural States, like Iowa, have many communities that rely on our \nelaborate air transportation system. People who live near hub airports \nhave the opportunity to take advantage of air travel somewhat \nefficiently and at a reasonable price. However, those in rural areas \nhave more difficulties. This challenge has become even more difficult \nafter 9/11 when most small communities were reduced to one air carrier \nwith less frequent flights. Commercial carriers only fly into \napproximately 500 airports, although that is a business choice and \nthere are other airports they could serve. It is more expensive to do \nbusiness in rural America. This bill will continue the vital programs \nthat our rural communities rely on to keep competitive in the worldwide \nmarketplace.\n  Over the past decade, a new prong has developed in the aviation \nindustry. Traditionally, the focus has been on just two main \ncategories, commercial aviation and the private airplanes for \nindividual or corporate use. Today, we have a growing new class of \nbusiness aviation, which includes the new dynamic of fractional jet \nownerships. The new business class is anticipated to grow at a faster \nrate than other segments of the industry. This new prong is providing \nvaluable opportunities for businesses to enhance efficiencies and \nproductivity, and is also a potential way for rural areas to have more \ntransportation opportunities.\n  While business aviation is good for and may be a saving grace for \nstruggling rural economies, the growth of business aviation is creating \nmore stress on our national air traffic system. This bill provides more \nequity by having the business sector contribute more to the funding of \nour aviation system.\n  This bill not only addresses important aviation policy, it also \nprovides the needed funding for Congress to meet the funding \ncommitments made in the 2005 highway bill.\n  Currently, we fund highway infrastructure through fuel and other \nexcise taxes. With record high gas prices and more fuel efficient \nvehicles, the highway trust fund has not had the receipts that were \nanticipated in 2005. Therefore, a shortfall is anticipated for fiscal \nyear 2009 and for future years.\n  It is vital that the highway trust fund is kept whole through the \nlife of the current authorization, SAFETEA-LU, so Congress can look to \nlong-term financing solutions to meet our surface transportation needs. \nWe need to have an important national dialogue in the next year so \nCongress can act in a prudent and expeditious manner on the next \nhighway bill.\n  Provisions included in this bill will fill the funding shortfall for \nfiscal year 2009. Offsets are provided so this funding will not add to \nthe overall budget deficit. Our States need to have the certainty that \nthis funding will be in place so they can continue with vital projects \nto improve safety on our Nation's bridges and roadways.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nand Commerce Committees in working together to bring this important \nbill to the Senate floor. This bill is good for Iowa and the Nation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I come to the floor today as the \nranking member of the Senate Aviation Subcommittee. I am going to \nencourage my colleagues to support cloture on the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization \nbill.\n  I have been working with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee and \nthe Finance Committee to develop a bill that we can all agree on. On \nthe main parts of the Commerce Committee bill, and the main parts of \nthe Finance Committee bill, we have come to agreement. There is one \nmajor part that was put in at the last minute that I think will bring \neverything down if we are not able to negotiate it. I am going to \ndiscuss that in a minute.\n  But I believe we have been able, in the main Commerce committee bill, \nof which Senator Rockefeller is the chairman, I am the ranking member \nof the Aviation Subcommittee that put together the package, and in the \nmain part of that bill, we have struck a balance that would finance the \nmodernization of the FAA airport development, rural air service that is \nso important in our country, and the labor-related provision.\n  If we want a final bill, I tell my colleagues that we must keep that \nbalance. We cannot load up this bill with controversial provisions, \nmany of which are in the House bill, which is the bill we are going to \ngo to cloture on, after which there will be the substitute on with the \nCommerce bill.\n  The House FAA bill already has a veto threat against it, and the \nprospects of a multiyear reauthorization for the FAA will diminish \nquickly if we do not resist the temptation to make this a political \ndocument. We have the opportunity to pass critical funding increases \nfor the modernization projects, timely improvements for the safety \nprograms at FAA, improvements to small community air service, and \nconsumer and passenger protections.\n  Senator Boxer and I have worked on the passenger protections, \nespecially when an airplane is sitting on the runway unable to take \noff. In the bill we have before us, which we will talk more about when \nthe substitute is put forward, there is a 3-hour limit on how long an \nairplane can stay on the ground without letting passengers off. We \nthink this is a major step in the right direction.\n  What I am going to be looking at, as we go through the week, is that \nwe cannot do further harm to the aviation industry in this country. \nRising fuel prices, tight credit markets, and the slowing economy are \nwreaking havoc on our U.S. carriers. There is not one that is saying: \nWe are doing well.\n  As we move forward, I hope we will keep that in mind, rather than \nadding burdens that cannot be maintained. If this bill is going to \nthrow any one of our airlines into a bankruptcy position, we will have \nfailed.\n  Now, I am very concerned about the pension provision that was put in \nat\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nthe last, I guess in the last couple of days, that would take away a \ncareful balance that was passed by this Congress last year. We worked \nvery hard to make sure that the airlines that have kept their defined \nbenefit plans, meaning they give full pensions to their members, are \nnot held in a position that would be detrimental versus carriers that \nhave gone to a defined contribution or 401(k) plan.\n  The new pension provision that was put in the Finance section of the \nFAA reauthorization bill does create an inequity for carriers trying to \nmaintain their defined benefit plan. The language would create a \ndisincentive for the airlines to fully fund their pension liabilities, \nbecause the new proposal would disallow past excess contributions being \ncarried forward in future years as currently allowed.\n  To put this in perspective, for instance, American Airlines currently \nhas about a 93-percent funding level in their defined benefit plan. \nHowever, the required level of funding for their plan is 80 percent. So \nthey have a significantly higher level of funding than is required.\n  In difficult times, which everyone should see all of the airlines are \nin, they would be allowed, under present law, to use the excess funding \nlevel to meet their ongoing obligations like a downpayment.\n  Unfortunately, the language that was put in the Finance Committee \nbill strips that ability to use these excess contributions and instead \nforces them to fully fund their ongoing obligations at 100 percent. So \nrather than owing roughly $80 million for their annual contribution, \nthey would instead owe $350 million. Over 3 years, that would be almost \nabout $1 billion, even though they are 93 percent funded on their \nobligations.\n  This penalizes companies for having done the right thing in providing \nsignificant prior funding for their pensions, and it changes the rules \nof a carefully balanced congressional directive.\n  I hope we can work this out before we come to the point at which we \nare trying to put the Finance Committee portion of this bill with the \nCommerce Committee portion. I very much hope our members will become \nvery educated on this issue, because if we are going to do this kind of \nharm, we should not be passing an authorization bill at all and instead \ndo a long-term extension of the FAA authorization bill, and try to work \nthese issues out so that no airline will be harmed or put in a \nsignificantly disadvantaged position relative to their competitors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 2 minutes in favor of bringing this bill \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased that Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nBaucus, and their ranking members of the subcommittees and the full \ncommittee, the Chairs of Finance and Commerce have worked together to \nbring us to this moment where we can reauthorize the FAA bill. It has \nreached the time.\n  I was very pleased that Senator Hutchison mentioned the Passenger \nBill of Rights that I was so pleased to author along with Senator \nOlympia Snowe. I was so pleased to have the support of so many on the \ncommittee. I wanted to remind everyone, it is important that we move \nforward on this bill.\n  There are so many things we have to consider now. We see what is \nhappening with our air service. When it works right, it is terrific. \nMyself, today, it all worked right. I had to take two planes to get \nhere all the way from California. It was smooth. But there are times \nwhen it is not smooth. We all know that.\n  But what we want to make sure of is that passengers are treated \nfairly, and without the heavy-handed Federal Government in everything. \nWe make sure that the system works. That led me to author the Passenger \nBill of Rights.\n  Kate Hanni was one of the people who got trapped on a plane for, I do \nnot remember if it was 8 or 10 hours with her two little boys. There \nwas no food for them. There were overflowing restrooms. It was a \nnightmare. People could not access their medicines. They were not \nallowed to, and certainly people did not have an option to get off the \nplane. And this happened over and over again.\n  I think we have all had experiences like that or we know someone who \ndid. There is no excuse for this. People have to have adequate water, \nadequate food, and be able to use a clean restroom and get access to \ntheir medicines.\n  It seems to me that ought to be a basic rule of the airlines. It is \nnot. And that is why we wrote this Passenger Bill of Rights, and the \ncommittee supported it in the underlying bill, and people will be \ngranted those what I consider very minimum rights.\n  We think we are going to offer a perfecting amendment, because at \nthis point what happens is, we put in there a 3-hour rule. That is the \nmaximum time on the runway, with certain exceptions: safety, weather, \nother things. But we say: If an airline does not agree to a 3-hour \nrule, 3 hours of people trapped in the aircraft on a runway, that they \nhave to submit an alternative to the FAA; but we do not require that \nthe FAA sign off on it.\n  So we may want to strengthen that. I would alert colleagues. I hope \nthey support us. I know I have no time remaining. I hope we will give \nthis a strong ``yea'' vote.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The time is now 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 383, H.R. 2881, the FAA \n     reauthorization bill.\n         Harry Reid, Daniel K.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes, to be followed for 10 minutes by Senator Klobuchar, as in \nmorning business and for it to count postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          America's Workforce\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, America's workforce is facing immense \nchallenges. Our country has lost 230,000 jobs in the first 3 months of \n2008. Many of those jobs are in the Presiding Officer's State of \nMichigan and my State of Ohio. The national unemployment rate has gone \nto 5.1 percent. In Ohio, unemployment hovers around 6 percent. Early \nthis year, Congress passed an economic stimulus package--a necessary \nstep but only a small step and a first step.\n  Wall Street projects an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent by the end \nof 2009. It will likely be higher in my State. We have not acted on \nextending unemployment insurance. The Republicans filibustered \nextending unemployment insurance when we passed the stimulus package \nearlier this year. The Republicans again have stopped our efforts and \nhave refused to extend unemployment benefits.\n  Over 2.6 million Americans--35 percent of all unemployed workers--\nhave already exhausted their unemployment benefits over the past 12 \nmonths. These are people who want to work, who have tried to find other \njobs, who simply have been unsuccessful in finding decent jobs.\n  Workers have paid into the unemployment system for years and deserve \nprotection now. Again, these are workers who have paid into this fund. \nThis is an insurance fund. It is not a welfare fund. These workers \ndeserve the compensation to help during their difficult times as they \nsearch for jobs. I urge my colleagues to end their filibuster and to \nwork on extending unemployment insurance.\n  The President continues to push for a Colombia trade deal. We have \nnot even acted on trade adjustment assistance which provides vital \nassistance to workers who lose their jobs because of trade. The \nPresident has actually threatened to veto the House trade adjustment \nassistance package.\n  Whether we have another trade deal, one thing is certain. Trade \nassistance needs to be reformed, and it needs to be expanded to workers \nwho cannot, in every case, prove they lost their jobs because of trade, \neven though they probably did. It should be expanded to service workers \nwho have lost their jobs.\n  Last week, Senate Republicans staged a filibuster to prevent even \nhaving a debate on giving a woman a day in court when she faces \ndiscrimination in the workplace. Today, women and victims of \ndiscrimination, based on race or age or disability or religion, are \ndenied a remedy when they are denied equal pay for equal work. It \nshould not be a partisan issue, but the Republicans have made it one.\n  Today is Workers Memorial Day--a day set aside every year to honor \nworkers killed and hurt on the job. Trade unionists around the world \nmark April 28 as an International Day of Mourning.\n  The most recent data shows that in the United States, there were \n5,840 fatal workplace injuries in 2006. Over 5,800 Americans were \nkilled on the job in 2006, over 100 more than in 2005. This includes \n196 workers in my State of Ohio.\n  Under this administration, workplace inspections have declined. The \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration has not vigorously \nenforced current laws and regulations on the books. It has not set any \nstandards except by court order. It continues to rely on ``voluntary'' \ncompliance to protect workers in many of the most dangerous \noccupations.\n  OSHA has dragged its feet on the butter flavoring chemical in popcorn \nthat has caused a fatal lung disease known as popcorn lung disease.\n  That is too late for Keith Campbell in Caledonia, OH, who is 50 years \nold but has the lungs of an 80-year-old because of exposure to the \nchemical at the popcorn plant in Marion, OH.\n  The point is, it has taken decades of struggle by workers and unions \nto improve conditions in the mines, in the meatpacking plants, and in \nthe metal stamping shops--in all kinds of plants where workers get all \nkinds of occupational injuries and illnesses.\n  This progress has been slowly, and sometimes not so slowly, unraveled \nby the Bush administration.\n  Through budget cuts and a shift in emphasis to voluntary employer \nprograms, the administration is essentially telling workers they are on \ntheir own. It hearkens back to an era when workers were treated like \ndisposable goods.\n  In election years, some candidates give drive-by speeches in towns \nthat are hit hard by unfair trade deals and tell them the ownership \nsociety is working. In some sense, it is true. More and more, workers \n``own'' responsibility for their own safety, their own retirement, and \ntheir own health care.\n  We hear some candidates sometimes talk about how if only taxes on the \nwealthiest Americans were lower, companies would not outsource \nproduction to China or Mexico or to any other country. I don't think \nthat argument is passing the straight-face test these days.\n  Middle-class families aren't buying it because they see perfectly \nwell what is happening around them. The message of the ownership \nsociety coming from the White House is that every man and woman is \nresponsible for himself or herself. But the result of the policies \npursued under that banner of the ownership society is the greatest \nconcentration of ownership in the hands of a few that we have seen \nsince the Great Depression. It is ownership all right but only for \nthose in high society.\n  Over the past 8 years, we have seen an administration that neither \nvalues nor rewards hard work. We have seen an administration that \nsimply doesn't value manufacturing. Manufacturing changed the face of \nAmerica and created a middle class that used its strength and power to \nchange the course of society.\n  The progress in labor rights, women's suffrage, antitrust laws, \nconservation, and the social safety net would not have happened without \nmanufacturing and would not have happened without rewarding our work.\n  When the Bush administration fails to value these manufacturing jobs \nin the first place, why should we not be surprised when it doesn't \nvalue safety in industries such as construction, mining, \ntransportation, and manufacturing?\n  Our Nation is struggling. We struggle because of the Federal \nGovernment's wrongheaded tax policy, and because our trade policy all \ntoo often encourages investors to move jobs overseas.\n  In the last 14 months, I have traveled my State extensively and held \nroundtables with community leaders, workers, activists, teachers, \nfarmers, and veterans in almost 100 different places in 62 of Ohio's 88 \ncounties. It is clear to me that Ohio workers are fighting back to \nbuild a decent standard of living for themselves and for others to \nprovide opportunities for their children and to construct a more \nprosperous State, one where smart and hard work is rewarded.\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\n  I listened to a woman, Dee Dee, who sat in negotiations representing \n1,200 janitors in Cincinnati--1,200 men and women who work hard, raise \ntheir children, and who contribute to their community; and in this case \nthey are not earning much more than the minimum wage.\n  Joined by several others at the bargaining table, Dee Dee helped \nreach an agreement with Cincinnati's office building owners. Over the \nnext 3 years, 1,200 janitors will get between a $2- and $3-an-hour \nraise, health benefits, and they will get a small pension.\n  In northwest Ohio, in the farmland of Henry County, Mark Schwiebert, \na very productive farmer in an increasingly competitive environment, \ntold me his story. He is proud of his farm, to be sure, but he also \ntakes his role seriously as an American citizen. He is an advocate for \nfamily farmers and for fair trade, understanding that the prosperity of \nOhio depends on a vibrant rural Ohio where young people want to stay \nand work in their communities.\n  Ohioans and workers across the country are fighting back. They did \nnot go away after this Chamber voted down the Fair Pay Act, again a \nvictim of Republican filibuster. They did not go away last year when \nRepublicans mounted yet another filibuster to prevent the Senate from \nconsidering legislation to level the playing field for unions trying to \nrepresent new groups of workers. They would not go away just because \nthis administration has ignored worker safety and is forcing more \nfamilies to mourn loved ones on Workers Memorial Day.\n  We need an ownership society, but it needs to be one in which workers \nown a greater share of the profits from their productivity, and the \nGovernment and employers own a greater share of responsibility for \ntheir safety and their well-being.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, Spring is finally arriving in \nMinnesota, even though we had snow last week. Spring does get to our \nState a little later than in Washington. This is the time of year when \npeople start thinking about putting their boats in the water and start \nthinking about making a trip to their cabins. We call it the lake \nseason. It is also the time of year when farmers are preparing to put \ntheir crops in the ground.\n  But this year is going to be different. The average price of gas just \nhit $3.45 a gallon in Minnesota, and it is $3.56 per gallon nationally. \nThe price of diesel fuel is at $4.14 per gallon nationally. Of course, \nthe price of crude oil is at an unbelievable $118 per barrel.\n  People cannot afford to do the things they used to do. I don't think \npeople usually think of going up to a small lake cabin as a luxury, but \nit becomes one when gas is this expensive.\n  I have heard from constituents who are having to cancel their family \nroad trips or their summer vacations up north because they cannot \nafford the gas they need to get there. I have heard from farmers who \nare having a hard time making ends meet, even in spite of the high \ncommodity prices, because the cost of their inputs--diesel fuel for \nfarm equipment and fertilizer made from natural gas--has spiraled out \nof control. Of course, it is particularly hard on middle-class and low-\nincome families because when they have less disposable income and gas \ngoes up to these levels, it is very difficult for them to get by.\n  The high price of energy has inflated the price of everything from \ngroceries to transportation to home heating, as the occupant of the \nchair knows, as he is from Vermont. It has impacted every sector of our \neconomy, from manufacturing, to forestry, to farms and small \nbusinesses.\n  In cold northern States such as Minnesota, Spring is when a lot of \npeople--especially senior citizens living on their own--are trying to \npay off their natural gas bill from the winter. They are too afraid to \nthink about how they are going to pay their heating bills next winter, \nif this trend continues.\n  Middle-class families are struggling with the high cost of health \ncare and a college education already, and they cannot afford this \nincrease in the price of gas. I just heard an expert a few weeks ago \ntalk about, if you look at the past 8 to 10 years, a regular, average \nmiddle-class family--their costs for everything from daycare, to home \nheating, to gas has gone up about $8,000 to $10,000 a year. But their \nwages have not gone up. They don't have a choice, Mr. President, about \nhow they are going to get to work. In my State, many don't have a \nchoice. They have to drive. They have to get to work, get to school, \nand they have to get to the doctor. Any wage increase they may have \ngotten last year goes straight into their gas tanks. And more often \nthan not, there haven't even been any wage increases.\n  Not a day goes by when I don't hear about the struggle from my \nconstituents in Minnesota. So it is hard for me to understand how \nrecently the President seems taken aback when someone asked him about \n$4 gas. The President said--remember, this was February 28. The \nPresident said:\n\n       You're predicting $4 a gallon gasoline? That's interesting. \n     I hadn't heard that.\n\n  To the people in my State, $4 a gallon for gas isn't ``interesting.'' \nIt is a budget-buster for many middle-class families in our State.\n  The fact is, this administration has failed to provide Americans with \na meaningful energy policy that would provide relief from high gas and \nenergy prices.\n  This country needs a bold energy policy for the future, a policy that \nwill stabilize prices and give consumers more alternatives, reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, and provide us with the next generation of \nhome-grown biofuels.\n  Brazil has already achieved this energy security. They have \nleapfrogged in front of our country. They can do it with sugarcane. We \ndon't have that much sugarcane here, and we have to go to the next \ngeneration of biofuels, cellulosic, switch grass--many different \nthings. But we have to put the reserve and incentives into place. We \ncan do this, but we need the will, and we need to pursue a forward-\nlooking energy policy with the same sense of urgency we used to put a \nman on the Moon nearly 40 years ago.\n  In the long term, this is going to mean strategic investments in \nresearch on hybrid electric cars, new solar technology, cellulosic \nethanol, and other forms of energy from biomass.\n  We should be investing not in the oil cartels of the Middle East but \nin the farmers and workers of the Midwest. We need better fuel \nefficiency standards in our cars. We already have a start on that with \nthe Energy bill and the 10-mile-per-gallon increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards. We need to do more. We also need a renewable energy \nelectricity standard, a portfolio standard for the Nation, like we have \nin Minnesota where the requirement is 25 percent of our electricity \nwill come from renewables by 2025. It has spurred investment in wind. \nWe are third in the country in wind now because we have been willing to \ntake that step.\n  There is also much that we need to do in the short term, Mr. \nPresident. We can put a stop to oil company giveaways by ending the \ngiveaways and tax breaks going to the oil companies and putting them \ninto a futuristic energy policy focused on renewables. We tried to do \nthat in the Energy bill, and we were one vote short of blocking the \nfilibuster. I still believe we can do it.\n  We also have to look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We can stop \ndiverting 50,000 barrels of oil every day into that Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. Of course, we need to have a petroleum reserve to protect our \ncountry in times of emergency. But the time to fill it is not when oil \nprices are at record highs.\n  Here is what the staff at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had to say \non the subject 6 years ago, in 2002:\n\n       Commercial inventories are low, retail prices are high, and \n     economic growth is slow. The Government should avoid \n     acquiring oil for the reserve under these circumstances.\n\n  If this was true in 2002, it is doubly true today. Maybe I should say \nit is triply true because gas prices are more than triple what they \nwere then. That is why I was proud to join with my colleague, Senator \nDorgan of North Dakota, and others in sending a letter to the President \nasking him to halt inputs into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nprovide some relief for consumers.\n  Next, OPEC. Another area where we can take immediate action is in our \ndealings with the OPEC nations. OPEC\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\nis a cartel of oil-producing countries that meets and decides how much \noil to produce and thereby control prices. They make no pretense of \nhaving a free market system. They don't obey the laws of supply and \ndemand. They gather together and set production, which determines \nprices.\n  As a former prosecutor, I call that kind of behavior ``collusion.'' \nIt is illegal in our country. But the members of OPEC are foreign \ngovernments and so far they have gotten away with it.\n  As oil exporting nations, the members of OPEC could provide us with \nsome relief. They have the spare capacity to increase production of oil \nand ease the pain being felt by American consumers and businesses. But \nOPEC recently met, as you know, and decided not to increase production, \nat least until the fall, after the summer driving season.\n  Not only that, Saudi Arabia has actually decreased production since \n2005. So I have joined with my colleagues, Senators Schumer, Dorgan, \nand you, Mr. President, in calling on the President to demand that OPEC \nnations increase their oil production to provide American consumers and \nbusinesses with much needed relief.\n  Think about it: This country spends $600,000 every minute on imported \noil. That is money leaving the pockets of American drivers going into \nthe coffers of foreign countries. By refusing to step up production, \nOPEC nations are saying we don't think prices are too high yet; we want \nthem to go even higher.\n  I don't think that is right. It is time this administration stepped \nup and did something about it. If we are going to be doing business \nwith Saudi Arabia and some of these countries, this administration \nshould have the leverage to push for more oil from OPEC.\n  Another short-term solution: Current prices are simply not justified \nby supply and demand. The administration likes to tell us nothing can \nbe done, that it is a case of supply and demand. But that answer does \nnot hold true any longer. Listen to what the oil company executives \nthemselves have to say about this matter.\n  On October 30, 2007, the CEO of Marathon Oil said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  That is exactly what he said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     market.\n\n  Let's look at what another CEO said. Here we have the CEO of Royal \nDutch Shell. The CEO of Royal Dutch Shell said:\n\n       The oil fundamentals are no problem. They are the same as \n     they were when oil was selling for $60 a barrel.\n\n  On April 1, a senior vice president of ExxonMobil testified before \nthe House that the price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel. \nHe said:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel.\n\n  That was April 1, 2008. I note that is April Fool's Day, but he did \nsay the price of oil should be about $50 to $55 per barrel. Why is it \ntrading at $118? If supply and demand doesn't explain the high price, \nwhat does?\n  According to the experts, there is a frenzy of unregulated market \nspeculation in the oil futures market that is driving prices up to \nrecord highs. I would like to share a quote from an energy market \nanalyst with Oppenheimer who was recently named by Bloomberg as the \ntop-ranked energy analyst in the country. He said:\n\n       I'm absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a \n     dime above $55 a barrel . . . Oil speculators include the \n     largest financial institutions in the world. I call it the \n     world's largest gambling hall . . . It's open 24/7 . . . It's \n     totally unregulated. . . . This is like a highway with no \n     cops and no speed limit, and everybody's going 120 miles per \n     hour.\n\n  That makes you feel good. It makes the people filling up their gas \ntanks paying that nearly 4 bucks a gallon feel good, like a gambling \nhall.\n  Why are these trades in a commodity as vital as oil unregulated? Back \nin 2000, a provision was inserted into the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act that exempted electronic energy trades from Federal \nregulation. In the absence of oversight, what was once a small niche \nmarket became a booming industry, attracting rampant speculation from \nhedge funds and investment banks. Oil and natural gas prices became \nvolatile. The provision has become known as the Enron loophole because \nit made possible the many abuses that triggered the Western energy \ncrisis and cost the economy $35 billion and nearly 600,000 jobs.\n  The Federal Government has a critical role to play in conducting \naggressive oversight of changing energy markets. History has shown us \nthat when enforcement is lax, consumers ultimately pay the price.\n  Simply put, we need to close the Enron loophole and strengthen \nFederal oversight of energy trading. I am pleased to say my colleagues, \nSenators Feinstein and Levin, have succeeded in including this \nprovision in the farm bill. It is another reason we need to get the \nfarm bill done.\n  I commend my colleagues, Representative Collin Peterson, from \nMinnesota, and Senator Harkin and Senator Conrad for getting this \nprovision done.\n  A final short-term solution. After the collapse of Enron, the \nPresident formed a Corporate Fraud Task Force at the Department of \nJustice. The task force has since produced more than 1,000 convictions \nby aggressively pursuing corporate fraud under existing law. What this \nshows us is good laws in and of themselves are not enough. We need \nenforcement. We need a cop on the beat. Any prosecutor can tell you \nthat. That is why I joined my colleague, Senator Cantwell, in calling \non the President to establish a new division of the Corporate Fraud \nTask Force specifically to apply to energy markets. This new Oil and \nGas Market Fraud Task Force would allow us to focus combined efforts of \nthe Department of Justice, FTC, SEC, and the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission.\n  In conclusion, the cost of energy is hurting Americans from all walks \nof life and businesses. I don't think we need one silver bullet. As we \nsay in my State, we need a silver buckshot. We need a bold energy \npolicy, first of all, in the short term, that focuses on temporarily \nsuspending deliveries of oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, that \npressures OPEC nations to increase oil production, that closes the \nEnron loophole to eliminate that speculation, and to establish the DOJ \nOil and Gas Market Fraud Task Force.\n  Then we need for the long term--Mr. President, you know this well we \nneed to increase vehicle fuel efficiency, make a national commitment to \ngenerate electricity from renewables and invest in research in cutting-\nedge technologies for alternative fuel vehicles and renewable energy \nsources. This is what we need to do.\n  The time is now for Congress to take strong steps toward creating \nthat bold energy policy. Americans are depending on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Klobuchar for her \ncomments. I agree with so much of what she had to say. When you go out \nand talk to real people and see the impact on their lives of these huge \nprices, you begin to analyze where we are.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he will withhold. \nI think the plan is that I am to end the session and he is to speak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That sounds fine to me. I did not hear that. I yield \nthe floor, before I complete bragging on the Senator's comments.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the \nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV. In 1957, UNLV was born as an \nextension of the University of Nevada, Reno, to accommodate the rapidly \ngrowing population of Las Vegas.\n  The first classes were held in the dressing rooms of Las Vegas High\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\nSchool's auditorium. There were only 28 students. When the Nevada Board \nof Regents founded the Southern Nevada Division of the University of \nNevada, students led the charge to become their own independent \ninstitution. They adopted the Rebel as their mascot to signify their \ndesire to break free of the Reno campus. With pressure from students \nand the Las Vegas community, an 80-acre parcel along a two-lane dirt \nroad was selected as the location for the campus. On September 10, \n1957, the first classes were held on the new campus. And in 1968, UNLV \nbegan its journey as an independent institution.\n  Over the past 50 years, Las Vegas has grown and become the \nentertainment capital of the world, and just like the city that it \ncalls home, UNLV, too, has had its fair share of celebrity. In 1964 \nElvis Presley and Ann-Margret danced in the gym in the famous scene \nfrom the film ``Viva Las Vegas''. Frank Sinatra and Wayne Newton served \non the UNLV Foundation's board in the 1980s and Anthony Zuiker, the \ncreator and producer of the hit show ``CSI'', is an alumni.\n  Today, UNLV is a thriving urban research institution with more than \n28,000 students and more than 220 undergraduate, master's, and doctoral \ndegree programs. The campus--now 350 acres--boasts over 100 buildings \nwith state-of-the-art technology and research facilities. Two of the \nmost recent additions have been a new student union and a student \nrecreation and wellness facility all paid for by the students. In 1998, \nUNLV opened the Boyd School of Law, which quickly gained accreditation \nfrom the American Bar Association and is now nationally ranked for its \nquality legal education. This year, UNLV also welcomed its eighth \npresident, David Ashley.\n  Many outside of Nevada know of UNLV for its athletic teams. The \nRebels participate in 17 intercollegiate sports. In 1990, the Runnin' \nRebels won the NCAA Men's Division I tournament, beating Duke 103 to \n73, the largest margin of victory ever in the championship game. While \nthe Runnin' Rebels have continued to be a perennial player in the NCAA \ntournament, in recent years, UNLV athletics have also achieved success \nin golf, swimming and diving, boxing, track and field, and soccer.\n  In its first 50 years, UNLV has grown from a satellite outpost of \nhigher learning to a major player in the fields of gaming and hotel \nmanagement, environmental and experimental science, engineering, \nEnglish, and law. UNLV has blossomed with the city around it, and as \nUNLV enters its next 50 years, I am confident that it will continue to \nprosper and strengthen the city it calls home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD M. SMITH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend \nEdward M. Smith, a man for whom I have great respect and admiration.\n  Ed has been involved in the labor movement in Illinois for more than \n40 years. He is deeply committed to the working families of America.\n  As a leader in the Laborers' International Union, Ed has worked to \nensure workers earn a living wage, good benefits and the opportunity to \nadvance and better their lives.\n  He is stepping down as Midwest Regional Manager of the Laborers' \nInternational Union of North America, Vice President of Laborers' \nInternational and Assistant to the General President, to become \nPresident of the Union Labor Life Insurance Company, labor's own \ninsurance and financial services company.\n  For those who may not be familiar with the Laborers, they are the men \nand women who do the hard, dangerous work of building our country.\n  Ed literally grew up in the labor movement. He was only 13 when he \njoined Laborers' Local 773 in Cairo, IL. He worked his way through \nschool as a construction craft laborer.\n  He was elected business manager of his local union in 1976 at the \nyoung age of 21. A decade later, he was elected president of the \nSouthern Illinois Laborers' District Council.\n  In 1994, Ed was elected Midwest Regional Manager of the Laborers' \nInternational, leading more than 50,000 union members. Two years later, \nhe was elected Vice President of the Laborers' International Union and \nbecame Assistant to the General President of the Union.\n  Laborers' International Union is one of the fastest-growing unions of \nconstruction workers and Ed oversaw over 30 successful organizing \ncampaigns, mainly in the public sector.\n  Ed was the first member of the Laborers' International Union to \ngraduate from the National Labor College with a bachelors degree. Ed \nalso graduated from the Harvard University Trade program and from \nShawnee College. In 1992, he received Shawnee College's first \noutstanding alumni award.\n  As Ed fought for Illinois' working families, he raised his own family \nwith his wife Betty. He has two children, daughter Jordan and son Matt.\n  Ed also devotes a great deal of his life to charitable organizations. \nHe has been a major benefactor to the Therapy Center in Carterville, \nIL, an organization that assists physically disabled children. He also \nserves as a board member of the I Can Read Program, for children with \nreading and learning disabilities.\n  In addition to his many union roles, Ed is well respected for his \nleadership with the Illinois State Board of Investment, the Illinois \nDepartment of Labor Advisory Board, and the National Alliance for Fair \nContracting.\n  Ed Smith is a big man with a big heart. It says something about him \nthat he has risen to such prominence in the American labor movement \nwithout ever leaving his hometown of Cairo, IL and without ever losing \ntouch with his Midwestern roots and values. While he has remained in \nsouthern Illinois, the effects of his work can be seen and felt \nthroughout our Nation.\n  As my friend Ed Smith begins the next chapter in his life, I want to \ncongratulate him on his retirement from Laborers' International Union \nand thank him for over 40 years of dedication to working men and women. \nI wish him the best in his new role as president of Union Labor Life \nInsurance Company as he continues to protect the working families of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3434-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3434-S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMARKS OF RUPERT MURDOCK\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last Monday evening I had the honor of \nattending a dinner of the Atlantic Council. At that dinner several \ndistinguished individuals were honored: former British Prime Minister \nTony Blair, News Corporation chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch, and \nAdmiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for \nDistinguished International, Business and Military Leadership \nrespectively.\n  During the evening, there was much discussion about the health of the \ntransatlantic relationship. I was impressed with Rupert Murdock's \ncomments as to how the alliance must change to meet future threats. He \nwent on to say ``We must face up to a painful truth: Europe no longer \nhas either the political will or social culture to support military \nengagements in defense of itself and its allies. However strong NATO \nmay be on paper, this fact makes NATO weak in practice. And it means \nthat reform will not come from within.\n  Those who want a reformed NATO must look to the outside. In other \nwords, we need to transform this Alliance from a community formed \naround a map to a community based on common values and a willingness to \ntake joint action in defense of these values.\n  Those who want a reformed NATO must look to the outside. In other \nwords, we need to transform this Alliance from a community formed \naround a map to a community based on common values and a willingness to \ntake joint action in defense of these values.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Mr. Murdock's entire remarks printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n\n Mr. Rupert Murdoch's Prepared Remarks for the Atlantic Council's 2008 \n                          Annual Awards Dinner\n\n       Good evening. Thank you, Henry, for that kind introduction. \n     Your words remind me of the definition of a diplomat: A man \n     who always remembers his wife's birthday--but never remembers \n     her age.\n       I also want to thank the Atlantic Council for this fine \n     award. By honoring me, you honor the work that News \n     Corporation's 61,000 employees are doing to connect people \n     across oceans, borders, and cultures. And you underscore the \n     importance of a strong private sector for a free society.\n       Few organizations have done more for the preservation of \n     our freedom than this Council. Tonight I want to commend Fred \n     Kempe\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\n     . . . General Jim Jones . . . the Council Board . . . and all \n     the Council members for the important work you are doing. \n     This Council was founded in the years following World War II. \n     Statesmen on both sides of the Atlantic recognized that the \n     defense of freedom would require the active engagement of a \n     new generation of leaders. By working to keep that Alliance \n     strong, you have helped the West prevail against Soviet \n     communism--and ensure the advance of democracy from the \n     Atlantic to the Urals.\n       Today we can be tempted to bask in our achievements--and \n     wax nostalgic about all we have been through.\n       But this is no time for nostalgia. At this moment in our \n     history, the Alliance that has been built up over decades now \n     finds itself threatened on several fronts:\n       First, by the growing appeal of protectionism on both sides \n     of the Atlantic . . .\n       Second, by the terrorists who target civilians in all our \n     countries . . . and finally, by the crisis of confidence in a \n     Europe that is losing its faith in the values and \n     institutions that have kept us free.\n       We see this crisis of confidence in many areas. Yet nowhere \n     is it more apparent than in the failure of nerve we are \n     seeing in Afghanistan. After the attacks of September the \n     11th, 2001, it was clear that America and its allies needed \n     to deprive al Qaeda of its safe haven. It was clear that we \n     needed to help the Afghan people replace the Taliban with a \n     free government that would build a more hopeful future for \n     its citizens.\n       Unfortunately, far from reflecting our unity, Nato's entry \n     into Afghanistan has exposed its divisions. Instead of \n     standing together as full and equal partners, a handful of \n     Alliance members are bearing the brunt of the fighting. \n     Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said that the lack of \n     equal burden sharing threatens the future of the Alliance. \n     And he is right.\n       We must face up to a painful truth: Europe no longer has \n     either the political will or social culture to support \n     military engagements in defense of itself and its allies. \n     However strong NATO may be on paper, this fact makes NATO \n     weak in practice. And it means that reform will not come from \n     within.\n       Those who want a reformed NATO must look to the outside. In \n     other words, we need to transform this Alliance from a \n     community formed around a map to a community based on common \n     values and a willingness to take joint action in defense of \n     these values.\n       In short, a strong and successful Atlantic Alliance will \n     have to ground itself more on shared principles rather than \n     accident of geography. And we need to show we are serious \n     about defending those principles by standing with those who \n     are standing up for them.\n       NATO's agreement to invite Albania and Croatia to become \n     members is a welcome start. So is the somewhat weaker \n     commitment that Ukraine and Georgia will become members of \n     NATO at some point in the future.\n       But we need to go much further. As a rule, when an \n     organization expands, the expansion dilutes its principles. \n     For today's NATO, it is just the opposite. Expansion is the \n     only hope of invigorating an Alliance weighed down by those \n     who are no longer willing to commit themselves to defend its \n     founding principles.\n       Around the world, there is no shortage of nations who share \n     our values, and are willing to defend them. I am thinking of \n     countries like Australia, which sent troops to Iraq . . . \n     Israel, which has been fighting Islamic terrorism almost \n     since its founding . . . and Japan, which generally follows a \n     more ``Western'' policy than most of Western Europe.\n       Other countries have not reached the level of development \n     these countries enjoy. But some are working hard to get \n     there, and would be strong partners down the road. At the \n     very least, the United States needs to support them as they \n     struggle against the dark forces trying to pull them down.\n       Right now the United States has a test in our own backyard. \n     Colombia is a nation that is fighting poverty, battling the \n     drug lords, and taking on terrorists backed by foreign \n     governments. Its citizens have suffered tremendously from \n     violence, and who want peace and opportunity. And it is being \n     led by a brave and innovative President, who is bringing the \n     rule of law to people who have not known it.\n       What does this brave President ask of us? He asks that we \n     ratify the trade agreement we have negotiated with his \n     nation.\n       By ratifying this agreement, we would open an important \n     market for American goods. We would demonstrate to millions \n     in our hemisphere that the path to prosperity lies in freedom \n     and democracy. And we would give strong moral support to a \n     leader struggling to bring hope and opportunity to his \n     people in an important part of the world.\n       Everyone knows this. Even the New York Times says the \n     Democratic Congress should ratify this trade deal. Instead, \n     Speaker Pelosi has effectively put off the bill by not \n     scheduling a vote. We need to make clear to the leadership in \n     Congress needs to know what killing this trade deal would \n     mean.\n       Throughout Colombia, a defeat for the trade deal would be \n     confirmation that the United States is not an ally you could \n     count on.\n       Throughout Latin America, a defeat for the trade deal would \n     be exploited by thugs like Hugo Chavez, who would tell the \n     people, ``See, the Americans will never accept you as equals \n     and partners.''\n       And throughout the world, a defeat for the trade deal would \n     be taken as another sign that the U.S. will not stand by its \n     friends when the going gets tough.\n       The Mexican ambassador to the United States puts it this \n     way: ``The most important geopolitical mistake the United \n     States could do today . . . is not ratifying that treaty.''\n       The world is watching. The same values that we are trying \n     to uphold in the Atlantic Alliance are at stake now in \n     Colombia. And if we fail to support them in Colombia, it will \n     be harder to revive them in the Alliance.\n       Let me conclude with a little story. I was born in \n     Australia . . . I received my university education in Britain \n     . . . and I have made my home in America. Over a long and I \n     hope productive life, I have learned that shared values are \n     more important than shared borders.\n       If we continue to define ``the West'' or ``the Alliance'' \n     as a strictly geographical concept, the Alliance will \n     continue to erode. But if we define the West as a community \n     of values, institutions, and a willingness to act jointly, we \n     will revive an important bastion of freedom--and make it as \n     pivotal in our own century as it was in the last.\n       Thank you for having me. And thank you again for this fine \n     award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3435-S3437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that S. 1315, as reported by \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, the proposed Veterans Benefits \nEnhancement Act of 2007, finally passed in the Senate. This \ncomprehensive legislation would improve benefits and services for \nveterans both young and old.\n  The Veterans' Affairs Committee reported S. 1315 to the full Senate \nin August of last year. At that time, my belief was that debate and \nconsideration of this legislation by the full Senate, would take place \nduring September. That did not happen. As I described in detail \nyesterday, further action on the bill has been blocked because of \nopposition from the other side of the aisle to certain benefits for \nFilipinos who fought under U.S. command during World War II.\n  I will first describe some of the provisions in the bill and then \nwill discuss in more detail my views on the provisions relating to \nFilipino veterans.\n  This legislation, as reported by the committee, would make several \nimportant improvements in insurance programs for disabled veterans. It \nwould establish a new program of insurance for service-connected \ndisabled veterans that would provide up to a maximum of $50,000 in \nlevel premium term life insurance coverage.\n  This legislation would also expand eligibility for retroactive \nbenefits from traumatic injury protection coverage under the \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance program. This insurance program \nwent into effect on December 1, 2005. All insured servicemembers under \nSGLI from that point forward are covered by traumatic injury protection \nregardless of where their injuries occur. However, individuals \nsustaining traumatic injuries between October 7, 2001 and November 30, \n2005, that were not incurred as a direct result of Operations Enduring \nor Iraqi Freedom, are not eligible for a retroactive payment under the \ntraumatic injury protection program. This legislation would expand \neligibility to these individuals.\n  This legislation would also increase the maximum amount of Veterans' \nMortgage Life Insurance so that a service-connected disabled veteran \nmay purchase from the current maximum of $90,000 to $200,000. In the \nevent of the veteran's death, the veteran's family is protected because \nVA will pay the balance of the mortgage owed up to the maximum amount \nof insurance purchased. The need for this increase is obvious in \ntoday's housing market.\n  In addition, S. 1315, as reported, would also increase the amount of \nsupplemental life insurance available to totally disabled veterans from \n$20,000 to $30,000. Many totally disabled veterans find it difficult to \nobtain commercial life insurance. These are the veterans we are trying \nto help with this legislation by providing them with a reasonable \namount of life insurance coverage.\n  S. 1315, as reported, would also make small but necessary changes in \nexisting laws relating to education and employment. First, it would \nrestore the funding cap on the amount of support available to State \nApproving Agencies to the fiscal year 2007 level of $19 million. \nWithout this restoration, these entities that assist VA in approving \nprograms of education would be facing a reduction of more than 30 \npercent beginning in this fiscal year. It is particularly\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\nimportant as more veterans return to civilian life and begin to use \ntheir educational benefits that SAAs have adequate resources.\n\n  Second, the pending legislation would update the Special Unemployment \nStudy required to be submitted by the Secretary of Labor to the \nCongress by mandating that it cover veterans of post-9/11 global \noperations. It would also require the report to be submitted on an \nannual, rather than a biennial, basis. By updating this report, \nCongress will have more data available on more recent groups of \nveterans--those who served and are serving in the gulf war and post-9/\n11 global operations. This will help with assessments of the needs of \ncurrent veterans entering the work force and develop appropriate \nresponses.\n  Third, the bill would extend for 2 years a temporary increase in the \nmonthly educational assistance allowance for apprenticeship or other \non-the-job training. The current temporary increase expired on January \n1, 2008, and this provision would benefit the 34,000 veterans who are \nsuffering through the first benefit rate reduction in the history of \nthe G.I. bill. Allowing the temporary increase to be eliminated would \nmean a monthly benefit rate cut for veterans enrolled in this type of \ntraining and would remove marketable incentive to encourage individuals \nto accept trainee positions they might not otherwise consider.\n  S. 1315, as reported, would also improve a variety of housing \nbenefits for servicemembers and veterans. I note that title II of this \nlegislation was recently passed as part of H.R. 3221, the housing \nreform bill. It is my intent to include these provisions in S. 1315 \nuntil they have become law through another vehicle.\n  This legislation would also amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act \nto help servicemembers get relief from cell phone contracts when \ndeployed overseas. Servicemembers, with all of their responsibilities \nabroad, should not have to worry about being released from cell phone \ncontracts.\n  Finally, this legislation gives Congress an opportunity to rectify a \nwrong done to Filipino World War II veterans over 60 years ago. In the \nyears since the end of the Second World War, Filipino veterans and \ntheir advocates, especially my distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, have worked tirelessly to secure these veterans \nthe status they were promised when they agreed to fight under U.S. \ncommand in defense of their homeland and to protect U.S. interests in \nthe region. Today, I am proud to say, many Filipino veterans enjoy \neligibility for benefits and health care services as U.S. veterans. \nHowever, there remains a distinction in law between certain groups of \nFilipino veterans. I hope that Congress will take another step toward \nremoving that unjust distinction. This Nation has a moral obligation to \ncare for those who have served under its flag.\n  Although I view veterans' benefits as a continuing cost of war and \nshould be funded as such, the provisions in S. 1315 would be paid for \nby an offset that restores the original intent of Congress, which was \nwrongly interpreted in a recent court decision, to provide certain VA \nbenefits on the basis of disability and not age. Some of the opposition \nto S. 1315 has centered on a misunderstanding of this provision. Aged \nveterans who are seriously disabled would not be deprived of special \nbenefits, but would continue to be eligible for them under the same \nconditions as applied to younger veterans.\n  This is not a comprehensive recitation of all the provisions within \nthis important veterans' legislation. However, I hope that I have \nprovided an appropriate overview of the benefits this legislation would \nprovide for America's veterans and servicemembers.\n  The sole point of controversy in S. 1315 is a pension benefit for \nFilipino veterans who served under U.S. command during World War II and \nwho live in the Philippines. I wish to give my colleagues my \nperspective on why this benefit should be paid.\n  The United States has had a relationship with the Philippines since \n1898, when it was acquired as a result of the Spanish American War. In \n1934, Congress passed the Philippine Independence Act, which set a 10-\nyear timetable for the independence of the Philippines. In the interim, \nthe U.S. established a Commonwealth of the Philippines vested with \ncertain powers over its own internal affairs. The granting of full \nindependence was delayed until 1946 because of the Japanese occupation \nof the Philippines from 1942 to 1945.\n  On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an Executive \nOrder ordering all military forces of the Commonwealth of the \nPhilippines into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States \nunder the command of a newly created command structure called the \nUnited States Armed Forces of the Far East. According to orders from \nGeneral MacArthur, Philippine units once mustered into U.S. service \nwould be paid and supplied from American sources.\n  The unique relationship between the Philippines and the United States \nmade the Philippine islands particularly susceptible to Japanese \naggression during the war. Historians agree that the Japanese strategy \nwas based upon a plan to destroy or neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet \nat Pearl Harbor, and to deprive the United States of its base in the \nPhilippines. Were it not for the U.S. presence, the Philippines would \nnot have presented the Japanese with a strategic threat and turned into \na battlefield.\n  The Philippine forces under U.S. command suffered heavy casualties as \na result of the Japanese invasion. It is estimated that 10,000 \nFilipinos died during the Bataan Death March, along with 3,000 U.S. \nsoldiers. The Philippines throughout the war suffered great loss of \nlife and tremendous physical damage. By the end of the war, the capital \ncity of Manila was in ruins and up to 1 million Filipinos had been \nkilled.\n  All of the military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines \nremained under the command of the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East \nthroughout World War II, and until the Philippines was granted \nindependence on July 4, 1946.\n  In October 1945, Gen. Omar Bradley, then Director of the Veterans' \nAdministration, affirmed that all Filipinos who served under U.S. \ncommand were entitled to all benefits under laws administered by that \nagency.\n  However, in 1946, the U.S. Congress, through the Rescission Acts of \n1946, withdrew veterans' status from certain Filipino veterans of World \nWar II.\n  Upon passage of the Rescission Acts, President Harry Truman expressed \nhis disapproval of the withdrawal of benefits from Filipino veterans. \nHe stated, ``There can be no question, but that the Philippine veteran \nis entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to those received \nby the American veteran, with whom he fought side by side.''\n  Our Nation has a long history of caring for aging veterans, \nparticularly those who served the country during a time of war.\n  The sole purpose of the VA pension program is to assist older, low-\nincome, war-time veterans, so that those who experienced the horror of \nwar are not forgotten in their old age.\n  Philippine veterans of the Second World War are now in their twilight \nyears and many are struggling to make ends meet, especially with global \nfood prices on the rise. Now, perhaps more than ever, the modest \npension benefits that are in S. 1315 are of the greatest value to \nveterans who earned them on the battlefield so many years ago.\n  The action by Congress in 1946 to strip Filipino veterans who served \nunder the American Flag during World War II of the recognition and \nbenefits that were their due was a grave injustice. It is especially \nregrettable that this injustice has existed for so many years. The \ninaction of prior Congresses to correct this wrong does not excuse us \nfrom the responsibility to take remedial action now.\n  The United States has a moral obligation to care for Filipino \nveterans who served under U.S. command in World War II and we must not \nfail in fulfilling that obligation.\n  I would like to speak briefly about the purpose of pension benefits \nand more specifically about the pension benefit in the pending bill. \nVeterans pension benefits are provided to allow wartime veterans to \nlive in dignity and meet their basic needs.\n  The amounts proposed in this legislation would permit Filipino \nveterans, who have been denied their rightful status as United States \nveterans for too long, to finally live in dignity.\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\n  Unlike other World War II veterans, these veterans have been denied \npension benefits for over 60 years. It is also important to note that \nthese benefits are not retroactive.\n  The amounts proposed are sufficient to give aged Filipino veterans a \npayment that would allow them to meet their basic needs for adequate \nnutrition and medicine.\n  The flat rate benefit also takes into account the likelihood that \nmany of these aged veterans, if living in the United States, would \nqualify for additional benefits based on disability due to their status \nas being housebound or in need of aid and attendance. No additional \nbenefits for housebound status or aid and attendance are provided.\n  The pension proposed for Filipino veterans is less than one-third of \nthe basic amount provided to veterans living in the United States, in \nrecognition of the lower cost of living in the Philippines. Measured \nagainst the aid and attendance standard, the proposed benefit is about \none-sixth of the amount provided to veterans in the United States.\n  The cost of items, such as food and medicine in Manila are about half \nof the cost in the United States, while the cost of housing is \nconsiderably less expensive.\n  For example, a bottle of 100 aspirin tablets costs about $4 in \nManila, about twice as much in the United States.\n  Because the income and asset verification procedures used in the \nUnited States are not available in the Philippines, and it is not \nfeasible to develop an administratively efficient system in the \nPhilippines to monitor the income and assets of pension recipients, the \nbill provides a flat benefit amount substantially lower than that paid \nin the United States.\n  I believe firmly that the proposed amount is a reasonable benefit \ntaking into account all of these factors.\n  The people of the Philippines did not shy from the call to fight \nduring World War II. They were true brothers in arms who fought \nvaliantly under U.S. command in the global struggle against \ntotalitarianism. This bill at long last recognizes the valor of all \nFilipino veterans in sacrifice to this noble cause and loyalty to their \nAmerican commanders.\n  The proposal put forward by the ranking member fails to honor these \nveterans by denying pension benefits to those who live in the \nPhilippines. I understand that there may be different perspectives on \nwhat pension amounts would be appropriate given the difference in the \ncost-of-living between this country and the Philippines. I am not, \nhowever, willing to yield on the principle that Filipino veterans \nliving in the Philippines deserve to receive veterans benefits in the \nsame manner as those living in the U.S. or anywhere else. I reject the \nnotion that two veterans, who fought side-by-side and endured the same \nhardships of war, should be treated unequally based solely on their \nplace of residence.\n  The soldier's creed is to leave no fellow warrior behind. I believe \nin that, and believe that it is important to acknowledge the valiant \nservice of those Filipino veterans of World War II who served under \nU.S. command.\n  I would like to end my comments tonight by again sharing the thoughts \nof the 33rd President of the United States--Harry S. Truman. In 1946, \nPresident Truman made a statement concerning provisions in a bill \naffecting Philippine Army veterans--At issue was a legislative rider \nattached to the transfer of $200 million for the pay of the Army of the \nPhilippines.\n  President Truman said, ``The effect of this rider is to bar \nPhilippine Army veterans from all the benefits under the G.I. Bill of \nRights with the exception of disability and death benefits which are \nmade payable on the basis of one peso for every dollar of eligible \nbenefits. I realize, however, that certain practical difficulties exist \nin applying the G.I. Bill of Rights to the Philippines.''\n  President Truman went on to state, ``the passage and approval of this \nlegislation does not release the United States from its moral \nobligation to provide for the heroic Philippine veterans who sacrificed \nso much for the common cause during the war . . . I consider it a moral \nobligation of the United States to look after the welfare of the \nPhilippine Army veterans.''\n  I agree with the words of President Truman from 60 years ago.\n  As I have said time and time again, this legislation would correct an \ninjustice that has existed for over 60 years. I, like President Truman, \nbelieve that it is the obligation of the United States to care for \nthose who have fought under the U.S. flag.\n  It is past time to right that wrong. As my fellow World War II \nveteran, the Senior Senator from Alaska said yesterday, this is about \n``honor.'' I believe it is the moral obligation of this Nation to \nprovide for those who served under the U.S. flag and alongside U.S. \ntroops during World War II.\n  I thank my colleagues for standing with me, my World War II \ncolleagues Senators Inouye and Stevens, and a majority of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, and not accepting the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3437-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3437-S3438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SHAWN BENTLEY ORPHAN WORKS ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for The \nShawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008, S. 2913, introduced at the \nclose of last week by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy \nand myself. This piece of legislation is a product of years of hard \nwork and collaboration.\n  I want to start off by thanking Chairman Leahy for his willingness to \nname this bill in honor of my long-time staffer and former colleague, \nShawn Bentley, whose untimely death, at 41, greatly saddened many in \nthis body.\n  Shawn worked for the Judiciary Committee for a decade, from 1993-\n2003. Starting as my counsel, he rose through the ranks, ending his \nSenate tenure as the majority's Chief Intellectual Property Counsel and \nDeputy Chief Counsel to the committee. He worked on many important \npieces of landmark intellectual property legislation, and he initiated \nwhat we have now introduced as an orphan works bill.\n  Thousands of artistic creations around the country are effectively \nlocked away in a proverbial attic and unavailable for the general \npublic to enjoy because the owner of the copyright for the work is \nunknown. These are generally referred to as ``orphan works.'' It is not \nalways easy to identify an owner of a copyrighted work, and in many \ncases, information about the copyright holder is not publicly known. To \nmake matters worse, many are discouraged from using these so-called \n``orphan works'' for fear of being sued should the owner eventually \nstep forward.\n  In an effort make orphan works more accessible, Chairman Leahy and I \nhave been working together for years to craft meaningful legislation to \naddress concerns that have been identified through public discussions \non this issue. The Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on \nIntellectual Property held a hearing entitled ``Orphan Works: Proposals \nfor a Legislative Solution,'' at which representatives from the \nphotography, museum, documentary film, and technology communities \ntestified. And a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held two \nhearings in the 109th Congress and one in the 110th.\n  Under S. 2913, potential users may use an orphan work if they conduct \nand document a diligent search but were unable to locate the copyright \nowner of the work for permission. While the bill outlines the criteria \nfor a search, and the copyright office will disclose best practices for \nfinding a copyright owner, the court makes the final determination as \nto whether a search is diligent and in good faith.\n  The proposed legislation also has a ``safe harbor'' for uses of \norphan works that are educational, charitable, or religious in nature, \nand which are used without commercial advantage. We anticipate that \nmany institutions such as museums, libraries, archives, nonprofit \neducational organizations, as well as public broadcasting entities will \ngreatly benefit from this legislation since they would be qualified \nusers.\n  S. 2913 represents a commitment from Congress to move forward in \ncreating a way to identify copyright owners of orphan works and unlock \naccess to thousands of artistic works so the general public may once \nagain enjoy them. I am hopeful that further refinements will be made to \nthis bill during the legislative process. I am confident\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\nthat Chairman Leahy and I will continue to, with outside input, perfect \nthis bill, and am confident in our House counterparts to do the same.\n  I am committed to moving this legislation forward and hope that we \ncan join efforts to refine and enact this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3438-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                 COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. OBAMA.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mr. Kevin \nWebb of Glasgow, KY. Mr. Webb was recently chosen to be one of eight \nspeakers at the first ever Ticket to Work Partners Summit held in \nLouisville, KY.\n  In March 2008 the Social Security Administration launched the Ticket \nto Work Partners Summit to bring together over 400 of Social Security's \npartners who actively engage Social Security disability beneficiaries \nin work through the Ticket to Work Program. Mr. Webb was chosen to be \none of eight speakers nationally to discuss how they have benefited \nfrom this program.\n  With the help of the Social Security Administration, Mr. Webb was \nable to start his own business in April 2006. Today he is a proud co-\nowner with his father, Ron Taylor, of Webb/Taylor Horseback Riding and \nBoarding.\n  Prior to becoming a successful business owner, Mr. Webb was faced \nwith a number of difficult challenges in finding employment. Despite \nall of the setbacks and obstacles he had to overcome, Mr. Webb never \ngave up on his dreams and continued to search for a job that made him \nhappy.\n  Mr. Webb applied for a grant given to five individuals each year by \nthe Kentucky Council on Developmental Disabilities and the State \nvocation rehabilitation for startup funds for new businesses. With the \ngrant and a fully funded Plan for Achieving Self Support from the \nSocial Security Administration, Mr. Webb and his father were able to \nlaunch the Webb/Taylor Horseback Riding and Boarding.\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\n  Besides starting his own business, Mr. Webb has also worked with \nelected officials in the Kentucky State Legislature on behalf of \nindividuals with disabilities. In 2003, the Kentucky State Legislature \npassed the Kevin Webb and Kim Brown Self-Determination Act to require \nthe Commission on Services and Supports for Individuals with Mental \nRetardation and Other Developmental Disabilities to make \nrecommendations to the Department of Medicaid Services for the \nimplementation of a self-determination model for individuals who are \nreceiving services through the Supports for Community Living waiver \nprogram.\n  I would like to congratulate Mr. Webb for his hard work and \ndedication as he celebrates the two year anniversary of opening Webb/\nTaylor Horseback Riding and Boarding. Mr. Webb is truly an inspiration \nto all Kentuckians and I wish him the best of luck in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3439-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         2009 SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Linthicum \nHeights, MD, on its 100th anniversary.\n  Linthicum Heights is a suburb of Baltimore that is also located near \nAnnapolis and Washington, DC. Close to rail lines and good roads, \nLinthicum offers location without sacrificing its suburban character \nand historic property.\n  Linthicum is on the National Register of Historic Places. The \ncommunity was farmland until 1908, when the decendents of Abner \nLinthicum decided to sell the farm land for houses. They created the \nLinthicum Heights Realty Company and named their development Linthicum \nHeights. Many of the original homes on the farm property remain. Two of \nthe most famous are Turkey Hill, built in 1822 by William Linthicum, \nand Twin Oaks, which was home to U.S. Congressman John Charles \nLinthicum, who represented the Fourth Congressional District of \nMaryland from 1911 to 1932. U.S. Representative Linthicum was a sponsor \nof the legislation that named ``The Star Spangled Banner'' as our \nnational anthem.\n  Today, Linthicum's location and its historic nature remain its charm \nand attraction. Easy access to Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Annapolis \nand its close proximity to Baltimore Washington Thurgood Marshall \nInternational Airport, Fort George G. Meade, Goddard Space Flight \nCenter, and numerous other Federal facilities make Linthicum a \ndesirable place to live.\n  The residents of Linthicum Heights as well as the Woman's Club of \nLinthicum Heights, the Linthicum-Shipley Improvement Association, the \nNorth Linthicum Improvement Association, business leaders, and \ngovernment officials are to be congratulated for their appreciation and \nsteadfast support of Linthicum Heights and its history.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Linthicum \nHeights on its 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3439-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR. EMMETT BUELL\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \nremarkable professor, scholar, and author, Dr. Emmett Buell of Denison \nUniversity in Granville, OH. Today, April 28, 2008, Dr. Buell will \nteach his final class before stepping down as a full-time professor.\n  Professor Buell received his Ph.D. in political science from \nVanderbilt University after earning his undergraduate and M.A. at \nLouisiana State University. He has taught at Denison since the 1969 to \n1970 academic year and has directed the Richard G. Lugar Program in \nPolitics and Public Service since its inception in 1995. This program \nprovides students with opportunities to study various aspects of public \npolicy, combining classroom instruction with the practical application \nof these studies through an internship experience. As of July 2007, \nabout 110 students in the program will have served as interns in \ncongressional offices. Given his exemplary leadership and record of \nsuccess, Dr. Buell was subsequently installed as the inaugural holder \nof the Richard G. Lugar Chair in Public Policy on April 21, 2006.\n  Dr. Emmett Buell is a nationally recognized expert in the political \nscience field and specifically on Presidential selection and negative \ncampaigning in Presidential elections. He has authored, coauthored, or \ncoedited four books, including ``Attack Politics: Negativity in \nPresidential Campaigns Since 1960''. Emmett also has authored or \ncoauthored articles and research notes in the American Journal of \nPolitical Science, Journal of Politics, American Politics Quarterly, \nUrban Affairs Quarterly, Social Science Quarterly, and the Journal of \nLaw & Politics. In addition, he has written chapters for books edited \nby others on such topics as the invisible primary, the New Hampshire \nprimary, the changing role of national party conventions, and news \ncoverage of Presidential aspirants.\n  Outside of his impressive list of experiences and skills, I know \nEmmett to be an individual of high integrity and character. He is \nidealistic, while remaining grounded in the practical. He is serious \nand thoughtful, while maintaining a sense of humor. He is generous with \nhis time and attention, without losing his focus and personal \ndiscipline.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Buell has been an inspirational mentor \nto hundreds of students. His office door has always been open, and he \nmakes every effort to assist, promote, and encourage those who seek \nguidance. I have heard from many individuals, including those who have \nworked in my own office, that they would not be in their employment \npositions today if it were not for his assistance. Likewise, I know \nthat he is immensely proud of these students and their accomplishments.\n  Dr. Buell is also legendary on the Denison campus for his devotion to \npersonal fitness and mastery of racquetball. He has encouraged numerous \nstudent challenges on the racquetball court throughout his career and \nhas almost always been on the victorious side.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased to join with many of these former \nstudents, along with numerous faculty and friends, in celebration of \nEmmett's career at a retirement ceremony on Saturday, April 19, 2008. I \nam delighted that this event provided a forum to share our admiration \nfor his years of service and contribution to Denison \nUniversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3439-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3439-S3440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO INDIANA STATE SENATOR DAVID C. FORD\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to honor the memory of an \noutstanding Hoosier, IN, State senator, David C. Ford.\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\n  Representing Senate District 19, David Ford served in the Indiana \nSenate from 1994 until his death from pancreatic cancer on March 5, \n2008. His colleagues in the Indiana Senate have lost a dear friend and \ninsightful leader. Public officials across the State will remember him \nas a tireless advocate for technological innovation. However, the \nbreath of his knowledge extended to education, agriculture, and \njudiciary policy as well. In short, he was an able and devoted \nlegislator who performed his duties with intelligence, vigor, and \nintegrity.\n  Prior to being elected to the Indiana Senate, David Ford served as \nprosecutor in Blackford County, IN. He was also an accomplished pilot, \nan active member of the American Agriculture Law Association, a board \nmember of Dollars for Scholars, and the recipient of many State and \nnational awards.\n  I remember many wonderful visits with David over the years. I was \nalways grateful for his wisdom and counsel, and I hope you will join me \nin paying tribute to State Senator Ford.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the 30th \nanniversary of the Seniors' Resource Center, SRC, in Jefferson County, \nCO. For three decades, the SRC has delivered critical services to the \naging and disabled communities in the Denver metropolitan area through \na variety of innovative programs. I salute Jon Zabawa, president and \nCEO of SRC, his staff, and the many volunteers who have made the Center \nwhat it is today.\n  From its inception as an extension of the Jefferson County Retired \nand Senior Volunteer Program, tasked with providing transportation \nassistance to the elderly, SRC has consistently received awards and \nacknowledgements for its terrific services. The National Council on \nAging has named SRC one of its five Best Practices Organizations. The \nNational Senior Citizen Education and Research Center has recognized \nSRC for ``outstanding performance in the Senior Aide Program and in \nenrollment, budget management, and placement.'' In 2002, SRC was the \nColorado Association of Transit Agencies' Mid Transportation System of \nthe Year. In 2004, they were the winners of the Community \nTransportation Association of America and the Beverly Foundation's \n``Search for Innovation in Senior Transportation Award.'' Most \nrecently, the center won the first-ever Non-Profit of the Year Award \nfrom the West Chamber of Commerce.\n  Over the last 30 years, SRC has worked to steadily improve and expand \nits programs. The organization has grown beyond Jefferson County to 10 \nother metropolitan counties. Today, more than 100,000 Colorado citizens \nhave access to SRC's services, including adult day and respite \nservices, in-home care, transportation, care management, referrals to \ncommunity partners, and job training programs.\n  In the year 2010, there will be more than 770,000 seniors age 60 and \nover in Colorado, making organizations such as the SRC even more vital \nto the health of our communities. I am very proud of SRC's work, and I \nlook forward to several more decades of their service to the \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3440-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORKER EDUCATION\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I highlight the importance of \nacknowledging and celebrating extraordinary efforts by Americans who \nhave led the way in protecting and preserving America's natural \nresources. I am honored to congratulate three educational institutions \nin my State of Oregon, Columbia Gorge Community College, Lane Community \nCollege and the Oregon Institute of Technology.\n  Recently, Columbia Gorge Community College received $1.6 million to \nsupport the college's community-based job training program to develop \nskilled technicians for renewable energy facilities such as wind, \nsolar, hydropower and biofuels production. The funding is part of the \nDepartment of Labor's Community-Based Job Training Grant Initiative to \nhelp community colleges provide area students and workers with the \nskills needed to stay competitive in up-and-coming industries. The \nprogram is the only one of its kind on the west coast. Just in the \nPacific Northwest, developers of wind energy facilities will need 300-\n500 additional workers in the next decade. Since the fall of 2007, \nColumbia Gorge Community College has offered a 1-year certificate and a \n2-year associate of applied science degree in renewable energy \ntechnology.\n  Lane Community College in Eugene, OR, was recently commended for \ntheir certificate and 2-year degree programs which train students in \nenergy management and renewable energy. Graduates of the program are in \nhigh demand by renewable energy companies. Lane Community College is \nquickly gaining recognition as a national leader in sustainability and \nhas won five awards in the past 2 years, including the Campus \nSustainability Leadership Award from the Association for the \nAdvancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, and the Outstanding \nCollege Recycling Program Award from the National Recycling Coalition.\n  The Oregon Institute of Technology, OIT, also has earned distinction \nfor offering the Nation's first 4-year undergraduate degree program in \nrenewable energy. The institute is on track to graduate the first class \nof students this year. Graduating students can seek employment in \nvariety of fields including design, engineering, installation, auditing \nand programming within the renewable energy sector. Additionally, OIT \nis working to become the only college campus in the world to be \ncompletely powered by geothermal energy.\n  I believe that we have a responsibility to encourage efforts to \nincrease the availability of renewable energy and conserve our natural \nresources. Oregon continues to build on a long history of innovation in \nenvironmental policy and practice. These community colleges are leading \nthe way in educating these workers and providing highly skilled workers \nto the rapidly expanding renewable energy sector in our State and the \nNation. I commend them for their efforts and pledge my full support as \nthey move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3440-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3440-S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACK H. RHYNER\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last week Jack Rhyner lost his \ncourageous battle against cancer, and Alaska lost a pioneer in our \ntelecommunications industry and I lost a very good friend.\n  As a young man, Jack worked alongside his father, Richard Rhyner, as \nhe founded TelAlaska. At 16, Jack salvaged telephone equipment damaged \nin the Fairbanks flood of 1967. Using emery boards to smooth out the \ngold points on the mechanical switches and high-pressure water hoses \nand brushes, he cleaned and repaired each component.\n  Jack and his dad used that salvaged equipment to build the first \ntelephone system in Fort Yukon. Until then, residents of that village \nshared a single phone line at the airport. Today, more than 300 \nresidents have private lines in their homes and access to DSL Internet \nservice.\n  In 1982, Jack took leadership of Interior Telephone. Over the years \nhe worked with his wife Donna developing and expanding TelAlaska into a \nstatewide, modern company connecting many of our rural villages to \nphone service for the first time. Jack's commitment and hard work \nresulted in dozens of villages--most of them inaccessible by road--\nbecoming connected to the world by telephone systems. In addition, \nTelAlaska provides DSL service to 12 villages and cable service to 4 \nsmall communities including my own hometown of Girdwood.\n  Jack was appointed to the FCC's Rural Task Force where he worked \ntirelessly to ensure affordable rates and reliable service in Alaska. \nAs a respected leader in Alaska's telecommunications industry, Jack was \noften called upon to share his insight into our State's unique \ncommunications challenges with Congress, State, and Federal agencies.\n  Jack's contributions to the advancement of telecommunications in \nAlaska earned him the prestigious Kaguyak Award from the Alaska \nTelephone Association. The Western Telecommunications Alliance \nrecognized Jack's dedication to rural telecommunications with the \nPresident's Award.\n  A true Alaskan, Jack was an avid outdoorsman. He enjoyed spending\n\n[[Page S3441]]\n\ntime with his shooting team which won more than a dozen championships \nat Birchwood Shooting Park. He would smile when he talked about setting \nup visits to the communities served by TelAlaska's companies, checking \nthe calendar to ensure that he would arrive in the right season for a \nday or two of fishing or hunting. It is no surprise, then, that he \nwanted his ashes spread in the fall at his favorite duck hunting \nretreat at Cold Bay.\n  Catherine and I send our condolences to Donna and their sons, Ryan \nand Richard II, and all who knew and loved Jack. He will be \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3441-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3441-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3441-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill:\n\n       H.R. 2830.

A bill to repeal certain oil and gas incentives established \nin the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce by request a bill \ntransmitted by the Administration that would eliminate mandatory \nroyalty relief incentives for the oil and gas industry on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, OCS, in the Gulf of Mexico. I share the \nadministration's position that these royalty incentives should not \napply to future OCS oil and gas lease sales on a mandatory basis.\n  Section 344 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, EPAct, requires the \nSecretary of the Interior to provide for royalty relief for the \nproduction of deep gas from the OCS. Section 345 of EPAct requires the \nSecretary to extend royalty relief for oil and gas produced from deep \nwater of the OCS. Under these provisions, at certain prices a set \nquantity of federally-owned oil and gas is allowed to be produced \nwithout any royalty payment by industry to the United States. Similar \nroyalty relief language, included in legislation enacted in 1995, has \ngiven rise to circumstances that may expose the Treasury to up to an \nestimated $60 billion in forgone royalty revenues.\n  Neither deep gas nor deep water royalty relief is warranted in this \nprice climate. Last year, the administration requested that these \nincentives be repealed. The President's proposed budget for fiscal year \n2009 renews this request. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF CERTAIN OIL AND GAS INCENTIVES.\n\n       Sections 344 and 345 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 \n     U.S.C. 15904, 15905) are repealed.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2008.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed is a copy of the letter sent to \n     the President of the Senate on August 20, 2007, urging the \n     Senate to consider legislation ``to repeal certain oil and \n     gas incentives contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.'' \n     This legislative proposal would end the mandatory royalty \n     relief incentives for future OCS lease sales.\n       I want to make sure that you are aware of the significance \n     and time sensitivity of this legislative proposal. The next \n     Gulf of Mexico lease sale is scheduled in August of 2008. By \n     law, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) must publish a \n     final notice of sale with final terms and conditions, \n     including royalty relief incentives, at least 30 days prior \n     to the sale. To ensure that any legislative changes are \n     reflected in the final notice of sale for the August sale, \n     this issue must be resolved by July 1.\n       Please note that an immediate repeal of the mandatory \n     royalty relief is supported by the Administration. Provisions \n     to support the repeal are included in the President's Fiscal \n     Year 2008 budget and cleared by the Office of Management and \n     Budget. Prompt action is now needed by Congress if the repeal \n     of the mandatory royalty relief is to be included in the fast \n     approaching Gulf of Mexico sale.\n       Your immediate attention would be greatly appreciated. I am \n     personally available to discuss this legislation with you and \n     answer any questions you or your staff may have.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            C. Stephen Allred,\n\n                                             Assistance Secretary,\n     Land and Minerals Management.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 2007.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill, ``to repeal \n     certain oil and gas incentives contained in the Energy Policy \n     Act of 2005 and for other purposes.''\n       I recommend that the draft bill be introduced, referred to \n     the appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       The repeal of sections 344 and 345 of the Energy Policy Act \n     of 2005 (Energy Policy Act) has been proposed in the \n     President's Fiscal Year 2008 budget. Section 344 of the \n     Energy Policy Act extended existing deep gas incentives by \n     mandating a royalty suspension volume of at least 35 billion \n     cubic feet of natural gas for certain wells completed at \n     depths greater than 20,000 feet sub-sea on leases located in \n     0-400 meters of water. Section 344 also directed that the \n     same methodology used to calculate suspension volumes in the \n     Minerals Management Service's 2004 rule for wells completed \n     between 15,000 feet and 20,000 feet sub-sea on leases in 0-\n     200 meters of water be applied to leases in 200-400 meters of \n     water. Section 345 of the Energy Policy Act provided \n     mandatory royalty suspension volumes for leases in water \n     depths greater than 400 meters issued in the first five years \n     after the Energy Policy Act's enactment (August 8, 2005-\n     August 8, 2010).\n       Repeal of Sections 344 and 345 of the Energy Policy Act \n     would eliminate incentives and royalty relief that we believe \n     are unwarranted in today's price environment.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that the \n     enactment of this draft bill would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n       An identical letter is being sent to the Honorable Nancy \n     Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            C. Stephen Allred,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n     Land and Minerals Management.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 A Bill\n\n       To repeal certain oil and gas incentives contained in the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2005 and fur other purposes.\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That sections 344 and 345 of the Energy Policy Act \n     of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15904 and 15905) are repealed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Section by Section Summary\n\n       A bill to repeal certain oil and gas incentives contained \n     in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and for other purposes.\n       This bill would repeal incentives for natural gas \n     production from deep wells in shallow waters of the Gulf of \n     Mexico and royalty relief for deep water production in the \n     Gulf of Mexico.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2923. A bill to provide for a three-year extension of the Senior \noversight Committee on wounded warrior matters, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the proposed Senior \nOversight Committee Extension Act of 2008 The VA and DoD Senior \nOversight Committee--the SOC--has been an important component of \nongoing efforts to ensure that the Departments of Veterans Affairs and \nDefense work together to improve the treatment and care of our Nation's \nwounded warriors. This bill requires a 3-year extension of the VA and \nDoD SOC so that it may continue its vitally important oversight \nfunction.\n  As a result of the problems identified at Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter in May 2007, VA and DoD established the SOC to identify \ncorrective actions. It was tasked with reviewing and overseeing the \nimplementation of the recommendations of the various task forces and \nstudy groups which were established to study problems related to the \ntransitioning of seriously injured servicemembers. Today, the SOC and \nits supporting staff continue to work toward implementing policies and \nprocedures to streamline and expedite joint efforts to provide \nseriously injured servicemembers and veterans with the best care \navailable.\n  The SOC is currently co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense \nand the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It brings together the \nmost senior VA and DoD officials on a regular basis to ensure that the \ndecisions designed to improve care, recovery, rehabilitation and \nreintegration of seriously injured servicemembers are made in a timely \nand efficient manner. It is supported by a full-time joint VA and DoD \nstaff that is responsible for coordinating, integrating and \nsynchronizing the activities of the Committee.\n  The Administration's current plan is for the SOC to hand over its \nresponsibilities next January to the existing VA and DoD Joint \nExecutive Council. However, the Joint Executive Council has neither a \nfull time staff nor the equivalent involvement of senior VA and DoD \nofficials. The JEC staff has neither the resources nor the leverage \nwithin the individual Departments to carry out the essential work that \nthe SOC has managed. Veterans' organizations who testified at the April \n23, 2008, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing support the need \nto extend the SOC rather than transfer responsibilities to the Joint \nExecutive Council.\n  Although I am pleased with the progress that has been achieved over \nthe past year on improving VA and DoD cooperation and collaboration, \nmuch work remains. I am concerned that, in the future, without the full \nweight of VA and DoD leadership behind these activities, an ongoing \ncommitment to solving the problems related to the goal of seamless \ntransition and a full time staff to track implementation, there is a \nvery real risk of returning to the bureaucratic lethargy which \ncontributed to the Walter Reed scandal. We have come too far to return \nto those days.\n  I am a firm believer in the adage that what the boss checks is what \ngets done. To make sure the boss--in this case, the Secretaries of \nVeterans Affairs and Defense--keep an eye on coordination and \ncooperation between the two departments, I am introducing this \nlegislation to provide the two Secretaries with authority to extend the \nwork of the SOC for 3 years, to ensure the continued existence of a \njoint body that will serve as the single point of contact for the \noversight, strategy and integration of policies and procedures \npertaining to the seriously injured.\n  With the upcoming change in Administration, there can be no wavering \non the high level of attention that the Departments have brought to \nissues of coordination and cooperation. I am committed to sustaining \nthis effort for as long as there are servicemembers in combat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Oversight Committee \n     Extension Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF SENIOR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE \n                   WITH RESPECT TO WOUNDED WARRIOR MATTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs shall jointly take such actions as are \n     appropriate, including the allocation of appropriate \n     personnel, funding, and other resources, to continue the \n     operations of the Senior Oversight Committee until September \n     30, 2011.\n       (b) Report on Further Extension of Committee.--Not later \n     than December 31, 2010, the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall jointly submit to \n     Congress a report setting forth the joint recommendation of \n     the Secretaries as to the advisability of continuing the \n     operations of the Senior Oversight Committee after September \n     30, 2011. If the Secretaries recommend that continuing the \n     operations of the Senior Oversight Committee after September \n     30, 2011, is advisable, the report may include such \n     recommendations for the modification of the responsibilities, \n     composition, or support of the Senior Oversight Committee as \n     the Secretaries jointly consider appropriate.\n       (c) Senior Oversight Committee Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``Senior Oversight Committee'' means the Senior \n     Oversight Committee jointly established by the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in May 2007 to \n     address concerns related to the treatment of wounded, ill, \n     and injured members of the Armed Forces and veterans and \n     serve as the single point of contact for oversight, strategy, \n     and integration of proposed strategies for the efforts of the \n     Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     to improve support throughout the recovery, rehabilitation, \n     and reintegration of wounded, ill, or injured members of the \n     Armed Forces.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2926. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify and \nupdate provisions of law relating to nonprofit research and education \ncorporations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation concerning the \nnonprofit research and education corporations--NPCs--that serve the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. These organizations provide essential \nsupport to research and education at VA facilities around the country. \nMy legislation will amend the law which authorizes NPCs so as to better \nreflect their mission and the needs of VA, as well as strengthen \ncontrol and oversight of these entities.\n  The legislation which authorizes NPCs was enacted in 1988 to allow \nthe establishment of these entities as flexible funding mechanisms for \nthe conduct of research and education at VA medical centers. In 2006, \n85 NPCs expended $227 million in support of over 5,000 VA research and \neducation programs. NPCs give VA the opportunity to access and manage \nresearch funds from sources outside of VA, while maintaining VA \noversight.\n  Twenty years have passed since the inception of NPCs, and it is time \nto update the law governing their operation. VA's research needs have \nshifted and the function of NPCs has evolved. I will highlight a few of \nthe corrections this legislation would make.\n  NPCs are nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations that are entirely \ndedicated to serving VA research. They efficiently administer VA \nresearch funds, and provide access to some funds that VA would \notherwise be unable to access. Unfortunately, given their close \naffiliation with VA, and due in part to various state laws, NPC \nnonprofit status is in some situations unclear. My legislation would \nexplicitly identify the nonprofit status of NPCs under IRS code. It \nwould also make clear that NPCs are not owned or controlled by the U.S. \nGovernment, and are not agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S.\n  As the utility and appeal of NPCs have grown, their numbers have \nexpanded. While this growth is positive, it is not always efficient or \nfeasible for a medical center to establish and manage its own NPC. The \nlegislation would\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\ncreate authority for multi-medical center NPCs to be shared among a \nnumber of medical centers. Condensing numerous NPCs into one would \nretain the local affiliations that make them valuable and effective, \nbut would achieve greater efficiency and economy of scale by combining \nadministrative resources.\n  The legislation would make additional adjustments in other areas. It \nwould expand VA's oversight capability. It would clarify existing \nauthority for NPCs to transfer funds among medical centers, and it \nwould clarify reimbursement processes. It would also modify the \nrequired composition of NPC governance boards, to allow individuals \nwith a wider range of expertise to serve.\n  I believe these proposed changes would facilitate better working \nrelationships between NPCs and VA, thereby achieving better support of \nVA research and education. I am confident that these provisions will \nmake an effective source of support for VA even stronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3446-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 534--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF MAY 2008 AS ``NATIONAL \n                           DRUG COURT MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nMenendez, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Johnson) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 534\n\n       Whereas drug courts provide focus and leadership for \n     community-wide partnerships, bringing together public safety \n     and public health professionals in the fight against drug \n     abuse and criminality;\n       Whereas 60 percent to 80 percent of drug offenders \n     sentenced to prison and over 40 percent sentenced to \n     probation recidivate, and whereas fewer than 17 percent of \n     drug court graduates recidivate;\n       Whereas the results of more than 100 program evaluations \n     and at least 3 experimental studies have yielded evidence \n     that drug courts greatly improve substance abuse treatment \n     outcomes, substantially reduce crime, and produce significant \n     societal benefits;\n       Whereas drug courts transform over 120,000 addicts each \n     year in the adult, juvenile, and family court systems into \n     drug-free, productive citizens;\n       Whereas judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, substance \n     abuse treatment and rehabilitation professionals, law \n     enforcement and community supervision personnel, researchers \n     and educators, national and community leaders, and others \n     dedicated to drug courts and similar types of treatment \n     programs are healing families and communities across the \n     country; and\n       Whereas the drug court movement has grown from the 12 \n     original drug courts in 1994 to over 2,000 operational drug \n     courts as of December 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of May 2008 as ``National Drug \n     Court Month'';\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe the month with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities;\n       (3) encourages leaders across the United States to increase \n     the use of drug courts by instituting sustainable drug courts \n     and other treatment-based alternatives to prison in all 3,143 \n     counties in the United States, which serve the vast majority \n     of the highest-need citizens in the justice system; and\n       (4) supports the goal of robustly funding the Drug Court \n     Discretionary Grant Program and other treatment-based \n     alternatives to prison in order to expand these critical \n     criminal justice programs.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution \nmarking May 2008 as National Drug Court Month. The more than 2,000 drug \ncourts that currently operate across the country are critical to \ncurbing drug use, reducing recidivism, and turning non-violent \nprisoners into law abiding and productive members of our society.\n  Drug courts closely supervise non-violent drug offenders as they \naddress their addiction or substance abuse problem. When they graduate \nfrom the program they are clean, sober and better prepared to \nparticipate productively in society. In order to graduate from most \ndrug court programs, participants are required to finish high school or \nobtain a GED, hold down a job, as well as maintain financial \nobligations including drug court fees and child support payments. A \nsponsor is also required to help ensure they stay on track.\n  In 1994, I wrote the law that created the drug courts program because \nwe believed that the programs they oversee were cost-effective, \ninnovative alternatives to prison that would reduce crime and deal with \nnon-violent offenders who are in desperate need of treatment. It turns \nout we were right. A 2005 report from the Government Accountability \nOffice found that drug court program participants were less likely to \nbe rearrested or reconvicted than those who did not participate in drug \ncourt programs. The report also concluded that a conservative estimate \nof the net benefits to society of sending a non-violent offender throug \ndrug court program ranges from about $1,000 per participant to about \n$15,000. There is just no question that these alternative to prison \nprograms not only work, but also make great financial sense.\n  Treating non-violent offenders through drug court-monitored programs \nand other alternatives to prison treatment programs provides them with \nan opportunity to turn away from drugs and to get on the path to be \nhealthy, contributing members of society. It also helps to reduce \nAmerica's exploding prison population: more than 2.3 million people are \nin prisons and jails across the U.S.; 1 in 100 adults in the United \nStates are behind bars. It costs an average of nearly $24,000 to \nimprison an individual. Drug courts can reduce the financial burden on \nState and local budgets.\n  I hope that National Drug Court Month raises awareness about the \nimportance of drug courts and other alternatives to prison treatment-\nbased programs. I ask my colleagues to join me in commending these \nprograms and urging state, local and Federal officials to help expand \nand robustly fund these treatment programs throughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3446-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3446-S3447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 535--RECOGNIZING APRIL 28, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL \n                         HEALTHY SCHOOLS DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mrs. Clinton (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Casey)) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today is National Healthy Schools Day--\nestablished to build awareness and promote healthy school environments \nfor our children and school personnel.\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\n  Many organizations--including the Healthy Schools Network in New \nYork--have worked together over the years to educate their communities \nas well as local, State, and Federal elected officials of the \nconditions that many of our children and teachers are subjected to on a \ndaily basis. I strongly believe the work of these organizations is \ncrucial in fostering the development and well being of our Nation's \nchildren. That is why I am proud to join them in this effort as the \nsponsor of resolution recognizing April 28, 2008 as National Healthy \nSchools Day. By recognizing this day, Congress can promote healthy \nschool environments for all children, teachers, principals, and school \nstaff.\n  Over half of our Nation' schools have environmental problems linked \nto poor indoor air quality AQ. Poor IAQ can cause a wide range of \nacademic problems for the millions of children attending these schools, \nincluding lack of concentration, respiratory illnesses, learning \ndifficulties, and even cancer. Furthermore, millions of school absences \neach year are attributed to health problems caused by poor IAQ or other \nunhealthy school environments.\n  It is imperative that we address these problems. From holding \ndemonstrations on healthy cleaning practices to conducting workshops on \nhow to design a healthy, high-performance school, the Healthy Schools \nNetwork along with other partner organizations will provide practical \nways to make our schools healthier, safer learning environments for our \nchildren and teachers.\n  Congress has demonstrated its interest in this compelling issue by \nincluding the Healthy High-Performance Schools Program in the No Child \nLeft Behind Act and the Energy Independence and Security Act. I \nencourage my colleagues to continue to fight on our children's behalf \nby adopting this resolution.\n  We must spread awareness of the environmental health of our Nation's \nschools. I commend those across the Nation who are using National \nHealthy Schools Day to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3447-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 536--RECOGNIZING THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING \n     OF SEEDS OF PEACE, AN ORGANIZATION PRO- MOTING UNDERSTANDING, \nRECONCILIATION, ACCEPTANCE, COEXISTENCE, AND PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, \n               SOUTH ASIA, AND OTHER REGIONS OF CONFLICT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Carper, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \nStabenow, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am proud to submit today a bipartisan \nresolution to designate May 15, 2008, as National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day. Joining me in the submission of this resolution are \nSenators Specter, Kennedy, Durbin, and Kohl. We join in recognizing the \nsacrifices that law enforcement officers make each day for the American \npeople.\n  This is now the twelfth year that I have been involved in offering \nthis resolution to honor the sacrifice and commitment of those law \nenforcement officers who lost their lives serving their communities. \nFor many years I submitted this resolution with my old friend and our \nformer colleague Senator Campbell, a former deputy sheriff. Both \nSenator Campbell, and I, as a former prosecutor, know well the risks \nfaced by law enforcement officers every day while they serve and \nprotect the American people.\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\n  We do not thank our Nation's law enforcement officers enough for the \nsacrifices they make in order to protect all of us. State and local \npolice officers and all of our first responders deserve our support and \nrespect. Their role is crucial in upholding the rule of law and keeping \nour Nation's citizens safe and secure. They help make our democracy \npossible. They are our here-at-home, day-in-and-day-out, real-life \nheroes.\n  Currently, more than 900,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. Since the first recorded police death in 1792, \nthere have been more than 18,200 law enforcement officers who have made \nthe ultimate sacrifice. There is lots of talk about the war on crime. \nOur law enforcement officers are all too often the casualties in that \neffort.\n  We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State with the fewest \nofficer deaths in history, with 19 recorded. But of course that is \nstill 19 deaths too many. The pain and the suffering and the loss \nassociated with every one of those is difficult for anyone to even \nimagine.\n  Last year, in 2007, 181 law enforcement officers died while serving \nin the line of duty. That is a regrettable and significant increase \nfrom 2006. Tragically, it is the most line-of-duty deaths since 2001 \nand the losses from September 11 of that year.\n  With crime having risen during the last few years after a decade of \ndecline, and with law enforcement officers' deaths increasing, Congress \nmust do more to strongly support State and local law enforcement \nofficers and agencies. Federal programs can bolster police departments \nand their support for line officers. We should help provide greater \naccess to bulletproof vests, state-of-the-art technology, improved \ntraining and advanced emergency medical care. I believe that there is \nstrength in numbers when it comes to fighting violent crime, and \nCongress owes it to all Americans to support the men and women who are \non the front lines keeping America safe.\n  I am proud of the work I have been involved in to help make it safer \non the beat for our officers. Back in 1998, Senator Campbell and I \nauthored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act in response to the \ntragic Carl Drega shootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire border. Two \nSate troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. Since then, we \nhave successfully reauthorized this program three more times: in the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the State Justice \nInstitute Reauthorization Act of 2004, and most recently as part of the \nViolence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of \n2005. It is now authorized at $50 million per year through fiscal year \n2009 to help State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests \nfor use by law enforcement officers.\n  I hope all Senators will join me to ensure that the program is fully \nfunded for fiscal year 2009, and will also join with me to reauthorize \nthis important program again this year. Bulletproof vests have saved \nthe lives of thousands of officers and are a fundamental line of \ndefense that no officer should be without. Hundreds of thousands of \npolice officers are counting on us.\n  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the \nU.S., in their communities, in their State Capitals, and in the \nNation's Capital, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police \nforces.

Res. 538\n\n       Whereas many nations throughout the world, and especially \n     within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de los \n     Ninos'', or ``Day of the Children'', on the 30th of April, in \n     recognition and celebration of their country's future--their \n     children;\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     people of the United States and are the center of American \n     families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas, according to the latest Census report, there are \n     more than 44,000,000 individuals of Hispanic descent living \n     in the United States, nearly 15,000,000 of which are \n     children;\n       Whereas Hispanics in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the Nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the Nation;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and that encourage children to explore and \n     develop confidence;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the United States will help affirm for the people of the \n     United States the significance of family, education, and \n     community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition for \n     the children of the United States will provide an opportunity \n     for children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     aspirations, and to find comfort and security in the support \n     of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans'', a day to bring together \n     Hispanics and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children; and\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its people, and people should be encouraged to celebrate \n     the gifts of children to society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 30, 2008, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to join with \n     all children, families, organizations, communities, churches, \n     cities, and States across the Nation to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies, including activities that--\n       (A) center around children, and are free or minimal in cost \n     so as to encourage and facilitate the participation of all \n     our people;\n       (B) are positive and uplifting and that help children \n     express their hopes and dreams;\n       (C) provide opportunities for children of all backgrounds \n     to learn about one another's cultures and to share ideas;\n       (D) include all members of the family, especially extended \n     and elderly family members, so as to promote greater \n     communication among the generations within a family, enabling \n     children to appreciate and benefit from the experiences and \n     wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (E) provide opportunities for families within a community \n     to get acquainted; and\n       (F) provide children with the support they need to develop \n     skills and confidence, and to find the inner strength and the \n     will and fire of the human spirit to make their dreams come \n     true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/28/senate-section/article/S3448-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3448-S3449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 78--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND ALL ENTERPRISES OWNED OR CONTROLLED \n BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SHOULD MAKE PROPER DISCLOSURES WITH \nTHE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGARDING THE SELECTIVE DEFAULT \n                        STATUS OF CERTAIN BONDS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2829) to make technical corrections to section \n     1244 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008, which provides special immigrant status for \n     certain Iraqis, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the bipartisan group \nof Senators on this bill who all recognize our obligation to help those \nIraqis who have assisted the United States in Iraq. This legislation \nwill remove obstacles encountered by the Departments of\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\nState and Homeland Security in issuing the 5,000 special visas that \nCongress authorized in January for those Iraqi citizens.\n  As part of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress \nprovided 5,000 special immigrant visas for Iraqis who had aided the \nUnited States as interpreters in the country. As chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, I have supported these efforts. The Departments of \nState and Homeland Security seem stymied and unable to implement what \nCongress has provided. In our efforts to remove any impediment to fast \nimplementation and address any excuse for further delays, we seek \npassage of this bill as well, to cut through bureaucratic stalling and \ntechnical requirements.\n  This administration has been woefully slow in recognizing its \nresponsibilities not only to those Iraqis who have helped us, but to \nall Iraqis who have been displaced or have fled the violence still \nplaguing that country. The relative inaction by the administration with \nrespect to those Iraqis whose lives are in grave danger due to their \nassistance of the United States is especially troubling. Action is \nneeded now. The Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on this \nhumanitarian problem more than 15 months ago. That hearing on the \nplight of Iraqi refugees was among our first, in January 2007. In the \ninterim, the administration has continued to make promises it cannot, \nor will not keep with respect to the resettlement of Iraqi refugees in \nthe United States.\n  The administration's failure to acknowledge the Iraqi refugee crisis \nis emblematic of its inability to address other serious human rights \nissues that are much of its own making. The injustice resulting from \nthe administration's interpretation of the material support and \nterrorism related bars that were enacted following September 11, 2001, \ncontinues to deprive legitimate asylum seekers of our protection. The \nconsequences of these laws continue to go unaddressed, despite the fact \nthat Congress has now twice given the Department of Homeland Security \nthe authority to alleviate the situation. While Secretary Chertoff is \nunwilling to use this authority to provide asylum to those who need our \nprotection, he has repeatedly used the vast authority ceded to him by \nproponents of the REAL ID Act to waive landmark environmental laws in \nthe course of constructing a border wall between the United States and \nMexico.\n  This month, during the Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, I followed up by asking Secretary \nChertoff about his Department's lack of progress on implementing the \nauthority Congress has given to him to remedy the material support and \nterrorism bars. At that time, I challenged him to fulfill the goal of \nlegislation I authored and Congress enacted to provide relief to \nindividuals such as Saman Kareem Ahmad, who received a commendation \nfrom General Petreaus for his work on behalf of the United States in \nIraq and instructs U.S military personnel in preparation for service in \nIraq. Although Mr. Ahmad was granted asylum, his application for a \ngreen card was denied because the organization with which he had once \nserved, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, was deemed a ``terrorist \norganization'' by DHS. I urged Secretary Chertoff to use the authority \nhe has been given to ensure that individuals like Mr. Ahmad were not \ndenied a place in the United States because of inflexible and expansive \nreadings of the so-called ``material support'' bar. I hope the \nadministration takes the opportunity Congress has given it to correct \nthis wrongheaded policy and practice. It is long past the time for this \nadministration to take action and acknowledge the severe humanitarian \nconsequences of its policies, whether in Iraq, or at our shores where \nthe persecuted are seeking refuge.\n  Providing for the safety of our Iraqi allies is only one aspect of an \nincreasingly severe humanitarian crisis in Iraq. Refugees International \nrecently reported that in the vacuum left by the failure of the Iraqi \ngovernment to address the plight of millions of its internally \ndisplaced citizens, various non-state militias are providing assistance \nto those who are suffering. By the report's account, these militias are \nfinding fertile ground for recruiting among this population, with the \nShiite Sadrist movement now being the ``main service provider'' to \ndisplaced Iraqis. We have been pressing the administration for some \ntime to acknowledge this crisis and to make increased efforts to assist \nthose Iraqis who have been internally displaced or who have left the \ncountry. Now we learn that the dangers associated with the \nadministration's failure to recognize the magnitude of this crisis go \nbeyond the terrible human cost that has resulted and threaten to \nundermine any efforts to bring positive change to Iraq.\n  The bill the Senate approves today will be another effort to \nencourage this administration to fulfill its obligations to those who \nhave sacrificed significantly to assist the United States. It is my \nhope that this will end the unacceptable delays and provide long \noverdue relief.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair and Senator Klobuchar \nfor her comments. These things just take time. I fully understand that.\n  I would share with her a question as to why we would continue to pour \nlarge amounts of petroleum into our Reserve when we are clearly at \nhigh, even peak prices that seems to me not a good idea. It would help \nrelieve some pressure on price and on supply if we were to suspend \nthat. I also share her concern that on the world market, we are not in \na free marketplace. Those experts who said they thought the price ought \nto be $50, $55 a barrel, I don't know what the prices ought to be, but \nI know OPEC meets and decides what the production level will be. As a \nprosecutor myself, that is a cartel. That is price fixing, as I \nunderstand it. Somehow, we need to make it a part of our sustained \nnational policy to stand up to this.\n  In one sense, what OPEC does when they drive up the price by limiting \nproduction, what they are doing is taxing the United States of America. \nThey just decide how much they are going to tax us for the oil we use. \nOne expert has said that the cost of producing a barrel of oil in those \nfabulous oil sands in Saudi Arabia is less than $10 a barrel. So we see \nwhat the profit margin is when it hits $120 a barrel on the world \nmarket. Many factors are in it. I know the decline in the dollar and \nother factors are involved.\n  But I just want to say that I do think we are moving into a new era \nof government-controlled oil more than we ever have. Most people think \noil companies control it. But recent studies show about 85 percent of \noil is owned by nation states. For example, Mexico owns all of its oil \nand will not allow private industry to participate in its extraction. \nBecause the Government is inefficient and unproductive, their \nproduction has fallen, whereas Mexico has huge reserves. Venezuela's \nproduction has fallen. Aramco, the Saudi Arabian company, owns theirs, \nand their production has fallen. As a result, we continue to see \nshortages on the world market, driving prices up, allowing certain \npeople who are clever and smart and who have invested wisely or \naggressively to make billions of dollars.\n  We have a serious energy problem in the United States. The high costs \nare impacting the lives of American citizens and farmers and others. \nThere was an article in a local paper--I believe the Mobile Press \nRegister--that I saw today where an individual who has a shrimp boat \nparked his boat at the dock and said: If the price of shrimp doesn't go \nup or the price of fuel drop, I cannot make a profit. There is no way I \ncan go out and do this. He docked his boat. There was a similar article \nin the Florence Times talking about farmers and the increasing cost \nfarmers see from the fuel they use.\n  Increased demand from India, Southeast Asia, South America, with \ndecreased production around the globe, has created the opportunity for \nprices and profits to grow for certain people who are wisely \npositioned.\n  During my last trip to Alabama for a week, I had townhall meetings \nand visited with people throughout the State. Energy prices were the \nNo. 1 thing people talked to me about. It is having a real impact on \ntheir family budget. The price of regular unleaded gasoline climbed to \n$3.50 a gallon. A year ago, it was $2.84, and 2 years ago, it was \n$2.74. That is a 28-percent increase in 2 years. This helps explain the \neconomic doldrums and slowdown we are in. The typical American family \nwith two cars is paying about $750 to $1,000 more per year for the same \namount of fuel they were buying the previous year. That represents $70, \n$80 a month of disposable income that previously they could use for \nother things for their family. It is now going to buy the same amount \nof fuel they were using the year before or 2 years before. This \nrepresents a huge economic hit to the American family.\n  There is another adverse, serious problem for America as a nation: \nMore than 60 percent of the fuel we utilize in our vehicles comes from \nplaces such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and Russia and Mexico, some \nof which countries are not friendly to us. That represents a $400 \nbillion transfer of wealth on an annual basis from this country. \nBusinessman T. Boone Pickens, in a recent interview in the American \nSpectator, referred to this as ``the greatest transfer of wealth in the \nhistory of mankind.'' That is a pretty smart guy. He is an oil man \nhimself. He said we have to do something about this. It is not \nsomething we can just ignore.\n  Of course, there is no silver bullet to solving the problems, but \nthere are some basic principles we should respect. We must increase \nsupplies in our own country, increase production in our country, which \nwe certainly can do and which I regret to say we have attempted in this \nSenate and in the House more than once, to be blocked by various groups \nthat seem to complain about high energy prices but don't want to do \nanything to allow us to produce more in the United States. We must \nconserve more energy. I supported the increased gas mileage standards \nwhich represent a substantial improvement. Maybe we can even do more. \nWe certainly must try to use more biofuels, if we can, although under \ncurrent technologies, we are reaching the limits. But I think other \ntechnology will help us in the future to expand the amount of biofuels \nwe can use. We must use the fuel we have more efficiently.\n\n  The Government does have a responsibility to ensure that we have \nfairness in the world marketplace and in the American marketplace and \nto make sure these cartels openly fixing the price of oil do not \nsucceed. As I will discuss in a minute, I think we should take a \nserious look at establishing a policy with regard to diesel fuel. I \nwill mention that in a moment.\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\n  I know the problem for gasoline is hitting American families \ndirectly. But at this moment, I would like to share some specific \nthoughts about diesel fuel and those high costs.\n  Recent spikes in diesel fuel prices don't get a lot of attention in \nthe media, but it has a huge impact on consumers and businessmen and \ntruckers and shrimpers and farmers.\n  Today, I had the pleasure to meet with six independent truckers who \nare here in Washington to bring attention to the skyrocketing cost of \ndiesel fuel. They had press conferences, and they talked to a number of \npeople. I invited a group to come to my office.\n  Over-the-road trucks, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, and agricultural \ntrucks almost exclusively use diesel fuel. This month, diesel fuel \nprices climbed to $4.14 a gallon. Two years ago, it was $2.72. That is \na 52-percent increase in diesel fuel, substantially greater than the \nincrease in gasoline. That is putting a huge stress on trucking \ncompanies--independent truckers, particularly--small businesses, and \nfarming and fishing operations.\n  Among automobiles and pickup trucks, 98 percent of the people drive \nvehicles that use unleaded gas. So you might say: I am not a trucker or \na farmer. Those prices don't really affect me. But that is just not so, \nreally. There are two ways the market for diesel fuel affects the \naverage person's pocketbook. When diesel prices go up, the cost of \ntransporting goods, consumer products, and food goes up. That increase \nis passed to consumers. Secondly, we have an opportunity, through \nimproved diesel technology, of making diesel engines cleaner and more \nefficient than ever before. Mercedes, for example, Daimler-Chrysler, is \noffering consumers a range of vehicles with its blue tech diesel engine \nthat is built in my home State. So we should spend a few minutes \nlooking at our policies and how they affect diesel prices.\n  I hope the Energy Committee, of which I am a member, will have some \nhearings on this issue. It would be worth our having some time set \naside exclusively to this problem. Nearly all trucks and delivery \nvehicles utilize diesel fuel. The price of diesel fuel affects our \ncountry in so many ways. Trucking currently uses 75 percent of the \ntotal diesel fuel used in the United States. Only 3.5 percent of the \nautomobiles in America use diesel. But in Europe, approximately 50 \npercent of the automobiles are diesel. And in the United States, one \naction we took that may have had some impact on not using so much \ndiesel fuel but had a good impact, perhaps, for the environment was to \ndemand very clean, low-sulfur diesel fuel. Our diesel fuel is lower \nsulfur than the Europeans, and that is because of environmental \nreasons.\n  But did you know this? Diesel automobiles run approximately 30 \npercent farther on diesel fuel than similar gasoline-powered \nautomobiles. Diesel engines get 30 percent better mileage than gasoline \nengines. Diesel-powered automobiles also get more miles per gallon even \nthan hybrid automobiles, or about the same. Some insist it is better, \nbut they are pretty much equal. In addition to being fuel efficient, \ndiesel-powered automobiles emit fewer CO2 emissions than \nsimilar hybrid and gasoline engines. A lot of people don't know that. \nOf course, that is why 50 percent of the automobiles in Europe, which \nhas analyzed this more carefully than we, it appears, are now diesel. \nThe European Union has emphasized diesel engines because it takes 30 \npercent less fuel to run a diesel engine.\n  The average price of diesel fuel used in motor vehicles has \nhistorically been lower than the price of regular gasoline. According \nto the Department of Energy, the average price of diesel has been \nhigher than gasoline since 2004--as a matter of fact, substantially \nhigher.\n  So for some reason, even though diesel fuel traditionally has been \nless expensive and requires less refining effort than gasoline, it has \nbeen averaging 64 cents a gallon more than gasoline.\n  Now, like I said, I believe in a free market. I am loathe for the \nGovernment to intervene. But let me ask this question: Why is that? \nWhy? Why would a product that should be cheaper be consistently, since \n2004, more expensive than the other product? I, frankly, do not know. \nBut it does appear our country has made a determination to shift to a \ngasoline economy and a hybrid economy.\n  I think it is fabulous we are utilizing large numbers now of hybrid \nvehicles--large numbers. We certainly have enough on the roads today to \nbe able to find out how well they work, to make their capabilities more \nsophisticated, to improve their lifespan, to improve their efficiency, \nto work out the bugs.\n  A lot of people are finding that the savings in gas alone will help \npay for the somewhat more expensive hybrid engine. So I am not against \nthe hybrid engine, and I am delighted we are leading the world in the \neffort to utilize hybrid engines.\n  What I am asking is, how have we gotten ourselves in a situation in \nwhich the less expensive diesel fuel, that gets 30 percent better gas \nmileage, is not readily available and is costing 64 cents more a \ngallon? Something is awry as far as I can see.\n  I say, let's get busy. Let's do something about it. Let's stand up to \nOPEC. Let's use every political influence and pressure we have to \nencourage them to increase productivity to reduce these shortages. \nLet's stop, at least temporarily, depositing to the petroleum reserve. \nLet's expand biofuels, and particularly biodiesel, which is a fabulous \nfuel that, unlike ethanol, is just as productive as diesel fuel and \nactually is even cleaner than diesel fuel.\n  We need to figure out how to get more production domestically from \nour own reserves. I will not go into the arguments we have had about \nANWR, all the oil shale in the West, and offshore drilling. We simply \nhave not done enough of it, and we still have large reserves available \nto us in this country. So when those reserves are produced, that wealth \ndoes not go to foreign nations but is kept within the United States, \ncreating jobs in our country.\n  So we need more production, and we need to look at this question of \nrefineries. I do not know what the problem is, but we need to ask some \nquestions. I have already asked the Congressional Research Service and \nthe Department of Energy some questions. But I intend to look at this \nmore as to why we do not have sufficient diesel fuel being produced in \nthe country and we continue to have shortages of it.\n  So that is what I think we need to do. I am not unaware and I \nunderstand completely that the surging cost of energy impacts working \nAmericans directly. It hits their pocketbook. Those are the people who \nhave the least disposable income, and it is like a hidden tax.\n  Yes, oil is more valuable today than it was. Mr. T. Boone Pickens, in \nhis article, said he thought we were at a peak oil situation in the \nworld while demands are going up worldwide. I do not know that we are \nyet at a total peak. I doubt we are, frankly. But we are getting close \nto that. So the oil is just a more valuable product. I understand that. \nBut we need to execute the policies we know will work to help contain \nthe price increases that are hurting Americans.\n  I will add this one thought: We need to be careful about cap and \ntrade and other pieces of legislation that focus solely on \nCO2 emissions because we know those actions and those pieces \nof legislation will only drive the cost of fuel higher. According to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, which has just completed a study \nof the cap and trade bill that the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee just reported to the floor a month or two ago, that bill \nwould raise the price of gasoline 50 cents a gallon. It could raise the \nprice of electricity maybe as much as $100 a month for a family. Who is \ngoing to pay that?\n  So we have to be very careful when we pass cap-and-trade, global-\nwarming-type legislation, that when we do, we do not dump huge costs on \nworking Americans, on low-income Americans which they do not deserve \nand they are not justified. So I think that is a matter we will need to \nconsider in the weeks to come.\n  I thank the Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to share these \nremarks. I appreciate very much the truckers who were in my office \ntoday. I enjoyed talking with them. They told me stories of people who \nare having to park their trucks and not being able to continue to work. \nThey told me stories of people who were going to go into bankruptcy; \nthey could not continue to make their payments.\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\n  So it is not an academic matter. It is a very real thing.
