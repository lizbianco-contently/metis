Mr. President, a few months prior to this body's \nconvening last week, I was honored and humbled when my colleagues \nelected me to serve as the Republican leader in the 110th Congress.\n  I am thankful for the trust my friends have placed in me, and I won't \nbreak that trust.\n  At such a time as this, and in such an historic Chamber, my thoughts \nturn toward great Kentuckians of the past who have left their indelible \nmark on this body.\n  Henry Clay served as Speaker of the House, Senator, and Secretary of \nState, despite losing three Presidential campaigns.\n  John Sherman Cooper served as the conscience of the Senate, and I \nhave\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nspoken on this floor before of the admiration and respect I will always \nhave for the Senator who mentored me in my first job on Capitol Hill.\n  But there is another famous Kentuckian who once dominated these \nSenate hallways who we should not forget.\n  He was a key lawmaker during World War II, and close friend to \nPresidents--a passionate orator, champion of the New Deal, and popular \nteller of tall tales. After his Senate service, he made famous the \nnickname ``the Veep.''\n  That man is Alben Barkley, the last, and until now, the only Senator \nfrom Kentucky to be elected his party's leader.\n  Senator Barkley served as majority leader for 10 years, from 1937 to \n1947, longer than anyone else before him. From 1947 to 1949 he served \nas minority leader, and in 1948 he was elected Vice President to \nPresident Truman.\n  But some of my colleagues may not know that Senator Barkley almost \nbecame the first President of the United States from Kentucky since \nAbraham Lincoln. He lost that opportunity by taking a courageous stand \nto put the Senate, the Senators he led, and principle ahead of \npolitical ambition.\n  Like Lincoln, Alben Barkley was born in a log cabin, literally, on \nhis father's tobacco farm in Graves County, KY, in 1877. The Barkley \nfamily was not a family of means, and Alben grew up chopping wood, \nharvesting tobacco, and plowing fields. Swapping stories with his \nfather's hired hands, Alben began to develop his fun-loving, \nstorytelling persona.\n  When he got older, Alben worked odd jobs to make ends meet. One time \nat a shoe store, a man with exceptionally large feet walked in and said \nto Alben, ``I'd like to see a pair of shoes that would fit me.'' The \nsharp-witted tobacco farmer's son retorted, ``So would I!'' Alben had \nto change jobs quite often.\n  Becoming a lawyer in Paducah, Barkley's political career began with a \nrace for county attorney in McCracken County. The history books tell us \nhe bought a one-eyed horse named Dick and stumped the whole county \nriding that horse.\n  At 27 years old, he toppled the incumbent in the Democratic primary \nand easily won the general election in 1905, for Kentucky in those days \nwas very much a one-party State.\n  Barkley then won election as McCracken County judge before going to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives in 1912. Kentucky voters re-elected \nBarkley, an avid progressive and devotee of President Woodrow Wilson, \nsix times until sending him to this Chamber in 1926.\n  Barkley's long shadow over history was fixed here in the Senate, \nwhere he served from 1927 to 1949, and then after his Vice Presidency \nagain from 1955 until his death in 1956.\n  Here in the Senate, Barkley became known as a first-rate speechmaker \nand storyteller. Many can recall Senator Barkley's saying: ``A good \nstory is like fine Kentucky bourbon . . . it improves with age and, if \nyou don't use it too much, it will never hurt anyone.''\n  By 1933, Barkley was selected as an assistant to Senate Majority \nLeader Joe Robinson of Arkansas. In 1937, Robinson died, clearing the \nway for Barkley's election as leader--but the manner of Barkley's \nelection to the top spot would serve today as an object lesson to \nSenators of how not to get the job, and it hampered Barkley's \neffectiveness as leader for several years thereafter.\n  When the 75th Congress began, the Democrats held a whopping 76 seats \nin the Senate, leaving only 16 Republicans and four Independents. Their \nmajority was so large that freshmen Democrats had desks over here on \nthe Republican side of the Chamber in the back.\n  Senators in those days referred to the lone outpost of Democrats over \nhere on the Republican side in the back as the ``Cherokee Strip'' \nbecause those unlucky Members were off the reservation.\n  But the Democratic Party was badly split in two. Half the caucus \nsupported Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal policies, and the other half \nfrequently undermined them.\n  In the leader's race, the first group lined up behind Barkley, and \nthe latter behind Senator Pat Harrison of Mississippi. Each Senator had \npledges of support from enough Senators to win, so they thought.\n  Usually in the Senate, it is the Vice President who breaks ties. But \nthis close vote was broken by the President himself. The day after \nRobinson's death, Roosevelt sent Barkley a letter that began, ``My Dear \nAlben.'' Roosevelt even referred to Barkley, correctly, but cheekily, \nas the ``acting majority leader.''\n  Now, Roosevelt preferred Barkley over Harrison because he knew he \ncould count on Barkley to shepherd his New Deal policies through the \nupper Chamber. Besides his public letter, FDR also dispatched aides to \nexert pressure on Senators to vote for Barkley.\n  One week after Robinson's death, all 75 Senate Democrats met to \nvote--75. With 74 votes tallied, Barkley and Harrison stood tied at 37 \nvotes apiece. The 75th and final vote put Barkley over the top. Senator \nBarkley had won the election, but he had lost a much more important \nrace with his colleagues.\n  As the Presiding Officer and all of my friends in the Chamber know, \nthe Senate has the sole power to choose its own leaders and chart its \nown course of affairs, without interference from the executive branch. \nAnd every Senator guards that right very seriously.\n  Many Senators took offense at the President's influence in Senator \nBarkley's election, and Barkley, frankly, paid the price. His \ncolleagues granted him the title of majority leader, but not the \naccompanying authority or respect.\n  On his first day in the top post, Democratic Senators ignored his \nplea not to override a Presidential veto, putting Barkley on the losing \nside of a 71 to 19 vote. The bill had originally been sponsored by \nBarkley himself, putting the leader in the humiliating position of \nlosing a vote to sustain a veto of his own bill.\n  Over the next few years, Barkley's troubles mounted, actually, as he \nkept finding himself on the losing end of votes. Senators cruelly \nreminded him of how he had climbed to the top spot by mockingly \nreferring to him as ``Dear Alben.''\n  Even worse, Washington journalists, seeing the leader unable to move \nhis colleagues, dubbed him ``Bumbling Barkley,'' and the name stuck.\n  In March 1939, Life magazine published a poll of Washington \njournalists rating the 10 ``most able'' Senators. Barkley's one-time \nrival Pat Harrison ranked fifth. The Senate majority leader did not \nmake the list.\n  Despite setbacks, Senator Barkley plunged ahead to lead the Senate \nand to champion President Roosevelt's New Deal. His colleagues began to \nmelt under his considerable personal charm.\n  In contrast with Robinson's heavy-handed leadership style, Barkley \noften sat down with a colleague, disarmed him with humor or a funny \nstory, and then made his case.\n  Barkley led from the podium at his desk, speaking persuasively and \nknowledgeably on any and every bill. By 1940, much of official \nWashington realized that legislation was actually moving faster and \nmore successfully through the Senate--and that Barkley deserved the \ncredit.\n  Barkley was crucial at negotiating compromise with his fellow \nSenators. As the war in Europe heated up and international affairs took \nup more of the Senate's time, Barkley's record of success continued to \nmount.\n  Historians note the vital role he played in passing the Lend-Lease \nAct, repealing the Arms Embargo Act and the Neutrality Act, and \nenacting the first peacetime military draft.\n  As the Senate majority leader, Barkley eagerly embraced the \nresponsibility to lead the charge for the administration's legislation. \nBut sometimes--sometimes--the President took the loyal leader for \ngranted.\n  That ended when Senator Barkley dramatically broke with his beloved \nPresident on a matter of principle.\n  Barkley's move may have angered Roosevelt, but by stepping out of the \nPresident's shadow and throwing off the impression of servility that \nthe mocking phrase ``Dear Alben'' implied, Barkley forever earned the \nrespect and trust of his Senate colleagues.\n  The principle Barkley made his stand on is one dear to my heart; and \nthat is, keeping taxes low. By February 1944, America was at war with \nthe Axis Powers, and President Roosevelt wanted to raise taxes \nconsiderably to pay for it. He requested a tax increase of $10.5 \nbillion, which was, apparently, a lot of money in those days.\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\n  Majority Leader Barkley knew that the Senate didn't have nearly the \nappetite for higher taxes that the President did. A $10.5 billion tax \nhike simply could not pass.\n  But Barkley did the best he could for his President, and successfully \nsteered through the Finance Committee and onto the floor a bill to \nraise revenues by $2.2 billion.\n  Barkley pleaded with Roosevelt to accept the bill as the best he \ncould get and to sign it. He knew the Senate, and he knew his Senators. \nBut the President dismissed the leader's advice.\n  Even though he knew it was coming, Roosevelt's veto message stung \nBarkley. It was petty, and it was personal.\n  The President wrote that, having asked the Congress for a loaf of \nbread, the final bill was ``a small piece of crust.'' Then his next \nwords struck hardest of all. He declared the final bill as ``not a tax \nbill but a tax-relief bill, providing relief not for the needy, but for \nthe greedy.''\n  After years of devotion and support to the President--often at the \ncost of the respect of his own colleagues--this insult to his integrity \nas a legislator, a leader, and a disciple of the New Deal was too much \nfor Barkley.\n  Overwhelmed with passion, Barkley dictated a speech to his secretary \nand walked out to the Senate floor. Word had leaked of what was coming. \nJournalists packed the galleries, and many Senators took their seats to \nlisten to their leader.\n  For the first time Senator Barkley, Washington's most famous \nraconteur, seemed to nervously stumble over his words. His voice \ncracked with emotion as he related his history of steadfast support for \nthe Roosevelt administration.\n\n       I dare say that during the past seven years of my tenure as \n     majority leader, I have carried that flag over rougher \n     terrain than was ever traversed by any previous majority \n     leader,\n\n  Barkley explained.\n\n       But . . . there is something more precious to me than any \n     honor that can be conferred upon me by the Senate of the \n     United States, or by the people of Kentucky . . .\n       Or by the president of this Republic. And that is the \n     approval of my own conscience and my own self-respect.\n\n  And with that Alben Barkley resigned as majority leader.\n  Barkley had always believed the leader must have overwhelming support \nfor the President's position. Unable to give that, stepping down was \nhis only choice.\n  Nearly every Senator in the chamber rose for a thunderous ovation. \nThe galleries stood as one to applaud as well. Longtime Senators said \nthey could not remember the last time a speech received such a \ntremendous response, and Vice President Henry Wallace called it ``the \nmost dramatic occasion in the U.S. Senate over which I ever presided.''\n  Within a day of Barkley's declaration of independence, he received \nover 7,000 telegrams. Roosevelt saw when he was beaten and wrote a \nletter urging Barkley not to resign. But he needn't have bothered.\n  The next day, the Democrats unanimously reelected Barkley to the \nleader's post. ``Make way for liberty!'' shouted Texas Senator Tom \nConnally, expressing the joy of his colleagues that their leader, and \nby extension, the entire Senate, had stood up for the Senate's \nindependence as a co-equal branch.\n  The Senate turned back Roosevelt's veto 72 to 14, and this time Alben \nBarkley led his colleagues to win that vote. Senator Elbert Thomas of \nUtah summed up the newfound power and prestige of the majority leader.\n  ``By his one-vote margin in the 1937 contest when he was first \nelected leader, the impression was given, and it has been the \nimpression ever since, that he spoke to us for the president,'' Thomas \nsaid. ``Now he speaks for us to the president.''\n  The majority leader and the President mended the breach soon after \nand continued to work together. But you could say their relationship \nwas never again the same.\n  That summer, the Democratic National Convention nominated President \nRoosevelt to an unprecedented fourth term. But with Vice President \nWallace deemed too liberal by most of the party and dumped from the \nticket, the President needed a new running mate. Could it be Barkley?\n  As the convention opened, Barkley emerged as a seeming front-runner. \nHe had the respect and confidence of the delegates. The Kentucky \ndelegation--not surprisingly--formally endorsed him.\n  But ever since breaking with Roosevelt in February, the President had \nhad ``a certain intangible reserve'' towards the majority leader. \nRoosevelt emphatically told his supporters Barkley was unacceptable as \na running mate.\n  Of course, we all know that the 1944 vice presidential nomination \neventually fell to another Senator, Harry Truman of Missouri, who was \nhand picked by the President himself.\n  And we all know that in April 1945, less than 3 months after taking \nthe oath of office for his fourth term, Franklin Delano Roosevelt died. \nHis health had been failing for some time, even back during the 1944 \nconvention.\n  Harry Truman became the 33rd President of the United States. Alben \nBarkley stayed on as Senate majority leader and narrowly missed \nbecoming the first President from Kentucky since Abraham Lincoln.\n  Henry Clay, who once held Alben Barkley's Senate seat, said ``I would \nrather be right than be President.'' Alben Barkley lived by that motto.\n  He chose to stand for his personal sense of honor and the integrity \nof the Senate, knowing it could cost him the favor of the President and \npossibly the Vice-Presidential nomination. It did. But Alben Barkley \nnever regretted it.\n  In fact, Barkley kept his keen sense of humor. In a speech to newly \nelected Senators in 1945, Barkley warned them to run ``for the tall and \nuncut'' if they ever received a letter from the President that began \nwith ``Dear'' followed by their first name.\n  Like so many other revered figures who have occupied these chairs, \nAlben Barkley loved the Senate, and he fought to protect it. As the \nSenate majority leader, that was his duty, and he fulfilled it without \nhesitation.\n  After 4 years as Vice President to Truman, Barkley retired from \npolitics, seemingly forever. But he longed to return to this Chamber \nwhich had seen his greatest successes and his most ignoble defeats. So \nhe ran for and won reelection in 1954, ousting Republican John Sherman \nCooper.\n  Alben Barkley died on April 30, 1956. He left this world doing what \nhe loved--giving a speech.\n  In his final moments, he explained to a crowd of students at a mock \nconvention at Washington and Lee University that as a newly elected \nSenator, he had refused a seat in the front row of this Chamber, \ndespite his decades of service.\n  ``I am glad to sit in the back row,'' the 78-year-old Barkley said. \n``For I would rather be a servant in the house of the Lord than to sit \nin the seats of the mighty.''\n  Those were Senator Barkley's last words before he collapsed. The \ncrowd's applause was the last thing he would hear, before suffering a \nmassive heart attack.\n  I wanted to share the story of Alben Barkley with my colleagues \nbecause I know that as we all debate the issues of the day in the \nSenate, we are mindful not just of what is happening in our country \ntoday, but what has gone before. History, and men like Alben Barkley, \nhas much to teach us.\n  Politics in America today can often be a bruising exercise. But I \ntake comfort in Alben Barkley's reminder that even if that is true, we \ncan and should put principle over the pursuit of power.\n  We've just had a hard-fought election. I for one, have always enjoyed \na good political contest.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to present a set of principles and \nideals to the people and to hear their choice when they cast their \nvotes.\n  But while we spar in the arena of ideas, let's not forget what we're \nsparring for. The goal is not just to win, but to win because you stand \nfor a cause that will better your countrymen and your country.\n  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand that \nlesson well. It is an honor for me to share this floor with them.\n  I am looking forward to continuing the contest in the time ahead. For \nnow, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and get back to work on behalf \nof the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S243-9", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S243-S246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATOR ALBEN BARKLEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

One time \nat a shoe store, a man with exceptionally large feet walked in and said \nto Alben, ``I'd like to see a pair of shoes that would fit me.'' The \nsharp-witted tobacco farmer's son retorted, ``So would I!'' Alben had \nto change jobs quite often.\n  Becoming a lawyer in Paducah, Barkley's political career began with a \nrace for county attorney in McCracken County. The history books tell us \nhe bought a one-eyed horse named Dick and stumped the whole county \nriding that horse.\n  At 27 years old, he toppled the incumbent in the Democratic primary \nand easily won the general election in 1905, for Kentucky in those days \nwas very much a one-party State.\n  Barkley then won election as McCracken County judge before going to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives in 1912. Kentucky voters re-elected \nBarkley, an avid progressive and devotee of President Woodrow Wilson, \nsix times until sending him to this Chamber in 1926.\n  Barkley's long shadow over history was fixed here in the Senate, \nwhere he served from 1927 to 1949, and then after his Vice Presidency \nagain from 1955 until his death in 1956.\n  Here in the Senate, Barkley became known as a first-rate speechmaker \nand storyteller. Many can recall Senator Barkley's saying: ``A good \nstory is like fine Kentucky bourbon . . . it improves with age and, if \nyou don't use it too much, it will never hurt anyone.''\n  By 1933, Barkley was selected as an assistant to Senate Majority \nLeader Joe Robinson of Arkansas. In 1937, Robinson died, clearing the \nway for Barkley's election as leader--but the manner of Barkley's \nelection to the top spot would serve today as an object lesson to \nSenators of how not to get the job, and it hampered Barkley's \neffectiveness as leader for several years thereafter.\n  When the 75th Congress began, the Democrats held a whopping 76 seats \nin the Senate, leaving only 16 Republicans and four Independents. Their \nmajority was so large that freshmen Democrats had desks over here on \nthe Republican side of the Chamber in the back.\n  Senators in those days referred to the lone outpost of Democrats over \nhere on the Republican side in the back as the ``Cherokee Strip'' \nbecause those unlucky Members were off the reservation.\n  But the Democratic Party was badly split in two. Half the caucus \nsupported Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal policies, and the other half \nfrequently undermined them.\n  In the leader's race, the first group lined up behind Barkley, and \nthe latter behind Senator Pat Harrison of Mississippi. Each Senator had \npledges of support from enough Senators to win, so they thought.\n  Usually in the Senate, it is the Vice President who breaks ties. But \nthis close vote was broken by the President himself. The day after \nRobinson's death, Roosevelt sent Barkley a letter that began, ``My Dear \nAlben.'' Roosevelt even referred to Barkley, correctly, but cheekily, \nas the ``acting majority leader.''\n  Now, Roosevelt preferred Barkley over Harrison because he knew he \ncould count on Barkley to shepherd his New Deal policies through the \nupper Chamber. Besides his public letter, FDR also dispatched aides to \nexert pressure on Senators to vote for Barkley.\n  One week after Robinson's death, all 75 Senate Democrats met to \nvote--75. With 74 votes tallied, Barkley and Harrison stood tied at 37 \nvotes apiece. The 75th and final vote put Barkley over the top. Senator \nBarkley had won the election, but he had lost a much more important \nrace with his colleagues.\n  As the Presiding Officer and all of my friends in the Chamber know, \nthe Senate has the sole power to choose its own leaders and chart its \nown course of affairs, without interference from the executive branch. \nAnd every Senator guards that right very seriously.\n  Many Senators took offense at the President's influence in Senator \nBarkley's election, and Barkley, frankly, paid the price. His \ncolleagues granted him the title of majority leader, but not the \naccompanying authority or respect.\n  On his first day in the top post, Democratic Senators ignored his \nplea not to override a Presidential veto, putting Barkley on the losing \nside of a 71 to 19 vote. The bill had originally been sponsored by \nBarkley himself, putting the leader in the humiliating position of \nlosing a vote to sustain a veto of his own bill.\n  Over the next few years, Barkley's troubles mounted, actually, as he \nkept finding himself on the losing end of votes. Senators cruelly \nreminded him of how he had climbed to the top spot by mockingly \nreferring to him as ``Dear Alben.''\n  Even worse, Washington journalists, seeing the leader unable to move \nhis colleagues, dubbed him ``Bumbling Barkley,'' and the name stuck.\n  In March 1939, Life magazine published a poll of Washington \njournalists rating the 10 ``most able'' Senators. Barkley's one-time \nrival Pat Harrison ranked fifth. The Senate majority leader did not \nmake the list.\n  Despite setbacks, Senator Barkley plunged ahead to lead the Senate \nand to champion President Roosevelt's New Deal. His colleagues began to \nmelt under his considerable personal charm.\n  In contrast with Robinson's heavy-handed leadership style, Barkley \noften sat down with a colleague, disarmed him with humor or a funny \nstory, and then made his case.\n  Barkley led from the podium at his desk, speaking persuasively and \nknowledgeably on any and every bill. By 1940, much of official \nWashington realized that legislation was actually moving faster and \nmore successfully through the Senate--and that Barkley deserved the \ncredit.\n  Barkley was crucial at negotiating compromise with his fellow \nSenators. As the war in Europe heated up and international affairs took \nup more of the Senate's time, Barkley's record of success continued to \nmount.\n  Historians note the vital role he played in passing the Lend-Lease \nAct, repealing the Arms Embargo Act and the Neutrality Act, and \nenacting the first peacetime military draft.\n  As the Senate majority leader, Barkley eagerly embraced the \nresponsibility to lead the charge for the administration's legislation. \nBut sometimes--sometimes--the President took the loyal leader for \ngranted.\n  That ended when Senator Barkley dramatically broke with his beloved \nPresident on a matter of principle.\n  Barkley's move may have angered Roosevelt, but by stepping out of the \nPresident's shadow and throwing off the impression of servility that \nthe mocking phrase ``Dear Alben'' implied, Barkley forever earned the \nrespect and trust of his Senate colleagues.\n  The principle Barkley made his stand on is one dear to my heart; and \nthat is, keeping taxes low. By February 1944, America was at war with \nthe Axis Powers, and President Roosevelt wanted to raise taxes \nconsiderably to pay for it. He requested a tax increase of $10.5 \nbillion, which was, apparently, a lot of money in those days.\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\n  Majority Leader Barkley knew that the Senate didn't have nearly the \nappetite for higher taxes that the President did. A $10.5 billion tax \nhike simply could not pass.\n  But Barkley did the best he could for his President, and successfully \nsteered through the Finance Committee and onto the floor a bill to \nraise revenues by $2.2 billion.\n  Barkley pleaded with Roosevelt to accept the bill as the best he \ncould get and to sign it. He knew the Senate, and he knew his Senators. \nBut the President dismissed the leader's advice.\n  Even though he knew it was coming, Roosevelt's veto message stung \nBarkley. It was petty, and it was personal.\n  The President wrote that, having asked the Congress for a loaf of \nbread, the final bill was ``a small piece of crust.'' Then his next \nwords struck hardest of all. He declared the final bill as ``not a tax \nbill but a tax-relief bill, providing relief not for the needy, but for \nthe greedy.''\n  After years of devotion and support to the President--often at the \ncost of the respect of his own colleagues--this insult to his integrity \nas a legislator, a leader, and a disciple of the New Deal was too much \nfor Barkley.\n  Overwhelmed with passion, Barkley dictated a speech to his secretary \nand walked out to the Senate floor. Word had leaked of what was coming. \nJournalists packed the galleries, and many Senators took their seats to \nlisten to their leader.\n  For the first time Senator Barkley, Washington's most famous \nraconteur, seemed to nervously stumble over his words. His voice \ncracked with emotion as he related his history of steadfast support for \nthe Roosevelt administration.\n\n       I dare say that during the past seven years of my tenure as \n     majority leader, I have carried that flag over rougher \n     terrain than was ever traversed by any previous majority \n     leader,\n\n  Barkley explained.\n\n       But . . . there is something more precious to me than any \n     honor that can be conferred upon me by the Senate of the \n     United States, or by the people of Kentucky . . .\n       Or by the president of this Republic. And that is the \n     approval of my own conscience and my own self-respect.\n\n  And with that Alben Barkley resigned as majority leader.\n  Barkley had always believed the leader must have overwhelming support \nfor the President's position. Unable to give that, stepping down was \nhis only choice.\n  Nearly every Senator in the chamber rose for a thunderous ovation. \nThe galleries stood as one to applaud as well. Longtime Senators said \nthey could not remember the last time a speech received such a \ntremendous response, and Vice President Henry Wallace called it ``the \nmost dramatic occasion in the U.S. Senate over which I ever presided.''\n  Within a day of Barkley's declaration of independence, he received \nover 7,000 telegrams. Roosevelt saw when he was beaten and wrote a \nletter urging Barkley not to resign. But he needn't have bothered.\n  The next day, the Democrats unanimously reelected Barkley to the \nleader's post. ``Make way for liberty!'' shouted Texas Senator Tom \nConnally, expressing the joy of his colleagues that their leader, and \nby extension, the entire Senate, had stood up for the Senate's \nindependence as a co-equal branch.\n  The Senate turned back Roosevelt's veto 72 to 14, and this time Alben \nBarkley led his colleagues to win that vote. Senator Elbert Thomas of \nUtah summed up the newfound power and prestige of the majority leader.\n  ``By his one-vote margin in the 1937 contest when he was first \nelected leader, the impression was given, and it has been the \nimpression ever since, that he spoke to us for the president,'' Thomas \nsaid. ``Now he speaks for us to the president.''\n  The majority leader and the President mended the breach soon after \nand continued to work together. But you could say their relationship \nwas never again the same.\n  That summer, the Democratic National Convention nominated President \nRoosevelt to an unprecedented fourth term. But with Vice President \nWallace deemed too liberal by most of the party and dumped from the \nticket, the President needed a new running mate. Could it be Barkley?\n  As the convention opened, Barkley emerged as a seeming front-runner. \nHe had the respect and confidence of the delegates. The Kentucky \ndelegation--not surprisingly--formally endorsed him.\n  But ever since breaking with Roosevelt in February, the President had \nhad ``a certain intangible reserve'' towards the majority leader. \nRoosevelt emphatically told his supporters Barkley was unacceptable as \na running mate.\n  Of course, we all know that the 1944 vice presidential nomination \neventually fell to another Senator, Harry Truman of Missouri, who was \nhand picked by the President himself.\n  And we all know that in April 1945, less than 3 months after taking \nthe oath of office for his fourth term, Franklin Delano Roosevelt died. \nHis health had been failing for some time, even back during the 1944 \nconvention.\n  Harry Truman became the 33rd President of the United States. Alben \nBarkley stayed on as Senate majority leader and narrowly missed \nbecoming the first President from Kentucky since Abraham Lincoln.\n  Henry Clay, who once held Alben Barkley's Senate seat, said ``I would \nrather be right than be President.'' Alben Barkley lived by that motto.\n  He chose to stand for his personal sense of honor and the integrity \nof the Senate, knowing it could cost him the favor of the President and \npossibly the Vice-Presidential nomination. It did. But Alben Barkley \nnever regretted it.\n  In fact, Barkley kept his keen sense of humor. In a speech to newly \nelected Senators in 1945, Barkley warned them to run ``for the tall and \nuncut'' if they ever received a letter from the President that began \nwith ``Dear'' followed by their first name.\n  Like so many other revered figures who have occupied these chairs, \nAlben Barkley loved the Senate, and he fought to protect it. As the \nSenate majority leader, that was his duty, and he fulfilled it without \nhesitation.\n  After 4 years as Vice President to Truman, Barkley retired from \npolitics, seemingly forever. But he longed to return to this Chamber \nwhich had seen his greatest successes and his most ignoble defeats. So \nhe ran for and won reelection in 1954, ousting Republican John Sherman \nCooper.\n  Alben Barkley died on April 30, 1956. He left this world doing what \nhe loved--giving a speech.\n  In his final moments, he explained to a crowd of students at a mock \nconvention at Washington and Lee University that as a newly elected \nSenator, he had refused a seat in the front row of this Chamber, \ndespite his decades of service.\n  ``I am glad to sit in the back row,'' the 78-year-old Barkley said. \n``For I would rather be a servant in the house of the Lord than to sit \nin the seats of the mighty.''\n  Those were Senator Barkley's last words before he collapsed. The \ncrowd's applause was the last thing he would hear, before suffering a \nmassive heart attack.\n  I wanted to share the story of Alben Barkley with my colleagues \nbecause I know that as we all debate the issues of the day in the \nSenate, we are mindful not just of what is happening in our country \ntoday, but what has gone before. History, and men like Alben Barkley, \nhas much to teach us.\n  Politics in America today can often be a bruising exercise. But I \ntake comfort in Alben Barkley's reminder that even if that is true, we \ncan and should put principle over the pursuit of power.\n  We've just had a hard-fought election. I for one, have always enjoyed \na good political contest.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to present a set of principles and \nideals to the people and to hear their choice when they cast their \nvotes.\n  But while we spar in the arena of ideas, let's not forget what we're \nsparring for. The goal is not just to win, but to win because you stand \nfor a cause that will better your countrymen and your country.\n  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand that \nlesson well. It is an honor for me to share this floor with them.\n  I am looking forward to continuing the contest in the time ahead. For \nnow, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and get back to work on behalf \nof the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S246-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I welcome the new Presiding Officer to \nthe Senate. I look forward to working with him as a new Senator. I hope \nhe enjoys his time in the Senate.\n  I am back here again today, as I was yesterday, to talk about the \nMedicare drug benefit. Yesterday I spoke about how the benefit uses \nprescription drug plans and competition--with emphasis upon \ncompetition--to keep costs down for our senior citizens. I spoke about \nhow well that system of competition that is in the prescription drug \nbill has been working for the last 2 years of its operation. Today I \nwant to get to the crux of this debate and a debate that is going to \ntake place a few days from now in this Chamber, the so-called \nprohibition on Government negotiation with drugmakers.\n  Opponents of the Medicare drug benefit have misrepresented what we \ncall the ``noninterference clause'' language. That language doesn't \nprohibit Medicare from negotiation with drugmakers. It prohibits the \nGovernment from interfering in negotiations that are actually taking \nplace.\n  Much of this debate hinges on a convenient lapse of memory that I am \ngoing to emphasize during my remarks about the history of the \nnoninterference clause. So today I want to take my colleagues on a \nlittle trip down memory lane. For our first stop on memory lane, I \nwould like to read something. This is a quote from someone talking \nabout their very own Medicare drug benefit proposal:\n\n       Under this proposal, Medicare would not set prices of \n     drugs. Prices would be determined through negotiations \n     between private benefit administrators and drug \n     manufacturers.\n\n  The person who said this clearly wanted private negotiation with drug \ncompanies for a Medicare benefit, not Government negotiations. The \nperson I quoted was proposing--and I will quote again what he said--\n``negotiations between private benefit administrators and drug \nmanufacturers.'' I don't think that person could be more clear in what \nhe was attempting to accomplish with his proposal.\n  You are going to be shocked to hear who said this. The quote is from \nnone other than President Clinton. President Clinton made that comment \nas part of his June 1999 plan for strengthening and modernizing \nMedicare for the 21st century. President Clinton went on to say that \nunder his plan ``prices would be determined through negotiations \nbetween the private benefit administrators and drug manufacturers.''\n  I quote further:\n\n       The competitive bidding process would be used to yield the \n     best possible drug prices and coverage, just as it is used by \n     large private employers and by the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Plan today.\n\n  President Clinton also described his plan as using private \nnegotiators as opposed to Government negotiators, because ``these \norganizations have experienced managing drug utilization and have \ndeveloped numerous tools of cost containment and utilization \nmanagement.''\n  Does this ring any bells? It should because it is the same framework \nused in today's Part D Medicare prescription drug benefit, private \nnegotiations with drug companies, and it is based on the nearly 50-year \nhistory of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  I would like to refer to another part of Medicare history for \nmemory's sake as well. This is another interesting spot on memory lane \nfor history buffs. The Clinton plan had a coverage gap that we refer to \nin the Senate as the doughnut hole, just like the bill eventually \nsigned into law in 2003.\n  Like many others, the brandnew Speaker of the House has questioned \nwhy one would pay premiums at a point in time when you are not \nreceiving benefits, as is the case with the doughnut hole. Well, that \nis how insurance works. We all know how the insurance industry works. \nGo look at your homeowner and auto policies and Part B Medicare. You \npay premiums to have coverage. That is how President Clinton's plan was \nmeant to work, if it had become law.\n  In Sunday's Washington Post, the new Speaker of the other body, \nPelosi, was quoted about having a doughnut hole. She said:\n\n       How could that be a good idea, unless you are writing a \n     bill for the HMOs and pharmaceutical companies and not for \n     America's seniors?\n\n  Was she referring to President Clinton's plan proposed in 1999? As I \nsaid, he proposed his plan in June of that year. On April 4, 2000, S. \n2342 was introduced in the Senate. S. 2342 would have created a drug \nbenefit administered through private benefit managers. So here again \nwould be private negotiators negotiating with the drug companies to \nsave seniors money on their prescription drugs. Does that sound \nfamiliar? It is just like today's Medicare Program that is law.\n  Here is another important stop down our memory lane. That bill, S. \n2342, introduced in 2000, included language on noninterference:\n\n       Nothing in this section or in this part shall be construed \n     as authorizing the secretary to authorize a particular \n     formulary, or to institute a price structure for benefits, or \n     to otherwise interfere with the competitive nature of \n     providing a prescription drug benefit through benefit \n     managers.\n\n  This is the first bill--the very first one--where the noninterference \nclause appeared. This is the first prohibition in present law on \nGovernment negotiation that was introduced. But S. 2342 wasn't \nintroduced by a Republican; it was introduced by my esteemed colleague, \nthe late Senator Moynihan. One month later, there was a bill, S. 2541, \nintroduced. I will read some of the language that was in that bill. \nThat bill said this; I have it on the chart:\n\n       The secretary may not (1) require a particular formulary, \n     institute a price structure for benefits; (2) interfere in \n     any way with negotiations between private entities and drug \n     manufacturers, and wholesalers; or (3) otherwise interfere \n     with the competitive nature of providing a prescription drug \n     benefit through private entities.\n\n  I will make it clear that this wasn't a Republican bill, either. It \nwas introduced, as you can see, at that time by Senator Daschle, who \nwas joined by 33 other Democrats, including 3 who are still prominent \nin the Senate--Reid, Durbin, and Kennedy. That is right. I want you all \nto know that 33 Senate Democrats cosponsored a bill with a \nnoninterference clause in it. You see, it turns out that the Democrats \ndidn't want the Government--nor did President Clinton--interfering in \nthe private sector negotiations either. They recognized then that the \nprivate sector would do a better job, and they didn't want some \nGovernment bureaucrat messing it up.\n  I will go to another chart. In June 2000, two Democratic bills were \nintroduced in the House of Representatives that also included \nnoninterference language. H.R. 4770 was introduced by then-Democratic \nleader Dick Gephardt. That bill had more than 100 Democrats \ncosponsoring, including the new Speaker of the House--then not \nspeaker--Nancy Pelosi, and Representatives Rangel, Dingell, and Stark. \nRangel, Dingell, and Stark are people whom I have worked closely with \nin Congress recently on a lot of health legislation or tax \nlegislation--or trade legislation, in the case of Congressman Rangel.\n  The prohibition on Government negotiation included in that House bill \nwas almost identical to the language Senator Daschle had in his bill. \nHere is the text of the actual noninterference clause included in the \nbill signed by the President in 2003, present law--what we refer to as \nPart D now:\n\n       Noninterference.--in order to promote competition under \n     this part and in carrying out this part, the secretary (1) \n     may not interfere with the negotiations between drug \n     manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and (2) may \n     not require a particular formulary or institute a price \n     structure for reimbursement of covered part D drugs.\n\n  Well, that sounds a bit like what was sponsored by Democrats over the \nlast several years. Last week, the senior\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nSenator from Illinois described the 2003 Medicare bill--and this was in \na speech on the floor--as being written by the pharmaceutical industry. \nBut the noninterference clause first appeared in legislation introduced \nby Democrats who now oppose the same provision that is in present law.\n  Now, the opponents of the Medicare drug benefit always say that the \nnoninterference clause is proof the present law was written by the drug \nindustry. My question, Mr. President, is this: If that is what they \nwant to think, then did the same pharmaceutical industry write these \nbills that the Democrats introduced in 2000, 2001, and 2002?\n\n  I bet you are wondering how many Democratic bills had the now \ninfamous noninterference clause in it--that is, the prohibition on \nGovernment negotiation. Well, here is the whole timeline. As you can \nsee from chart 4, that prohibition on the Government negotiating, the \nnoninterference clause, has been in seven bills by Democrats between \n1999 and 2003, including a bill introduced in the House on the same \nday, H.R. 1, which eventually became the bill the President signed. \nThere were seven. Here they are. The first is the Moynihan bill, April \n2000; Daschle-Reid bill, May 2000; Eshoo bill, June 2000; Gephardt-\nPelosi-Rangel-Stark-Dingell-Stabenow--when she was in the House and is \nnow a Senator--introduced June 2000. Stark had it in a motion to \nrecommit in June 2000. Senator Wyden from Oregon introduced it as part \nof S. 1185 in July 2001. Thompson of California had it in a House bill \nin June of 2003.\n  It seems to me that on the other side of the aisle there ought to be \nsome consideration of where did Republicans get this idea. I hate to \nsteal ideas from Democrats, but if they work, they work. I spoke \nyesterday about how this provision--or the present way of doing it. The \nFederal Health Employee Benefit Program has been doing it for 50 years, \nand it has been saving senior citizens lots of money, not just on the \nprice of prescription drugs but prescription drugs and premiums and a \nlot of other things--not only saving senior citizens money out of their \nown pockets but saving the taxpayers with a new judgment on what the \ncost of the drug program is going to be that was projected back when it \nwas signed by the President. It is $189 billion less than the \nCongressional Budget Office, the CMS, and the OMB said it would cost.\n  Now, I know what the response will be. It will be that even though \nDemocratic bills had nearly the exact same prohibition on Government \nnegotiation--practically word for word in seven bills over a long \nperiod of time--opponents now think the approach is no longer the best \nfor Medicare. That's sort of like ``we supported it before we opposed \nit.'' Beneficiaries and the public deserve more than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S247-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA'S NCAA FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am here with a big smile on \nmy face, with an orange and blue tie, to recognize the signal \naccomplishment of the University of Florida Fighting Gators, and not \nonly now with the national championship in football, but in the same \nseason, the 2006 season, to have the unusual achievement of having the \nnational champions in basketball as well as football.\n  Throughout the season, this team was challenged time after time and \nwas underrated in the press; yet, they had the heart to win and keep \nfighting. The score of 41 to 14 last night clearly shows who are the \nnational champions.\n  On behalf of our State of Florida, later today, I will be introducing \na resolution commending the University of Florida for being the \nnational champions and urge our colleagues to join in this Senate \nresolution.\n  I will only additionally call to the Senate's attention that with my \ncolleague, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, we engaged in a friendly wager. This \nis not like the normal wager that years ago, when a Florida team was \nplaying a California team and the junior Senator from California, \nSenator Boxer, and I entered into a friendly wager of a crate of \noranges versus a barrel of California almonds--and our office enjoyed \nthose almonds for several months. No, this was a different kind. This \nwas a wager with Senator Brown of Ohio that the losing team's Senator \nwould do the number of military pushups equivalent to the score of the \ngame in public in front of the cameras. So with a score of 41 to 14, \nthat is 55 pushups. I will even extend the olive branch to Senator \nBrown that if he doesn't want to do all of them, I will do part of them \nwith him. But it is a great day for college football, and it is \ncertainly a great day for the State of Florida and for the University \nof Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S247-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STAR PRINT--S. 21\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, this morning and in the days leading up to \ntoday, we have seen and heard a great deal of discussion, particularly \nby the media, describing the issue of the President's speech tomorrow \nevening and all of the discussion in the political system as a \npolitical tug of war about Iraq. It is not that. This is not a \npolitical tug of war. It is a serious moment for this country to try to \nevaluate what to do about something that overlays almost everything \nelse we are considering these days; that is, the current war in Iraq. \nWhat do we do about what is happening there? It is about the lives of \nour soldiers. It is about our country's future. It is about how to make \nchange in Iraq, how to create the kind of change that will give us the \nopportunity to do the right thing.\n  I intend to listen carefully to what the President says in his speech \nto the nation tomorrow night. I am not going to prejudge what he says, \nbut let me suggest what I think the President has to answer for us, for \nme, for the American people.\n  There is considerable discussion about the fact that the President \nwill likely call for a surge or an increase in American troops going to \nIraq. There is also discussion that perhaps he will call for additional \nfunds that would be sent to Iraq for reconstruction or other things \nAmericans would contribute.\n  One point the President will have to explain is the testimony that \nwas given less than 2 months ago before the Senate by General Abizaid, \nthe top military commander in Iraq. I am talking about the top military \ncommander of American troops in Iraq. Here is what General Abizaid said \nin November, less than 2 months ago. He said:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     corps commander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, ``In your professional opinion, if we were to bring \n     in more American troops now, does that add considerably to \n     our ability to achieve success in Iraq?'' And they all said \n     no. The reason is because we want the Iraqis to do more. It \n     is easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  This is testimony before a congressional committee of the top U.S. \nmilitary commander in Iraq saying he has asked all of his top \ncommanders, if we were to bring in more American troops now, does it \nadd considerably to our\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nability to achieve success in Iraq. He said:\n\n       They all said no.\n\n  That is something I believe has to be reconciled. Has that changed? \nHas something changed in 2 months?\n  With respect to the amount of money that is sent to the country of \nIraq, I observe this: This country has spent hundreds of billions of \ndollars on the Iraq war. Between Iraq and Afghanistan, we are now \napproaching $400 billion. We appropriated separately roughly a $20 \nbillion pot of money for reconstruction in Iraq. That is in addition to \nthe reconstruction which has been done by American soldiers. That $20-\nplus billion was pushed out the door--a massive amount of money--in a \nshort time.\n  I held a good number of hearings as chairman of the Democratic Policy \nCommittee on that issue: contracting in Iraq. I think it is the most \nsignificant amount of waste, fraud, and abuse this country has ever \nseen. Let me show one poster that describes a part of it, which was \nshown at our hearing and we discussed this:\n\n       A $243 million program led by the United States Army Corps \n     of Engineers to build 150 health care clinics in Iraq has, in \n     some cases, produced little more than empty shells of \n     crumbling concrete and shattered bricks cemented together \n     into uneven walls.\n\n  A company called the Parsons Corporation got this money. They were to \nrehabilitate, I believe, 142 health clinics in the country of Iraq. \nTwenty were done, and the rest didn't happen at all. The money was \nspent. All the money is gone. The American taxpayers found that all \ntheir money was gone, but the fact is that the health clinics were not \nrehabilitated.\n  There was a doctor, a physician from Iraq, who testified. He said: I \nwent to the Health Minister of the new Government of Iraq. I said: I \nwant to see these health clinics that were supposed to have been \nrehabilitated for which some $200 million was appropriated by the U.S. \ntaxpayers, by the U.S. Government. I want to see these health clinics.\n  He said the Health Minister of the new Government of Iraq said: You \ndon't understand, they don't exist. They are imaginary clinics.\n  Well, our money is gone. This is an example of the waste, fraud, and \nabuse in contracting.\n  The Halliburton corporation, Custer Battles corporation--it is \nunbelievable--the stories. This photo shows some American officials \nwith $100 bills wrapped in Saran Wrap the size of a big brick. This \nfellow testified at a hearing I held, this man in the white shirt. He \nsaid: Look, we told contractors in Iraq: Bring a bag, we pay cash. He \nsaid it was like the Wild West: Bring a sack, we pay cash.\n  This $2 million in $100 dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap actually \nwent to Custer Battles corporation. Custer Battles corporation got over \n$100 million in contracts. Among other things, it is alleged they took \nforklift trucks from the Baghdad Airport, took them over to a \nwarehouse, repainted them, and then sold them to the Coalition \nProvisional Authority, which was us. It is a criminal action at this \npoint.\n  My point is this: Whatever we do in Iraq, I want to be effective. We \nowe it to the troops, we owe it to the men and women who wear America's \nuniform.\n  At this point, we have America's troops in the middle of a civil war. \nYes, most of this is sectarian violence. We see the reports. January 7: \n30 dead in Baghdad, bodies hang from lampposts. The Government said \nSaturday that 72 bodies were recovered around the city, most showing \nsigns of torture. We see these day after day after day. Our heart \nbreaks for the innocent victims of this war. The question for us now \nis, Should American troops be in the middle of that civil war? Should \nwe send additional troops to that circumstance? If so, for what \npurpose? And if so, why do we do it less than 2 months after General \nAbizaid said the commanders do not believe additional troops will be \neffective?\n  We have done what is called a surge in Baghdad starting last July. I \nbelieve it was somewhere around 15,000 additional troops were sent to \nBaghdad. The fact is, the violence increased, more soldiers died.\n  I am going to listen to President Bush's speech. This ought not and I \nhope will not and should not be political. It is about all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, the President and the Congress working \ntogether to find a way for the right solution for this country to \nsupport our soldiers, make the right judgments for them, make the right \njudgments for our country's long-term interests.\n  Yes, we have a fight against terrorism that we must wage, and we must \ndo it aggressively, but most of what is going on in Iraq at this point \nis sectarian violence, and it is, in fact, a civil war. The question \nis, What do we do now?\n  It seems to me that if we are going to keep American troops in Iraq \nfor any length of time, we ought to consider partitioning so at least \nwe separate the combatants and the sectarian violence. It only seems to \nme, in a civil war, that works. But I will listen intently tomorrow \nwith my colleagues to hear what the President's new plan is. I hope we \ncan work together in a way that begins to do what is in the best \ninterest of this country. I am very skeptical about this issue of \ndeciding that we are going to surge additional troops into Iraq, even \nas the top military commanders in Iraq say that should not be done.\n  I mentioned Iraq first because it overwhelms most of the other agenda \nhere, but there are so many other issues with which we must deal. Let's \ndeal with Iraq and get that right, support our troops, do what is \nnecessary, do what is best for our country. Let's work together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, let's work together, the President and the \nCongress, and find the right solution and do what is right for our \nfuture. Then let's turn to other issues.\n  How about energy? It is interesting, we are held hostage by foreign \noil. Over 60 percent of the oil that runs the American economy comes \nfrom off our shores. When we talk about energy independence, we need \nenergy independence, and I support fossil fuels. We are going to use \noil, coal, and natural gas. We always have and we always will, and I \nsupport that. But let me say this: In 1916, this Congress put in place \ntax incentives for the production of oil, long-term, robust, permanent \ntax incentives to incentivize the additional production of oil.\n  Think how different it is with what we have done with renewable \nenergy. We decided about 20 years ago to give some tax incentives to \nincentivize renewable energy development, but they were temporary, \nshort term. The production tax credit for the production of wind and \nother renewable energy has been extended five times because it has been \nshort term. It has been allowed to expire three times. That is not a \ncommitment to this country. This is not a commitment to renewable \nenergy. This is not a commitment to energy independence. The fact is, \nwe are just babystepping our away along in all these areas. We didn't \ndo that with oil. We made a robust, long-term commitment in 1916, and \nit remains today, that said: Let's produce. How about doing the same \nthing for renewable energy? Yes, the biofuels, but also wind energy and \nhydrogen fuel cells and all the other ways that can make us more secure \nfrom an energy standpoint. Let's stop babystepping. Let's have a 10-\nyear plan. We cannot do this with a 1-year plan or a 2-year plan. We \nneed to deal with that issue.\n  We need to deal with the issue of health care costs. I wanted to, but \nI don't have the time this morning, to respond to my colleague from \nIowa who twice has come to the floor to talk about why our Government \nshouldn't be allowed to negotiate drug prices in the Medicare Program. \nIt is preposterous that we have a provision in law that prevents the \nFederal Government from negotiating lower drug prices, especially \nbecause our consumers in this country pay the highest prices for \nprescription drugs in the world, and that is unfair. I relish that \ndebate, and I wait for that debate.\n  Jobs and trade--the fact is, we have lots of issues we need to sink \nour teeth into. I am going to come back and speak about many of these \nissues at great length. First, we have to deal with this situation in \nIraq. That is very important. That is about the lives of men and women \nwho wear America's uniform. But it is more than that as well. It is \nabout what we are doing around the world. It is about, yes, our lives \nand our treasure, and we need to get that right.\n  I mentioned when I started that I think the press, if one listens to \nall the\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\nprograms, tend to portray this as a political tug of war. It is deadly \nserious, much more serious than a political tug of war. It is about \ntrying to get this right for our country's future.\n  I hope that in the coming several weeks, we can come to a conclusion \nabout this very important issue--yes, the war in Iraq, the larger war \non terrorism, deal with some of these issues, such as homeland \nsecurity--and then move on to begin to address the issues I just talked \nabout as well; that is, the issue of energy security, health care \ncosts, jobs, trade, and a series of issues that are important for this \ncountry's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \ngiven 10 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this morning I rise to discuss the \nterrible situation we see in Iraq. While home in New Jersey over these \nlast few days, I was often approached by constituents on the street and \nthere was one topic that would come into the conversation almost \nimmediately, when people said: Senator, when are we going to get our \ntroops out of the crossfire in Iraq?\n  It is a great question, but the answer is certainly not clear.\n  Our constituents back home understand that President Bush has totally \nmishandled the diplomatic and strategic parts of the Iraq mission and \nour troops are the ones who are caught in the middle--caught in the \nmiddle of an ethnic civil war between Sunnis and Shiites. From my home \nState of New Jersey, we have already lost 74 people in Iraq; nationwide \nthe total is quite clear--over 3,000 have lost their lives, and there \nare over 23,000 wounded with injuries that could disable them for the \nrest of their lives.\n  To make matters worse, a disproportionate amount of the burden of \nthis conflict has fallen to Guard and Reserve troops. In fact, in early \n2005, the National Guard and the Reserves made up nearly half of the \nfighting force in Iraq, people who were to be called up when \nemergencies arose. The Reserves were not there primarily to be a \nreplacement for long-term combat duty. This administration decided \nearly on that their agenda for the military was to shrink the size of \nour Active Forces. We all heard that. ``We will get it down to being \nlean and mean, and increase reliance on contractors for support.'' If \nit were not so tragic, it would be a joke.\n  Now we see, in practice, the Bush long-term military plan has been a \ndisaster. We do not have enough active troops. We are relying way too \nmuch on the Guard and Reserve. And contractors such as Halliburton have \nbeen wasting taxpayer dollars right and left.\n  The proof of this waste was a fine, levied against Halliburton, of \n$60 million at one time for overcharges for the care and feeding of our \ntroops. We continue to hear of irresponsible behavior of contractors \nserving our needs in Iraq. Mismanagement of all forms has been a \nhallmark of Defense Department supervision.\n  At every turn, this President has made terrible judgments. Tomorrow \nwe are going to hear another decision by President Bush. Why should the \nAmerican people trust him to understand what he is getting us into? We \nheard the President say, ``Bring 'em on,'' one of the most disingenuous \nstatements ever made by a President. I served in Europe during World \nWar II, and I can tell you that we never wanted to hear a Commander in \nChief taunting the enemy from the comforts of the White House. Asking \nmore of the enemy to show their faces? We didn't want to see them at \nall.\n  We saw the President's foolish display of bravado on the Aircraft \nCarrier Abraham Lincoln when he declared, ``Mission accomplished.'' \nWhat a careless statement the President of the United States made that \nday, over 3\\1/2\\ years ago. Mission accomplished? That meant the job \nwas finished, as far as most people were concerned. But it was not \nthrough.\n  While the President was performing in 2003, leaders were warning of a \nmilitary crisis. General Shinseki, Army Chief of Staff, told a Senate \nArmed Services Committee that we would need to keep a large force in \nIraq even after a war to curb ethnic tensions and provide humanitarian \naid. General Shinseki, distinguished military leader, said we needed \nseveral hundred thousand troops there. His assessment was harshly \ndismissed quickly by the President and by Secretary Rumsfeld. The \nGeneral's reality-based opinion got in the way of their ideologically \nbased mission of a smaller Active-Duty Force.\n  In the aftermath of the initial invasion, President Bush has made the \nwrong move almost every time. Now we have walked so deep into the swamp \nin Iraq that just adding more guns is not going to work. This so-called \nsurge is another bad idea--slogans, such as ``cut and run'' have to be \nmatched against the reality of ``stay and die.''\n  President Bush likes to say: I do what the generals tell me to. But \nnow we know that is not the case. The generals have been extremely \ncandid about their view of the surge idea. They think it is wrong. Now \nwe are hearing that the President intends to give another $1 billion to \nIraqi reconstruction projects. We want to fund every cent that our \ntroops need for their safety, for their return, for their health care, \nfor their well-being, but sending more money down the rat hole is not \ngoing to do it. It is being diverted from programs at home, such as \neducation, stem cell research, health care for all our people, to name \na few, and the taxpayers of New Jersey do not want their money used to \nbuild another civilian project in Iraq that is going to get blown up \nthe next day. Before we look to spend more money on civil projects in \nIraq, let's get the diplomatic situation straightened out.\n  The American people want to see us leave Iraq with some hope for \nstability in our absence. That will require President Bush to use all \nof the diplomatic tools at his disposal to force a dramatic change of \ncourse for the Iraqi Government. The current Government in Iraq has to \ntake real steps to disarm the Shiite militias and show the Sunnis that \nthey will actually be empowered in the Iraqi Government. If we do not \ndo that, we could send a million troops to Iraq tomorrow, but it would \nnot make a difference. If the Sunnis feel the Iraqi Government has \nnothing to offer and Prime Minister al-Maliki doesn't stop the Shiite \nmilitias, the bloodbath will continue.\n  I hope the leaks about the President's plan are wrong and that he \nwill announce tomorrow a better course, a course that will allow us to \nexit Iraq but with real hope of a more stable society left behind.\n  I conclude that with the history of planning for this war and the \nstatements coming from the White House and the leadership of the \nDefense Department I ask: How can we trust their judgment with a new \nplan to put more people in harm's way without some idea of when this \nwill end? It is not a good idea and we ought to get a better \nexplanation from the President and the Defense Department as to what \nmight the outcome be if their plan succeeds.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S249-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S249-S250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is now closed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Oxford English Dictionary defines the \nword ``surge''--s-u-r-g-e--as ``a sudden large temporary increase.'' \nNote in particular the word ``temporary.'' President Bush's rumored new \nstrategy on Iraq--a surge of U.S. troops intended to quell the violence \nin Baghdad--is both wrongheaded and headed for failure.\n  As outlined, the surge envisions clearing all violent factions out of \nBaghdad in an effort which is to be led by Iraqi security forces. \nApparently, U.S. forces will provide indiscriminate firepower in \nanother attempt to establish democracy by brute force. This does not \nseem to me to be the way to win hearts and minds in Iraq.\n  I oppose any surge in Iraq. Only days ago, just days ago, we passed \nthe grim milestone of 3,000 American dead in Iraq. There are few firm \nnumbers on Iraqi lives lost, but estimates are in the tens of \nthousands. I am reminded of one definition of ``insanity'': making the \nsame mistake over and over while continuing to expect a different \nresult. We have surged before. Still the violence in Iraq worsens.\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\n  We are close to the beginning of the fifth year--the fifth year--of a \nwar which should never have been started by an administration that fed \nthe Congress and the public false information. This is an \nadministration which has learned nothing--nothing, zilch--nothing more \nabout the country of Iraq than it knew before it launched an unprovoked \nU.S. attack.\n  Our stated purpose for continuing to occupy Iraq is to help the Iraqi \npeople build a stable democracy. But the difficulty of that task should \nhave been clear before we invaded. It was clear to me. Iraq is a \ncountry that was only held together by a brutal strongman, Saddam \nHussein. And without the strongman to force cohesion, it is a country \nwith deep ethnic and religious divisions and no central loyalties. \nThere is no tradition of constitutions or equal rights, no unifying \ncommon beliefs about individual freedoms or governing with the consent \nof the governed--none of that commonality of thought that reinforces \ngoverning principles in the society at large.\n  The al-Maliki Government would never survive on its own outside the \nGreen Zone in Baghdad, and indeed the point of a surge is to secure \nonly the capital. But what then? After accelerating the violence, even \nif we are able to lock down Baghdad, what will transpire to keep the \ninsurgency from regrouping elsewhere, possibly fed by Iran or by Syria? \nHow will we then establish the legitimacy of a shaky Iraqi Government?\n  In my view, we may be about to make a critical mistake by moving in \nexactly the wrong direction in Iraq. Instead of a surge, we ought to be \nlooking at a way to begin orderly troop reduction. The folly of the \nsurge idea is apparent. The insurrection in Iraq is a civil war. The \nconflict is among warring factions battling for some measure of control \nover the others. U.S. involvement on one side simply further energizes \nall the other sides. This surge will only energize them, further \nprovoking a likely countersurge of violence. If it is a true surge--in \nother words, temporary--the insurrection factions will only work harder \nto maim and kill our troops and claim victory if we reduce forces. So, \nin fact, there will probably be no surge but, rather, a permanent \nescalation of the U.S. presence, which is simply being sold to the \nAmerican public as a surge. Once again, we get obfuscation and spin \nfrom a White House that seems incapable of careful thought and \nanalysis.\n  Any plan to increase troops in President Bush's new strategy is \nsimply a plan to intensify violence, put more American troops in harm's \nway, risk the lives of more innocent Iraqis, engender more hatred of \nU.S. forces, and embroil U.S. forces deeper in a civil war.\n  I would like to see a clear defining--a clear defining--of our \nimmediate challenges in Iraq; a realistic discussion about short-term \nachievable goals; an admission that we cannot remain in Iraq for much \nlonger because the American public will not tolerate it; and benchmarks \nfor beginning an orderly withdrawal conditioned on actions by the Iraqi \nGovernment.\n  So, Mr. President, the al-Maliki Government has been duly elected by \nthe people of Iraq. It is time we let them take charge. Let them, Mr. \nPresident. Let them take charge. As long as we prop them up and inflame \nhatred, they will never have the legitimacy they need to make the \npolitical decisions that may ultimately save Iraq. In short, it is time \nto take the training wheels off the bike. Do you know what that means? \nIt is time to take the training wheels off the bike.\n  Our blundering--and it is nothing less--our blundering has inflamed \nand destabilized a critical region of the world, and yet we continue to \nsingle-mindedly pursue the half-baked goal of forcing democracy on a \ncountry which is now embroiled in a civil war. Our blinders keep us \nfrom seeing the regional problems which are bubbling and which soon may \nboil. The real damage to the United States is not only the loss of life \nand the billions of dollars expended, it is also the diminution of our \ncredibility around the world as a country with the will and the vision \nto lead effectively.\n  Serious diplomacy is clearly in order on the matters of Lebanon, the \nIsrael-Palestinian conflict, and on Iran. Multinational talks were part \nof the Iraq Study Group's recommendations, but diplomacy usually ends \nup at the bottom of the administration's option list, and that is where \nit has landed again.\n  If the ``shoot first'' crowd in the White House continues to stick \nits chin out and believe that bullets and bombast will carry the day, \nsoon--very soon--our ability to mediate the morass of difficulties in \nthe Mideast and elsewhere may be permanently damaged. Pariahs do not \nusually carry much weight at negotiating tables. If the lesson in Iraq \nteaches anything, it is that military might has very great limitations. \nBut then that is a lesson we should have learned many years ago from \nVietnam--many years ago from Vietnam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S250-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S250-S257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In the \nlast election, the message was loud and clear: It is time to change the \nway business is done in the Nation's Capitol.

Strong \ncriminal sanctions for these practices will henceforth be in place.\n  Passage of this bill will demonstrate once and for all that we care \nmore about representing the American people than the perks of power.\n  I am especially pleased to be joined in this effort by my new ranking \nmember, Senator Bennett, with whom I look to work very closely in this \nnew Congress. I am also pleased that Senator Lieberman, the new \nchairman of Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Senator \nCollins, the ranking member of that committee, have agreed to join us \non the floor as comanagers of this bill.\n  On March 29, 2006, by a 90-to-8 vote, the Senate passed S. 2349, the \nLegislative Transparency and Accountability Act, which has now been \nintroduced by the majority and minority leaders as S. 1. This \nlegislation was a combination of separate bills reported by the Rules \nCommittee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \nIt came to the floor early last year, at a time when Americans were \nbecoming increasingly concerned about corrupt and criminal practices by \na group of lobbyists, administration officials, congressional staff \nand, yes, even Members of Congress.\n  Also, various questions were raised about the K Street Project, in \nwhich lobbyist firms, trade associations, and other business groups \nwere told they\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nwould encounter a closed door in Congress unless they hired members of \nthe then majority party.\n  The Senate-passed bill was a strong ethics, earmark and lobbying \nreform package. Unfortunately, the House voted instead to soften the \nprovisions, lift the limits on party expenditures in general elections, \nand regulate 527 groups. A stalemate ensued and no conference report \nwas returned. Now, with a new Congress under Democratic leadership, the \nSenate's first bill, S. 1, is essentially the same text as the Senate-\npassed S. 2349.\n  I believe one message that was very clear in the last election was \nthe need for Congress to immediately take steps to restore the public's \ntrust. I would like to briefly outline the major provisions of the base \nbill and then follow up with some discussion about the improvements \nthat are being considered in a bipartisan leadership substitute.\n  This is now the base bill. It prohibits gifts and travel paid for by \nlobbyists. Section 106 bans all gifts and meals from lobbyists. Section \n107(a) bans travel paid for by lobbyists or in which lobbyists \nparticipate. Section 107(b) requires full disclosure of travel by \nMembers or their staffs on noncommercial airplanes. It closes the \nrevolving door. Section 241 extends the existing lobbying ban for \nformer Members and senior executive branch personnel from 1 to 2 years. \nThat is a consequential change. Sections 108 and 241 toughen the \nexisting lobbying ban for senior staff--those making 75 percent of a \nMember's salary or more--by prohibiting them from lobbying anyone in \nthe Senate, not just their former boss or committee, as is presently \nrequired.\n  Section 109 requires public disclosure by Members of any negotiations \nfor private sector employment.\n  Section 105 strips floor privileges from former Members who become \nregistered lobbyists so that no former Senator can come to the Senate \nfloor to lobby.\n  Section 110 bars immediate family members from lobbying a Member or \nhis or her office, though they could still lobby other offices.\n  Section 103 requires that a sponsor of an earmark be identified with \nthe additional spending requests in the earmark on all bills, \namendments, and conference reports.\n  Section 104 requires conference reports, including the sponsors of \nearmarks in these reports, be posted on the Internet at least 48 hours \nbefore a vote unless the Senate determines by a majority vote that it \nis urgent to proceed to the legislation. So there is a hiatus in which \nnames of sponsors will be published on the Internet for at least 48 \nhours.\n  Section 102 subjects any out-of-scope matter added by a conference \nreport to a 60-vote point of order. What does ``out of scope'' mean? It \nmeans a matter not approved by either body of the Congress. If you have \na matter not approved by either body, and you want to bring it up in a \nconference report, you would have to withstand the test of a 60-vote \npoint of order if a Member saw fit to bring that point of order. The \nParliamentarian tells me that would not include earmarks added in \nconference which were not approved by the House or Senate. Members \nshould know that. Earmarks are not included, just out-of-scope issues. \nWe might want to take that into consideration.\n  As I have said before, I strongly believe such earmarks which have \nbeen added without being voted on by the subcommittee, committee, House \nor Senate, should be subject to a 60-vote point of order. I am \ninterested in working with any colleagues on this matter.\n  The provision at issue was based on a stand-alone bill I introduced \nwith Senator Lott last year, but it was changed as it moved forward. \nEven though it may not include earmarks, it is an important provision \nwhich will go a long way toward stopping controversial provisions often \nadded in the dark of night.\n  Transparency in the Senate: Section 111 makes the K Street project--\nthat is, partisan efforts to influence private sector hiring--a \nviolation of Senate rules.\n  Section 232 requires ethics training for members of staff.\n  Section 234 requires the Ethics Committee to issue annual reports on \nits activity--not to name names but to give the public a better idea \nabout how active the committee has been.\n  Section 114 of the bill requires Senators to identify holds they \nplace on legislation. This is an important improvement. All too often, \nimportant legislation has been blocked by an anonymous hold, and nobody \nknows who it is. Here, one person can stop a bill that has been \ndutifully passed out of the committee and passed by the Senate. This \nmeasure does not prevent such holds but requires that the Senator doing \nthis file a public report in the Congressional Record within 3 days.\n  My colleagues from the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee will have much to say about the lobbyist disclosure \nprovisions because they fall within the jurisdiction of their \ncommittee.\n  Let me go into a few major provisions under discussion that would \nlikely come with a substitute amendment. The first is sporting and \nentertainment events. The substitute requires the proper and full \nvaluation of tickets to sporting and entertainment events. No more cut-\nrate tickets to combat the below-market prices being charged Members \nand staff as a way of getting around the gift ban. It would close the \nrevolving door. The substitute prohibits Members from negotiating for \nprivate sector employment that involves lobbying activity while still \nholding office. Senior staff would have to inform the Ethics Committee \nif they enter into negotiations for private sector employment.\n  The substitute will also have a repeal on the current exception to \nthe revolving door lobbying ban for Federal staffers hired by Indian \ntribes, something my office has worked on with Senator Reid.\n  Now, earmarks. Over the last 12 years, the number of earmarks have \ntripled to 16,000, worth $64 billion a year. The process has clearly \ngotten out of control. An important first step is disclosure. The \nsubstitute provides much more vigorous transparency. In the bill \napproved by the Senate last March, an earmark is defined as ``a \nprovision that specifies the identity of a non-Federal entity to \nreceive assistance and the amount of that assistance.'' The term \n``assistance'' means budget authority, contract authority, loan \nauthority, and other expenditures and tax expenditures or other revenue \nitems.\n  In the substitute, earmarks will be defined much more broadly to \ninclude not only non-Federal entities but any provision that benefits \nonly one non-Federal entity even though the original funding is routed \nthrough a Federal agency. This is meant to get at the kind of earmarks \nnotoriously offered by former Representative Cunningham that \neffectively directed funds to a non-Federal entity but did not directly \nname the entity.\n  We will also include targeted tax benefits and targeted tariff \nbenefits in the definition of earmarks.\n  Another section is a provision sponsored by Senators Conrad and \nGregg, chairman and ranking member of the Committee on the Budget. This \namendment requires a Congressional Budget Office score for all \nconference reports before they are considered by the Senate. In \nemergencies, this could be waived by 60 votes.\n  The substitute will express the sense of the Senate on fair and open \nconference committee procedures. What that means is for the majority \nparty not to exclude the minority party from the conference. We \nDemocrats know what this is like. We would like to end that and have \nconferences open for the free discussion of Members of both political \nparties. This is a sensible provision. We should put an end to the \npractice that existed in this last Congress.\n  There will also be a ban on dead-of-night additions to conference \nreports after they have already been signed by Members. I actually \ncouldn't believe this went on, but it does, and we should end it.\n  There are two important areas on which no agreement has been reached. \nOur majority leader had proposed broadening gift reform in S. 1 to \nprohibit gifts not only from lobbyists but also from organizations that \nemploy or retain lobbyists, which makes sense. He had proposed \nbroadening the travel provisions of S. 1 to prohibit travel paid for \nnot only by lobbyists but also by organizations that employ or retain \nlobbyists and prohibit lobbyists' involvement in that travel. I also \nthink that makes sense.\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\n  The minority leadership did not agree on the two proposals, so I now \nexpect to see our majority leader offer an amendment on this \nseparately. I will be pleased to support it.\n  In conclusion, a USA Today Gallup Poll last month said that only 15 \npercent of those polled gave our House high marks for honesty. That was \ndown from 25 percent in 2001 when Members got their best score since \n1976. When one looks at the scandals that were exposed last year, that \nis not surprising. The ties between lobbyists and lawmakers must be \nbroken. Yes, the public has a constitutional right to petition \nCongress, but that right should not be limited to those who seek any \nspecial access.\n  The 2006 election saw the largest congressional shift since 1994. \nEven with the war on Iraq on voters' minds, polls showed Americans more \nconcerned about ethics in government. The stakes are high. It is \nimperative we act. We have a vehicle to do so before the Senate. I hope \nwe will.\n  I yield to the distinguished ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee for her careful and cogent explanation of what is in the \nbill. I am happy to be an original cosponsor of S. 1. I will be a \ncosponsor of the substitute that will be provided under her leadership \nalong with Senator Reid and Senator McConnell.\n  I agree with her and with most others that we need to move ahead on \nthis issue. We need to let the American people know we are paying \nattention to the ethics questions as they relate to lobbying and to our \nown internal activities.\n  Her discussion of earmarks has very little to do with the way \nlobbyists operate but with the way the Congress operates. Lobbyists \nreact to what we do. They are paid to pay attention to what we do and \nthen shift and adjust their activities to match what is going on in the \nCongress. Many of the problems we have seen arise in the last dozen \nyears have come from changes within Congress, changes in procedures--\nnot formal changes but evolutionary changes--that have come along as \nCongress has reacted to the pressures we face.\n  My first experience in this town was as a teenager, as an intern. I \nsuppose there is something wrong with me because I was enough of a \npolitical junky that I used to sit in the gallery at night when I could \nhave gone home and listen to the debate in the Senate. I would amuse \nmyself in the daytime by reading the Congressional Record. I am not \nsure how many people would do that today.\n  In those days, debate in the Senate was real debate. Senators would \ncome to the Senate, go back and forth with each other. Things were \ndifferent. The way things moved through committees was different. It \nwas a much more leisurely and orderly process.\n  I have seen, in the 14 years I have been in the Senate, the process \nspeed up to the point that even the kind of cursory examination we \nwould give to legislation 14 years ago has gone by the boards.\n  I have been part of the process of creating the omnibus \nappropriations bill, which is probably the worst possible way to \nlegislate. Yet under the pressures we found ourselves confronted with \nit was the only way to get appropriations bills completed.\n  I have watched as the authorizing process has gradually but \ninexorably broken down as authorizers now come to appropriators and \nsay: We can't get this through our committee for a variety of reasons. \nWould you add it to the appropriations bill? The appropriations bill is \npicked because it is the only bill that has to pass. We have to fund \nthe Government.\n  I remember a Congress when Secretary Babbitt had a vital problem \nrelating to his department and to my State. We talked it through. Then \nhe said: Senator, see if you can get it on the CR, the continuing \nresolution. There was no opportunity for passage of that particular \nitem. Here is a Cabinet officer, representing President Clinton, \ntalking to a Republican Senator, representing the people of Utah, and \nthe advice is: See if you can put it on the CR.\n  Obviously, the process of orderly authorization, oversight, \nexamination, and then appropriations which is laid down in our rules \nhas broken down under the pressure. It was in that crucible where \npeople such as Duke Cunningham would step forward and say: We are going \nto take advantage of this broken process to our own personal advantage.\n  Now, understand, Duke Cunningham is in jail. Understand, Jack \nAbramoff, the lobbyist who saw the opportunity of exploiting this \nbreakdown, is in jail. The laws, the rules, the ethics that currently \nexist, gave rise in this present circumstance to a comment someone \nmade. He said: You folks in the Congress are the only people I know \nwho, when someone breaks the rules, decide the thing to do is to change \nthe rules.\n  There is some sense that perhaps we are overreacting to the scandals \nof Abramoff and Cunningham. I do not believe that S. 1 is an \noverreaction, nor do I believe is the substitute offered by Senators \nReid and McConnell, of which I and I am assuming the chairman of the \ncommittee are original cosponsors. But as the debate goes forward, \nthere might be a temptation to overreact in some of the amendments that \nwill be offered to this bill and to the substitute. So I want to make a \nfew points about the whole process of lobbying.\n  Again, a little personal history: Back in the 1960s, I was a \nlobbyist. I have said my timing was terrible because when I went to \nwork as a lobbyist, lobbyists were not paid as much as Members. Today \nit seems to be the other way around.\n  I remember belonging to a group that very creatively called itself \nthe Breakfast Group because we met for breakfast once a month. It \nconsisted of all of the lobbyists of Fortune 500 companies in \nWashington at the time. We would meet at the Chamber of Commerce where \nthe staffer from the Chamber of Commerce would brief us on their \nattitudes toward our issues. He left the chamber to set up an office \nfor a Fortune 500 company and wanted to join the group as one of our \nmembers. We voted him in, and then we voted the membership closed \nbecause we said if we get too many more, it will be too big. There were \n20 members. There were 20 people who were representatives of Fortune \n500 companies at the time.\n  Mr. President, this is an old document I hold in my hand from 2000, \nso it is 6 years old. It includes the names of all of the lobbyists who \nare currently in Washington. That little group of 20 has grown somewhat \nin the 40 years from then till now. But as you look through this list, \none thing becomes clear that I think a lot of people do not understand \nwith respect to the legislation we are considering. By virtue of all of \nthe people who have now entered this kind of activity, virtually every \nsingle American is represented by a lobbyist. Every single American has \nsomeone lobbying in behalf of his or her interests, whether he or she \nknows it or not.\n  I just dipped into this document, turned open some pages, at complete \nrandom, to see who are the lobbyists and what are they here for. Here \non page 473, we have the Legal Action Center for the City of New York: \nA not-for-profit law and policy organization fighting discrimination \nagainst people with substance abuse problems, people with HIV/AIDS, and \npeople with criminal records. So people who have substance abuse \nproblems, HIV/AIDS, and criminal records have a lobbyist.\n  Here is the Learning Disabilities Association. Here is the Lawyers \nAlliance for World Security: A national, non-partisan membership \norganization of legal professionals dedicated to stopping unrestrained \nweapons proliferation and bringing the rule of law to the newly \nindependent nations of the former Soviet Union. So if you are against \nnuclear proliferation, you have a lobbyist.\n  The League of Conservation Voters: A national, non-partisan arm of \nthe environmental movement, works to elect pro-environmental candidates \nto Congress, publishes annual ratings of Congress, and so on.\n  OK. Flipping ahead, we have the National Association of Schools of \nDance: Accreditation of post-secondary educational programs in dance--\nthey have a lobbyist--along with the National Association of State \nUnits on Aging: A\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nnational, non-profit public-interest organization dedicated to \nproviding general and specialized information, technical assistance, \nand professional development support to State units on aging.\n  And I went a little deeper away from national associations. We have, \non page 636 the Solar Energy Research and Education Foundation: An \neducational organization developing a museum in Washington featuring \ninteractive CD-ROM-based computer technology. And next to that is the \nSolid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County and across the page, the \nOffice of the Attorney General of the State of South Dakota.\n  Every American is represented in one form or another by a lobbyist. \nSo we must be careful as we deal with the perception that comes out of \nperhaps televisionland that all lobbyists are corrupt, all lobbyists \noperate with shady activities, with under-the-table money.\n  If we decide that is, in fact, what we are dealing with and clamp \ndown in such a way so hard as to get in the way of the National \nAssociation of Schools of Dance, we will do damage to the \nconstitutional right--right there in the first amendment, next to \nfreedom of religion and freedom of speech--the constitutional right to \nlobby. They did not call it that in the 18th century. They said the \nright to petition the Government for redress of your grievances because \nthe Capitol had not been built and a lobby had not been created. But \nthe word came out of people exercising their rights. We must respect \nthat. We must recognize we have to do this very carefully. And we must \nrecognize that internal reform, disclosure of earmarks, activities with \nrespect to conference reports, cleaning up our own act of how we handle \nlegislation is an important part of seeing to it that the process is \nproper.\n  As I said at the outset, I do not believe S. 1 is an overreaction. I \ndo not believe the amendment in the nature of a substitute is an \noverreaction. I am happy to be an original cosponsor of both. And I \nsalute the majority leader in his determination to start out with this \nissue because it is an issue on which we can reach broad bipartisan \nagreement. It is an issue that can send the message to the voters that, \nyes, we recognize that, however it has evolved, the rules do need to be \nchanged. Even though the people who broke the old rules were caught \nunder the old rules, convicted under the old rules, and sent to prison \nunder the old rules, we need to be looking ahead and recognize that in \na world where virtually everyone is involved, in one way or another, we \nneed to do this right.\n  So I am happy to be a part of this debate, and I appreciate the \nleadership we are receiving from the majority leader and from the \nchairman of the committee.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking \nmember for his excellent comments, and I have learned something about \nhis life which I found very interesting. I did not know he had started \nhis distinguished career as a lobbyist, and I clearly saw the growth of \nthat institution in the book the Senator held up. I thank the Senator \nvery much for his comments. I look forward to working with him in the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask all Members, beginning this \nafternoon, to please come and file your amendments. We are eager to \nhave them. In the unanimous consent agreement, the Senator from Montana \nis next, Mr. Tester. However, I do not see him on the Senate floor. So \nlet me say this: The way we will run this is by doing a unanimous \nconsent agreement and trying to line up speakers, if that is agreeable \nwith the ranking member. If people are not here, they will lose their \nplace in line.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator, is that agreeable to the ranking \nmember?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, Mr. President, that will be agreeable to me, with \nthe understanding that if the Senator does show up, then they will go \nin the queue wherever they can fit.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  I see the Senator from Montana just emerging for his first appearance \nbefore this body, and he is therefore recognized for--I have 10 minutes \ndown.\n  I ask the Senator, would you require 10 minutes or 15 minutes because \nwe will give the same amount to the distinguished Senator Lott?\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I say to Senator Feinstein, 10 minutes \nwill be more than adequate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Fine. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of time to \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is a great honor for me to be before you today in this Chamber as \na Senator representing the great State of Montana.\n  It is the genius of American democracy that a third-generation family \nfarmer from Big Sandy, MT, can serve in the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. We have a great opportunity with great \nresponsibility. Americans are not enamored by ideology or political \nparty. I ran for the U.S. Senate because I wanted to make Government \nwork for the American people once again.\n  Montanans stood by me to demand change. We are here today because the \nAmerican people want their Government to work. Today, we can show the \nAmerican people that their Government does work by enacting genuine \nethics reform, to ensure a Government that is transparent and open.\n  As I met with the folks across the State of Montana, I heard over and \nover again about the loss of faith in our Government and our elected \nofficials. Scandals and questionable behavior have brought a shadow \nover this institution. But today the Sun is rising again.\n  The leadership of Senator Reid and the addition of the Feingold-Obama \nethics reforms are a giant step forward in restoring the public's faith \nin their Government and public officials. The ``for sale'' sign on \nCongress will be taken down, and the pay-to-play practices of past \nMembers will finally come to an end. These bills shine a spotlight on \nhow Members operate in Washington to ensure that the people's business \nrather than the special interests' business is being done.\n  In Montana, we believe in working together with our neighbors to find \nsolutions to our problems. And in our Nation, the American people are \nlooking for all of us to represent them, the people, those hard-working \nfamilies trying to make ends meet.\n  The best way to work for the American people is to ensure that they \ncannot only see what is happening in their Government but that they can \ntake part in their Government. It is time for transparency, time for \nworking families, small businesses and family farmers and ranchers to \nnot only be heard but to be represented and empowered in this body and \nin the Halls of our Nation's Capitol.\n  No more currying favor with Members of Congress and staff by high-\npowered lobbyists through free court-side tickets or all-expense-paid \ntravel to exotic destinations. No more slipping in special interest \nprovisions in bills already signed, sealed, and all but delivered. No \nmore floor privileges and Member gym privileges for former Members \nlobbying on behalf of their clients. No more so-called K Street \nprojects in which Members force lobbying firms to hire staffers from a \ncertain party or lose the Member's support for their clients' projects.\n  Montanans and Americans simply deserve better from their Government \nand elected representatives. Montanans and Americans deserve a \ngovernment that is working hard for their interests, not the big-\nmoneyed special interests. All of these special privileges and \nactivities get in the way of making real changes that will improve the \nlives of hard-working and honest American and Montana families.\n  I want to do the job the people of Montana have hired me to do, and \nthis ethics package gives me the tools to do just that. I am proud and \nhonored to join with my colleagues in support of change that will bring \nsunshine to the process of government and allow for transparency.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise again, for the second\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\nyear in a row, in support of the Legislative Transparency and \nAccountability Act of 2007. It was my pleasure, last year, as the \nchairman of the Rules Committee, to work with my colleague on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, Chris Dodd, and in fact, the entire \ncommittee in a bipartisan way to produce this legislation from the \nRules Committee.\n  Then we brought it to the floor. We had an open process. We had lots \nof amendments offered. At some point it was the will of the Senate we \nbring debate it to a close, and we produced legislation because there \nis a need for ethics and lobby reform. I have been an aggressive \nsupporter of many of the provisions that have been already mentioned \ntoday and that are included in this bill.\n  So I want to make it clear that last year the Senate passed this \nlegislation, with significant improvements or changes in the law with \nregard to the rules of the Senate, ethics, and lobbying reform, and \nmoved it into the process of being in conference with the \nHouse. Unfortunately, it was not concluded.\n\n  I do have a long history in this area, going back to when I was in \nthe House in the 1970s, and when we passed some gift reform in the \n1980s. And here we are again. I don't back away from having in the past \nsupported some changes. And having done it last year and again this \nyear, I think we should move forward in this area. But I must say, I am \ndelighted to yield the leadership role on this issue to the \ndistinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein. She is now the \nincoming chairman of the Committee on Rules managing this legislation \nin place of Chris Dodd of Connecticut who did such a good job last \nyear, and my colleague from the great State of Utah, Senator Bennett. \nThese two people will work together. They will do a credible job. They \nwill aggressively support responsible changes in the ethics rules and \nlobbying laws of this country. However, I believe they will have the \ncourage to say to us sometimes: Wait a minute, what does this mean? \nWhat are we doing to ourselves, the institution, and the job we do?\n  I have been in Congress 34 years. I know when changes need to be \nmade. I also know sometimes when we are about to put a gun to our head \nand pull the trigger. Let's do this in a responsible, nonpartisan way \nthat is good for the institution and good for America. But, please, \nlet's not turn it into feckless positioning to make it look good when, \nin fact, the result could be very counterproductive. I hope we will not \ndo that. I don't question anybody's motives. We all have perspectives \nwe have to think about.\n  Take, for instance, the issue of earmarks. We all have views on that. \nIn some areas it is called pork. I have said many times that earmarks \nare pork when they are north of Memphis, TN.\n  I am from one of the poorest States in the Nation. I am not going to \ngive up the right, the opportunity to get some help for some of the \npoorest people in America when the bureaucracy won't do it.\n  I have a little old town in Mississippi, Tchula, MS, with an African-\nAmerican woman, Republican mayor, where they have to haul water to \ntheir houses for drinking. That is in America today. It is unbelievable \nthat in 2006, you have people who don't have safe drinking water in \nthis country. We passed the safe drinking water legislation in 1996. \nYet it still doesn't seem to filter down to the poorest of the poor \nsometimes. I tried for years to get HUD to help this little town that \nsits in a saucer that floods every year.\n  I said: Please help us move these people onto higher ground, get them \nout of their snake-infested, annually flooded houses; help us get them \nwater and sewers; help us get them decent housing; help us get them a \ncommunity center, a police station. Just help them.\n  I never got a nickel. So my colleague Senator Cochran and I started \nearmarking funds for this little town. It wasn't big. It was a \nrelatively small amount of money. But if we cannot, as Senators or \nCongressmen from a district or a State, whether it is Montana, \nMinnesota or Mississippi, step up sometimes where legislation has not \ndone the job, or where the bureaucracy has not done its job, and fix \nthe problem, then we are not fulfilling our Constitutional obligations \nto the citizens of our states. Sometimes I know more about the need for \na transportation project than some bureaucrat at the Department of \nTransportation. I am not going to give up what I consider a \nConstitutional right, and that is the right to shape how federal money \nis spent.\n  However, has earmarking gotten out of control? Yes. Has it been \ngrowing like topsy over the years under Democrats and Republican? Yes.\n  Some people say: You shouldn't get an appropriation unless it has \nbeen authorized. Do you know why we started getting appropriations for \nprojects that weren't authorized? Because we quit authorizing. The \nSenate got in a situation in recent years--and it goes back to both \nRepublicans and Democrats; we share the blame on this--where we quit \ngetting bills done. How many bills lie dormant at this desk because \nthere is a hold by a fellow Republican or a Democrat against a fellow \nDemocrat? If you wait until you get authorization, such as a water \nresources bill, before you get the appropriation, you may never get it. \nThat forced a lot of what has happened.\n  I am a firm believer in sunshine. Disclose it. That is the best \nantiseptic. I am not ashamed of what I do. If I am going to be \nembarrassed if it is made public, I won't do it. Of course, there is \none danger. The more we publicize what we are doing, there may be more \nand more pressure on us to do more. Somebody is going to have to \nexplain on the Appropriations Committee why Senator X gets an earmark \nand Senator Y doesn't. So we may be, again, creating growth in this \nprocess. But I think we should disclose it. I don't have any problem \nwith identifying earmarks, explanations of earmarks. There is no amount \nof disclosure you can come up with that I wouldn't think is OK.\n  I also--and Senator Feinstein knows this--have developed a real \nconcern about what has been going on now and growing for a number of \nyears where things are added in conference at the last minute that were \nnot considered by, or included in, either the House or the Senate bill. \nThat unnerves me. By the way, it is not just appropriations; it is \nauthorizations, and it is tax bills.\n  The one incident that alarmed me actually involved a tax bill. \nBecause if you are a conferee in the last minute of conference some \nnight at 10 o'clock and you can change a phrase in a tax bill that can \nmean billions for a particular sector of the economy, that is very \ndangerous. But it happens.\n  I know it is difficult to write exact language to deal with the \nproblem of last minute inserts in conference reports. I drafted such \nlanguage that I believe will be workable. I welcome these new leaders \nof the Rules Committee and recommend they review closely the language I \nhave drafted that addresses this issue and I believe will not create a \ntremendous problem for the leadership.\n\n  Harry Reid is going to be standing here one day trying to wrap up a \nsession on a major bill and if we create point of order authority on \nanything that is added in conference without some limits on it, he \ncould be hit with a series of points of order, one after the other \nafter the other. Then how do you complete the conference report? The \nleadership has to worry about that on both sides of the aisle.\n  I think we could do more on these earmarks. My colleague from \nMississippi Senator Cochran has been chairman of Appropriations, as \nwell as the ranking member. I am going to make sure I work closely with \nhim on how we do this. But we need to do more.\n  I believe this legislation we have before us is a good effort. Some \npeople say it is not good enough. Look, if we start trying to satisfy \ncertain media people, certain ethics groups, there is no limit. We will \nall be living in robes in the Russell courtyard with no access to the \noutside. So we can't do that. But let's do all we can. Let's do some \nthings that will improve the way we do business. I think this \nlegislation does this. It is bipartisan in introduction. I understand a \nsubstitute will be offered later this afternoon that will maybe move \nthe ball forward some more. I am not sure exactly what all that would \nbe, but what I have looked at, I don't see major problems there. I do \nthink how you deal with the defining earmarks and how you disclose \nsponsorship is important but more delicate than some may think.\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\n  With regard to gifts, we ought to get over that. We should not be \nhaving gifts from lobbyists. We shouldn't be having meals paid for by \nlobbyists. Some of you have heard me say this, anyway. If I never have \nto have another meal at night with, frankly, anybody, the happier I \nwill be. But I am so offended that somebody says for the price of a \nmeal, I can be had by a lobbyist or anybody else. People wouldn't elect \nme Senator from Mississippi if they thought I could be had for a meal. \nPlus the meals you have up here are not any good, anyway. You can't get \nblackeyed peas up here. You can't get really good, properly prepared \ncatfish up here. It is outrageous. So my point is, I am insulted by the \naccusation. Get rid of the gifts and meals and get that perception off \nthe table. You are not giving up much, anyway. I would rather go home \nand have dinner with my wife. That is what more of us ought to do.\n  By the way, I hope under the present leadership we will have a little \nmore time at night with our families. I have this unique idea about my \njob. I think you should work during the day, and I think you should go \nhome at night. I hope we will not be nocturnal. I am glad to see \nSenator Reid saying he is going to hold the votes to 20 minutes. I am \nglad we are going to be working on Mondays and Fridays. When I had a \nlittle bit to say about that, we did that. We voted on Mondays and \nFridays. I would rather work during the day and do the responsible \nthing and go home and be with my family at night.\n  With regard to third-party-funded travel, again, I think we need to \nhave a lot more disclosure. I think you ought to have detailed trip \nidentification or itinerary, and a listing of who was on the trip. I do \nthink we need to be careful. Are we going to totally ground ourselves \naround here? There are constitutional questions we have to consider. We \ndo have to get places within our own States. I do think we should be \naware that if you represent Maryland--maybe Senator Bennett made this \npoint--if you represent a State that is relatively small, you can get \nwhere you need to be in an hour in a car. But if you represent Alaska \nor California, you can't get there. Even my State, when I go from the \nMississippi gulf coast devastated by the hurricane to north Mississippi \nto that great center of learning at Oxford, the University of \nMississippi, it is 346 miles. That is not even the end of the State. \nYou can't get everywhere you need to be with just automobile \ntransportation. Should you have to report it? Should there be a limit \non how you do that? Absolutely. But let's be careful about making it \nimpossible for us to do our jobs here as men and women of the Senate.\n  With regard to some of the other rules included in this bill, floor \nprivileges for former Members where the possibility, perception may be \nthat a former Member is here lobbying on a bill, you can't have that, \nno. At the same time, we shouldn't prohibit former Members on the day \nwe are sworn in, as we had this past week, from coming on to the floor \nand participating in that celebratory ceremony. Again, let's use some \ncommon sense. Don't prohibit them en bloc. Allow former Members to come \non certain occasions, but don't allow them to come when we are \nlegislating, certainly, if they are lobbying.\n  Another issue deals with job negotiations by sitting Senators. Again, \nwe ought to have disclosure. If you are negotiating for private \nemployment, you should disclose that. That's what this bill does.\n  In conclusion, I think we have a good base bill. It sounds as though \nthe substitute may be OK. I am sure there are going to be some \namendments that we should think about very carefully. Let's be careful \nabout pompous pontificating or questioning other people's motives. \nLet's be careful that when we do something, we can actually enforce it. \nLet's think it through. I think we can do that. I think the way it has \nbeen brought up is fine.\n  I am very concerned about the idea of an outside office of public \nintegrity and how that could be used unfairly in a political season. \nSome people say: Well, don't worry about that. Well, you have to. \nBecause we could do it to each other. You would hope that we wouldn't; \nI wouldn't do it to the Senator from Florida and he wouldn't do it to \nme. But it has been done. Going way back to my years in the House, I \nwas on the franking commission. We had a process to file complaints \nwith the franking commission if a Member of the House misused the \nfrank. It was interesting, right before the election, how many extra \ncomplaints about abuse of the frank showed up before that commission. \nIt became a political issue that was used to beat up a Member who quite \noften wasn't even guilty of anything wrong. But the damage was done. It \nwas in the media.\n  Mr. President, we can and should pass a reform bill. I said that last \nyear. It is the right thing to do. But I hope that we will use common \nsense. Let's not turn ourselves into something where we can't even do \nthe job. Let's not inadvertently make criminals out of ourselves and \nour staffs. I am not saying there haven't been problems and that there \nwon't be in the future. We are all human beings, and we are capable of \nmaking mistakes. But we can do a better job. I think it is time we do \nthat.\n  I want to make it clear that as far as I am concerned, this is going \nto be a bipartisan effort.\n  This is not partisan. The mistakes made over the years that I have \nseen since I have been in Washington have been made on both sides of \nthe aisle. We can do a better job of putting things into place where we \nare less likely to make a mistake. I wish the very best to the \nChairlady and the ranking member. I think they can do a good job, and I \nthink we can do something good for the institution, and we will restore \na modicum of faith in us from the American people.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think my time has expired. Who has the floor, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I wish to say this to my colleague in response \nto his excellent comments about the tendency of some folks to \npontificate around here. It called to mind for this Senator the old \nadage that ``I would rather see a sermon than hear one any day.'' That \nmight be a lesson for all of us in public office to remember.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is a very good adage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am not going to take that \namount of time. I do want to go back to the basic underlying problem \nthat finally is bringing us to the point that we are going to get a \nbill passed here and one in the House of Representatives, and we are \ngoing to get a compromise hammered out in a conference committee and \nget a product which we will send to the President for his signature.\n  It basically has boiled down to the fact that we have had vote buying \nand earmark buying. That is inimical to the interests of this country \nand the way that we operate in a system of justice. It is inimical to \nthe interest of a democracy, in representing the people, and when the \npeople see this, they say: Enough; we want a change. We tried to do \nthis in the last Congress. There was a bill passed here and there was a \nbill passed on the other side of the Capitol, but for all the various \npersonal reasons and special interests, we could not get anything \nmoving and get a final agreement.\n  Now, what does this come out of? It comes out of a basic human \nfailing called pride. Pride, by the way, in the Good Book, is mentioned \nas one of the greatest sins. Pride can be described in many other ways. \nIt can be arrogance, obstinance or it can be an ``it is my way or the \nhighway'' attitude. It can be quite destructive. As this observer of \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration would clearly note, \nit was arrogance in the NASA management that brought down two space \nshuttles--one in 1986 because the NASA management wasn't listening to \nwhat the engineers on the line were saying. The communication--in other \nwords, due to arrogance and pride--was going one way, from the top to \nthe bottom, not from the bottom up. That caused the destruction in \nJanuary of 1986 of\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nthe space shuttle Challenger. And 18 years later, the very same thing \nhappened again to NASA. The space shuttle Columbia was destroyed for a \ndifferent technical reason than 18 years previously, but the same \nreason occurred, which was the arrogance of power and pride that had \nset in. The same thing happened. Communication was from the top down, \nbut they weren't listening to the engineers on the line who were \ntelling them that that thermal protection foam on the external tank was \nshedding in the launch of each of those space shuttles.\n  So we say that same thing--pride, arrogance, the abuse of power. \nRemember the British politician who said, ``Power corrupts and absolute \npower corrupts absolutely.'' Indeed, that is what we see. It is not \napplicable to one side of the aisle or the other. This has happened \nthroughout the history of this great democracy, over two centuries. So \nwhat happens is that, ultimately, the people will say: Enough, and we \nwant change. Then we will try to respond to the change. We remember the \nreaction that occurred in this country in 1974 in the election as a \nresult of the arrogance of power that had been in the White House that \nwe know as the Watergate scandal. And then we know about in the decade \nof the 1980s, where the Democrats had been in power for decades, and \nthen there was one thing after another that was happening. In the \nelection of 1994, people were tired of the arrogance that was being \ndisplayed. Now we are on a shorter cycle--here, in a 12-year period, \nfrom 1994 to 2006, and people were saying: I don't like this vote \nbuying, this earmark buying, where somebody gets a special \nappropriation because they happen to be getting special gifts of \nlodging and trips and gifts and antiques and meals, and so forth and so \non. And, of course, that is the celebrated case of MGM and Mitchell \nWade and all of that fallout, and you hear the revelations coming out \nof another lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, and the resignation of another \nmajor figure in the House of Representatives. It all goes back to this \narrogance of power.\n  Since we all have ``feet of clay,'' what is the best way we can try \nto avoid that temptation of arrogance of power? The temptation is going \nto be there. First of all, it has to be right there in your heart. \nCheck your own self as a public servant. But the next thing we can do \nis something that we are attempting to do in this legislation. You get \neverything out into the open, so that you know that there is always the \nfourth estate, the press, looking over your shoulder. That makes it \neasier for them to find out what the facts are. Thus, the earmarks have \nto be completely transparent if, indeed, there are going to be any \nearmarks, which is another question we will address on down the line.\n  Get it out into the sunshine. We have a tradition of that in Florida \nfrom way back in the 1960s, enacting the sunshine law. State Senator J. \nEmory Cross, from Gainesville, FL, a place in celebration right now as \na result of the national championship--Senator Cross, who was an old \ncountry lawyer and a State senator, said there has to be a different \nway. That was in the 1960s. They passed Florida's sunshine law which \nsaid that a government body meeting to discuss public business had to \nbe in the public. All of that doesn't occur here all of the time--a lot \nof it by necessity because of national security, and so forth. But the \nmost we can do is get things out into the open, in the full glare of \nthe spotlight, so that people can evaluate that what we are and what we \nare not doing is to strengthen this democracy. That is what we have to \ndo.\n  I think this legislation is a step in the right direction. It is \ngoing to try to get at these lobbyist-financed meals, gifts, and \ntravel. It is clearly going to require more transparency. Our \ndemocratic Government is viewed as a model in countries throughout the \nworld. I just spent 2 weeks in the Middle East and Central Asia. They \ndo business a lot differently. Payoffs, and so forth, are a standard \npractice in a lot of those parts of the world. We do it differently \nhere. Perhaps that is another reason why this constitutional democracy \nhas survived and, indeed, thrived for well over two centuries. The \nFounding Fathers established a government that was designed to put a \ncheck on power and represent the interests of all Americans, regardless \nof their station in life.\n  So as we grapple with this issue of trying to put an influence on \nthose who articulate a special interest, a narrowly defined interest, \ninstead of an interest for what is referred to as the common wheel, the \ncommon good, then that is very much vital to restoring the balance of \npower in the functioning of our Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, first, let me praise our great majority \nleader and Senator McConnell, the minority leader, for bringing us \ntogether for a good start to the 110th Congress. The idea of a joint \ncaucus, both parties coming together to send a signal that we were \ngoing to work together in the 110th Congress as we begin, was a very \ngood step. I believe Senator Reid said we are now entering a season of \nhope and that we can move forward with hope for positive results in the \n110th Congress. Senator McConnell talked about how a government, even \nthough it may be divided by the two parties and the executive branch, \ncan be the kind of government that can bring about good results for the \npeople of America. That was a very good statement as well. Citing what \nhappened in the 1981 Reagan Social Security revision, that was an \nexample of how a divided Government could get a result, as well as his \nspeaking about the 1996 welfare-to-work reform. That was another good \nexample of how we can get things done.\n  I hope this Congress, in fact, gets to be known as the Congress that \ndid, in fact, produce results for the American people and that we can \nwork together to bring about those results.\n  Today, as we begin the consideration of S. 1, it is one of those \nefforts in which we together are attempting to show results to the \nAmerican people to restore the confidence of the American people in the \ninstitutions that belong to them.\n  It is no coincidence that this is the first bill to come before this \nnew Senate. This bill lays a foundation for everything that we hope to \ndo in the months and years ahead. It does so by addressing three \nfundamental needs.\n  First, it addresses the need to restore the people's faith in their \nGovernment. Indeed, in the wake of the Jack Abramoff scandal, the \nconviction of former Congressman Duke Cunningham, and the various other \nallegations and investigations that have created this problem in \nWashington, DC, it is clear that the American people have lost faith in \ntheir Government.\n  In case we didn't know it beforehand, that message was sent loudly \nand clearly by the voters in the November elections. With this bill, we \nhave the opportunity to restore that lost faith without which we cannot \neffectively conduct the business of the people of America.\n  Second, this bill also addresses the need to bring greater \ntransparency to the Government of America. As Justice Brandeis said a \nlong time ago:\n\n       Sunshine is said to be the best of disinfectants.\n\n  These words have particular resonance with the American people as we \nlook to end today the practice of holding one-party conference \ncommittees; of placing strange and anonymous holds, not knowing where \nthey come from, on legislation and nominations just because someone \nwants to prevent progress from taking place; and slipping provisions \ninto conference reports that were not passed by either Chamber, some of \nthese provisions being slipped into the conference reports in the dead \nof night. With this bill, we look to replace these secretive practices \nwith a more open and transparent Congress for the American people.\n  Third, we also need to take on the influence of special interests and \nto curb those influences of special interests on the Government of \nAmerica.\n  When the American people see a revolving door between Congress and \nthe K Street lobbying firms, when they see Members of Congress and \nstaff treated to gifts and travel paid by lobbyists, when they see \nlegislation changed at the behest of a special interest, they \nunderstandably roll their eyes. With this bill, we look to curb the \ninfluence\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\nof special interests in favor of the people's interest because all of \nus were elected to represent the people first.\n  This bill is not a perfect bill, and we will work this week to refine \nand improve the bill. For example, I would like to see the denial of \nFederal pensions to Members of Congress who are convicted of certain \ncrimes. I am proud to support an amendment with Senator John Kerry \nwhich would do just that in this legislation. The likes of former \nCongressman Duke Cunningham and the bribery that occurred in that \nparticular case should be the grounds for the denial of pensions to \nFederal Congressmen and Congresswomen.\n  I would also like to see greater transparency in the committee \nprocess, and I will offer an amendment on that issue later this week.\n  I also believe it is important to note that this bill touches on \nethics in the executive branch. We know there has been so much focus in \nthe public debate on how this deals only with the legislative branch of \nGovernment, but, in fact, this legislation will also end up creating a \nnew program of Government independence and integrity in the executive \nbranch.\n  It will do so by extending the revolving door for very senior \nexecutive branch employees from 1 to 2 years and by expressing the \nsense of the Senate that any applicable restrictions on congressional \nbranch employees should also apply to the executive and judicial \nbranches of Government.\n  We need to make sure that every branch of Government has strong \nethics rules. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \naccomplish that goal in the coming months. It is my hope that the \nrelevant committees address these issues in the near future.\n  Let me make a comment about this issue.\n  The fact is, the House of Representatives is dealing with ethics as \ntheir first issue, and the Senate is dealing with ethics as our first \nissue. We are taking a very important step in the right direction, but \nat the end of the day, it is the loss of confidence of the people of \nAmerica in their Government in Washington as a whole that we need to \ntake a look at, and the issues we deal with here are only focused \nlargely on the legislative branch of Government, but there are also a \nwhole host of issues in the executive branch of Government that should \nrequire us to take a hard look at what it is that all of our Government \nofficials are doing.\n  At the end of the day, our goal should be to try to make sure the \nintegrity of Government extends to all aspects of the Government and \nthat the confidence of the people we all represent extends to a \nconfidence in all of our Government. The only way we can do that is to \nmake sure we have the highest ethical standards that apply to the \nCongress as well as to the White House and to the executive branch of \nGovernment.\n\n  It is my sincere hope that the committees of jurisdiction, including \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security and other \ncommittees that will look at this issue, will also help us bring about \nthat kind of cultivation with respect to how we look at integrity in \nGovernment.\n  It isn't enough for us to clean out only a part of the barn in \nWashington, DC. I am a rancher and a farmer in terms of my upbringing. \nWhen you go in, you clean out the whole barn. Our effort is to clean up \nWashington, DC, and, if it is a committed effort on the part of both \nDemocrats and Republicans, we need to make sure we are cleaning out the \nwhole barn.\n  Finally, it is important to make sure that we all recognize this bill \nis moving us forward in the right direction in a number of ways. It \nbans all gifts, and it bans meals and travel paid for by lobbyists. \nThat is a ban that did not exist before this context. It is an \nimportant step in the right direction.\n  Second, it requires public disclosure within 3 days of any hold \nplaced on a nomination or on legislation. During the 109th Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans who were part of legislation we were trying \nto get through could not find out who was putting holds on legislation. \nThat is not the way to do business. If a Senator has a problem with a \nbill, if they want to put a hold on a bill, they ought to tell their \ncolleagues what it is they have a problem with, what is the substantive \nissue that causes that Senator a concern that requires him or her to \nput a hold on a bill.\n  This is a very important procedural positive step forward for this \ninstitution, and I look forward to strongly supporting that part of the \nbill.\n  Third is closing the revolving door between Congress and K Street by \nextending the cooling off period of Members of Congress and stiffening \nthe rules regarding lobbying activity by senior staff members. It is an \nimportant rule that allows us to close that revolving door which has \nbeen a part of Washington, DC, for far too long.\n  Fourth, this legislation requires that conference reports be made \navailable to the public at least 48 hours before their consideration by \nthe Senate. That way not only be the public of the United States of \nAmerica but also the Members of this body will have an opportunity to \nstudy what is in the legislation and will be able to react so we do not \nenact legislation that is passed in the dead of night without people \nknowing on what they are voting.\n  Fifth, the bill requires a list of earmarks in a bill, the identity \nof the Senators who propose them, and also identity of their essential \nGovernment purpose.\n  For the last year, we have talked about earmark reform and the \nimportance of moving forward with changes in the earmark process, which \nhas been a part of this body probably since its inception, but making \nsure we know where those earmarks are coming from, who is proposing \nthem, and what is the essential governmental purpose that is being \naddressed by that particular earmark.\n  It is essential for us to be able to tell the American public what it \nis we are doing with taxpayers' dollars. I fully support the earmark \nproposals that are put forth in this legislation.\n  As a member of the Senate Ethics Committee, I am also pleased to join \nwith my colleagues in supporting the aspects of the bill that would do \nthe following:\n  First, it would require the Ethics Committee of the Senate to report \non an annual basis with detailed statistics on the number of alleged \nviolations and the status of complaints that are pending before the \nEthics Committee of the Senate.\n  Second, it would require the Ethics Committee that it conduct \nmandatory ethics training not only for Senators but also for all of our \nstaffs who are affected by the decisions and the activities of our \noffice on an ongoing basis.\n  And, third, that we as a Senate move forward in the creation of an \nindependent commission to make recommendations on the effectiveness of \ncongressional ethics rules and lobbying disclosure laws.\n  It is important to note that these changes are necessary, not because \nthere is something inherently wrong or dishonorable about the process \nof petitioning the Government. They are important and they are \nnecessary because the American people have lost faith in their \nGovernment and because our Government should be doing more to have a \nGovernment that is transparent and a Government that is responsive to \nthe business of the people.\n  I commend the leadership, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, members \nof the Rules Committee, my colleagues and friends from California and \nUtah who are the managers of this bill, and members of the Governmental \nAffairs and Homeland Security Committee for their work. This is very \nimportant legislation that is taking an important first step in \nrestoring the faith of the American people in the integrity of their \nGovernment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold the quorum call?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, if the Senator will withhold the requst for a \nquorum call, Mr. President, I note that it is almost 12:30 p.m. I ask \nthat the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S257-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S257-S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Since Senator Lieberman has \nnot yet arrived on the floor, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to begin. When Senator Lieberman arrives on the floor, I will \nyield to him and then reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, today the Senate once again considers \nsignificant legislation to reform ethical practices and lobbying \npractices. Any sense of deja vu among my colleagues is understandable, \nfor the bill before us, S. 1, is identical to the bill passed by the \nSenate by a vote of 90 to 8 in March of last year. That bill was the \nbipartisan product of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration. Because it never became law and because the issues that \nit addressed have only grown more troubling, the bill stands before us \nreincarnated but still very much needed.\n  The recent elections took place in the shadow of far too many \nrevelations of questionable or even downright illegal conduct by \nMembers of Congress. In reaction to those scandals, the American people \nsent a clear message to Congress that they had lost confidence in their \nGovernment. You may ask, Why does it matter? Why does it matter if the \nAmerican people have confidence in their Government officials? It \nmatters because without the trust of the American people, we cannot \ntackle the major issues facing this country. As long as our \nconstituents are convinced that the decisions we are making are tainted \nby special influences or undue influence, then we simply cannot \naccomplish the work of this Nation.\n  I think it is appropriate that the first bill that is brought before \nthis Chamber to be debated and considered is one that would reform the \nlobbying and ethics rules to increase disclosure and to ban practices \nthat might be called into question or create an appearance of \nwrongdoing. We need to assure the American people that the decisions we \nmake are decisions of integrity, in which their interests are put \nfirst.\n  It is important to remember that the conduct of most Members of \nCongress and their staffs is beyond reproach. I believe the vast \nmajority of people serving in the House and the Senate are here for the \nright reason. They are here because they care deeply about their \ncountry and they want to contribute to the formulation of public policy \nthey believe will improve the lives of the American people.\n  The same can be said for the conduct of most lobbyists. In fact, \nlobbying--whether done on behalf of the business community, an \nenvironmental organization, a children's advocacy group, or any other \ncause--can often provide Members of Congress with useful information \nand analysis. That information and analysis aids but does not dictate \nthe decisionmaking process.\n  Unfortunately, today the word ``lobbying'' too often conjures up \nimages of expensive paid vacations masquerading as fact-finding trips, \nspecial access the average citizen can never have, and undue influence \nthat leads to tainted decisions. We cannot underestimate the corrosive \neffect this perception has on the public's confidence in the \nlegislative process.\n  One of the most important functions of the bill before us is to \nincrease transparency, make it evident what is going on, how our \ndecisions are made. As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once noted, \n``Sunlight is the best disinfectant.'' That, indeed, is the premise of \nthis bill. It calls for greatly increased disclosure. It provides, for \nexample, for a searchable, accessible public database where information \non lobbying contacts and filings will be maintained and disclosed. It \nrequires far more detailed disclosure of lobbyist activities in more \nfrequent filings under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and it ensures that \nthis information is made readily available to the public via the \nInternet. The knowledge that the public will be able to scrutinize in \ndetail the activities of a lobbying firm and contacts between Members \nand lobbyists will help to provide much needed transparency in this \nwhole area. In addition, the enhanced disclosures will allow citizens \nto decide for themselves what is acceptable and what is not.\n\n  This bill also contains some needed reforms of earmarks. Too many \ntimes an earmark--the designation of taxpayer dollars for a specific \npurpose--has been included in the final version of an appropriations \nbill, or another bill, despite the fact that it was never discussed or \ndebated in either the Senate or the House. By requiring that any \nearmarks in legislation disclose the name of the Member of Congress who \nproposed the earmark and also requiring an explanation of the essential \ngovernmental purpose of the earmark, and by making this information \navailable on the Internet, this legislation will shed sunlight on the \nsource of and the reason for earmarks and allow them to be fairly \nevaluated.\n  I go through a very rigorous process when I decide to press for \nearmarks. I make sure there is community support, I review them in \ndepth, and I am going to be very comfortable having my name attached to \nearmarks that I propose. In fact, I hope then that will help my \nconstituents know I am working very hard for a project with which I \nagree.\n  It is not the process of earmarks per se that is a problem. The \nproblem is when earmarks are sneaked into the final version of \nlegislation without public debate, without a vote, without any \nconsideration, and no one is sure where the earmark came from, who \nsponsored it or, in some cases, even who the beneficiary is going to \nbe. That is the problem. That is what this bill would cure.\n  The enhanced disclosure in this legislation not only applies to the \nactivities of lobbyists but to our own activities as well. I am pleased \nthis legislation takes steps to eliminate the practice of anonymous \nholds on Senate legislation. This occurs when a Member notifies the \ncloakroom that he or she wishes to block a piece of legislation from \ncoming to the floor and yet does so anonymously. I can tell you as \nsomeone who has had to deal with anonymous holds time and again, it is \nvery frustrating when you can't find out who is holding up your \nlegislation, why they are holding it up, and you cannot begin to \nresolve whatever the problems are. The hallmark of this body should be \nfree and open debate. A process that allows a secret hold to kill a \nbill without a word of debate on the Senate floor is contrary to that \nprinciple.\n  The bill also includes some important provisions to slow the so-\ncalled revolving door problem, where Members of Congress and high-\nranking staff leave their jobs in the Senate or the House one day and \nthen turn around and lobby the institution they once served. Once \nagain, the limitations in this bill get to the heart of the image \nproblem here and help to ensure the integrity of our decisions.\n  Many of our former colleagues have become lobbyists. There is nothing \nwrong with that. But there should be a cooling-off period before they \ncome back.\n  I notice my colleague from Connecticut has now arrived on the floor. \nThrough the Chair, I ask my colleague if he wants me to finish my \nstatement or if he wants to do his now, since he was first in the \nqueue?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, to my friend from Maine, it is an \nexpression of the partnership we have had over the years on the \ncommittee that the hearing in our committee went until 2 o'clock so \nSenator Collins was able to get here before I was. If she will please \nfinish her statement and I will go after her.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\n  I am also very pleased to join Senators Reid, McConnell, Feinstein, \nLieberman, and Bennett in cosponsoring a bipartisan substitute \namendment that will be laid down this afternoon. This substitute \namendment will further strengthen the legislation we have before us. I \nthank all of my colleagues for working together to achieve this goal.\n  Nevertheless, I make clear, while I strongly support the legislation \nbefore the Senate as well as the substitute, the legislation could be \nfurther strengthened in a very important way.\n  Last year, Senators Lieberman, McCain and I proposed an Office of \nPublic Integrity. That concept is also included in another bill that \nwas sponsored this year by Senators McCain, Lieberman, Feingold, and \nmyself. I anticipate Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, Senator \nFeingold, and I will be offering this proposal during the course of \nthis debate.\n  I will debate that issue later at the appropriate time, but right now \nlet me say any true comprehensive reform of our lobbying and ethics \nrules should include an independent investigatory body. The American \npeople view the way we investigate ethics violations as an inherently \nconflicted process. Think about it--and I know the Presiding Officer \nhas a law enforcement background--we are our own advisers, our own \ninvestigators, our own prosecutors, our own judges, our own juries. We \nplay every role.\n  As good a job as a Member of the Ethics Committee in the Senate has \ndone in overseeing the conduct of Members and their staff, it remains \ndifficult, if not impossible, to guarantee the system works in a way \nthat gives the public confidence that there is an impartial, thorough \nreview of allegations against Members of Congress when we are \nfulfilling every role in the process.\n  Now, I respect and understand the constitutional requirement that \nMembers of Congress sit in judgment of one another and our proposal \ndoes not change. The Office of Public Integrity would bring the results \nof its investigation to the Ethics Committee, which would then decide \nwhether to proceed further, whether there is an actual violation, and \nwhat kind of remedy, if any, is necessary. That is an important \nprovision. I look forward to working with the Senator from Connecticut, \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, and the Senator from Arizona in that area.\n  We need also to make sure we stop having trips that are paid \nvacations. However, we don't want to interfere with true fact-finding \ntrips. Those are generally useful to our work. We are close to working \nout the right balance in that area.\n  I look forward to passing effective legislation that will help to \nrestore the public's confidence in the Senate. By scheduling this bill \nfirst on our agenda we have recognized the importance of these issues \nto the American people. We need to act without delay to help restore \ntheir faith in how we do business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nMaine, Senator Collins, for her excellent statement and for her work as \nshe led the committee, which produced a significant part of the bill \nbefore the Senate. I will speak about it and put it in a larger \ncontext.\n  We all know that the trust that people have in Congress is at a low \npoint. I don't know that it is a historic low point, but it is a lot \nlower than anyone wants it to be, both for the national interest and \nout of a sense of pride we have in the service we attempt to give.\n  The reasons for the low level of public trust and confidence in \nMembers of Congress and, more to the point, in Congress as an \ninstitution are more than one. One of the significant reasons for the \nlow level of confidence in Congress is the partisanship that has \ndivided this institution and, too often, made it impossible to do \nanything for the people who sent us here, who gave us the privilege of \ncoming here to serve them. Partisanship is one part of the lack of \nesteem and trust the public has in us.\n  A second part is the public's doubt about the ethics of Members of \nCongress and the process we have for judging our ethics. Scandal after \nscandal unfolded last year. The public was left with the impression \nthat the self-interest of lawmakers and lobbyists too often triumphed \nover the national good and the national interests. That is not true, \nbut that was certainly the impression made by some of the awful \nexposures and scandals that were uncovered and by the prosecution of \nMembers and lobbyists.\n  Unless we take action to restore the public's trust in us--that \ncentral confidence between those who are privileged to govern and those \nwho, if you will, are governed--we will not be able to do the things we \nneed to do to take on and to respond, in a constructive way, to the \nchallenges we have before the Senate, including a new strategy for \nIraq, a momentous decision that will affect our national security to be \nkicked off, if you will, redirected, by the statement that the \nPresident will make to the Nation tomorrow night; fighting the war on \nterrorism, reducing the deficit, doing something to fix our health care \nsystem, which is broken; improving our public system of education \nwhich, for still does not offer an equal opportunity to too many of our \nchildren; taking stress off the middle class which is the heart and \nsoul of our country. All of those things will not happen in a good way \nunless we can rebuild the public's trust in us.\n  It involves less partisanship, a better self-policing of ethics--and \nI will come to that in a minute--but also doing some of the things I \nhave talked about, responding to some of the problems, taking advantage \nof some of these opportunities that will restore the relationship \nbetween the people of the United States and those who serve them in the \nCongress.\n  And so much of law--we legislate the law--as someone taught me years \nago, is the way we express our values, the way we express our \naspirations for ourselves as a society, the rights and wrongs, what we \nhope we will be, is apparent in the system by which we legislate \nourselves and those who lobby us. But the reality is that the best \nsystem for doing that is our own ethical norms, which most of us, of \ncourse, have; that, ultimately, we have to self-police ourselves by not \ntrifling with and demeaning the extraordinary opportunity to serve that \nour constituents have given us.\n  Now we come to S. 1. I truly commend our new majority leader, Senator \nReid, for introducing an ethics and lobbying reform bill as S. 1 and \nscheduling it as the very first legislative item of business for the \nSenate in this 110th Congress. I will give a little background to how \nwe got here, particularly legislatively how we got here.\n  In January of last year, I was privileged to join Senator McCain in \ncosponsoring a sweeping lobbying reform bill that he crafted following \nhis and Senator Dorgan's courageous investigation into the scandal \nsurrounding the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Senator Feingold and Senator \nReid also introduced comprehensive bills that added many constructive, \nprogressive ideas to the debate.\n\n  Senator Collins seized the moment as Chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, and by early March of last \nyear, our committee reported, with near unanimous bipartisan support, \nthe most significant piece of lobbying reform legislation to come \nbefore Congress in over a decade. In the Rules Committee, Senators Lott \nand Dodd worked together to mark up a tough set of reforms to the \nSenate ethics rules. Senators Feinstein and Bennett, as the incoming \nand ranking members of that committee, have picked up the baton of \nreform where their predecessors left off.\n  As a result of a truly bipartisan effort last year, the Senate \ncombined provisions reported out of the two committees--Homeland \nSecurity and Rules--and passed the legislation overwhelmingly by a vote \nof 90 to 8. Unfortunately, the House did not pursue the same course. It \npassed a weak bill on a mostly partisan vote and the House and Senate \nnever moved to conference.\n  Now, we begin the new year with a fresh chance to finish old business \nand clean up our House and Senate for tomorrow. Last year's Senate-\npassed bill is the text of S. 1 before the Senate now, a set of reforms \nthat would bring greater honesty and transparency to the way we do \nbusiness in Washington.\n  This year, we should go beyond last year's proposals, as Senator \nCollins\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\nsaid, and enact even stronger reforms because the demand and need is \ngreater. Our legislation should go further to include an independent \nOffice of Public Integrity.\n  What we start with today in S. 1 is a very strong statement that the \n110th Congress will put the public interest over special interest.\n  I will spend a few moments describing the provisions of S. 1 that \nwere reported out of our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in March of last year, dealing primarily with the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act which comes before our committee under the rules.\n  The Lobbying Disclosure Act was passed in 1995, more than a decade \nago. Since then, the number of lobbyists has skyrocketed. Last year, \n6,554 lobbying firms or organizations, not individuals--firms or \norganizations--registered to lobby. That is almost double the 3,554 \nregistrants in 1996, the first full year of reporting under the \nLobbying Disclosure Act. The Office of Public Records received a total \nof 46,835 lobbying reports last year which represents a tremendous \namount of activity. The amount of money spent each year on lobbying has \nskyrocketed, as well. Here we make estimates that put the number well \nover $2 billion a year for lobbying.\n  Now, to state the obvious, but the obvious often needs to be stated, \nlobbying Congress is not an evil thing to do. Being a lobbyist is not a \ndishonorable profession. In fact, lobbying Congress is a \nconstitutionally protected right. The first amendment protects the \nright of all people to petition the Government for redress of \ngrievances. Therefore, we have to be respectful when we legislate in \nthis area. But it is entirely consistent with the first amendment \nright, and, of course, essential to our Government to provide ethics \nand transparency for lobbying practices.\n  First and foremost, are the politicians. In S. 1, we bring the \nLobbying Disclosure Act into the age of the Internet by requiring \nelectronic filing and creating a public-searchable database on the \nInternet, making the information as accessible as a click of the mouse \nto everyone interested.\n  We bring greater transparency to the relationship between lawmakers \nand lobbyists by expanding the types of activities lobbyists must \ndisclose, including their campaign contributions, the fundraisers they \nhost for Federal candidates, travel arranged for Members of Congress, \npayments to events to honor Members of Congress, and contributions to \nentities such as charities that are established by, for or controlled \nby a Member. We would get more timely disclosure from lobbyists by \nrequiring them to submit filings on a quarterly, rather than a \nsemiannual, basis.\n  S. 1 would also close a major loophole in the Lobbying Disclosure Act \nby requiring lobbyists, for the first time, to disclose paid efforts to \ngenerate grassroots lobbying.\n  Our former colleague, the late and really great Lloyd Bentsen, a \nSenator from Texas, once described this kind of grassroots lobbying as \n``Astroturf lobbying.'' Why? Because it generates manufactured, \nartificial rather than real, self-grown, grassroots pressures on \nCongress.\n\n  As it stands now, the Lobbying Disclosure Act requires disclosure \nonly by lobbyists directly in contact with Members. S. 1 would require \ndisclosure of the identity of organizers of media campaigns, mass \nmailings, phone banks, and other large-scale efforts encouraging the \npublic to contact Members of Congress about specific issues. This is \nimportant because it would provide the American people, Members of \nCongress, ourselves, and the media with a better understanding of whose \nmoney is financing which efforts to influence Congress. This bill calls \nfor transparency, but puts no limits on activity.\n  We would also remove the cloak obscuring so-called stealth lobbying \ncampaigns which occur when a group of individuals, companies, unions, \nor associations ban together to form a lobbying coalition. These \ncoalitions frequently have innocent-sounding names that give the \nimpression they are promoting positive mom-and-pop, apple pie goals. \nBut, in fact, they lobby on a range of issues that could never be \nidentified by the name of the coalition.\n  S. 1 would also toughen the enforcement provisions under the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act by doubling to $100,000 the civil penalty that a \nlobbyist is subject to for violations of the law's requirements. And, \nfor the first time, this proposal would forbid a lobbyist from \nproviding gifts or travel to a Member of Congress in violation of House \nor Senate rules.\n  We would slow the revolving door between Congress and K Street by \ndoubling from 1 to 2 years the so-called cooling off period for former \nMembers of Congress, during which time they would face lobbying \nrestrictions.\n  In total, the provisions of S. 1, I believe, provide a strong \nfoundation for reform. Can this bill be improved? Of course it can. And \nI believe it will in the amendment process that will come before this \nChamber on S. 1.\n  The majority leader, I know, is working to craft a comprehensive \nsubstitute bill that will go even further toward tightening earmark \ndisclosure and revolving-door rules. I am confident that, through the \namendment process, we will emerge with a bill that is even stronger \nthan the good bill we passed last year.\n  A final word. In my opinion, significant changes to our ethics rules \nmust be accompanied by significant changes to the way we enforce those \nrules. The public is understandably skeptical about a system in which \nwe investigate, consider, and pass final judgments on allegations of \nethical responsibility. They have seen too many Members, in the last \nfew years particularly, caught up in scandal. In order to win the \npublic's confidence, and, frankly, to do what is right to demonstrate \nour seriousness in this effort, I believe it is time, this year, to \ncreate an independent, investigative, and enforcement Office of Public \nIntegrity. That would in no way usurp the ultimate authority of the \nSenate Ethics Committee, under rules consistent with the Constitution \nto be the final arbiter of questions about the ethics of Members of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would say this: We have an opportunity \nto begin anew--a fresh start at rebuilding the bonds of trust that have \nbeen broken between the Congress and the American people because of the \nunethical behavior of a few Members of this great institution.\n  S. 1 is the beginning, and a strong beginning, of what I believe will \nbe an even stronger ending to accomplishing that critically important \ngoal.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is S. 1 now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk in the \nform of a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lieberman, and \n     Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 3.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am very happy the Senate has now begun \ndebate on S. 1. It is a strong, bipartisan package of ethics reforms \nand will help reassure the American people that we answer to them.\n  The matter now before the Senate, S. 1, without the substitute I have \noffered, would be the most significant changes in ethics and lobbying \nreform since Watergate. So if we do nothing else other than adopt the \nReid-McConnell S. 1, we should feel very good about what we are able to \naccomplish in this body.\n  I repeat, if we accomplish nothing else, the legislation now before \nthis body will be the most significant, important change in ethics and \nlobbying rules for about three decades. So without any question, S. 1 \nis a good start.\n  But we should even do better, and that is what the substitute I sent \nto the desk on my behalf and that of Senator McConnell will do. It will \neven do better for the American people.\n  For those who are watching this debate in the Senate and are \nexpecting\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\nreal, meaningful results, that is what is going to happen. I think the \nAmerican people for sure are not interested in quick fixes or window \ndressing or a few public relations moves. They want bold changes. They \nwant us to fundamentally alter the way business is done in the Nation's \nCapital and to ensure that the people's interests--not the special \ninterests--come first in the Halls of Congress.\n  So today Senator McConnell and I introduced S. 1. And now I have \noffered on our behalf--Senators McConnell and Reid--a substitute \namendment designed to make the Senate's ethics legislation even \nstronger.\n  First of all, I want the Record spread with my appreciation and the \nacknowledgment of the bipartisan effort of the Republican leader. I \nthink it speaks volumes that the two of us are here before this body \nasking our Members to support two very fine pieces of legislation, S. 1 \nand now the substitute amendment. We are asking our Members to join \nwith us.\n  As I indicated earlier--and I repeat for the third time--if we do \nnothing other than pass S. 1, tremendous changes in the way we do \nbusiness in Washington will occur. But now, to add to that, is the \nbipartisan substitute which will make that even stronger. So I cannot \nsay enough publicly or privately in the way of extending my \nappreciation to the Republican leader for working with me.\n  And we worked together on this issue. Our staffs have worked together \non this for weeks--weeks. And we did not finalize what we were going to \ndo until today as the Senate convened. The Republican leader suggested \nto me: Here are some things I think we should do. Here are some things \nwe should not do. What do you think?\n  I said: I will think about it. I have thought about it. He was right. \nI acknowledged that he was right and called him a short time later and \nindicated that to be the case.\n  What are a few of the highlights of the Reid-McConnell substitute \namendment?\n  First, the substitute will place new prohibitions and disclosure \nrequirements on lawmakers and senior staff when they seek private \nsector employment. The underlying bill slowed the revolving door \nbetween top Government jobs and lucrative private sector employment, \nbut the substitute amendment will do even more to reduce the undue \ninfluence that results from the revolving door.\n  Second, the Reid-McConnell substitute will eliminate dead of night \nchanges to conference reports. Once a conference report has been \nsigned, it will be completely impermissible to change it.\n  What is this all about? We have had so many instances in recent years \nwhere the conference is closed, and sure enough, we come to the Senate \nfloor and the conference report includes matters that were put in the \nbill after the conference had been closed. That is wrong. That will no \nlonger be possible. What we do with conference reports will have to be \ndone in a public fashion.\n  Also, you will note this legislation does things other than what has \nbeen done on a bipartisan basis with Reid and McConnell. For example, \none of the finest relationships we have in this body is between \nDemocrat Kent Conrad and Republican Judd Gregg. They are both experts \nwith the Government's money. They work together as much as they can, in \na bipartisan fashion, and I think it is better than any two budget \npeople have worked together since we have had a budget process in the \nSenate.\n  The substitute includes a reform proposal by the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, Senators Conrad and Gregg, requiring \nthat conference reports be accompanied by a CBO score. We need to \nrestore fiscal discipline and reduce the large deficits that have \ndeveloped over the past several years.\n  In the past we have had conference reports that have had matters \nincluded with no ability for Senators to determine how much it was \ngoing to cost. Just put these in there and, we were told: Well, the CBO \ndid not have time to do it. It is the end of the session. It is a big \nbill. They do not have the time to do it.\n  They are going to have to have the time to do it now or it will not \nbe done. That matter will not be in unless we have a score from the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  There are a number of other things in this substitute. I will not \nmention them all. But the substitute amendment will strengthen the \nprovision in the underlying bill requiring disclosure of earmarks.\n  The American public should be concerned about earmarks. Now, I am not \nopposed to earmarks. They have been in appropriations bills since we \nhave been a country. They have just gotten way, way out of hand. \nThousands of them. And it has not shined a good light on our Congress.\n  In recent years, we have seen lawmakers--working on behalf of \nlobbyists--insert anonymous earmarks, costing taxpayers millions and \nmillions of dollars, into legislation at the last minute. In these \ninstances, the earmarking process has been subject to abuses that we \nmust all work together to bring to an end.\n  I have been a Member of the Appropriations Committee for two decades, \nand there is not a single earmark I have ever put in a bill that I \nwould be afraid to put my name on. And that is in effect what we are \nasking: if an earmark has merit, a Senator should be willing to stand \nby it publicly. That is why, under this bill, if a Member of Congress \nwants to direct taxpayer funds to a specific need--they have a right to \ndo that, and I believe an obligation to do that--if a Member of \nCongress wants to direct taxpayer funds to a specific need that they \nbelieve is important to their State or to this country, they will be \nrequired to attach their name to that in the light of day. That is \nappropriate.\n  Now, the substitute that Senator McConnell and I have offered to the \nSenate has more than that. But that is a rough outline of what we have.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the substitute \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 4 To Amendment No. 3\n\n           (Purpose: To strengthen the gift and travel bans.)\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Durbin, and Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered 4 to \n     amendment No. 3.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my presence on this floor relating to this \nbill is about to come to an end. I would hope that when I finish my \nbrief statement Senators will come and participate in the debate \ndealing with S. 1, the substitute Senator McConnell and I offered, and \nthis amendment, and then whatever other amendments.\n  I have indicated there will be an open process here, and I want \nSenators to feel comfortable that they have the opportunity to offer \namendments. I will say, I think we should move forward as quickly as \npossible. I would very much like to finish this bill next week and have \nevery intention to do so. In fact, everyone should be aware of and \nalerted to the fact that we are going to finish the bill next week, \neven if it goes past Friday at 12 o'clock.\n  We need to finish this legislation. Next week is a short week because \nof Dr. King's holiday. So we need to work on this legislation. We do \nnot have a lot of time just to wait around and have a lot of quorum \ncalls.\n  Last November, the American people called for bold changes in the way \nWashington does business. In the Senate, we have made answering this \ncall for change our first priority, S. 1.\n  Senator McConnell and I have joined with S. 1, and Democrats and \nRepublicans together introduced a sweeping package of ethics reforms as \nour first item of legislation. And today, as I have indicated, Senator \nMcConnell and I have made the bill even stronger.\n  I would like to go even further. That is what this one, final \namendment I have offered does. My second-degree amendment contains \nthree major provisions.\n  First, it strengthens the gift ban in the underlying bill. Whereas S. \n1 bans\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\ngifts from lobbyists to Members of Congress and staff, this amendment \nwould go one step further and ban gifts from companies and other \norganizations that even employ or retain lobbyists.\n  Two, this amendment strengthens the travel ban in the underlying \nbill. Whereas S. 1 bans travel paid for by lobbyists, this amendment \nwill go further and ban--with some commonsense exceptions--travel paid \nfor by companies and other organizations that employ or retain \nlobbyists.\n  Finally, this Reid amendment will include a very significant reform \nabout which there has been much discussion in recent days.\n  This amendment will require Members of the Senate to pay the full \ncharter fare if they wish to travel on private airplanes. If a Senator \nneeds to fly on a private airplane for any purpose, he or she should be \nrequired to pay the full cost of that trip, not a discounted one. These \nreforms are not aimed at any particular lawmakers. I have traveled on \nprivate airplanes a lot over the years. These reforms are not directed \nto any particular lawmaker or any political party. We have all done it \nover the years, with some exception. They are designed to remove even \nthe appearance of impropriety from this Congress.\n  What we in this body have to do is not only do away with what is \nwrong but what appears to be wrong. And to the American public, flying \naround on these aircraft appears to be wrong. I hope it hasn't changed \nany votes. I am confident it has not. But we want to do away with what \neven appears to be wrong.\n  I repeat, this particular reform is not aimed at any particular \nlawmaker, any particular political party, any particular campaign \ncommittee. It is designed to remove even the appearance of impropriety \nfrom Members of this body and send a strong signal to the American \npublic that their elected representatives are not unduly influenced by \nmeals, travel, and gifts that lobbyists and large corporations are \nwilling to lavish. We all remember the scandals making headlines across \nAmerica a year ago. The newspapers were filled with the stories of \nlawmakers being flown around the world for rounds of golf, corrupt \nlobbyists bilking their clients for millions of dollars, and of top \ncongressional staff being wined and dined and treated to sporting \nevents by special interests trying to influence their bosses. These \nstories have a corrosive effect on the great institution in which we \nall serve. We must make sure they are never repeated by reassuring the \nAmerican people that legislation can't be traded and that their leaders \ncan't be bought.\n  I look forward to a spirited debate on these amendments and eventual \npassage of this bill. Together we must do all we can to restore the \nfaith of the American people in their Government. We need to answer the \npeople's call for change. If an earmark has merit, a lawmaker should be \nwilling to stand by it publicly. If a person wants to fly on an \nairplane, it should be under the rules that apply to most everybody \nelse in the country.\n  These are significant proposals of change. They are for the good of \nthe institution. I hope the vast majority of the Senate will support \nthe amendment offered by Senator McConnell and this Senator and also \nthe amendment I offered by myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I commend my colleague, Senator Reid, \nthe majority leader. I was happy to join in cosponsoring not only the \nReid-McConnell substitute but also the Reid amendment that has just \nbeen offered. What we are attempting to do is restore the confidence of \nthe American public in Congress. We have a lot of work to do. The sad \nand troubling events of the last several years which have involved \ninvestigations, prosecutions, and convictions of so many on Capitol \nHill and those who work nearby are a grim reminder that there are \npeople who will try to exploit this system.\n  I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, when \nshe said that the overwhelming majority of the Members of the House and \nSenate, both political parties, are honest, hard-working people. I have \nspent many years working with my colleagues in the Senate as well as in \nthe House. I do believe they understand that public service is not \nsupposed to be an avenue to wealth; it is supposed to be an opportunity \nto serve. If you want to get rich, don't run for office. That is the \nbasic rule which all of us understand. Those who fail to understand it \nunfortunately tarnish the reputation of Congress and those others who \nserve honorably.\n  We are attempting through this effort, which Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Bennett are leading on the floor, to make changes in the rules \nof the Senate and the procedures of the Senate so we can start to \nrestore the confidence of the American people in this institution. It \nis fitting and proper that this is the first bill we consider. This is \nthe first thing we should do. Everything else should follow after we \nhave addressed this important ethical concern.\n  I wish to say a word about earmarks because there has been a lot \nsaid. Some believe--even the President, in a recent Wall Street Journal \narticle--that earmarks are the root of the real problem on Capitol \nHill. I don't agree with the President. I think as long as earmarks in \nappropriations spending bills are fully transparent, clearly for a \npublic purpose, they are a good thing.\n  I have been involved in the Appropriations Committees in both the \nHouse and Senate, trying to bring back a fair share of funds to my home \nState of Illinois through the earmark process. Where some may try to \nsquirrel away or secret away an earmark in a bill, I view it much \ndifferently. It is usually a race to the press release to take credit \nfor things we have included in the bill because I take great pride in \nthe effort we have made. This legislation addresses the earmark \nprocess. It will add transparency and accountability to it and, in so \ndoing, allow us to return to the earmarks and appropriations bills with \npride, understanding we have improved that process overall.\n  The last point I would like to make is that those who would take \nbribes in public life are clearly criminal. They have violated the law. \nThey should be prosecuted and convicted for that bribery and \ncorruption. We are attempting now to limit the contacts between those \nwho have an interest in legislation and those of us who vote on \nlegislation to make sure that relationship is more professional, less \npersonal, and that there is more disclosure on both sides in terms of \nthat relationship.\n  I would like to say for a moment that it doesn't get to the heart of \nthe issue. The heart of the issue is not whether any Member of Congress \nis going to take money or a lavish gift or trip. That happens so \nrarely. But there is something built into our political system that \nreally has to be debated, that goes to the real heart of this issue; \nthat is, the way we finance our campaigns as elected officials.\n\n  Unless you are one of the fortunate few--so wealthy that you can \nfinance your own campaign and never ask for a contribution--most of us \nspend a good part of our public lives asking for donations. We go to \nevery one we see, from those of modest means who give us small checks \nto the richest people in America who write much larger checks. It is \nalmost an imperative if you are not wealthy, if you want to finance a \ncampaign, to find millions of dollars to buy the television and radio \ntime to deliver your message in your State. If we really want to get to \nthe heart of restoring the confidence of the American people in our \nGovernment, we have to go to the heart of the problem--the way we \nfinance political campaigns.\n  For many years on Capitol Hill, I resisted the notion of public \nfinancing of campaigns. I had some pretty good arguments against it. \nWhy do I want to see public moneys or taxpayer dollars going to crazy \ncandidates representing outlandish causes who have no business in this \npolitical process? Well, those arguments held up for a while, but over \ntime I came to understand that while I was arguing against that lunatic \nfringe in American politics, I was creating a trap for everyone else \nwho was honest and trying to raise enough money to wage an effective \ncampaign.\n  The time has come for real change. In this last election cycle, which \nthe Presiding Officer knows full well, more money was spent in that \noff-year election than in the previous Presidential election year. The \namount of money\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\ngoing into our political process is growing geometrically. It means \nthat more and more special interest groups and individuals with an \nagenda are pouring dollars into the political process. It means that \nour poor, unsuspecting voters are the victims of these driveby ads that \ncome at them night and day for months before a campaign. It means that \ncandidates, both incumbents and challengers, spend month after weary \nmonth on the telephone begging for money.\n  It is no surprise that the same people we are begging money for are \nthe people who are the subject of this ethics legislation--the \nlobbyists of the special interest groups. We live in this parallel \nworld.\n  Today, with the passage of this underlying legislation, we will ban a \nlobbyist buying me lunch. Tomorrow that same lobbyist can have me over \nfor lunch at his lobbying firm to provide campaign funds for my \nreelection campaign, and it is perfectly legal. What is the difference? \nFrom the viewpoint of the person standing on the street looking through \nthe window, there is none. It is the same lobbyist and the same Member \nof Congress. The fact that one is a political campaign fundraising \nevent and another is a personal lunch is a distinction which will be \nlost on most of America.\n  The reason I raise this is I will support these ethics reforms. They \nare absolutely essential. They are the product of the scandals we have \nseen on Capitol Hill in the last several years. But if we stop there, \nif we do nothing about the financing of our political campaigns, we \nhave still left a trap out there for honest people serving in Congress \nto fall into as they try to raise money for their political campaigns. \nIn a few weeks I will be introducing public financing legislation to \ntry to move us to a place where some States have already gone--the \nStates of Arizona, for example, and Maine--moving toward clean \ncampaigns, understanding that the voters are so hungry for changes and \nreforms that will shorten campaigns, make them more substantive, take \nthe special interest money out of those campaigns, make them a real \nforum and debate of ideas and not a contest of fundraising. Sadly, that \nis what they have become in many instances.\n  I urge my colleagues in their zeal for reform not to believe that the \npassage of S. 1 and its amendments will be the end of the debate. I \nhope it will only be the beginning and that we can move, even in this \nsession of Congress, to meaningful hearings and the passage of public \nfinancing of campaigns that will truly reform the way we elect men and \nwomen to office at the Federal level and restore respect to this great \ninstitution of the U.S. Congress, both the House and the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, in November, the American people sent a \nclear message to their representatives in Washington. After a year in \nwhich too many scandals revealed the influence special interests have \nin this town, the American people told us that we better clean up our \nact, and we better do it fast.\n  But it would be a mistake if we conclude this message was intended \nfor just one party or one politician. After all, the votes hadn't even \nbeen counted in the last election before we started hearing reports \nthat corporations were already recruiting lobbyists with Democratic \nconnections to carry their water in the next Congress. This is why it \nis not enough to just change the players; we have to change the game.\n  Americans put their faith in us this time around because they want us \nto restore their faith in Government, and that means more than window \ndressing when it comes to ethics reform.\n  I was hopeful that last year's scandals would have made it obvious to \nus that we need meaningful ethics legislation, but last year, despite \nsome good efforts on this side of the aisle, the bill we ended up with, \nI thought, was too weak. It left too many loopholes, and it did too \nlittle to enforce the rules. It was a lost opportunity. It would not \nhave restored the people's faith in Congress, and in that end I had no \nchoice but to vote against it.\n  I don't want that to happen this time. Fortunately, the substitute \namendment the majority leader, Harry Reid, has offered today brings us \nclose to the bill that will achieve his stated goal, and that is to \npass the most significant ethics and lobbying reform since Watergate. \nWe owe the American people real reform, and if we work hard this week \nand next, we will get it done.\n  This time out, we must stop any and all practices that would lead a \nresponsible person to believe a public servant has become indebted to a \nlobbyist. That means a full gift and meal ban. That means prohibiting \nlobbyist-funded travel that is more about playing golf than learning \npolicy. And that means closing the revolving door to ensure that \nCapitol Hill service, whether as a Member of Congress or as a staffer, \nisn't all about lining up a high-paying lobbying job. We should not \ntolerate a committee chairman shepherding the Medicare prescription \ndrug bill through Congress at the same time he is negotiating a job \nwith the pharmaceutical industry to be their top lobbyist.\n  The substitute bill offered by Majority Leader Reid contains many of \nthese reforms. I thank him for working with Senator Feingold and me in \ncrafting this package. But in two important respects, I think we still \nneed to go further.\n  First, we need to go further with respect to enforcement. I will save \nmy remarks on this subject for a later time, but I fully support the \ncreation of an office of public integrity, as Senators Lieberman and \nCollins have proposed. It is similar to the independent ethics \ncommission I proposed last February. Regardless of what approach we \nadopt, we have to take politics out of the initial factfinding phase of \nethics investigations, and we have to ensure sufficient transparency in \nthe findings of those investigations so the American people can have \nconfidence that Congress can police itself.\n  The second area in which we need to go further is corporate jets. \nMyself and Senator Feingold introduced a comprehensive ethics bill \nthat, among other things, would close the loopholes that allow for \nsubsidized travel on corporate jets. Today, I am very pleased to see \nthe majority leader has offered an amendment that would serve the same \npurpose. I fully support him in his effort.\n  Let me point out that I fully understand the appeal of corporate \njets. Like many of my colleagues, I traveled a good deal recently from \nIllinois to Washington, from Chicago to downstate, from fundraisers to \npolitical events for candidates all across the country. I realize \nfinding a commercial flight that gets you home in time to tuck in the \nkids at the end of a long day can be extremely difficult. This is \nsimply an unfortunate reality that goes along with our jobs.\n  Yet we have to realize these corporate jets don't simply provide a \nwelcome convenience for us; they provide undue access for the lobbyists \nand corporations that offer them. These companies don't just fly us \naround out of the goodness of their hearts. Most of the time we have \nlobbyists riding along with us so they can make their company's case \nfor a particular bill or a particular vote.\n  It would be one thing if Congressmen and Senators paid the full rate \nfor these flights, but we don't. We get a discount--a big discount. \nRight now a flight on a corporate jet usually costs us the equivalent \nof a first-class ticket on a commercial airplane. But if we paid the \nreal price, the full charter rate would cost us thousands upon \nthousands of dollars more.\n  In a recent USA Today story about use of corporate jets, it was \nreported that over the course of 3 days in November 2005, BellSouth's \njet carried six Senators and their wives to various Republican and \nDemocratic fundraising events in the Southeast. If they had paid the \nfull charter rate, it would have cost the Democratic and Republican \ncampaign committees more than $40,000. But because of the corporate jet \nperk, it only cost a little more than $8,000.\n  There is going to be a lot of talk in the coming days about how \nimportant\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nit is to ban free meals and fancy gifts, and I couldn't agree more, but \nif we are going to go ahead and call a $50 lunch unethical, I can't see \nwhy we wouldn't do the same for the $32,000 that BellSouth is offering \nin the form of airplane discounts. That is why I applaud Senator Reid \non his amendment to require Members to pay the full charter rate for \nthe use of corporate jets.\n  As I said, I understand that for many Members, these jets are an \nissue of convenience. They allow us to get home to our constituents, to \nour families, and to the events that are often necessary for our jobs. \nBut in November, the American people told us very clearly they are \ntired of the influence special interest wields over the legislative \nprocess. The vast majority of Americans can't afford to buy cheap rides \non corporate jets. They don't get to sit with us on 3-hour flights and \ntalk about the heating bills they can't pay, or the health care costs \nthat keep rising, or the taxes they can't afford, or their concerns \nabout college tuition. They can't buy our attention, and they shouldn't \nhave to. And the corporation lobbyists shouldn't be able to either. \nThat is why we need to end this corporate jet perk if we are to pass \nreal, meaningful ethics reform.\n  The truth is, we cannot change the way Washington works unless we \nfirst change the way Congress works. On November 7, voters gave us the \nchance to do this, but if we miss this opportunity to clean up our act \nand restore this country's faith in Government, the American people \nmight not give us another opportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both the substitute amendment and the \nReid amendment to close the corporate jet loophole. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be added as a cosponsor to the Reid-McConnell amendment \nNo. 3 and Reid amendment No. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, there are some Senators here who want \nto offer an amendment. I simply want to make a brief response to my \nfriend from Illinois and his comments about corporate jets.\n  I have seen firsthand exactly what he is talking about, where a \ncorporate jet picks you up, takes you to a fairly remote location, and \nit is not only well stocked with food and drink but with experts who \nwill fill you in on what it is they want you to know.\n  There is another side of it, however. As the Senate knows, I am \nunburdened with a legal education, but there is one phrase that comes \nout of the legal profession and I think applies here, which is: Hard \ncases make bad law. I am speaking now for the most senior Republican \nwho will very much speak for himself on this issue, but I think in this \ncontext it is appropriate to insert these remarks.\n  In the State of Alaska, the only way one can get to 70 percent of the \npopulation locations in Alaska is by air. I suppose one could get there \nby dogsled, but as a practical matter, the only way you get there is by \nair.\n  That being the case, there are planes flying all over Alaska every \nday, and virtually all of them are owned by corporations.\n  The corporate executive is flying from Anchorage to point A or from \nJuneau to point B, or whatever, and says to the Senator: I am going \nthere; can I give you a ride? There is no charter rate for these kinds \nof activities. Some of the planes are pretty small. But this is the \nonly way you can get around in that State.\n  A Senator said this morning in our breakfast meeting: In my State, I \ncan get to every location in the State in less than an hour by \nautomobile. I have been in the State of Delaware. It is hard to stay in \nthe State of Delaware by automobile. But if you go to some of the large \nStates of the West--Alaska being obviously the largest--and an \nabsolute, firm ban on any kind of flight on corporate jets unless you \nare paying commercial hourly rates for the charter is to say to the \nSenators of Alaska: You cannot travel around your State; you can't \ncommunicate.\n  Utah is a smaller State than Alaska. I don't take flights around Utah \nvery often. I spend a lot of time in the car. From one end of the State \nto the other, it takes about 4 hours by car. Sometimes it is easier to \ndo that than try to deal with the hassle of getting in and out of \nairports, and many of the places I go don't have airports. But I would \nhope, as we have this debate about corporate jets, that we do not think \nsolely in terms of Halliburton's corporate jet with a single Senator \nsurrounded by lobbyists, and we recognize at the other end of the \nspectrum there are circumstances that require--indeed, common sense \ndictates--the use of corporate jets fully reported, paid for in an \nintelligent way that will allow us to not take a single case and apply \nit to every situation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I regret the Senator from Illinois \nleft the floor because I thought I might ask a question of him. But he \nhas left the floor. I see a Senator on the other side ready to speak, \nso I will defer at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have looked forward to joining this \ndebate. I compliment those leaders who had the foresight to bring this \nvery important issue to the floor of the Senate at the very beginning \nof this new Congress.\n  I worked with many Senators on both sides of the aisle last year. We \nhad a bipartisan working group very focused on ethics and lobbying \nreform. We tried to push forward some bold, significant proposals.\n  In the end, I was rather disappointed, quite frankly, with the final \nproduct as it left the Senate floor. But I am very hopeful that we will \nproduce a stronger, bolder final product now in this new Senate this \nmonth, particularly having listened to the voters and their very clear \nstatements on the issue in the last election.\n\n\n                   amendment no. 5 to amendment no. 3\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, in that regard, I will send up three \namendments to the desk and I ask that they be considered. I call up the \nfirst of those three amendments and I will explain it. I ask that the \npending amendment be set aside for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the application of the Federal Election Campaign \n                     Act of 1971 to Indian tribes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. APPLICATION OF FECA TO INDIAN TRIBES.\n\n       (a) Contributions and Expenditures by Corporations.--\n     Section 316 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 441b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Treatment of Indian Tribes as Corporations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In this section, the term `corporation' \n     includes an unincorporated Indian tribe.\n       ``(2) Treatment of members as stockholders.--In applying \n     this subsection, a member of an unincorporated Indian tribe \n     shall be treated in the same manner as a stockholder of a \n     corporation.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to any election that occurs after \n     December 31, 2007.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this amendment is very simple. It \nattacks what is a very significant loophole in current campaign finance \nlaw, and that is a big and gaping loophole with regard to Indian \ntribes. As you know, under Federal campaign finance law, entities such \nas corporations, labor unions, et cetera, can participate in the \nFederal political process, but they need to do that, in terms of \ncontributions and finances, through PACs, through political action \ncommittees. That is not true with regard to Indian tribes. Indian \ntribes, unlike every other entity, unlike corporations, unlike labor \nunions, unlike every entity under the Sun, can give money directly from \ntheir tribal revenues--including, of course, their biggest source of \nrevenue right now, which is gambling revenue. So they can take that \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\nsource of money and use that directly, through the leadership vote of \nthe tribe, to give money to political candidates.\n  In addition, there is another part of this big loophole, and that is \nthat some of the cumulative giving limits that apply to every other \nentity out there--corporations, labor unions, et cetera--do not apply \nto Indian tribes. Again, this is a very glaring loophole under present \nFederal campaign finance law. I do not think there is any good \nrationale or argument under the Sun to retain it.\n  I strongly urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to \ntake a good, hard look at this and vote for and support this very \nsimple amendment which simply closes that loophole.\n  We may have some Member stand on the Senate floor and say: It may be \na good idea, but we need to put it off. We are going to look at \ncampaign finance later. We need to talk about this later in a different \ncontext.\n  I strongly disagree. When we think about the events of the last year, \nwhen we think about the debate, the national concern about corruption \nand cronyism, certainly there are big stories having to do with Indian \ntribes at the center of this. Some of the worst abusers of those \nsituations were not the tribal members nor the tribal leadership \nthemselves, but certainly it involved Indian tribes, and certainly the \nenormous amount of money available to the tribes because of gambling \nrevenue was at the heart of those very bad situations.\n  I think we need to address this now. We need to hit it dead on. It is \nvery much part of the stories and concerns we have heard about over the \nlast year or two. Again, this is very simple, straightforward and very \nfair--which is to treat Indian tribes exactly as we treat other \nentities, such as corporations, such as labor unions, et cetera. \nCertainly allow them to participate in the political process, certainly \nallow them to fully support candidates of their choice but make them do \nthat through setting up PACs, not simply allow them to spend their \ngambling revenue or other proceeds directly and in many cases without \nsome of the overall limits that apply to other entities such as \ncorporations.\n  With that, I will be happy to answer any questions or participate in \nany debate on the floor. I, also, have two other amendments at the \ndesk. Whenever it is in order, I ask to call up those so we may discuss \nthose as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 6 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and call up my second amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 6 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit authorized committees and leadership PACs from \n employing the spouse or immediate family members of any candidate or \n           Federal office holder connected to the committee)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PROHIBITION ON EMPLOYMENT OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF A \n                   CANDIDATE OR FEDERAL OFFICE HOLDER BY CERTAIN \n                   POLITICAL COMMITTEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title III of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     after section 324 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 325. PROHIBITION ON EMPLOYMENT OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF A \n                   CANDIDATE OR FEDERAL OFFICE HOLDER BY CERTAIN \n                   POLITICAL COMMITTEES.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any authorized \n     committee of a candidate or any other political committee \n     established, maintained, or controlled by a candidate or a \n     person who holds a Federal office to employ--\n       ``(1) the spouse of such candidate or Federal office \n     holder; or\n       ``(2) any immediate family member of such candidate or \n     Federal office holder.\n       ``(b) Immediate Family Member.--For purposes of subsection \n     (a), the term `immediate family member' means a son, \n     daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, \n     mother, father, stepmother, stepfather, mother-in-law, \n     father-in-law, brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister of \n     the Member.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this is a second amendment of a package \nof amendments I am presenting to the full Senate. As I did with the \nfirst amendment, what I would like to do--and I have had discussions \nwith the Chair and ranking member, the participants who are leading the \nfloor debate--is I will briefly explain this amendment. I will \ncertainly be happy to engage in a fuller debate at a later time and \nhave a full vote on this amendment, as with the previous one, at a \nlater time, hopefully, in the next few days.\n  This amendment, also, directly addresses a situation that has clearly \narisen and clearly caused great concern among the American people in \nthe last couple of years. That is family members of Members of \nCongress, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, making money--\nbeing paid, in some cases, very large amounts of money--while being \nemployed by that candidate's PAC. Under present law, it is perfectly \nlegal. It certainly doesn't pass the ``smell'' test in the hearts and \nminds of many Americans, but it is perfectly legal for a Member's \ncampaign to hire a family member, a spouse, a child, any close family \nmember--to help take care of the business of that PAC and be \ncompensated for it, in some cases, with very significant salaries.\n  Let me say at the outset, I believe there are ways that could be done \nproperly and ethically. The problem is, as is the case in so many of \nthese questions, that there are also many ways where it can be and is \nand has been abused, so it basically puts a family member on the \npayroll of an entity that the Member of the House or the Senate \ncontrols. There is no real governing entity that polices the situation. \nNo one knows whether that person shows up for work or for how many \nhours or how significant that work is. At the end of the day, through \nthat family member, the family enjoys a significant additional income \nbecause that Member of the House or Senate is in politics and controls \nthat PAC.\n  Again, this is not a theoretical problem yet to happen. This is not a \nsolution waiting for a problem. This has been done in real life. This \nhas clearly been abused in the past. It has clearly been a conduit for \nMembers to gain family income through entities they control. I think, \nbecause of that abuse, because of the real erosion of public confidence \nwe have seen in Congress because of abuses such as this over the last \nseveral years, there is only one sure and clean way to solve the \nproblem and that is to simply have a bright-line test and say: \nImmediate family members can't get paid by the Member's PAC. We are not \ngoing to allow that. You have to hire a nonfamily member for these \nadministrative roles so that no one can abuse the situation and put an \nimmediate family member on the payroll, often at a very significant \nsalary.\n  Again, my amendment is very simple. It says no immediate family \nmember can be hired by the candidate's campaign or leadership PAC, and \nit defines immediate family member the same way section 110 of last \nyear's Senate-passed bill defined that term, and that is son, daughter, \nstepson, stepdaughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother, father, \nstepmother, stepfather, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother, sister, \nstepbrother or stepsister or spouse. It is straightforward, a bright-\nline rule. To me it is very clear that is the only way we are going to \nstop this abuse that has occurred in the past and rebuild the \nconfidence of the American people.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 7 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  With that, if it is appropriate, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthat amendment and call up my third amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 7 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to establish \ncriminal penalties for knowingly and willfully falsifying or failing to \n file or report certain information required to be reported under that \n                      Act, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. KNOWING AND WILLFUL FALSIFICATION OR FAILURE TO \n                   REPORT.\n\n       Section 104(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 \n     U.S.C. App.) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)'';\n       (2) in paragraph (1), as so designated, by striking \n     ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$50,000''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2)(A) It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly \n     and willfully falsify, or to knowingly and willingly fails to \n     file or report, any information that such person is required \n     to report under section 102.\n       ``(B) Any person who violates subparagraph (A) shall be \n     fined under title 18, United States Code, imprisoned for not \n     more than 1 year, or both.''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, this third amendment is also very clear \nand straightforward. It increases the penalties significantly in cases \nin which there is not just a mistake on a financial disclosure form but \na knowing and willful and purposeful attempt to hide information that \nthe Member knows is supposed to be made public under the law. It \nincreases those penalties on the civil side, and it, also, under the \nappropriate circumstances, creates criminal penalties for that.\n  Again, I think this goes to the heart of the erosion of public \nconfidence because of lobbyists and ethics lapses and abuses over the \nlast several years which have clearly involved Members of Congress. \nSome are in jail now as we speak because of those abuses.\n  This is a very clear and necessary way to remedy those past abuses \nand that erosion of public confidence. I think it is very important \nthat these penalties are serious on the civil side and on the criminal \nside but that they only apply to cases where there is knowing and \nwillful misrepresentation, where there is an active and a clear attempt \nto hide facts, to not comply with the law. Clerical or other mistakes \ndon't cut it. That is not worthy of these very serious civil and, in \nsome cases, criminal penalties. But a knowing and willful \nmisrepresentation, an active attempt to hide facts from the public that \nthe law clearly mandates be made public, that is a different story. We \nneed a zero tolerance policy for that.\n  Again, my amendment increases those penalties on the civil side and \non the criminal side, and I urge all the Members of the Senate to \nsupport this very important amendment to rebuild that credibility of \nthis body and of the House.\n  In closing, let me say, again, I welcome this activity on the Senate \nfloor. I welcome this debate. I compliment Majority Leader Reid and all \nothers who made this decision to put this issue front and center, \nfirst, on the Senate floor in the new Senate. I am eager to pass a \nstrong, responsible bill to restore, to build up over time--it will not \nhappen overnight--the confidence of the American people in our \ninstitutions.\n  Since I first came to the Senate, I have worked with various \nSenators, including a bipartisan working group on these issues, on \nthese proposals last year. But I don't think we went far enough last \nyear. Clearly, we didn't pass a bill through the entire process. But \neven the bill we passed through the Senate I don't think was strong \nenough. It did not address some of these crucial areas, including the \nIndian tribal campaign finance loophole, including the area of abuse \nwhere candidates and Members can put family members on the PAC campaign \npayroll, including making sure we increase civil and criminal penalties \nfor knowing and willful violations.\n  My amendments will do this, and I urge all of my colleagues to take a \ngood, hard look at them. Tomorrow, I will be introducing two, possibly \nthree, other amendments, and I look forward to debating those as \nwell. I appreciate the helpfulness of the managers. I look forward to \ncoming back to these amendments to call them up for full debate and \nvote.\n\n  I yield my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am happy to see the Senator from \nMontana presiding.\n  I am very pleased to speak about ethics and lobbying reform and the \nbill we will consider over the next week or so.\n  To start, what a pleasure it is to have a majority here that not only \nsupports reform but recognizes the importance of dealing with this \nissue immediately in this new Congress. There is no better way to show \nthe American people that things have changed in Washington and will \ncontinue to change than by taking up and passing strong ethics and \nlobbying reforms right away. I thank Majority Leader Reid for making a \ndecision to start our work in this new Congress with this issue. This \nis the right thing to do.\n  Ethical conduct in Government should not be an aspiration, it should \nbe a given. For too long, the public has had to open the morning papers \nand read about how Congress is mired in scandal rather than about how \nwe are going to deal with the really tough problems) facing our \ncountry. We might wish that rules aren't necessary, but time has \nproven, over and over again, that they are. And once there are rules, \nthere seem always to be people who want to bend those rules or skate as \nclose to the line as they can. And sometimes they fall or jump over \nthat line. And so the rules need to be revisited and toughened, based \non experience.\n  Just over a year ago, it looked like the Jack Abramoff scandal had \nfinally lit a fuse under the Congress. Soaring promises were made that \nreform was on the way last year. Bills were introduced, hearings were \nheld, and ultimately both the House and Senate considered legislation \non the floor. But there was always a sense that what was going on was \njust a show. It was clear that many of those in charge wanted to change \nas little as possible. It seemed like the Republican leaders in the \nHouse believed that the public really didn't care about these issues. \nFirst they attached major campaign finance reform provisions to the \nbill the Senate passed, and then they let it die.\n  We found out on November 7 just how wrong they were. The new faces in \nthis Senate are the direct result of the public's distaste for how the \nlast Congress handled this issue, and many others. So now it is time \nfor real action. And the public will again be watching closely to see \nhow we perform.\n  We start our work today on S. 1, which is the same bill that the \nSenate approved last year, by a vote of 90-8. Last year, I was one of \nthe eight. I thought the bill was too weak in some very significant \nways. And so today, along with the junior Senators from Illinois and \nConnecticut, Senators Obama and Lieberman, I have introduced the \nLobbying and Ethics Reform Act. This is our attempt to say what we \nthink the Senate's final product should look like when we finish our \nwork on S. 1.\n\n  I do not intend to offer this new bill as a complete substitute. \nInstead, I will seek to I have important provisions of this bill added \nas amendments to S. 1. I am happy to say that a number of the \nsuggestions that we make in our bill have been accepted by the majority \nleader. Some are included in his substitute, which is the base bill for \nthis legislation. Some very important additional improvements are \nincluded in the Reid first degree amendment. This is a very good start \nfor this debate, to improve the bill right at the outset.\n  I take a few minutes as we start this debate to talk about some of \nthe most important issues that we must address in this bill. First, we \nneed an airtight lobbyist gift ban. No loopholes, no ambiguity. We took \na first step towards banning gifts from lobbyists, including meals, \ntickets, and everything else, in last year's bill, but we left open a \nbig loophole. If we do nothing else to improve last year's effort, we \nhave to close that loophole.\n  I am not going to stand here and say that any Senator's vote can be \npurchased for a free meal or a ticket to a football game. But I don't \nthink anyone can argue that lobbyists are providing these perks out of \nthe goodness\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nof their hearts, either. At this point, no reform bill is going to be \ncredible unless it contains a strict lobbyist gift ban.\n  No one has ever explained to me why Members of Congress need to be \nallowed to accept free meals, tickets, or any other gift from a \nlobbyist. If you really want to have dinner with a lobbyist, no one is \nsaying that you can't. Just take out your credit card and pay your own \nway. I can tell my colleagues from personal experience that you \nwill survive just fine under a no-gifts policy. The Wisconsin \nLegislature has such a policy and I brought it here with me to \nWashington. I don't go hungry. We need to just stop the practice of \neating out at the expense of others. It is not necessary. It looks bad. \nAnd it leads to abuses.\n\n  I am happy to say that Senator Reid agrees that the lobbyist gift ban \nis not a ban if organizations that retain or employ lobbyists can still \ngive gifts. He is prepared to close the loophole in S. 1 that would \nallow that to continue. His amendment does that and I support it.\n  Another important shortcoming of S. 1 is in the area of privately \nfunded travel. That was the issue that leapt to the fore when Jack \nAbramoff pled guilty just a little over a year ago. Abramoff took \nMembers of Congress on ``fact finding trips'' to Scotland where they \nwent shopping and golfed at St. Andrews. It was a scandal and Members \nof Congress were falling all over each other in a race to do something \nabout it. But just a few months later, the Senate passed a bill that \ndid almost nothing at all about it.\n  My staff keeps a file of invitations for fact-finding trips for \nstaff. Here are a few from over the years. A ``legislative issues \nseminar'' on St. Michaels Island, sponsored by MCI World Com, with \ndinner at the Inn at Perry Cabin; a trip to Silicon Valley sponsored by \nthe Information Technology Industry Council, with dinner sponsored by \nthe Wine Institute; a ``congressional field trip'' sponsored by GTE to \nTampa and Clearwater Beach. The invitation reads:\n\n       To take advantage of the terrific location beside Tampa Bay \n     and the Gulf of Mexico, we'll demonstrate that you can place \n     a cellular call over water, either while dining aboard a boat \n     or fishing for that night's dinner.\n\n  These kinds of ``fact finding trips'' paid for by industry groups \nwere left untouched by the bill the Senate passed. That was one of the \nreasons I voted against the bill.\n  Fortunately, the new House leadership recognized the need to do \nsomething about privately funded travel, even if they weren't prepared \nto prohibit it entirely. The House passed a rules change on the first \nday of the session to allow only trips sponsored by groups that don't \nemploy or retain lobbyists. The only trips that groups that lobby can \noffer are to a one day event--to make a speech, for example. This is a \nmajor improvement, especially because lobbyist participation in \norganizing, arranging, or planning these trips would be strictly \nlimited.\n\n  There are many things that could be done about privately funded \ntravel, but at the very least we should not have more lenient travel \nrules than the House of Representatives. Again, I am pleased that \nSenator Reid supports the House travel rules and I hope we will adopt \nhis amendment that brings us in line with those rules.\n  When I introduced my lobbying reform bill back in July 2005, it \nincluded a provision addressing the abuse of Members flying on \ncorporate jets. At that time, I have to say, it seemed like a fantasy \nthat we would actually pass such a provision. I heard complaint after \ncomplaint about it, that we shouldn't do it.\n  Slowly but surely, many people have come around to where the public \nis: Corporate jet travel is a real abuse. Sure, it is convenient, but \nit is based on a fiction--that the fair market value of such a trip is \njust the cost of a first class ticket. And when that fiction is applied \nto political travel, it creates a loophole in the ban on corporate \ncontributions that we have had in this country for over a century. Any \nlegislation on corporate jets must include campaign trips as well as \nofficial travel because one thing is for certain--the lobbyist for the \ncompany that provides the jet is likely to be on the flight, whether it \nis taking you to see a factory back home or a fundraiser for your \ncampaign.\n  Our bill does that. It covers all of the possible uses of corporate \njets, and amends all of the Senate rules needed to put in place a \nstrong reform, and the Federal election laws as well. From now on, if \nyou want to fly on a corporate jet, you will have to pay the charter \nrate. And these flights shouldn't be an opportunity for the lobbyist or \nCEO of the company that owns the jet to have several hours alone with a \nSenator. Our bill prohibits that as well. This is what the American \npeople have been calling for. There are no loopholes or ambiguities \nhere. Politicians flying on private planes for cheap will be a thing of \nthe past if we can get this provision into the bill. Senator Reid's \namendment includes a tough corporate jet provision. I am pleased to \nsupport that portion of the amendment. This is a big deal, and I \ncommend the majority leader for taking this step.\n\n  Another issue on which I hope we will make some improvements in this \nbill is the revolving door between between Government service and \nlobbying firms. One of the things that really sticks in the craw of the \npeople back home is the idea that politicians use their government \nservice as a stepping stone to lucrative lobbying careers. And they \nalso believe, rightly in some cases, that former Members who are \nlobbyists have special access and influence over their former \ncolleagues. We have a criminal statute that prohibits former Senators \nfrom lobbying the Congress for a year after they leave office. The same \ntough provisions apply to top officials in the executive branch.\n  But experience has shown that these provisions don't really get at \nthe problem. The cooling off period is too short. Our bill doubles it. \nAnd the cooling off period has become more of a warming up period for \nsome Members of Congress who move on to work for an organization with \ninterests in legislation. They basically run the lobbying show behind \nthe scenes during the time they can't lobby their colleagues directly.\n  Is it too much to ask a Member of Congress who leaves office to take \na 2-year breather before accepting money from an employer for trying to \ninfluence Congress? I don't think so. We are talking here about highly \ntalented and highly employable people. There are so many employers, \nso many worthy causes, that would benefit from their talents and \nexperience, doing things other than trying to influence legislation. \nFortunately, the Lobbying Disclosure Act has a ready made definition of \n``lobbying activities'' that is broader than lobbying contacts. Our \nbill's revolving door provision prohibits Members of Congress from \nengaging in lobbying activities for 2 years after leaving office, not \njust lobbying contacts. That would make the revolving door restrictions \nreally mean something.\n\n  I believe that is what the public wants--restrictions that mean \nsomething, not rules for show, with hidden loopholes and not a system \nof rules with lax enforcement. That is why our bill includes the \nLieberman-Collins proposal for an Office of Public Integrity to \ninvestigate ethics complaints and make recommendations to the Ethics \nCommittee on whether to take action. It is certainly time that this \nproposal receive very serious consideration. We are on the cusp of \nmaking some very significant changes to our own rules. Let's not \nundermine what we are accomplishing by leaving unaddressed the very \nreal need for tough and independent enforcement.\n  I also believe this bill must go further in addressing earmarks. \nSenator McCain's bill, which I have cosponsored, includes a provision \nthat would allow the Senate to strip out earmarks for unauthorized \nspending. This is an important reform and I hope it can be added to the \nbill.\n  Thus far, I have talked only about ethics rules, but the bill on the \nfloor contains some very significant improvements to our lobbying \ndisclosure laws as well. The current law, the Lobbying Disclosure Act, \nwhich was enacted in 1995, was itself a landmark reform, the first \nchange in nearly 50 years to the original Federal Regulation of \nLobbying Act. I was here when the LDA passed, under the leadership of \nthe Senator of Michigan, Mr. Levin. It is an important and effective \nlaw.\n  A decade of experience has shown, however, that it has shortcomings. \nThe\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\nbill on the floor includes some important improvements. My bill \nincorporates those improvements and also adds some--requiring \ndisclosure by lobbyists of the earmarks they try to get for their \nclients, and requiring lobbyists and lobbying organizations to file \nseparate reports on their political contributions and fundraising. The \nuse of campaign contributions as a lobbying tool is well known in this \ncity and in this Senate. It is time that our lobbying disclosure laws \nreflected that. And we should cover all of the tools in the lobbyist's \nwork bench, not just direct contributions but the collection or \nbundling of the contributions of others. Lobbyists wield influence by \nserving as fundraisers, not just be giving money themselves.\n  I have high hopes for this debate. After a false start last year, we \ncan get this job done. The House has moved quickly to pass new ethics \nrules. It is our turn now. And we can lead the way with serious \nlobbying disclosure reforms. I am looking forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides to start this Congress with a real \naccomplishment. If we do this, the public's confidence in how we tackle \nthe many pressing issues before us will be greatly enhanced. That, in \nthe end, is the best reason to undertake these reforms. They are the \nfoundation on which the rest of our work together stands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Pay-Go\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly, not specifically \non this bill, although it is related to this bill. I will have an \namendment to this bill. Hopefully, I can offer that tomorrow. But since \nthere is a lull in activities, I want to speak briefly on something the \nHouse has recently done as part of its 100-hour agenda. It has passed \nlanguage which is euphemistically referred to as pay-go.\n  I think it is important to understand what the implications of that \nlanguage are because it gives definition to the House leadership rather \nquickly in this whole process of where we are going in the area of \nfiscal responsibility as a country because what this language \nessentially does is guarantee tax increases, but it has virtually no \nimpact on spending restraint.\n  It has been given this motherhood title ``pay-go'' when, in fact, it \nshould be called and more accurately is described as ``tax-go.''\n  The implications of this language are pretty simple. It says that \nwhen a tax cut lapses or comes to the end of its term, that tax cut \nwill be raised back to the original rate. So, for example, we today \nhave a tax rate of 10 percent for low-income individuals. That tax cut \nwas put in place back in the early 2000 period under the President's \ntax cuts. That tax cut comes to a close from a statutory standpoint--in \nthe sense that the authorization level of the rate terminates in 2010--\nand that rate will jump back up to the basic rate, which I believe was \n15 percent at the time. So there will be a 5-percent tax increase on \nlow-income Americans who pay taxes. That would be people with over \n$40,000 of income, for all intents and purposes. That is a tax \nincrease.\n  One would think that type of mechanism would also be applied, if one \nis going to use a euphemism such as pay-go, to the spending side of the \naisle, so when the spending program used up its authorized life--let's \ntake, for example, the farm program--and it reaches the end of its \nterm, as the farm program is about to do, at that point, that program, \nwhich is a subsidized program, would have the cost of the original \nprogram go back in place or it would be cut back to having no subsidy \nat all. But that is not the way it works.\n  Under the proposal, entitlement programs are perceived to go on \nforever and to spend money forever at whatever the rate is, even if \ntheir authorization ends. But tax reductions are perceived to end and \ntax rates are perceived to go up. You basically treat the two sides of \nthe ledger entirely differently. On one side of the ledger, taxes go up \nunder this ``tax-go'' proposal if there is no change, and on the other \nside of the ledger, if there is no change, the entitlement spending \ngoes on for that designated program forever without it falling back and \nbeing limited. There is no review of it.\n  The practical implication of this language is that the only thing it \naffects, when you put in place this so-called pay-go, which is really \n``tax-go,'' is the tax side of the ledger. That is the only thing that \ncan be impacted because the entitlement program under the scoring \nmechanisms of our Government don't lapse, don't end. The spending is \nperceived to go on. So pay-go cannot apply to it. You cannot review the \nprogram. It is only on the tax side that it applies.\n  The effect of that is this is a mechanism to force a tax increase \nbecause what this basically says is without 60 votes, you cannot \ncontinue the lower tax rate. But on the entitlement side, you can \ncontinue to spend the money not subject to a 60-vote threshold. Those \nare two different approaches to the two sides of the ledger in the \nCongress.\n  So by taking this action in the House and passing this language, they \nhave essentially said it is their goal to dramatically increase taxes, \nto use the mechanism of alleged pay-go, or ``tax-go,'' to drive major \ntax increases on the American public.\n  If you are on the Democratic side of the aisle in the House, or maybe \neven on the Democratic side in the Senate, that may make sense; you may \nwant to raise taxes. It is the tradition, of course, of the party to \nlike to raise taxes, I guess. That is how they got the title ``tax and \nspend'' fixed to their nomenclature. But this is rather a brash way to \ndo it; to start right out with the first major enforcement mechanism \nfor budget, supposedly, restraint being a mechanism that doesn't reduce \nspending at all, doesn't restrain spending at all. All it does is force \nus to raise taxes or at least be subject to a 60-vote point of order if \nwe want to maintain taxes at their present level.\n  Some may say: We need to raise taxes; the tax burden in America is \nnot large enough on earning Americans, especially on high-income \nAmericans. I fundamentally disagree. Why? Because when one looks at the \npresent law and what is generated in revenues, we are seeing a dramatic \nincrease in revenues in this country. Revenues have jumped in the last \n3 years more than they have jumped in any period in our history. That \nis because we have in place a tax system which has created an incentive \nfor people to go out and invest and undertake economic activity which \nhas, in turn, generated revenues to the Federal Government.\n  Historically, the Federal Government revenues have been about 18.2 \npercent of the gross national product. That is\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nhow much the Federal Government has historically taken out of our \neconomy and spent for the purposes of governance. That is the average.\n  We are now getting back in tax receipts, because of these large \nincreases over the last 3 years, close to 18.4, 18.5 percent of gross \nnational product, so we have actually gone over what is the historical \nlevel of revenues to the Federal Government. We are generating more \nrevenues than the Federal Government historically gets. That is good \nnews.\n  It has been done in the right way, by the way. We have generated this \nextra revenue by creating an atmosphere out there where people are \nwilling to invest in taxable activity. We have seen it over the years. \nIn fact, President Kennedy was the first one to appreciate this, \nfollowed by President Reagan, and then President Bush. When you get tax \nlevels too high--the American people are creative. We are a market \neconomy with an entrepreneurial spirit, and when you raise taxes too \nhigh, people say: I am not going to pay that tax rate. I am going to \ninvest in something that avoids taxes, some highly depreciated \nsomething that expenses items like municipal bonds, something that \nallows me to put my money where I don't have to pay that exorbitant tax \nrate.\n  What has happened, however, under the Kennedy tax cut and the Reagan \ntax cut and the Bush tax cut is when you get taxes at the right level, \nwhen you say to the American entrepreneur and American earner: We are \ngoing to charge you what is a reasonable tax rate on your investment, \nthen the American people go out and they invest in taxable activity. \nThat taxable activity generates jobs and jobs create growth. It also is \na much more efficient way to have money used. You don't have money \ninefficiently being invested for the purpose of avoiding taxes. Money \nis instead invested for the purpose of generating activity, which is \nproductive.\n  As a result, the entire economy rises, as has happened in the last \nfew years, and you generate significant revenues to the Federal \nTreasury, as has happened in the last few years, and is projected, by \nthe way, to continue--both by the CBO and OMB.\n  Some will say: Sure, but that doesn't point out the fact that the \nhigh-income people in America got a huge tax cut under this tax \nproposal. Remember, we are generating more revenue from this tax cut, \nmore revenue than we got before. We had a down period. There are going \nto be a lot of debates about that. My view is it came out of the bubble \nof the late 1990s and the attack of 9/11 and the initial impact of the \ntax cut. But that has all been reversed to a point where we now have an \neconomic situation where we are generating more revenues to the Federal \nGovernment than we have as an historical norm. So we are getting more \nrevenues from this tax system.\n  Interestingly enough, the tax system is more progressive. It is the \nmost progressive it has been in history. The American people with \nincomes in the top 20 percent are paying 85.2 percent of the Federal \ntax burden. The top 20 percent pay 85 percent of the tax burden. That \ncompares to the Clinton years where the top 20 percent were paying 84 \npercent. So, actually, the top 20 percent are absorbing more of the tax \nburden of America, generating more revenues to the Government, and not \nonly that but the bottom 40 percent of American income-earning \nindividuals are getting more back than they did under the Clinton \nyears, almost twice as much.\n  If you earn less than $40,000 in America, you are receiving more back \nthan you did in the Clinton years because of the fact of the earned-\nincome tax credit--in fact, almost, as I said, twice as much.\n  We have a law now that is doing two extraordinary things: it is \ngenerating huge revenues to the Federal Treasury because of the \neconomic activity it is encouraging--creating jobs, creating \ninvestment, creating taxable events--and it has created a more \nprogressive tax system. That is the good news.\n  So why do we want to raise taxes? Why do we want to go back and raise \ntaxes on that situation? I don't think we should. But if you follow the \npay-go proposal that has been brought forward by the House, that is the \nonly option that occurs as these tax policies start to lapse in the \nyear 2010.\n  I would probably be willing to fight that fight. In fact, I am \nwilling to fight that fight if we treated the spending side of the \nledger the same way under pay-go, or under ``tax go,'' as I call it, \nbut we don't. As I mentioned earlier, because of the way the baseline \nworks around here, the spending side of the ledger does not have to be \nlooked at under the pay-go rules. You can continue to spend on those \nentitlement programs whatever is in their traditional spending \npatterns, whatever they are, plus increases as a result of more people \nusing them. Granted, you can't create new entitlement programs. Those \nwould be subject to pay-go. And you can't dramatically expand the \nprograms. For example, the Part D premium would have been subject to \npay-go--was subject to pay-go. But that is only a small portion of the \nspending issue. The real essence of the spending issue is the \nunderlying entitlement, as is, of course, the essence of the tax side, \nthe underlying rate.\n\n  What you have essentially done is create a mechanism which, because \nof the way we score spending versus taxes, causes taxes to be subject \nto a 60-vote point of order but does not cause spending to be subject \nto the same discipline. So the practical implications of it are that it \nwill basically be used primarily as a force for forcing tax increases \non the American people. That is almost automatically, by the way, \nbecause in 2010 these taxes that are in place, these tax rate changes, \nlapse. Under the rules they will be subject to a 60-vote point of order \nand getting 60 votes around here for a tax cut, as we know, is pretty \ndifficult.\n  This is the problem with pay-go as it is presently structured. \nInterestingly enough, the House has also done this in a way that \ndoesn't even go to the traditional pay-go rules, which would involve \nsequester, as I understand it. They have done this outside the \nstatutory process. They have done it as a rule and therefore the true \nenforcement mechanism against a new entitlement, to the extent pay-go \nwould apply against a new entitlement, would be sequester.\n  What is sequester? It essentially says that either you offset the new \nspending with spending cuts somewhere or else you have an automatic \nevent which does it for you across the board. That is the right way to \ndo this. You should have a sequester. So the failure to get sequester \nas part of the exercise just once again shows that there isn't a \nseriousness of purpose in this rule as it was passed by the House \nrelative to spending restraint. There is only a seriousness of purpose \nrelative to making sure that taxes go up. You really can't defend that \nposition unless you are willing to take the position that really what \nwe are interested in is raising taxes because otherwise, to defend that \nposition, you would have to say: Yes, but we didn't want it to apply to \nentitlement programs that already exist. And even if there is a new \nentitlement program we didn't want it to apply to that new entitlement \nprogram with any enforcement mechanism that might actually require us \nto cut spending. We will just sort of finesse that one. The only thing \nwe really want this to be required to attach to is whether taxes go up \nin 2010.\n  So I do think it is ironic, if not a bit disingenuous, to have one of \nthe first major items of principle upon which the House Democratic \nleadership is going to stand be that they want a rule that puts in \nplace the requirement that we raise taxes. In my opinion, it shows \nthere maybe is a superficial purpose relative to actually defending and \ncontrolling spending.\n  I have not been one to shrink from pointing out that my side has not \ndone a great job on spending restraint. I have been rather definitive \nabout that. But I do think that it is inappropriate to start this \nCongress with the statement that we are going to be fiscally \ndisciplined and then claim that fiscal discipline is going to be hung \non one rule. And that appears to be the only thing done over there on \nthe issue of, as they say, ``fiscal discipline,'' one rule which as a \npractical matter has no practical effect on spending restraint. None.\n  There are ways to correct this. There are ways to make this rule a \nstatute. In fact, the Senator from North Dakota has proposed that. \nThere are ways to make this rule apply appropriately to\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nrestraining entitlements as well as restraining the issue of tax \npolicy, if that is what you want to do. I might be inclined to support \nsuch a rule if it were balanced, if it said we are going to be as \naggressive on the issue of spending restraint and entitlements as we \nare going to be aggressive on the issue of defining how taxes are \napplied, but that is not the case. That is not the case at all.\n  This is a rule that comes at us, that treats these two accounts \ndifferently and inappropriately in the sense that it treats one as \napples, one as oranges, and then says we are only going to deal with \nthe apples.\n  It is not good policy. For some reason, unfortunately, it has managed \nto take on a life of its own relative to this nomenclature--pay-go--so \nthat there is almost a sacrosanctness to it. We had an idea around here \nfor years called the lockbox which took on that same sort of sacrosanct \nconcept even though it also was a bit illusory as to what it \naccomplished versus what it claimed to accomplish. This proposal has \nthe same problem. It is illusory as to what it accomplishes compared to \nwhat it claims to accomplish. It does accomplish the raising of taxes. \nIt does not accomplish the disciplining of the entitlement side of the \nspending accounts.\n  I understand that this matter is probably not going to be raised on \nour side until we get to the budget process. That may or may not be the \nright place to raise this issue because if you are going to do it \nstatutorily, which is actually the way you should do it, the budget \nprocess can't accomplish that. But should we, and when we do approach \nthis topic, I hope we can amend this in a manner which would allow us \nto have it play fairly so that we had apples on both sides of the \nagenda, both sides of the ledger, or oranges on both sides of the \nledger, so that an entitlement program, when it reached its authorizing \nterm, would have to be subject to the issue--not new entitlements, but \nthe actual underlying entitlement. When you have a tax program, when it \nhits its authorized life, it would be subject to the same. That would \nbe the right way to do it, but it is not the way the House did it, and \nit wasn't done that way intentionally.\n  I would like to think that it was just inadvertent that they left out \nentitlements, but it is not. They left it out because the driving \nthrust--and I think the reason it has taken on such a life of its own \nin the nomenclature--the driving thrust is to use this as a mechanism \nto basically attack the tax cuts of the early 2000 period. It is not an \nattempt to restrain the rate of growth of this Government on the \nentitlement accounts.\n  Why do we need to restrain the rate of growth on the entitlement \naccounts? It is very simple. The numbers are stark, they are there, and \neverybody agrees to them. By the year 2025, three accounts in this \nGovernment--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--will absorb 20 \npercent of the gross national product, 20 percent. By the year 2040 \nthey will be absorbing almost 30 percent of the gross national product. \nIf you recall what I said earlier--which I can understand that you \ndon't because I have been going on for a long time--the revenues of the \nFederal Government are only 18.4 percent of the Federal gross national \nproduct. So, by 2025, because of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration, we will simply be unable to afford this Government unless \nwe are going to radically increase the tax burden on all Americans, \nworking Americans. It is pretty obvious to me you can't tax your way \nout of this problem. You cannot put a burden on the next generation of \n22, 23, 24 percent of gross national product as being their tax burden \nbecause that means you deny them the ability to live a lifestyle like \nwe are living. You deny them the extra dollars they would need to send \ntheir children to college, to buy their homes, to be able to do what \nthey want to do with their life, because all of that money is going to \ngo to taxes to pay for all the entitlements on the books which we have \nto pay for as a result of the retired generation.\n\n  You cannot tax your way out of this issue, even if we agree with the \nstatic models that say as you raise taxes, you get more revenue. I \nhappen to not believe in that. We have proven with Kennedy, Reagan, and \nBush cuts that does not work. Even if you were to accept you cannot tax \nyour way out of this problem, you have to address the spending side of \nthe ledger. That is why you have to have a real pay-go rule--not a tax-\ngo rule, a pay-go rule--that actually does address the spending side of \nthe ledger aggressively as it addresses the tax side of the ledger or \nyou should not have the rule at all, because you are basically \nprejudicing us to move down the road of tax increases and not \naddressing the fundamental problem, the fundamental issue that is \ndriving the problem our children will confront, which is they are going \nto get a country they cannot afford. Our generation is going to give \nthem a country they cannot afford. That is not right for one generation \nto do to another generation.\n  There are ways to address this. There are substantive ways to address \nit. The Senator from North Dakota has been one of the leaders and now, \nas chairman of the Budget Committee, gets to be the leader--I welcome \nhim to that role--in trying to come to some resolution on this whole \nissue of how you get to the balance between spending and taxes in the \nface of the human demographic, this huge retirement that will occur and \nthe pressures it will put on our society.\n  We are getting off on the wrong foot if we simply say we are just \ngoing to do it on the tax side of the ledger. That is essentially what \nthis proposal that came out of the House does. There are better ways to \ndo it. There are better ways to structure the proposal. The issue has \nto be addressed. It means as a society we have to address it. We simply \ncannot do it on the tax side of the ledger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from North Dakota will yield,\n  I wonder if we have any information that is available with regard to \na vote or votes tonight that Members can be made aware of. Does the \nSenator from North Dakota have any information on that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand Senator Feinstein might have had some \ninformation she could provide on that. I know there are Senators \nwaiting to hear the expected schedule for tonight.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Are we still in debate on the underlying \nethics and lobbying bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein is in the Senate.\n  If the Senator from North Dakota would yield briefly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield so colleagues know plans for the \nevening.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, we have three amendments so far by Senator \nVitter. They are being vetted with respect to committees. We are not at \nthe present time prepared for a vote. My view is the likelihood of a \nvote tonight is remote. I have been in our cloakroom trying to learn if \nI can say there are no more votes. The closest I can come is to say the \nlikelihood of a vote is not high. Does that help the Senator?\n  Mr. President, I very sincerely urge Members, please come to the \nfloor if Members have amendments. Please file amendments. Please speak \nto your amendments. We will never finish this bill unless Members are \nhere. The floor has been open all afternoon for amendments. With the \nexception of one Senator, there are no amendments before the Senate. I \nhope Members are listening. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry to interrupt my colleague. If I could ask the \nSenator to yield for a moment, through the Chair, I ask the Senator \nfrom California as the manager of this bill if she would have any \nobjection if we made it official that there will be no votes further \nthis evening.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have been asking to do just that for 1 hour. Yes, \nof course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think we should do that in respect to schedules.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I respect the Senator for getting the job done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let us also encourage, admonish our colleagues that we \nwill have some votes in the morning and get the bill moving. We want to \nget\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\nthis bill finished. We will stay in session next week until this bill \nis finished. It is better to frontload it with activity. That means if \nanyone has a serious amendment, come on down tomorrow morning because \nwe would like to bring it to the Senate floor for consideration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, the Senator from Illinois is absolutely \nright. I made three appeals for amendments thus far. What I am \nconcerned about is at the very end of the consideration of the bill, we \nwill be flooded with amendments and not have the time to debate the \nmatter. Now is that time. The Senator is absolutely correct. Hopefully \nwe will both be listened to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                                 Pay-Go\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the Senate to respond to my \ncolleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, with respect to the issue of \npay-go. People deserve to hear the other side of the story.\n  I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, who has left the Senate \nfloor, that is one of the most creative presentations on pay-go I have \never heard. And very little of it matches the description I would give \nof pay-go.\n  The first thing I point out, the Senator from New Hampshire used to \nbe a strong supporter of pay-go. In fact, this is what he said in 2002, \n4\\1/2\\ years ago:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or if \n     you are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event that also lapses.\n       . . . If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place \n     caps and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline \n     in this Congress, and, as a result, will dramatically \n     aggravate the deficit which, of course, impacts important \n     issues, but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  He was right. Now we have seen a dramatic transformation in his \nposition. He was exactly right.\n  Look at the evidence. He said it would aggravate the deficits if we \ndid not have pay-go. We can now look at the record. We have now been 6 \nyears without effective pay-go discipline in this Senate. What has \nhappened? The debt of the country has exploded. The debt is now $8.5 \ntrillion and it is headed for $11.6 trillion under the budget plan our \ncolleagues on the side opposite offered in this Senate.\n  They did exactly what he predicted almost 5 years ago without pay-go \ndiscipline. Deficits and debt have exploded, and increasingly this debt \nis being financed from abroad. In fact, it took 42 Presidents--all \nthese Presidents pictured here--224 years to run up $1 trillion of U.S. \ndebt held abroad. This President has more than doubled that amount in \njust 5 years.\n  The absence of pay-go or effective pay-go is not the sole reason for \nthis, but it is one reason. The Senator from New Hampshire himself \npredicted that back in 2002. He said that pay-go requires a tax \nincrease. Wrong. Pay-go doesn't require a tax increase. What pay-go \ndoes is say this: If you want new tax cuts, you have to pay for them or \nget a supermajority vote.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire then says, there is no spending \ndiscipline. Wrong again, because pay-go says you can't have new \nmandatory spending. Remember, mandatory spending is well over half of \nthe budget: Medicare, Social Security--those are examples of mandatory \nspending. And pay-go says you can't have new mandatory spending unless \nyou pay for it, or you get a supermajority vote.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire said to us that pay-go is a stalking-\nhorse for tax increases. That is not true. Pay-go is a stalking-horse \nfor budget discipline. He himself said as much 5 years ago.\n  The Republicans--at least some now--say that tax cuts are treated \nunequally because they do not continue indefinitely in the baseline. \nWhy is that? It is because our friends on the other side sunset the tax \ncuts in order to jam more of them into a period of time.\n  Now they say, after they are the ones who constructed these sunsets, \ngee, there are sunsets on these tax cuts. Guess what. They are the \narchitects of the sunsets. They are the ones who wrote the sunset \nprovisions into the law. If they had not used reconciliation--which is \na large word that simply means special provisions here to avoid \nextended debate--to avoid Senators' right to amend to put pressure on \nthe Senate to act in a very short period of time, if they had not used \nthose special provisions then, the tax cuts would be part of the \nbaseline on an ongoing basis. They are hoisted on their own petard. \nThat is the reality of what is occurring.\n  Now, the Senator from New Hampshire said there has been an explosion \nof revenue under their watch. No, there hasn't been. Last year we got \nback to the revenue base we had in 2000. It has taken all this time to \nget back to the revenue base we had then.\n  What the Senator is talking about is shown on this chart. Here are \nthe real revenues of the United States, and we can see there has been \nvirtually no growth since 2000. In 2000 we had just over $2 trillion of \nrevenue. They put in their tax cuts in 2001 and revenue declined. It \ndeclined more the next year. It declined more the next year. And it \nstayed down the fourth year. Only in 2005 did we start to get close, \nand only in 2006 did we get back to the revenue base we had in 2000.\n  Now, just because they cut the revenue base did not stop them from \nincreasing spending. They increased spending 40 percent during this \nsame period. The result was, as I have shown in the previous charts, an \nexplosion of deficits, an explosion of debt.\n  Here is what happened to the deficits. Here they are. They inherited \nbudget surpluses. In 2002, we were back in red ink; in 2003, record \ndeficits; in 2004, a new record; in 2005, one of the three worst \ndeficits in the history of the country; in 2006, again, huge deficits. \nAnd here we are in 2007. This is a projection at about the same level \nas last year, actually somewhat worse.\n  But that doesn't even tell the story because, unfortunately, the \nbuildup of the debt is far greater than the size of the deficit.\n  This was the stated deficit for last year, $248 billion. But the debt \ngrew by $546 billion. We will never hear the word ``debt'' leave the \nlips of our friends on the other side of the aisle. We will never hear \nthe word ``debt'' leave the lips of our President. Because they know \nthese facts and I know these facts. The ``debt'' is growing much faster \nthan the size of the deficit. It is the debt that is the threat.\n  As we have indicated, increasingly we are borrowing it from abroad. \nLast year we borrowed 65 percent of all the money that was borrowed by \ncountries in the world. The next biggest borrower was Spain, at one-\ntenth as much as we borrowed.\n  The hard reality is, we are on a collision course because none of \nthis adds up. The result is, we borrowed over $600 billion from Japan. \nWe borrowed over $300 billion from China. We borrowed over $200 billion \nfrom the United Kingdom. We have even now borrowed $50 billion from our \nneighbors to the north in Canada. In fact, we now owe Mexico over $40 \nbillion.\n  Look, their fiscal prescription has failed--failed completely--and \nthe question is, Do we change course? I believe we must. Part of \nchanging course is to go back to the pay-go discipline we had in \nprevious years. That pay-go discipline--and I want to repeat--says this \nvery clearly: If you want new tax cuts, you have to pay for them. If \nyou want new mandatory spending, you have to pay for it. If you do not \npay for it, in either case you have to get a supermajority vote.\n  Let me just make clear on middle-class tax cuts, I believe we ought \nto pay for them to extend them, but even if you did not, there is no \nquestion you would command a supermajority vote on the floor of the \nSenate. There is no question that you would get 60 votes for the 10-\npercent bracket, 60 votes for childcare credits, 60 votes to end the \nmarriage penalty. We know you would command 60 votes on any one of \nthose. I personally think we ought to pay for it. But pay-go does not \nrequire that you pay for it if you can command a supermajority. What \nour friends on the other side are worried about are the outsized tax \ncuts for the wealthiest among us because they believe, and perhaps \nrightly, that you could not get 60 votes to extend those, which means \nyou would have to pay for them, which, in the context of the growth of \ndeficit and debt, probably makes perfect sense.\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\n  What is most interesting is the change in my colleague's position \nbecause, as I indicated, 5 years ago these were his statements. I will \nend as I began. Five years ago my colleague said:\n\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event.\n\n  That is what pay-go does. That is exactly what he said 5 years ago. \nHe was right then. He is wrong now because he has changed his position. \nHe said then:\n\n       If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place caps \n     and pay-go mechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in \n     this Congress. . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       . . . and, as a result, we will dramatically aggravate the \n     deficit which, of course, impacts a lot of important issues, \n     but especially impacts Social Security.\n\n  The tragedy is, they gutted pay-go. They gutted it. And the result is \nprecisely what he predicted at the time. The deficits and the debt have \nexploded.\n  What the House has tried to do and what we will try to do here is \nrestore some basic budget discipline. Pay-go is one part of that. It is \nnot the only part. It is not the salvation to our budget woes, but it \nis a tool that will help. It helped in the 1990s. It will help now. It \ndoes not require tax increases. That is just a false statement. It does \nnot require tax increases. It says if you want new tax cuts, you have \nto pay for them or get a supermajority vote.\n  He says there are no spending restraints. Wrong again. In pay-go, it \nsays very clearly that you cannot have new mandatory spending unless \nyou offset it. And if you cannot offset it, you have to get a \nsupermajority vote. That is the kind of budget discipline we need. That \nis the kind of budget discipline we have had in the past, and it led us \nfrom major deficits--in fact, record deficits at the time--to record \nsurpluses.\n  To say pay-go is a stalking-horse for tax increases is just false. \nPay-go is a budget process tool that is designed to help bring some \ndiscipline back to this body, to keep us from running up this massive \ndebt. If you think about it, increasingly we are financing these \ndeficits and debt abroad. Fifty-two percent of our debt now is being \nfinanced abroad. As a result, we have doubled foreign holders of our \ndebt in just 5 years. That is an utterly unsustainable course.\n  What could it mean? Well, if these countries which are now advancing \nus hundreds of billions of dollars decided to diversify out of dollar-\ndenominated securities, what would we have to do? We would have to \nraise interest rates in order to attract the capital to float this \nboat. That is what we would have to do. That would have very serious \nconsequences for our economy. That is why we cannot continue on this \ncourse.\n  Pay-go is one part of the solution to these problems. It is only one \npart. I would not even suggest it is the major part. What is really \nlacking around here is will. What is really lacking around here is \ntelling the American people the truth about our fiscal condition, and \nonly if we tell them the truth will they respond with the urgency that \ncircumstances require.\n  I very much hope we are going to be truth tellers in this Congress \nand we are going to go to the American people and be frank with them \nabout this buildup of debt and the risks it creates for our country and \nthe fundamental challenge it presents to our long-term economic \nsecurity. The one place I agree entirely with the Senator from New \nHampshire is that the long-term entitlement programs must be reformed \nbecause we face a demographic tsunami: the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. Make no mistake, it is going to change everything. This is \nfundamentally different from anything we have seen before. And this is \nnot a projection because the baby boomers have been born. They are out \nthere. They are alive today. They are going to retire. They are going \nto be eligible for Social Security and Medicare.\n  The hard reality is, we cannot foot the bill for all the promises \nthat have been made by past Congresses. The Senator from New Hampshire \nis dead-on on that issue, and he and I and others are going to work our \nvery best together to try to address these long-term challenges.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if you walked down the main streets of \nOregon or Rhode Island or anywhere else in our country and asked what a \nsecret hold was, my guess is that most citizens would have no idea what \nit was, or maybe they would think it is some kind of hairspray or maybe \na smackdown wrestling move.\n  But the fact is that a secret hold is one of the most powerful tools \nthat exists in our democracy. I and Senator Grassley have worked for a \ndecade to ensure that if a Senator puts a hold on a piece of \nlegislation, they would have to do it in the open. They would have to \ndo it in a way that was considered accountable. A hold in the Senate \nis, in fact, what it sounds like; it keeps a piece of legislation or an \nimportant measure from coming up. In some instances, it can affect \nmillions of people and billions of dollars.\n  It would be one thing if a Member of the Senate, such as the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island or the Senator from Iowa, felt very strongly about \nsomething and they came to the floor and said: I am going to do \neverything I can to block it because I don't think it is in the public \ninterest and I am opposed. That is one thing. It is quite another thing \nfor a Senator to exercise the power and to keep something from even \ncoming before this body in total secrecy. When he was asked why he \nrobbed banks, Willie Sutton said, ``That's where the money is.'' The \nreason I and Senator Grassley have called for openness with respect to \nholds is we believe the secret hold is where the power is.\n  We particularly want to reduce the power of lobbyists who so often \nhot-wire, the way things work here in the Senate, to block everything \nthrough a secret hold that the public knows nothing about. Getting a \nSenator to put a secret hold on a bill is akin to hitting the jackpot \nfor the lobbyists. Not only is the Senator protected by a cloak of \nanonymity but so are the lobbyists. A secret hold, in fact, can let \nlobbyists play both sides of the street. They may have multiple \nclients. They may have multiple interests, and they can figure out how \nto orchestrate a victory without alienating potential or future \nclients. This is one of the most powerful tools a lobbyist can have, \nand it is particularly powerful at the end of a session in the Senate.\n  We are delighted that the Presiding Officer, the new Senator from \nRhode Island, is here. He will see what it is like at the end of a \nsession. Suffice it to say that it is pretty darn chaotic. Measures and \nproposals are flying every which way, and through a secret hold you can \nkeep something from ever being heard at all. What I was struck by when \nI had a chance to come to this distinguished body is that in a number \nof instances in the past, it has not even been a Senator to exercise \none of these secret holds; it has been a member of a staff--a personal \nstaff or committee staff--or somebody else. So what you have is this \nextraordinary power exercised by someone who doesn't even have an \nelection certificate. I think that is an abuse of power, and that is \nwhat I and Senator Grassley have sought to change.\n  We want to make it clear we are not trying to reduce the ability of a \nMember of the Senate who feels strongly about a measure to make sure \nthey can weigh in and be heard on that particular concern. Under our \nproposal, you are not going to have the end of holds. In fact, last \nyear, I put a public hold on something I felt very strongly about.\n  Mr. President, I am sure the Chair heard about it in the course of \nhis experience over the last couple of years. I felt very strongly \nabout protecting Internet democracy and making sure there wasn't \ndiscrimination against those who use the Internet. A piece of \nlegislation passed the Senate Commerce Committee that, in my view,\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\nwould be very detrimental to Internet users. Right now, you pay your \nInternet access charge and you go where you want, when you want, how \nyou want. Nobody faces discrimination. That would have changed under \nthe bill that was passed by the Senate Commerce Committee. So I came to \nthe floor of this body a few minutes after it passed committee, and I \nannounced I was putting a public hold on that legislation because I \nwanted to do everything in my power to make sure that the Internet, as \nwe know it today, would continue. So anybody who disagreed with me--and \nas the Presiding Officer knows, the cable and phone lobbies were \nspending millions and millions of dollars on advertising. They could \ntell who was accountable because while I was exercising my hold, \neverybody knew about it. It wasn't done in the dead of night, wasn't \ndone by skulking around in a fashion where there was no way to hold \nsomebody accountable. I came to the floor of the Senate.\n  I see my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Iowa. When he \nand I started working on this, he said: I am going to try this. I think \ndoing public business in public is the way to go and, by the way, I \ndon't think this is going to hurt. I don't think it is going to bite \nyou. I remember the words of the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nbecause he and others have seen it. We have had a number of colleagues \non both sides of the aisle join us in this effort, including Senator \nInhofe, who has been a strong supporter, and Senator Salazar from \nColorado, a strong supporter. It is almost as if there is a new \nopenness caucus that has come together in the Senate behind the simple \nproposition that Senator Grassley has stood for and that is that public \nbusiness ought to be done in public. Senator Grassley and I have worked \nfor a full decade to bring this about.\n  We are very pleased that as a result of the bipartisan cooperation \nbetween the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, and the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator McConnell, it has been included \nin the legislation in the ethics bill before the Senate. Senator \nGrassley and I know that no matter what you put into law, there will be \nefforts by some, we are sure, to try to find a way to get around it. \nBut I will tell you that we have seen such an abuse of this practice in \nrecent years, where Senators in secret can avoid any accountability at \nall. It seems to me that this legislation that is part of the ethics \npackage that requires a Senator who weighs in on a measure to be held \npublicly accountable is long overdue. We have allowed, particularly \nthrough the help of the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, that it will \nbe possible for Senators to consult on measures very easily.\n  Senator Grassley and I have no intention of blocking the ability to \nconduct those consultations that give Senators an opportunity to learn \nmore about a piece of legislation and work together on a bipartisan \nbasis. But what we do feel strongly about is when Senators weigh in, \nwhen they make it clear they are going to block something, as I sought \nto do--and, fortunately, I was successful on the communications debate \nlast year--when Senators weigh in and they want to block something that \ncan affect, as that particular bill would have, billions of dollars and \nmillions of people, then everyone ought to know who is going to be held \naccountable.\n  I see my good friend from Iowa. Similar to myself, he has put a full \ndecade into this campaign for a new openness in the Senate, for more \nsunlight in the Senate. We will have to continue to prosecute our cause \nas the debate goes forward, and we still have a conference with the \nother body. I think the fact that this has been included as a result of \nthe strong support of Senator Reid, the majority leader, and the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, is a strong blow for the cause of \nopen Government and accountability.\n  With that, I yield the floor and look forward to the remarks of my \npartner in this whole effort, the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, for being a bulldog on this issue and working so closely \nwith me. Besides complimenting him on his efforts, and finally being \nvictorious on these efforts, it gives me an opportunity to say to the \ncountry at large, people who generally believe that everything done in \nWashington is done on a partisan basis, this is an example of where one \nDemocrat and one Republican, working together, have been successful, \nand we have been working together. So everything in Washington is not \npartisan.\n  Also, I think it brings to a point that as far as the Senate is \nconcerned, as opposed to the other body, the fact that this probably \nwould not have gotten done if it had not been done in a bipartisan way. \nFor things to be successful in the Senate, it takes some bipartisanship \nand the broader the bipartisanship the better. But also as a substitute \nfor bipartisan opposition to what we are doing, our bulldogging this \nissue for a long period of time has proven to override the bipartisan \nopposition to it because when we put an issue such as this to public \ndebate, common sense has to prevail.\n  Getting back to what Senator Wyden quoted me as saying over the last \nseveral years, that the public's business ought to be done in public, \nthat people who are surreptitiously trying to do things and then try to \nexplain that to the public, the public is not going to buy into it. But \nthe public does buy into doing what the public thinks Congress is all \nabout, and that is being a very public body because we are \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  I say those things aside from the merits of the issue. I cannot \nexpress those merits for myself any better than Senator Wyden has done. \nI don't intend to try to attempt to do that, but I will give you my \nversion of why this is a very important issue. In doing this, I fully \nsupport everything Senator Wyden has said, and I associate myself with \nthose remarks.\n  As an extension of what he said, I will say for myself, every Senator \ndoes have a right and, if he or she is representing their constituents, \nought to exercise this right to object to a unanimous consent request \nto bringing matters before the Senate that they might feel are \ndetrimental to their constituency or detrimental to the good of the \ncountry. Of course, an extension of unanimous consent is putting a hold \nas a way of protecting that right.\n  Since Senators cannot be on the floor all the time, a hold is \nessentially a way of putting the leaders on notice that a Senator \nintends to object to a unanimous consent request to proceed to a \nmatter. Of course, I have exercised, and the Senator from Oregon has \nsaid he has exercised, putting on holds for various reasons. For a long \ntime, I have made my holds public by putting a very short statement in \nthe Congressional Record of why I was holding something up, No. 1, \nbecause I think the public's business ought to be public, and, No. 2, \nbecause I am saying holds ought to be public, so it would be unethical \nfor me to have a secret hold, and No. 3, people who disagree with my \nhold ought to have an opportunity to discuss with me why they think \ntheir position is right, and I ought to have a right to discuss with \nthem why I think something ought to be changed in their bill or some \nreason I am holding it up, so one can talk and know they are getting \ntogether to solve the problem so the work of the Senate can be done.\n  Since I have done that, I have to say I fully support the right of \nSenators to place holds on items that they do not consent to consider. \nHowever, a Senator has no right to register an objection anonymously. \nThat has not been that way for decades in the Senate because some \nSenators feel that the public good ought to require that sometimes \nthings ought to be done in secret. I don't happen to agree with that \nthought. So I am taking the position that the public's business ought \nto be public.\n  If I could expand on that a little bit, I suppose there are some \nlegitimate exceptions to it, but except for the privacy laws, except \nfor national security and connected with that maybe our intelligence \noperation and maybe in the case of executive privilege--meaning people \nwho are in the White House very close to the President--I think there \nis no reason for business not to be public. That is, 99 percent of the \nrest of the business that the Federal Government does, from my point of \nview, ought to be public.\n  In practice, a hold can prevent a measure from coming before the \nSenate indefinitely. This gives tremendous\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\npower to a single Senator that no single Senator should be able to \nexercise for a very long period of time, maybe in the purist way--but \nin the less pure way should not be able to exercise secretly because \nthe public's business ought to be done in the public.\n  There is no good reason why a Senator should be able to \nsinglehandedly block the Senate's business without public \naccountability. For several years now, as I have said, I have practiced \nusing holds for various reasons, but I placed a statement in the Record \nof why I was doing it.\n  We must have transparency in the legislative process for the right of \nthe public to know what we are doing but also to expedite the public's \nwork. The use of secret holds damages public confidence in the \ninstitution of the Senate. I figure a secondary, subsidiary benefit of \nwhat we are doing is when people get the idea that we are not trying to \ndo something secret, that the public's business is public, they are \ngoing to be less cynical about the institutions of Government \ngenerally. The less cynicism we have, the more confidence people are \ngoing to have in the institutions of Government and the better our \nGovernment is going to operate, the better the representative system of \nGovernment is going to operate.\n  But where does less cynicism start? It doesn't start necessarily with \nchanging the rules. It starts with people such as Senator Grassley, \nSenator Wyden, and Senator Whitehouse because when we do things in the \nway the public expects us to do them and more Senators do that all the \ntime, Senator by Senator we are going to reduce the cynicism and \nenhance public respect for the institutions of Government.\n  The purpose of the underlying bill before the Senate is to provide \ngreater transparency in the legislative process. Therefore, the \namendment by Senator Wyden and this Senator from Iowa is a natural \nextension of that purpose. It is quite appropriate that this underlying \nbill include disclosure requirements for holds that he and I have been \nworking on for several years.\n  In the process, we have to compliment Senator Reid for including this \nin the underlying bill and Senator McConnell, and I am not sure how \nthey individually felt about this in the past. But I think it is very \nclear that with the vote we had last year--I think it was in the mid-\neighties--of Senators who support what we are doing, it is a foregone \nconclusion that regardless of how leaders might feel about it, if they \nwere on the other side, they were very much in the minority.\n  Realism finally comes through when we have consistency and \ndetermination, as Senator Wyden has demonstrated and that vote \ndemonstrates, and it is a tribute to our leaders that if they don't \nnecessarily like what we are doing, that they have included it in their \nlegislation. Obviously, I have to give thanks to them. I, also, give \nthanks to Senator Lott who, over a period of couple of years, has been \nworking with us. I, also, wish to give credit to the President pro \ntempore, Senator Byrd, who a couple years back gave us some \nencouragement along this line.\n  I hope, now that everything is coming together, that within a few \nshort weeks we can have a very open process of making holds public, \nbringing people together and producing results in the Senate because of \none giant step we are taking here.\n  Doing away with holds might not sound like one giant step, but it is \nfrom the standpoint if you knew what the four-letter word ``hold'' does \nto the legislative process around here, it grinds everything to a \nhalt--everything to a halt. Try to explain to your constituents back \nhome that some Senator has a hold on a bill and try to explain that is \nwhy we can't get something done. They wonder what planet we come from. \nIt is very difficult to explain.\n  We are still going to have holds, we still have to explain it, but at \nleast I can say to people it is Senator Smith or Senator Jones or \nSenator Wilson who has a hold on the bill, and I am going to talk with \nthem and see what we can do about it and get something done.\n  I compliment the Senator from Oregon very much and hopefully the \nSenate is going to work better.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business \nfor such time as I might consume, and for other Members, it will be in \nthe neighborhood of about 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S274-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S274-S278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am back again tonight to talk about \nthe Medicare drug benefit. As I said yesterday, the 110th Congress will \nconsider legislation that would fundamentally change the benefit. The \npublic and Medicare beneficiaries need to fully understand the proposed \nchanges and how they would affect them.\n  When we talk about the public and Medicare beneficiaries, remember, \nfor the most part, we are talking about the senior citizens of America \nand people who are on Social Security disability.\n  Yesterday I spoke about how the benefit uses prescription drug plans \nin competition to keep costs down and how well that has worked. Today I \nwant to get to the crux of this debate, the so-called prohibition on \nGovernment negotiation with drugmakers.\n  Opponents of the Medicare drug benefit have twisted the law to come \nup with their absurd claim that Medicare will not be negotiating with \ndrugmakers. They misrepresented the noninterference clause. The \nlanguage does not prohibit Medicare from negotiating with drugmakers; \nit prohibits the Government from interfering in negotiations that are \nongoing all the time.\n  So it is a prohibition on Government negotiating. It is not a \nprohibition on negotiation. It is very important because it is not the \nGovernment agency itself that is doing the negotiating. It is the \nprivate prescription drug plans that are doing the negotiation.\n  That may surprise some people who have heard about the so-called \nprohibition on negotiations. Of course, price negotiations occur on \ndrugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Those negotiations occur \nbetween the prescription drug plans and the manufacturers. We have a \nprecedent for this. The plans are run by organizations experienced in \nnegotiation with drug manufacturers. They deliver prescription drug \nbenefits to millions and millions of Americans--in other words, meaning \nmillions and millions of Americans beyond senior citizens--and \nincluding this 50-year precedent of it being done for Federal employees \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plans.\n  As I said yesterday, competition among the plans to get the best \nprice is working. We have lower than expected bids and cost of premiums \nand lower than expected costs for the Government as a result. So not \nonly is it saving the senior citizens money, as it has been saving \nFederal employees money for 50 years, but also lowering costs to the \ntaxpayers because there is some subsidy for seniors in the Medicare \nprescription drug program.\n  Most importantly, we have lowered prices on drugs for beneficiaries. \nFor the top 25 drugs used by seniors--so I am just taking the top 25 \ndrugs used--the Medicare prescription drug plans have been able to \nnegotiate prices that on average are 35 percent lower than the average \ncash price at retail pharmacies; 35 percent lower. The purpose of the \nprohibition on Government negotiation--in other words, getting back to \nwhat is referred to as the noninterference clause--is to keep the \nGovernment from undermining these negotiations that have been so \nsuccessful and to keep the Government out of the medicine cabinet.\n  I have lost count of the number of times I have talked about this so-\ncalled prohibition that is not a prohibition on negotiations, because \nnegotiations are going on every day. I am not easily discouraged and \nthat is why I am here talking tonight on this subject. I prefer to \ndebate more substantive issues, but unfortunately that is not the case. \nThe debate that went on during the campaign, the debate that went on in \nsome speeches on the floor in the last Congress, and the debate that \nwill come here on the Senate floor in the next 3 weeks, is in fact a \nshell game. It is about distortion of the language of the law, it is \nabout manipulation of beneficiaries and, in turn, the public, and it \nhinges on the convenient lapse in some people's memory about the \nhistory of this noninterference clause. What I want to do today is \nremind people about the history.\n  We are going to take a little trip down memory lane. For our first \nstop\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\non memory lane, let me take a second to read something to you. This is \na quote from someone talking about their own Medicare drug benefit \nproposal.\n\n       Under this proposal, Medicare would not set prices for \n     drugs.\n\n  Let me start over again because that first sentence needs to be \nemphasized:\n\n       Under this proposal, Medicare would not set prices for \n     drugs. Prices would be determined through negotiations \n     between the private benefit administrators and drug \n     manufacturers. . . .\n\n  The person who said this clearly wanted private negotiations with \ndrug companies for Medicare benefits. He was proposing, and I want to \nquote again from this person--and I am soon going to tell you who that \nis--\n\n       . . . negotiations between private benefit administrators \n     and drug manufacturers.\n\n  So I am taking that quote out of the previous quote for a way of \nemphasis.\n\n       Negotiations would go on between private benefit \n     administrators and drug manufacturers.\n\n  In other words, not involving the Government. So it could not be more \nclear what this person had in mind when he was proposing legislation a \nfew years ago. You are going to be shocked to hear who said this. For \nthose who thought President Bush said it, they are wrong. The quote is \nfrom none other than President Clinton. President Clinton made that \ncomment as part of his June 1999 plan for strengthening and modernizing \nMedicare. President Clinton had in his idea, when we were going to \nstrengthen and modernize Medicare with a prescription drug program, \nthat we ought to have negotiations done by the private sector, not by \nthe Government.\n  President Clinton went on to say that under his plan:\n\n       Prices would be determined through negotiations between the \n     private benefit administrators and drug manufacturers.\n\n  Quoting further:\n\n       The competitive bidding process would be used to yield the \n     best possible drug prices and coverage. . . .\n\n  And following the 50-year precedent I have been referring to, he went \non to say:\n\n       . . . just as it is used by large private employers and the \n     Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans today.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from President Clinton.\n  President Clinton also described his plan as using private \nnegotiators because:\n\n       These organizations have experience managing drug \n     utilization and have developed numerous tools for cost \n     containment and utilization management.\n\n  This is a President whom a lot of people would believe, because he \ncomes from the Democratic Party, has great faith in big Government, \nthat he would not be suggesting these things. But when you have a \nprecedent of 50 years of it working for Federal employees, he believed \nit was good enough to use when you offer prescription drugs to the \nsenior citizens of America.\n  Does this ring any bells? It should, because it is the same framework \nused in today's Medicare prescription drug benefit--and I had a hand, \nas a conferee, in writing that. Private negotiations with drug \ncompanies--and it is based on a nearly 50-year history of the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Plan.\n  Here is another interesting spot on memory lane--if I could digress \nfor a minute for the benefit of Members who keep ringing up about a \ndoughnut hole--separate from the issue of pricing drugs and \nnegotiating. I thought it would be good to remind people. The Clinton \nplan had a coverage gap as well. It had a doughnut hole, as we refer to \nit, like the bill eventually signed by President Bush in 2003. Like \nmany others, the new Speaker of the House has questioned why one would \npay premiums at a point in time when you are not receiving benefits. In \nother words, when you are in the doughnut hole. It happens in the \nprivate sector, in a lot of different insurances. That is how insurance \nworks. Go look at any homeowner's policy and auto policy or even the \nPart B of Medicare. You pay premiums to have coverage, and that is also \nhow President Clinton's plan would have worked if it had been passed in \n1999 instead of 2003.\n  In Sunday's Washington Post, Speaker Pelosi was quoted on her \nthoughts about having a doughnut hole. She said:\n\n       How could that be a good idea unless you're writing a bill \n     for the HMOs and the pharmaceutical companies and not for \n     America's seniors?\n\n  Maybe she was referring to President Clinton's plan. As I said, \nPresident Clinton proposed this plan in June of 1999. On April 4, 2000, \nin a bill that is listed as S. 2342, the Medicare Modernization Act \nintroduced here in the Senate, S. 2342 from that year, 2000, would have \ncreated a drug benefit administered through benefit managers. It even \nhad the same title as the Medicare law that is now law. The Medicare \nModernization Act is the title in 2000. It is the title of a bipartisan \nbill that is now law. So, here again, we have private negotiations with \ndrug companies. It sounds familiar. It is like today's Medicare drug \nbenefit.\n  Here is another important stop down our memory lane. This bill, which \nI referred to as S. 2342 previously, included the following language. \n``Noninterference,'' nothing in this section or in this part shall be \nconstrued as authorizing the Secretary to:\n\n     require a particular formulary or to institute a price \n     structure for benefits; (2) interfere in any way with \n     negotiations . . . or (3) otherwise interfere with the \n     competitive nature of providing a prescription drug benefit \n     through private entities.\n\n  This is the first bill, the very first one where the noninterference \nclause appeared. You could say it is the second time it appeared \nbecause it appeared as a suggestion of President Clinton, but it was \nintroduced the first time, and this was the language. But S. 2342 was \nnot introduced by Republicans. It was introduced by my esteemed \ncolleague and friend, the late Senator Moynihan. One month later there \nwas S. 2541 introduced. I will read some language of that bill. Here I \ngo to the first chart I have. I have four charts coming up.\n       (B) Noninterference . . . The Secretary may not--\n       (1) require a particular formulary, institute a price \n     structure for benefits;\n       (2) interfere in any way with negotiations between private \n     entities and drug manufacturers or wholesalers; or\n       (3) interfere with the competitive nature of providing a \n     prescription drug benefit through private entities.\n\n  That wasn't a Republican bill, either. It was introduced by Senator \nDaschle, who was joined by 33 other Democrats, including Senators Reid, \nDurbin, and Kennedy. For instance, 33 Senate Democrats cosponsored \nlanguage for a bill that they now find not to their liking. I don't \nunderstand it. It turns out that the Democrats did not want Government \ninterfering in the private sector negotiations, either. They recognized \nthen that the private sector would do a better job. They recognized \nthen what President Clinton recognized: something that had worked 50 \nyears for Federal employees could be allied to senior citizens and \nMedicare as well and maybe do it better. And they didn't want the \nGovernment, some bureaucrat, messing it all up. At that time, they \ndidn't want the Government in their medicine Cabinet, either.\n  In June 2000, two Democratic bills were introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives that also included the noninterference language. One \nwas introduced by Dick Gephardt. That bill had more than 100 \ncosponsors, including then-Representative Pelosi, now Speaker of the \nHouse, but it also included Representatives Rangel, Dingell, and Stark. \nI want Members to know I worked very closely on some health issues with \nDingell and Stark, and I worked very closely with Congressman Rangel on \ntrade and tax issues.\n  That language included in H.R. 4770, introduced by Representative \nGephardt and supported by more than 100 House Democrats, was almost \nidentical to the language in Senator Daschle's bill. So we have 33 \nSenate Democrats, we have 100 House Democrats supporting the \nnoninterference language.\n  Here is a chart with the text of the noninterference clause included \nin what is now Part D, the prescription drug part of Medicare, \nreferring to it again under its official title, the Medicare \nModernization Act.\n  It says:\n\n       (B) Noninterference--in order to promote competition under \n     this part and in carrying out this part, the Secretary--\n       (1) may not interfere with the negotiations between the \n     drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP sponsors; and\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\n       (2) may not require a particular formulary or institute a \n     price structure for the reimbursement of covered Part D \n     drugs.\n\n  It sounds exactly like what was introduced in the Democratic bill. If \nwe compare this language to the Gephardt-Pelosi language, the Medicare \nModernization Act provisions have 26 fewer words. Compare it to the \nDaschle-Kennedy noninterference clause--the Medicare Modernization Act \nhas 10 fewer words. It sounds as if sponsors of those bills were pretty \nconcerned about the potential of Government interference.\n  Last week, the senior Senator from Illinois described the Medicare \nlaw enacted in 2003 as being written by the pharmaceutical industry. \nBut the noninterference clause first appeared in legislation introduced \nby Democrats who now oppose the same provision that is law.\n  Since the opponents of the Medicare drug benefit always say that the \nnoninterference clause is proof that the drug industry wrote the law, \nmy question is, If that is what you think, did the pharmaceutical \nindustry also write the bills that you had put in over the previous \nyears going back to the bills I have referred to that were introduced \nby Democrats? I bet you wonder just how many Democratic bills contain \nthat now infamous ``noninterference clause''--the prohibition, in other \nwords, on Government negotiating.\n  I have a timeline. As this chart shows, the prohibition on Government \nnegotiation--the noninterference clause--has been in seven bills by \nDemocrats between 1999 and 2003. That is in addition to the point I \nmake clear of where the last Democratic President was on this subject: \nright where the law is today. Seven bills, including the bill \nintroduced in the House on the same day as H.R. 1, which is now the \nlaw.\n  First it was in the Moynihan bill in 2000. There was a Daschle-Reid-\nKennedy bill. That was followed in the House by a bill introduced by \nRepresentative Eshoo and then the Gephardt-Pelosi bill which has \nRepresentatives Rangel, Dingell, Stark, and our colleague who then was \nin the House, Senator Stabenow now, as a cosponsor. Representative \nStark then had his own bill, and the senior Senator from Oregon \nintroduced his bill in the Senate.\n  Finally, in the House, Representative Thomas introduced a bill. I \nknow what the response will be. It will be that even though Democratic \nbills had nearly exactly the same noninterference language, practically \nword for word in seven bills over a long period of time, opponents now \nthink that approach is no longer best for Medicare. It is sort of like \nwe supported it before we opposed it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Of course I yield for a question. We very seldom get a \nchance to debate. That is a welcome opportunity.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I notice that my friend and colleague from Iowa has been \nin the Senate for the last several days talking about Medicare \nprescription Part D, which he played a major role in creating. I know \nhe feels the program as passed into law should not be changed--or at \nleast not along the lines many suggest. However, I ask this question: \nDoes the Senator believe that the current program at the Veterans' \nAdministration which allows that agency to bargain for bulk discounts \non behalf of our veterans to reduce the prices of the drugs they buy \nfor our veterans is a good policy?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In the sense of what we can afford for veterans, we \nought to think in terms of that we cannot afford enough for veterans \nwho put their lives on the line.\n  When we have appropriated accounts, there are some limits, as opposed \nto an entitlement such as Medicare, but it is not as good as what \nseniors have under this because there are several therapies the \nGovernment will not pay for under the veterans program we pay for under \nMedicare. From that standpoint of the quality of the program, based \nupon the therapies that are available, it is not as good as what we \nhave in Medicare.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator acknowledge the fact, though, that the \nVeterans' Administration, because it can bargain on behalf of all \nveterans and obtain bulk discounts, saves money not only for the \nveterans who are provided with these drugs but also for our Government; \nthat the pharmaceutical companies, anxious to provide drugs to millions \nof veterans, will give bulk discounts that will benefit both the \nVeterans' Administration and the veterans?\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The answer is yes. But you get back to the person who \ncame to one of my town meetings and said: The doctor said I ought to \nhave this prescription. Why won't the Veterans' Administration pay for \nit? I have to have this one, according to the Veterans' Administration, \nand there is some way it affects me that the other one wouldn't.\n  We have to take that into consideration as well. Yes, bulk discount \ngets drugs cheaper, but the Government is not going to pay for every \ndrug. You are going to have the bureaucrat in the medicine cabinet of \nthe veteran, and the bureaucrat is not today in the medicine cabinet of \nthe senior citizen.\n  You also have to realize that, in addition to the VA having a limited \nformula, they also do not have the availability of the drug in the \npharmacies the way we provide in this Medicare Program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Iowa acknowledge the fact that \nunder the current Medicare prescription Part D, if a senior citizen in \nIowa or Illinois signed up for a specific program, there is no \nguarantee the formulary they signed up for today will be available to \nthat senior next month or even next year? So if the Senator from Iowa \nis concerned that the VA can't guarantee all drugs, the current \nMedicare prescription drug Part D Program does not guarantee the \nformulary. The formulary can literally change by the month, and a \nsenior can find that a valuable and important drug they signed up for \nis no longer covered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If you want to say for a period of a year or beyond a \nyear, the answer is yes, but for 12 months, no. But also remember that \nevery year the Secretary of Health and Human Services has to approve \nthese plans, and there are certain basic needs they have to meet. One \nof those basic needs that is in the law that is not in the VA program \nis a requirement that every therapy be available.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Iowa, it has been my \nexperience, working with my seniors, that every plan does not offer \nevery drug.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is true, but every therapy is available.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the same situation the VA faces. The VA may say \nto that veteran: We believe you should have a generic drug. The veteran \nmay prefer a brand-name drug which is more expensive, but the plan \nprovides the therapy through a generic drug. So in that way, it \nparallels what the Senator is describing under Medicare prescription \nPart D.\n  What I am suggesting, what we are suggesting on this side of the \naisle, is not to foreclose the possibility that private plans will \ncontinue to offer options under Medicare prescription Part D. What we \nare trying to add is something that was debated at length and rejected \nwhen the bill was written; that is, to allow Medicare as an agency, as \na program, to offer its own prescription drug program for seniors, to \nbargain with pharmaceutical companies to find the lowest prices \npossible and then allow the seniors to make the choice: either take the \nMedicare approach or take a private approach. It gives more choices, \nnot fewer.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I want to comment \non the first part of what he recently said; that is, that what you say \nis true in regard to plans changing what drugs can be offered. We \nrequire that every therapy be available, but you are right, not every \ndrug is available. And you want what the VA has because it might be \nbetter.\n  Now, let me point out then why our program is better. In the VA, 30 \npercent of drugs are covered, 70 percent not covered. In our program, \nif a senior finds him or herself in a plan where at the end of the year \nit has changed, they have choices of several plans to go to. The VA \ndoes not have that choice. There is no place a veteran can go. There is \nno place my constituents could go when they came to me and said: Why \ndon't you cover this drug? My doctor says I need it because of what it \ndoes to me that the other one won't--or just the opposite.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could say to the Senator from Iowa, I have found my \nveterans to be very happy with the VA\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\nprogram. It is a very affordable program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have, too, so I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is growing dramatically in size, which suggests more \nveterans are using it. But going back to Medicare Prescription Part D, \nwe are not suggesting that Medicare offering its own program as an \noption is going to be mandatory on seniors. It is still their decision \nwhether they want to use the Medicare approach--which we are supporting \non this side of the aisle, which allows for these discounted drugs--or \nif they feel a private plan is better for them, better for their needs, \nbetter for their pocketbook. It is just a consumer choice. But that \nchoice is not available today.\n  Medicare cannot offer to the seniors, under Medicare Prescription \nPart D, an option. What is wrong with Medicare offering that option and \ncompeting with these private insurance companies?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, can I ask a question without answering the \nSenator's question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Certainly. Of course.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Because I was very joyful the Senator was coming out \nhere. I saw him come out. I probably irritated him or something.\n  Here is what I was hoping we would be debating. Because the whole \npoint of the last 2 days is: From President Clinton in June 1999, all \nthe way through bills that the Senator's party introduced in 2003, we \nhad the noninterference clause in it. I want you to know I felt very \ncomfortable adopting a Democrat noninterference clause in my bill that \nis now law, and I was hoping the Senator was going to come out and give \nsome justification why his party--mostly in his party; there were some \non our side who would agree--why his party would change its mind after \nPresident Clinton thought that what we have been doing for 50 years was \nworking so well in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program that he \nwanted to do it. And he said you get lower drug prices by doing it that \nway.\n  Several bills--I think I said seven bills--introduced by Democrats \nhad the same principle in it. And now you don't like it. I don't \nunderstand why. I was hoping that was why the Senator came out to \ndebate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Iowa, that \nis why I was asking the questions because I think the questions get \nbeyond the word ``noninterference'' into the reality of the choice we \nare suggesting.\n  I do not believe it is an interference to the rights of seniors \neligible under Medicare Prescription Part D to give them an additional \nchoice. And that is all we are asking: Allow Medicare to offer to the \nseniors another choice. They can reject it. They can accept it. I do \nnot think that is mandatory or interfering.\n  I think, frankly, that a free-market Republican such as my good \nfriend from Iowa would grasp that as a good option. It means the \nprivate insurance companies would then have to do their best to compete \nwith Medicare. If Medicare offers a better plan, seniors can take it. \nIf it does not, they can take private insurance options that are \ncurrently available.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If it is a good idea, I think the Senator from Illinois \nwould do the consumers more good by offering a Government program to \ncompete with Wal-Mart, maybe.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say, when it comes to the Medicare program, we \nknow this was created by the Senator's committee. And I salute him for \nhis leadership. But it is in fact a Government program. In fact, it is \na program that is subsidized by our Federal Government. It is not just \nallowing little, private entities to compete. We provide a subsidy to \nthem. We have constructed a plan which has a doughnut hole where there \nis a period of no coverage. We have constructed an approach that some \nseniors find very hard to understand. But regardless, it is a \nGovernment creation. What we are suggesting is a Medicare option is not \nunreasonable. It still leaves the final choice in the hands of the \nseniors. They make the final choice what is best for them, what is best \nfor their family, and what is best for their budget.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think I have to give a bottom line and \nsay it is working. Or if that is not good enough for you--after 2 \nyears--that it is something that is working, it is something that is \nneeded, it is something that Republicans got passed. And we did not get \nit passed without Democratic help, thank God--it was bipartisan--\notherwise we would not have gotten it done. But for 4 years we were \nwaiting for something to happen on your side of the aisle. It did not \nhappen.\n  So could I end by saying one thing? In case my word is not so good, I \nwould quote from the LA Times. It is in response to what the Senator \nsaid about the VA program. And I do not have any problems with the VA \nprogram. But it says here:\n\n       VA officials can negotiate major price discounts because \n     they restrict the number of drugs on their coverage list. In \n     other words, the VA offers lower drug prices but fewer \n     choices.\n\n  Now, do we want to give the seniors of America fewer choices? I think \nyou do. The route you are going, that is where you are going to end up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Iowa, it \nis true that the VA formulary for eligible drugs is a more restrictive \nlist. I do not know if that will be the same case when Medicare--if \nthey are allowed to--offers an option. But ultimately the choice is in \nthe hands of the seniors. If they think the formulary that is offered \nby Medicare is too restrictive, they do not have to choose it. It is \ntheir ultimate decision. It is the concept of freedom. And I know the \nSenator from Iowa embraces that concept. I hope he will consider our \napproach.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So I cannot attribute this specifically to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, but the Senator is talking about choice now, and if \nthere is anything people have choice on, it is all the plans that are \navailable. But from your side of the aisle, starting in 2004, all I \nheard was there was too much choice, too much choice, too many plans.\n  So I do not know for sure if you and your party know where you are \ncoming from, whether choice is OK, how much choice is OK. Maybe you are \nleading us down the line where we are going to end up, if you get too \nmuch Government interference, we will not have choice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to my colleague, when it comes to this issue, \nmy experts are pharmacists. Just like so many towns in Iowa, there are \nmany towns in Illinois where the drugstore pharmacy is a community \ncenter, and people come to trust their druggist, trust their \npharmacist. What I did, as Medicare Prescription Part D came on line, \nwas to visit those drugstores and sit down with the pharmacist. And I \nwill tell you quite candidly, many times they were dealing with seniors \nwho had reached a point in life where a lot of information was \ndifficult to evaluate, and they had to work with their pharmacist to \nfind the best option.\n  So if there was a criticism on our side, it was the fact that there \nwas so much information being given to seniors with a limited amount of \ntime to make a decision. I think the Senator from Iowa would concede \nthat some seniors needed the help of family members or pharmacists or \ncounselors at senior centers to help them make this decision.\n  But on the final analysis, I hope the Senator will be open to the \nconcept that if Medicare offers an option, it is just another choice \nfor seniors. Take it or leave it. It is still ultimately their \ndecision.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me suggest to you that the committee \nthat has jurisdiction over it, which I am no longer chairman of, has a \ntradition of trying to work through things. I want you to know I am \ncommitted to looking if there are better ways of doing it. But I think \nit is pretty difficult to argue with a program that has come in with \nsenior citizens, by 80 percent in more than one poll, saying they are \nsatisfied and, secondly, a program--what Government program have you \never seen come in without big cost overruns?\n  This one has come in now with the latest projection by CBO that it is \ngoing to cost $189 billion less than we anticipated it would cost. And \nwe got lower Federal costs. We got lower premiums for the seniors. We \ngot 35-percent lower drug prices for the 25 drugs most used by seniors. \nWe got lower\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nState costs, because the States do not have to pick up the duel \neligibles as they used to.\n  There is something good coming out of the discussion the Senator and \nI are having. If we would have had this discussion 3 years ago, you \nwould have said what we were doing was going to bring holy hell and not \ndo any good and it would never work. At least now there is some \nacceptance of the program. So maybe with a little bit more dialog we \nwill come around to the point where you are saying: Maybe, Senator \nGrassley, you were right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am always--in fact, I have been quoted \nin your campaign literature sometimes saying nice things about you.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I noticed you have not said that so I can quote you \nagain.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am being very careful this time around. And I would be \nhappy to acknowledge you are my friend and a great leader, and you have \ndone a great job here. And put it in your next brochure if it will \nhelp.\n  But I want to close by saying thank you for this dialog. It is rare \non the floor of the Senate, and we need more of it. I would say, when \nit comes to perfect laws, I think aside from the Ten Commandments, most \nlaws could stand an amendment or two. So I hope you will be open to the \npossibility of improving Medicare Prescription Part D.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Remember, the bill you want to amend is a bipartisan \nbill. Remember that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to finish my remarks. I am not sure finishing \nmy remarks can be more valuable than what we just had here in this sort \nof discussion. But I think when the Senator came in, I was kind of \nneedling the other party a little bit with a statement like all of this \nbusiness of Democrats introducing this noninterference language, and my \ncopying it, thinking that was the right thing to do, was the bipartisan \nthing to do, that now they are backing off of it, as you can see by the \nrecent exchange I had with my friend from Illinois, that it is sort of \nfor the Democrats like: We supported it before we opposed it.\n  But I want to recap. When Democrats controlled the Senate, their \nbills took the same approach and had basically the same noninterference \nlanguage--the same prohibition on government negotiations. Looks like \nmy colleagues across the aisle yielded--and perhaps against their own \nbetter policy judgment--to take the opportunity to make political hay \nby demagoguing what seems like a reasonable proposition. That \nproposition was that Government, with all those Medicare beneficiaries \nin the Medicare program, should negotiate lower prices for drugs. In \nreality, it is nothing but an appealing sound bite.\n\n  After the Medicare law was enacted, opponents distorted the meaning \nof the language and vowed to change it. They have now demagogued on \nthis issue for 3 years. They had all that time to prepare their \nproposals. What has been introduced to date? The bill introduced in the \nHouse to address the so-called prohibition has been described as ``not \nas far-reaching as the new majority indicated before taking power.''\n  The Senate bill is a nonbinding sense of the Congress resolution as a \nplaceholder with no details. I understand that some bills are \nintroduced as markers pending further development. I have done that \nmyself. But 3 years of talking about this issue, talking about what is \nwrong with the noninterference clause, and there still is no more \nsubstance behind the proposal than that?\n  One of the questions I should have asked the Senator from Illinois \nis, please describe to me how it is going to work if you take out the \nnoninterference clause. I have never had anybody tell me that. \nSomething like, let's do it a little bit like the VA, but the HHS is \nnot the VA. So how is it going to be done? Somewhere along the line \nthey are going to have to tell us.\n  In fact, the USA Today editorial page recognized the lack of \nsubstance when they wrote in November that House Democratic aides \ncouldn't provide any details on their party's proposal. This is after 3 \nyears of their finding fault with what is law.\n  It makes me wonder if people who led the charge against the so-called \nprohibition on Government negotiation truly ever did change their minds \nabout this provision. There was actually a surprising level of \nagreement among Democrats and Republicans that the private sector would \nbe able to do a better job of tough negotiation with drug companies \nthan the Government could ever do. We had all seen the same history of \nthe poor job Medicare does setting prices on almost anything, whether \nit is hospitals or whether it is wheelchairs. Everyone from President \nClinton to Mr. Gephardt to Speaker Pelosi to the senior Senator from \nOregon, recognized that at the time when they put their names on \nlegislation.\n  The same USA Today editorial referred to opponents' plans to change \nthe law as ``more of a campaign pander than a fully baked plan.'' Maybe \nthe opponents finally realized that themselves.\n  I believe beneficiaries and the public deserve more than that. That \nis what the debate is going to be all about. But they are going to have \nto sell their point.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the most amazing citizens of our \nremarkable State of Vermont is Antonio Pomerleau. Most people know him \nas Tony Pomerleau. My wife Marcelle and our children know him simply as \nUncle Tony.\n  Tony and his wife Rita have been among the most generous contributors \nto the well-being of families in Vermont of anyone I know, and he did \nnot come from a wealthy background. His parents, my wife's \ngrandparents, came as immigrants to the United States from the Province \nof Quebec in Canada. Nonetheless, he and his wife Rita raised a family \nof 10 and also faced the tragedy of losing two beautiful daughters. \nThroughout it all, he has retained his position as a leading citizen of \nour State but even more so as an example to all of us.\n  Shortly before Christmas, Tony was named Vermonter of the year by our \nState's largest newspaper. With pride, I ask unanimous consent that the \neditorial about our Uncle Tony be printed in the Record so everyone \nthroughout our great country can know about him.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 24, 2006]\n\n                 Tony Pomerleau, Vermonter of the Year\n\n       He's 89 years old and still going like the Energizer bunny, \n     his family says.\n       Tony Pomerleau.\n       People know his name in this state. And those who know the \n     man consider themselves fortunate.\n       He is Santa Claus to countless children, the festive, \n     white-haired gentleman who has thrown a big party every \n     Christmas since 1982 for hundreds of children and their \n     families who might not be able to afford a celebration of \n     their own.\n       He is Mr. P, the delightful, generous soul who added a \n     holiday party for families of the Vermont Army National Guard \n     in 2004. It was a huge lift for the 800 or so people who \n     attended, and he did it again in 2005--and again this year, \n     opening the doors to all Guard families, with special \n     attention paid to the families of about 120 Guard members who \n     are still deployed.\n       Everyone is welcome. Everyone has a seat at Antonio (Tony) \n     Pomerleau's table.\n       It's Pomerleau's giving spirit that makes him so deserving \n     of the honor of Vermonter of the Year. His steadfast \n     commitment to Vermont and the people of this state make him a \n     fine choice.\n       As Robert Perreault of Hardwick said in his nomination \n     letter, ``He is extremely generous with his time, ideas and \n     money, to implement programs that have helped people, \n     especially the children and our Vermont Guardsmen and their \n     families.''\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\n       Pomerleau's niece, Marcelle Leahy, wife of Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy, encouraged her uncle to play a role in helping the \n     Guard families with whom she was working through the Guard's \n     Family Readiness Group. Pomerleau was more than happy to do \n     it.\n       It doesn't take much for Pomerleau to be persuaded to share \n     his good fortune with others. He ``came up the hard way,'' \n     his son Ernie said last week. Tony Pomerleau has been there.\n       He was the third child of Ernest and Alma Pomerleau, a \n     hardworking French-Canadian couple who decided to try their \n     chances across the border in Vermont. When Pomerleau was 6 \n     months old, the family moved to a dairy farm in Barton, \n     according to an unpublished biography the family has put \n     together.\n       As a child, Pomerleau was touched by two formative \n     incidents. First, he fell down the basement stairs at age 3 \n     and was forced to wear an iron corset. Doctors feared his \n     life would be shortened.\n       ``He wasn't supposed to live beyond 12 years old,'' Erie \n     Pomerleau said. ``And here he is, 89 and still going \n     strong.''\n       The second incident, according to the family biography, was \n     something of a miracle. Alma Pomerleau took her son, age 10, \n     to Ste. Anne de Beaupre in Quebec--the shrine that is covered \n     in crutches and other medical aids left behind by countless \n     others who believed they were cured.\n       Alma removed young Tony's iron brace, and they returned \n     home to Vermont without it. Her son was fine.\n       ``Of course it was a miracle. It was my mother's prayers,'' \n     Pomerleau said in the biography.\n       And so Tony Pomerleau gives back. He gives and gives, \n     according to the families, charities, schools and \n     organizations that have been touched by his spirit.\n       There's the renowned annual party, organized by the \n     Burlington Parks and Recreation Department, and paid for by \n     Pomerleau. Now there's also the Guard party. There is St. \n     Michael's College in Colchester, where Pomerleau, received an \n     honorary doctorate after years of contributing to the campus. \n     There is Burlington's Church Street, which he helped \n     rejuvenate in the 1950s. There is the Burlington Police \n     Department, where Pomerleau was a longtime police \n     comissioner. He bought the North Avenue building for the \n     police headquarters and has provided ongoing support for the \n     officers, such as laptop computers for their patrol cars. \n     There are the scholarships at Rice Memorial High School, the \n     renovations at Christ the King Church, the trips Pomerleau \n     has funded for Burlington schoolchildren, and the regular \n     donations to the American Red Cross, United Way of Chittenden \n     County and the Salvation Army.\n       Pomerleau started his entrepreneurial life as a child, soon \n     after he shed that iron brace. He sold haircuts and canaries. \n     He washed cars, ran errands and helped his family in their \n     general store in Newport. In 1942, after working for a \n     national shoe store chain up and down the East Coast, he \n     decided to settle in Burlington where he bought a failing \n     grocery store. Within three years, he owned four stores and a \n     wholesale beverage business. In 1951, he started his real \n     estate career and by age 45, he was a millionaire. Pomerleau \n     built Vermont's first shopping center in the 1950s, the Ethan \n     Allen Shopping Plaza, and then developed about 20 more.\n       He has lived large, and the beautiful Greek Revival \n     building on College Street that houses Pomerleau Real Estate \n     is a testament to that life.\n       Through it all, Pomerleau's wife, Rita, and 10 children, \n     two of whom have died, have been his main focus. Pomerleau is \n     also the proud grandfather of 13.\n       In many ways, Tony Pomerleau remains the optimistic boy who \n     left his iron brace behind at Ste. Anne de Beaupre.\n       ``Someone asked him the other day when he was going, to \n     retire,'' son Ernie said. ``And he said, `When I get old.' ''\n       Never get old, Mr. P. We like you the way you are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S279-S280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING PRESIDENT GERALD FORD\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, even as we usher in a new Congress, \nAmericans have said farewell to one of our Chief Executives, President \nGerald R. Ford. President Ford was a man of character and integrity, a \nleader of hope and purpose. I hope and pray that the outpouring of \nsupport for President Ford in recent days will be a source of comfort \nand strength for his family and especially for his beloved wife, First \nLady Betty Ford.\n  The people of Michigan's Fifth District loved their Congressman Jerry \nFord. They sent him to the House of Representatives 13 times, by large \nmargins. In fact, Congressman Ford's reelection percentages over nearly \na quarter century did not vary by more than a few points. His \nconstituents supported him as he served them, consistently and solidly.\n  It is easy to see why his constituents felt such a connection with \nhim. Jerry Ford grew up in Grand Rapids, MI. He achieved the rank of \nEagle Scout and, in high school, joined the honor society and was named \nto all-city and all-State football teams. At the University of \nMichigan, he played center on two national championship football teams \nand was named most valuable player in 1934.\n  Early in life, Jerry Ford's values and basic good sense helped him \nsee past the excitement of the moment. He passed up opportunities to \nuse his athletic prowess for the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers \nand instead decided to coach boxing and football at Yale University, \nwhere he realized his goal of attending law school. He returned to \nGrand Rapids to begin practicing law and, after serving in the Navy \nduring World War II, returned again to practice law and seek election \nto Congress in 1948. Somehow in all that activity, he found time to \ncourt Elizabeth Bloomer. She must have been a very understanding woman \nbecause he even campaigned on their wedding day. President Ford would \nlater say that his most valued advice was that which came from his \nwife. They spent 58 years together and had four wonderful children.\n  The qualities that endeared Congressman Ford to his constituents also \ninspired trust in his colleagues in the House, who elected him \nRepublican Conference chairman in 1963 and then Republican leader in \n1965. In fact, Congressman Ford was so well regarded that President \nLyndon Johnson named him to the Warren Commission which investigated \nthe assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and President Richard \nNixon tapped him to replace the resigned Vice President Spiro Agnew.\n  Gerald Ford loved the House of Representatives, and his personal \npolitical goal was to become Speaker of the House. He declined \ninvitations to run for the Senate and for Governor. Ironically, while \nthe Republicans' minority status kept him from leading that Chamber, \nhis appointment as Vice President allowed him to become President of \nthe Senate.\n  The Ford Presidency was brief, just 29 months long, but broke \nsignificant new political ground. He was the only occupant of the Oval \nOffice who was never elected either President or Vice President. Former \nNew York Governor Nelson Rockefeller's appointment as Vice President \nmeant that, for the first time in American history, neither of the \nNation's two top officers had been elected to either office. The Ford \nand Rockefeller appointments were the first handled under the \nprocedures established by the 25th amendment to the Constitution, \nratified less than a decade earlier. And, of course, President Ford \npresided over our Nation's bicentennial in 1976.\n  The passage of even a few years, let alone a few decades, can easily \nchange memories and perspectives. In recent years, the majority party \nhas held either House of Congress by a modest margin. In this body \ntoday, the balance of power could rest on one Senator. At one point \nduring Gerald Ford's service in the House, however, Democrats \noutnumbered Republicans by more than 2-to-1. Even under those difficult \ncircumstances, Congressman Ford found ways of reaching across the \naisle, working productively with the other party to find solutions to \nthe Nation's problems.\n  When Gerald Ford took up residence at the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue, there were times when he had to stand up to Congress. He issued \nan astounding 66 vetoes in fewer than 3 years, and Congress was able to \noverride just a few.\n  President Ford served during one of the most trying times in American \nhistory, facing troubles at home and abroad. At home, there was the \nWatergate scandal that had resulted in the Ford Presidency. In 1975, \nunemployment reached a level nearly twice what it is today. Inflation \nwas in double digits. Fears of energy shortages persisted. Elsewhere in \nthe world, President Ford faced the war in Vietnam and crises in the \nMiddle East and the continued threat posed by the former Soviet Union. \nAnd on top of all of that, he shouldered the burden of restoring \nAmericans' faith in their leaders and in democracy itself. Last week in \nhis eulogy, Dr. Henry Kissinger, President Ford's Secretary of State, \nput it this way: ``Unassuming and without guile, Gerald Ford undertook \nto restore the confidence of Americans in their political institutions \nand purposes.''\n  He made decisions, some of which were unpopular at the time, that he\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nfelt were necessary for the good of the Nation. Some say that these \ncontributed to his narrow loss to Jimmy Carter. At the same time, from \nopinion polls after the political conventions showing the incumbent \ntrailing by nearly 30 points, President Ford closed the gap to make the \n1976 election one of the closest in American history.\n  We are all thankful President Ford did not simply retire from public \nlife when he left the White House. For nearly three decades, he \nremained active as a statesman and involved in important issues. He \nfounded, and for many years chaired, the World Forum conducted by the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, and he continued writing about some of \nthe political and social challenges of our day. In 2001, he authored a \npoignant column which appeared in the Washington Post and endorsed \nlegislation to promote regenerative therapies that can give hope to \nAmericans suffering from chronic diseases. As a cosponsor of that \nlegislation, I was moved and grateful for President Ford's wisdom and \nsupport.\n  For these and so many other activities and contributions, President \nFord received the Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian award, \nin 1999 and the Profiles in Courage Award from the Kennedy Foundation \nin 2001. In 1999, he and Mrs. Ford received the Congressional Gold \nMedal for their dedicated public service and humanitarian \ncontributions.\n  As great as President Ford was, he was always the first to \nacknowledge his wonderful spouse, and I would be remiss, if I did not \nsay a few words about Betty Ford. She was such a model of grace and \ndignity, inspiring us with her love and devotion to her family. Betty \nFord was a bold First Lady, candidly sharing with the Nation her \nstruggles with cancer and chemical dependency. She did not, however, \nstop there but turned those struggles into a crusade to help others. \nShe served as cochairman of the Susan G. Komen Foundation when it was \nfounded in 1982. Each year, she presents the Betty Ford Award from that \nfoundation to a champion in the fight against breast cancer. The Betty \nFord Center, which she founded in 1982, is today one of the leading \ntreatment facilities in America, perhaps the world, and Mrs. Ford \ncontinues to serve as its board chairman.\n  As recently as last week, Betty and her four children, Steve, Mike, \nJack, and Susan, showed us their tremendous devotion and kindness as \nthey stood in the Capitol Rotunda for hours on end greeting every \nvisitor who came to pay their respects to President Ford. Even in the \nface of tragedy, Betty and her children are gracious.\n  President Ford believed that most people were mostly good most of the \ntime. That optimistic attitude led him once to say that while he had \nmany adversaries in his political life, he could not remember having a \nsingle enemy. When he took the oath of office on August 9, 1974, he \noffered not an inaugural address but what he called just a little \nstraight talk among friends. He made a commitment, a compact, with his \nfellow Americans, in which he said:\n\n       You have not elected me as your President by your ballots, \n     he said, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President \n     with your prayers . . . I have not sought this enormous \n     responsibility, but I will not shirk it . . . Our \n     Constitution works; our great republic is a government of \n     laws and not of men. Here the people rule . . . God helping \n     me, I will not let you down.\n\n  Those words so reflected the character and vision of President Ford \nthat they were printed in the opening pages of the commemorative \nprogram distributed when the Gerald R. Ford Museum was dedicated in \nSeptember 1981 in Grand Rapids. It is there, along the Grand River, \nthat thousands of Americans, many waiting for hours in the cold, paid a \nfinal tribute to our 38th President. And it is nearby, in the city he \nloved and that loved him, that President Ford was laid to rest.\n  Gerald Ford did not let us down. It is fitting that on the gravestone \nof this remarkable man, this distinguished public servant, this healer \nof our Nation, are the simple words: Lives Committed to God, Country, \nand Love.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, President Gerald Ford had a distinguished \ncareer of public service marked by his exceptional personal qualities, \nand his passing is a sad moment for all Americans.\n  President Ford was born in Omaha, NE in 1913 and grew up in Grand \nRapids, MI. As a student at the University of Michigan, Ford was an \nallstar football player and became an assistant football coach at Yale \nUniversity while he earned his law degree. During his service in World \nWar II, he attained the rank of lieutenant commander in the Navy.\n  President Ford was first elected to Congress in 1948 and served for \n25 years, eight as the minority leader. He was selected to serve as \nVice President and became President because he was a man who could \nrestore integrity to the Presidency, hope in America, and bridge \npartisan divides in Congress.\n  I first met Gerald Ford when he was the House minority leader and I \nwas chief of staff for Congressman John Y. McCollister from Omaha. I \nhave never met a person in politics who was a more decent and more \ncomplete individual than President Ford. He earned the trust and \nconfidence of the American people through his character, competency and \ncommon decency.\n  I had the honor of attending his Capitol memorial service in the \nRotunda last week with my daughter, Allyn, and son, Ziller. I am \ngrateful and proud that they had the opportunity to hear President Ford \nremembered and eulogized with eloquence, grace, and honesty. America is \na better place because of President Gerald Ford. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S280-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S280-S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    CORPORAL MATTHEW JOSEPH STANLEY\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. \nArmy CPL Matthew Joseph Stanley of Wolfeboro, NH. Tragically, on \nDecember 16, 2006, this courageous young soldier and two of his \ncomrades gave their last full measure for our Nation when their Army \nvehicle struck an improvised explosive device in Taji, Iraq, north of \nBaghdad. At the time of this hostile action Corporal Stanley, a cavalry \nscout with C Troop, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry \nDivision, based in Fort Hood, TX, was serving his second tour in Iraq \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Matthew was a 2002 graduate of Kingswood Regional High School where \nhe was wellknown and liked by his teachers and fellow students. \nClassmates remember Matthew as fun, always laughing and having a smile \non his face. Family and friends say he was one of the nicest guys you \nwould ever want to meet and remember his fondness for hunting and \nfishing.\n  Sensing a call to duty, and because of his desire to protect his \ncountry, in December 2003, Matthew joined the U.S. Army. Upon \ncompleting basic training at Fort Knox, KY, in the spring of 2004, he \nreported to Fort Hood, TX. The awards and decorations that Corporal \nStanley received over the succeeding months are a testament to the \nstrong character of this man. They include the Bronze Star Medal, \nPurple Heart, two Army Commendation Medals, Army Good Conduct Medal, \nCombat Action Badge, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, \nOverseas Service Ribbon, and Expert Rifle Qualification Badge. He was \nposthumously promoted to the rank of corporal.\n  Patriots from the state of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from Bunker Hill to Taji--and U.S. Army CPL \nMatthew Stanley served and fought in that same fine tradition. During \nour country's difficult Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine wrote ``These \nare the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine \npatriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; \nbut he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and \nwoman.'' In these turbulent times Matthew stood with the country he \nloved, served it with distinction and honor, and earned and deserves \nour love and thanks.\n  My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Matthew's wife Amy, \nhis parents Lynn and Richard, his brothers and sisters, and to his \nother family members and many friends who have suffered this most \ngrievous loss. All will sorely miss Matthew Stanley, a 22-year-old \npatriot who was proud of his family, proud of where he lived, and proud \nof what he did. In the words of Daniel Webster--may his remembrance\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nbe as long lasting as the land he honored. God bless Matthew Joseph \nStanley.\n\n\n                     corporal jonathan e. schiller\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with a sense of sadness, but also \npride, that I rise today to pay tribute to CPL. Jonathan E. Schiller of \nOttumwa, IA, who gave his life on New Year's Eve in service to his \ncountry in Iraa. He is remembered by friends and family for his good \nhumor and his patriotism. Corporal Schiller's parents, Bill and Liz \nSchiller, said of their son, ``Jon died doing what he loved, serving \nhis country and protecting the freedom of our people and others. We are \nproud of our son's accomplishments and those of his fellow soldiers in \nthe Army and all branches of the military. We are forever grateful to \nthe Army for changing our boy into a man who fought and died defending \nsomething that we take for granted every day... freedom!'' My thoughts \nand prayers are with Bill and Liz, Jon's brothers Charlie and Max, and \nall of those in the Ottumwa area and elsewhere who mourn the loss of \nthis brave young man. Jon Schiller's willingness to volunteer for \nmilitary service in a time of war speaks loudly to his love of our \ncountry. He now joins the honored ranks of generations of American \nyouth who have laid down their lives for the preservation of freedom. \nHis courageous service and tremendous sacrifice must never be forgotten \nby a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S281-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      WELCOMING REPRESENTATIVE MAZIE HIRONO TO THE 110TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to welcome the newest \nmember of the Hawaii Congressional Delegation, Representative Mazie \nHirono, to the 110th Congress.\n  Representative Hirono has previously served the State of Hawaii as \nLieutenant Governor, Hawaii State Representative, and deputy state \nattorney general, and I am confident she will continue her \ndistinguished record as a compassionate, tireless, and courageous \npublic servant through her service in Washington as a Member of the \nU.S. House of Representatives. She embodies the best of Hawaii and our \nNation.\n  As a young girl, she and her mother and two brothers emmigrated from \nJapan in search of a better life. The life they found in Hawaii was \nmarked by struggle and hard work. But, more importantly, Mazie Hirono \nfound hope and self-reliance.\n  She also learned an important lesson that still guides her today. \n``My mother taught me that no circumstance is beyond the power of \ncourage, and that when you know what is right you must find the will to \nact, even against the greatest of odds,'' she says. That uncommon \nspirit, from an uncommon mother, defines Mazie Hirono.\n  I kindly ask you and my colleagues to join me in welcoming \nRepresentative Hirono to the 110th Congress of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S281-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF GARY LaPIERRE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a New England \njournalism legend, Gary LaPierre, who retired on December 29, capping a \nremarkable career. For many citizens of our region, Gary LaPierre is \nthe voice of New England. He comes from the beautiful small town of \nShelburne Falls, MA, where his mother Esther still lives today, and is \none of the most dependable, fair, and effective journalists \nMassachusetts has ever seen. Gary first began covering me in my 1964 \nSenate reelection campaign, and he has been asking me questions ever \nsince--his interviews with me number in the hundreds. This past \nelection day, November 7, 2006, Gary declared me the winner in my \nSenate race that evening.\n  Gary has won many awards for his outstanding journalism over the \nyears. His ``LaPierre on the Loose'' segment and his skills in \ninvestigative reporting send chills down the spines of anyone out to \ndefy the public interest. Whether it is lighthearted regional stories, \ninvestigative analyses, or news of the day, Gary handles them all well, \nand he brings them to us with his trademark clarity, vision, and \nintegrity. I am not sure what Boston will do in the mornings now that \nGary is retiring.\n  I have always liked Gary. He asks the tough questions, and he has \nbeen there when history was happening in Boston. He brought national \nstories to local neighborhood news and covered everything local \nsuperbly.\n  Schoolchildren love Gary, too. When we were buried in a snowstorm, he \nis the dean of school cancellations and can read through the list \nfaster than anyone on the air. He covered the blizzard of 1978 while \nholed up in his studio for 5 straight days, keeping constant tabs on \nthose stranded on Route 128. For many, Gary was the narrator in what \nbecame one of Boston most cherished hometown stories.\n  But Gary's reach has often extended beyond Boston borders. He has \ntraveled with the Beatles, and he met our Iranian hostages in Germany. \nBut he always came home to where his heart is--and we are happy he did.\n  Gary is a fair political reporter as well. He has covered every \nDemocratic Presidential Convention I can recall--and Republican ones, \ntoo--and he covered my own campaign in 1980. In fact, no campaign is \ncomplete without Gary's analysis, and we have all learned a great deal \nfrom him over the years.\n  His reassuring voice guided us through the horrors of September 11, a \nday that none of us will ever forget. He also brought us the joys of \nthe Red Sox World Series Championship in 2004. Whatever the topic, he \nhad a talent for making his listeners feel they were a part of the \nevent.\n  Gary's compassion, his integrity, and his love for Boston will be \nmissed on the airwaves each morning, but he leaves us with cherished \nmemories, and he helped make WBZ in Boston the world class broadcasting \nstation it is today. Now, as he retires, I join his countless admirers \nin wishing him a long and happy retirement. He has certainly earned it. \nWe will miss you on WBZ, Gary, but to us, you will always be the voice \nof Boston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S281-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S281-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S281-5", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 6:10 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 159.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal \nthe Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, \nSenator Collins, to introduce legislation that protects the retirement \nbenefits earned by public employees and eliminates barriers which \ndiscourage many Americans from pursuing careers in public service. This \nbill will repeal two provisions of the Social Security Act--the \nGovernment Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination Provision--which \nunfairly reduce the retirement benefits earned by public employees such \nas teachers, police officers, and firefighters.\n  The Government Pension Offset reduces a public employee's Social \nSecurity spousal or survivor benefits by an amount equal to two-thirds \nof his or her public pension.\n  Take the case of a widowed, retired police officer who receives a \npublic pension of $600 per month. His job in the local police \ndepartment was not covered by Social Security, yet his wife's private-\nsector employment was. An amount equal to two-thirds of his public \npension, or $400 each month, would be cut from his Social Security \nsurvivor benefits. If this individual is eligible for $500 in survivor \nbenefits, the Government Pension Offset provision would reduce his \nmonthly benefits to $100.\n  In most cases, the Government Pension Offset eliminates the spousal \nbenefit for which an individual qualifies. In fact, 9 out of 10 public \nemployees affected by the Government Pension Offset lose their entire \nspousal benefit, even though their spouse paid Social Security taxes \nfor many years.\n  The Windfall Elimination Provision reduces Social Security benefits \nby up to 50 percent for retirees who have paid into Social Security and \nalso receive a public pension, such as from a teacher retirement fund.\n  While the reforms that led to the creation of the Government Pension \nOffset and Windfall Elimination Provision were meant to prevent public \nemployees from being unduly enriched, the\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\npractical effect is that those providing critical public services are \nunjustly penalized.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Pension \nOffset provision alone reduces earned benefits for more than 300,000 \nAmericans each year, by upwards of $3,600. In some cases, for those \nliving on fixed incomes, this represents the difference between a \ncomfortable retirement and poverty.\n  Nearly one million Federal, State, and municipal workers, as well as \nteachers and other school district employees, are unfairly held to a \ndifferent standard when it comes to retirement benefits.\n\n  Private-sector retirees receive monthly Social Security checks equal \nto 90 percent of their first $656 in average monthly career earnings. \nHowever, under the Windfall Elimination Provision, retired public \nemployees are only allowed to receive 40 percent of the first $656 in \ncareer monthly earnings, a penalty of over $300 per month.\n  This unfair reduction in retirement benefits is inequitable. The \nSocial Security Fairness Act will allow government pensioners the \nchance to receive the same 90 percent of their benefits to which \nnongovernment pension recipients are entitled.\n  We must do more to encourage people to pursue careers in public \nservice. Unfortunately, the Government Pension Offset and Windfall \nElimination Provision make it more difficult to recruit teachers, \npolice officers, and fire fighters; and, it does so at a time when we \nshould be doing everything we can to recruit the best and brightest to \nthese careers.\n  California's police force needs to add more than 10,000 new officers \nby 2014--a growth of nearly 15 percent--while hiring more than 15,000 \nadditional officers to replace those who leave the force.\n  It is estimated that public schools will need to hire between 2.2 \nmillion and 2.7 million new teachers nationwide by 2009 because of \nrecord enrollments. The projected retirements of thousands of veteran \nteachers and critical efforts to reduce class sizes also necessitate \nhiring additional teachers.\n  California currently has more than 300,000 teachers but will need to \ndouble this number by 2010, to 600,000 teachers, in order to keep up \nwith student enrollment levels.\n  Most importantly, the Government Pension Offset and Windfall \nElimination Provision hinder efforts to recruit new math and science \nteachers from the private sector. As our world becomes increasingly \ninterconnected, it is imperative that our school children receive the \nfinest math and science education to ensure our Nation's future \ncompetitiveness in the global economy.\n  It is counterintuitive that on the one-hand, policymakers seek to \nencourage people to change careers and enter the teaching profession, \nwhile on the other hand, those wishing to do so are discouraged because \nthey are clearly told that their Social Security retirement benefits \nwill be significantly reduced.\n  Now that we are witnessing the practical effects of these 20 year old \nprovisions, I hope that Congress will pass legislation to address the \nunfair reduction of benefits that essentially sends the message that if \nyou do enter public service, your family will suffer and will be unable \nto receive the full retirement benefits to which they would otherwise \nbe entitled.\n  I understand that we are facing deficits and repealing the Government \nPension Offset and Windfall Elimination Provision will be costly.\n  I am open to considering all options that move us toward our goal of \nremoving this inequity by allowing individuals to keep the Social \nSecurity benefits to which they are entitled while promoting public \nsector employment.\n  We should respect, not penalize, our public service employees. I hope \nthat my colleagues will join me in sending this long overdue message to \nour Nation's public servants, that we value their contributions and \nsupport giving all Americans the retirement benefits they have earned \nand deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Social Security \nFairness Act. This bill repeals two provisions of current law--the \nwindfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset \n(GPO) that unfairly reduce earned Social Security benefits for many \npublic employees when they retire.\n  Individuals affected by both the GPO and the WEP are those who are \neligible for Federal, State or local pensions from work that was not \ncovered by Social Security, but who also qualify for Social Security \nbenefits based on their own work in covered employment or that of their \nspouses. While the two provisions were intended to equalize Social \nSecurity's treatment of workers, we are concerned that they unfairly \npenalize individuals for holding jobs in public service when the time \ncomes for them to retire.\n  These two provisions have enormous financial implications not just \nfor Federal employees, but for our teachers, police officers, \nfirefighters and other public employees as well. Given their important \nresponsibilities, it is unfair to penalize them when it comes to their \nSocial Security benefits. These public servants--or their spouses--have \nall paid taxes into the Social Security system. So have their \nemployers. Yet, because of these two provisions, they are unable to \ncollect all of the Social Security benefits to which they otherwis'e \nwould be entitled.\n  While the GPO and WEP affect public employees and retirees in \nvirtually every State, their impact is most acute in 15 States, \nincluding Maine. Nationwide, more than one-third of teachers and \neducation employees, and more than one-fifth of other public employees, \nare affected by the GPO and/or the WEP.\n  Almost one million retired government workers across the country have \nalready been adversely affected by these provisions. Many more stand to \nbe affected by them in the future. Moreover, at a time when we should \nbe doing all that we can to attract qualified people to public service, \nthis reduction in Social Security benefits makes it even more difficult \nfor our Federal, State and local governments to recruit and retain the \nteachers, police officers, firefighters and other public servants who \nare so critical to the safety and well-being of our families.\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n  The Social Security windfall elimination provision reduces Social \nSecurity benefits for retirees who paid into Social Security and who \nreceive a government pension from work not covered under Social \nSecurity, such as pensions from the Maine State Retirement Fund. While \nprivate sector retirees receive Social Security checks based on 90 \npercent of their first $656 average monthly career earnings, government \npensioners checks are based on 40 percent--a harsh penalty of more than \n$300 per month.\n  The government pension offset reduces an individual's survivor \nbenefit under Social Security by two-thirds of the amount of his or her \npublic pension. It is estimated that 9 out of 10 public employees \naffected by the GPO lose their entire spousal benefit, even though \ntheir deceased spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years.\n  What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those \nwho can least afford the loss--lower-income women. In fact, of those \naffected by the GPO, 73 percent are women. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than \n200,000 of these individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that \ncan make the difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty.\n  Our teachers and other public employees face difficult enough \nchallenges in their day-to-day work. Individuals who have devoted their \nlives to public service should not have the added burden of worrying \nabout their retirement. Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked \nwith me about this issue. They love their jobs and the children they \nteach, but they worry about the future and about their financial \nsecurity in retirement.\n  I hear a lot about this issue in my constituent mail, as well. \nPatricia Dupont, for example, of Orland, ME, wrote that, because she \ntaught for 15 years under Social Security in New Hampshire, she is \nliving on a retirement income of less than $13,000 after 45 years in \neducation. Since she also lost survivors' benefits from her husband's \nSocial Security, she calculates that a repeal of the WEP and the GPO \nwould double her current retirement income.\n  These provisions also penalize private sector employees who leave \ntheir jobs to become public school teachers. Ruth Wilson, a teacher \nfrom Otisfield, ME, wrote:\n\n       ``I entered the teaching profession two years ago, partly \n     in response to the nationwide pleas for educators. As the \n     current pool of educators near retirement in the next few \n     years, our schools face a crisis. Low wages and long hard \n     hours are not great selling points to young students when \n     selecting a career.\n       I love teaching and only regretted my decision when I found \n     out about the penalties I will unfairly suffer. In my former \n     life as a well-paid systems manager at State Street Bank in \n     Boston, I contributed the maximum to Social Security each \n     year. When I decided to become an educator, I figured that \n     because of my many years of maximum Social Security \n     contributions, I would still have a livable retirement \n     `wage.' I was unaware that I would be penalized as an \n     educator in your State.''\n\n  In September of 2003, I chaired a Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearing to examine the effect that the GPO and the WEP have had on \npublic employees and retirees. We heard compelling testimony from Julia \nWorcester of Columbia, ME--who was then 73. Mrs. Worcester told the \nCommittee about her work in both Social Security-covered employment and \nas a Maine teacher, and about the effect that the GPO and WEP have had \non her income in retirement. Mrs. Worcester worked for more than 20 \nyears as a waitress and in factory jobs before deciding, at the age of \n49, to go back to school to pursue her life-long dream of becoming a \nteacher. She began teaching at the age of 52 and taught full-time for \n15 years before retiring at the age of 68. Since she was only in the \nMaine State Retirement System for 15 years, Mrs. Worcester does not \nreceive a full State pension. Yet she is still subject to the full \npenalties under the GPO and WEP. As a consequence, she receives just \n$171 a month in Social Security benefits, even though she worked hard \nand paid into the Social Security system for more than 20 years. After \npaying for her health insurance, she receives less than $500 a month in \ntotal pension income.\n  After a lifetime of hard work, Mrs. Worcester, is still substitute \nteaching just to make ends meet. This simply is not fair. I am \ntherefore pleased to join Senator Feinstein in introducing this \nlegislation to repeal these two unfair provisions, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 207. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntaxpayers to designate part or all of any income tax refund to support \nreservists and National Guard members; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nassist the families of our reservists and National Guard members. With \nour reservists and National Guard members bravely answering our \ncountry's call to service, we must do all we can to meet the calls of \nhelp from those families left behind who are struggling financially as \na result of their loved ones' wartime service.\n  All too often, the families of reservists and National Guard members \nmust contend not only with the physical absence of a loved one but also \nwith the loss of income that makes paying house, car, medical and other \nbills too great of a burden to bear without help. According to the \nlatest available statistics, some 55 percent of married Guard members \nand reservists have experienced a loss in income, with nearly 50 \npercent experiencing a loss of $1,000 in pay per month and 15 percent \nexperiencing a loss of $30,000 or more in pay a year. With our Guard \nand reservists putting their lives on the line, they should not also \nhave to put their families' financial lives on the line due to their \nservice.\n  In an effort to provide relief to these families, I am introducing \ntoday the Voluntary Support for Reservists and National Guard Members \nAct that would bolster the financial assistance available to these \nfamilies. More specifically, the Voluntary Support for Reservists and \nNational Guard Members Act would provide taxpayers the option of \ncontributing part of their tax refund to the Reserve Income Replacement \nProgram which provides financial assistance to those families who have \nexperienced an income loss due to a call-up to active duty. In 2005, \nthe IRS issued 106 million refunds that totaled $227 billion with the \naverage refund coming in at $2,141.36. Even a small percentage of this \namount could make a significant difference in the lives of these \nreservist and National Guard families.\n  While we can do little to ease the emotional burden experienced by \nfamilies regarding the service of their loved ones, we can at least try \nto give them some peace of mind when it comes to their day-to-day \nfinances. These families already have made a great sacrifice to the \nnation, and they should not also have to sacrifice their financial \nwell-being due to their loved ones' service. Beyond our gratitude, care \npackages and gifts, we can thank our troops for their service by \nhelping to meet the everyday needs of their families who are facing \nfinancial hardships. My bill would provide Americans a convenient way \nto thank our troops by contributing a portion of their tax refunds to \ngive much-needed help to the loved ones of our reservists and National \nGuard members .\n  I ask unanimous consent that my legislation, the Voluntary Support \nfor Reservists and National Guard Members Act, and the accompanying \nremarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate nationwide availability of 2-2-1 \ntelephone service for information and referral on human services, \nvolunteer services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Calling \nfor 2-1-1 Act. I'm thrilled to be a part of the new Democratic Congress \nas we move to pass the kind of bipartisan legislation I'm talking about \ntoday--a bill that could make an invaluable difference in the lives of \ncitizens in New York and the country.\n  I'd first like to thank my colleague Senator Dole for joining me in \nthis effort. Because of her long history with the Red Cross, the \nSenator understands the importance of 2-1-1, and I am so pleased to be \nworking with her again in this new Congress to champion this important \ncause.\n  Every hour of every day, someone in the United States needs essential \nservices--from finding an after-school program to securing adequate \ncare for an aging parent. Faced with a dramatic increase in the number \nof agencies and help-lines, people often don't know where to turn. In \nmany cases, people end up going without necessary services because they \ndo not know where to start. The 2-1-1 system is a user-friendly social-\nservices network, providing an easy-to-remember and universally \navailable phone number that links individuals and families in need to \nthe appropriate nonprofit and government agencies. 2-1-1 helps people \nfind and give help by providing information on job training, schools, \nvolunteer opportunities, elder care housing, and countless other \ncommunity needs.\n  However, the importance of this system extends far beyond the day to \nday needs of our citizens. The need for effective communication was \nmade crystal clear in the immediate aftermath of the devastation of \nSeptember 11, when most people did not know where to turn for \ninformation about their loved ones. Fortunately for those who knew \nabout it, 2-1-1 was already operating in Connecticut, and it was \ncritical in helping identify the whereabouts of victims, connecting \nfrightened children with their parents, providing information on \nterrorist suspects, and linking ready volunteers with coordinated \nefforts and victims with necessary mental and physical health services. \n2-1-1 provided locations of vigils and support groups, and information \non bioterrorism for those concerned about future attacks.\n  As time went by, many people needed help getting back on their feet. \nMore than 100,000 people lost their jobs. Close to 2,000 families \napplied for housing assistance because they couldn't pay their rent or \nmortgage. 90,000 people developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or clinical depression within eight weeks of the attacks. \nAnother 34,000 people met the criteria for both diagnoses. And 2-1-1 \nwas there to help.\n  The needs were great and the people of America rose to the challenge. \nBut our infrastructure struggled to keep up with this outpouring of \nsupport. In fact, a Brookings Institution and Urban Institute study of \nthe aftermath of September 11 found that many dislocated workers \nstruggled to obtain available assistance. The devastation of natural \ndisasters Hurricanes Katrina and Rita further demonstrated the need to \nconnect people to services quickly in a time of crisis. That's what 2-\n1-1 is all about: providing a single, efficient, coordinated way for \npeople who need help to connect with those who can provide it.\n  There is broad, bi-partisan support for this legislation--because the \nneed for it has been proven. Unfortunately, in many States, limited \nresources have slowed the process of connecting communities with this \nvital service. Without adequate Federal support, 2-1-1 will not reach a \nnationwide population for decades. The University of Texas developed a \nnational cost-benefit analysis that found there would be a savings to \nsociety of nearly $1.1 billion over ten years if 2-1-1 were operational \nnationwide. The Federal Government, States, counties, businesses and \ncitizens all stand to benefit from a nationwide 2-1-1 service.\n  As this new Congress moves in a positive direction for America, we \nmust enact legislation that best protects and prepares ourselves for \nthe future. All fifty States deserve to be equipped with the proper \ncommunication to respond effectively in an emergency situation.\n  Every single American should have a number they can call to cut \nthrough the chaos of an emergency. That number is 2-1-1. It's time to \nmake our citizens and our country safer by making this resource \navailable nationwide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 215 A bill to amend the communications act of 1934 to ensure net \nneutrality: to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the issue of Internet freedom, which is \nalso known as net neutrality, is one that is very important to me. I \nhave long fought in Congress against media concentration, to prevent \nthe consolidation of control over what Americans see, read and hear in \nthe media. Americans have recognized how important this issue is and \nmillions spoke out when the FCC sought to loosen the ownership rules to \nallow for more consolidation.\n  But now, Americans face an equally great threat to the democratic \nvehicle of the Internet. The Internet, which we have always taken for \ngranted as an open and free engine for economic and creative growth, is \nnow also at risk, and this must also become a front burner issue for \nconsumers and businesses.\n  The Internet became a robust engine of economic development by \nenabling anyone with a good idea to connect to consumers and compete on \na level playing field for consumers' business. The marketplace picked \nwinners and losers, and not some central gatekeeper. Our economy, small \nbusinesses and consumers benefited tremendously from that dynamic \nmarketplace.\n  But now we face a situation where the FCC has removed \nnondiscrimination rules that applied to Internet providers for years, \nand that enabled the Internet to flourish, and consumers and innovation \nto thrive.\n  The FCC removed these rules, and broadband operators soon thereafter \nannounced their interest in acting in discriminatory ways, planning to \ncreate tiers on the Internet that could restrict content providers' \naccess to the\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nInternet unless they pay extra for faster speeds or better service. \nUnder their plan, the Internet would become a new world where those \ncontent providers who can afford to pay special fees would have better \naccess to consumers.\n  On November 7, 2005 then-SBC, now AT, CEO Ed Whitacre was quoted in \nBusiness Week as saying: ``They don't have any fiber out there. They \ndon't have any wires. They don't have anything . . . They use my lines \nfor free--and that's bull. For a Google or a Yahoo! or a Vonage or \nanybody to expect to use these pipes for free is nuts!''\n  In another article a senior executive from Verizon was quoted as \nsaying: ``(Google) is enjoying a free lunch that should, by any \nrational account, be the lunch of the facilities providers.''\n  Now perhaps if we had a competitive broadband market we would not \nneed to be concerned about the discriminatory intentions of some \nproviders. In a market with many competitors, there is a reasonable \nchance that market forces would discipline bad behavior.\n  But this is not the case today: FCC statistics on broadband show that \nthe local cable and telephone companies have a 98 percent share of the \nnational broadband residential access market.\n  For those that say, the market will take care of competition, and \nensure that those that own the broadband networks won't discriminate, \nthat cannot be so when at best consumers have a choice of two \nproviders.\n  Furthermore, these broadband operators have their own content and \nservices, video, VOIP, media content. They have an incentive to favor \ntheir own services and to act in an anti-competitive fashion. Last year \nCablevision's Tom Rutledge talking about Vonage made the following \nstatement: ``So, anyone who buys Vonage on our network using our data \nservice doesn't really know what they are doing . . . Our service is \nbetter, its quality of service. We actually prioritize the bits so that \nthe voice product is a better product.''\n  With these developments, consumers' ability to use content, services \nand applications could now be subject to decisions made by their \nbroadband providers. The broadband operator will become a gatekeeper, \ncapable of deciding who can get through to a consumer, who can get \nspecial deals, faster speeds, better access to the consumer.\n  This fundamentally changes the way the Internet has operated and \nthreaten to derail the democratic nature of the Internet. American \nconsumers and businesses will be worse off for it.\n  It is for this reason that Senator Snowe and I are reintroducing the \nInternet Freedom Preservation Act, with the support of Internet \nbusinesses large and small, consumer groups, labor and education \ngroups, religious organizations, and many others.\n  Last year we faced an uphill battle: broadband providers were \nspending millions of dollars on print and television advertisements and \nefforts to convince lawmakers to let them act as gatekeepers on the \nInternet, removing the power from the consumers that drive Internet \nchoice today.\n  We still face the vast resources of broadband operators that seek to \nauthorize their ability to control content on the Internet. But more \nimportantly on the side of our legislation we have the grass roots \nsupport for and the substantive merits of Internet freedom.\n  In addition, we have proof that it can be done- nondiscrimination \nrules and Internet freedom can co-exist with profitable business plans. \nRecently AT accepted as a condition of its merger with BellSouth a \nnet neutrality provision written by the FCC. Wall Street immediately \nreported that it expected no impact on AT's bottom line by the \nacceptance of these conditions, and AT is forging ahead, while at the \nsame time having committed to protecting Internet freedom.\n  It is clear that an open and neutral Internet can co-exist and thrive \nalong with competitive and profitable business models.\n  But legislation is still critical. The merger conditions are an \nimportant step but are not enough. We must restore Internet freedom \nmandates to the entire broadband industry and make them permanent, \nensuring that consumers can continue to receive the benefits of an open \nand vibrant Internet not only in the short term from AT, but from any \nbroadband provider in the longer term.\n  Today we introduce the Internet Freedom Preservation Act to ensure \nthat the Internet remains a platform that spawns innovation and \neconomic development for generations to come. We look forward to \nworking with our colleagues in Congress to enact these important \nmeasures into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain Federal land in \nthe Santa Fe National Forest and certain non-Federal land in the Pecos \nNational Historical Park in the State of New Mexico; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing along with Mr. \nDomenici the ``Pecos National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of \n2007''. This bill will authorize a land exchange between the Federal \nGovernment and a private landowner that will benefit the Pecos National \nHistorical Park in my State of New Mexico.\n  Specifically, the bill will enable the Park Service to acquire a \nprivate inholding within the Park's boundaries in exchange for the \ntransfer of a nearby tract of National Forest System land. The National \nForest parcel has been identified as available for exchange in the \nSanta Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and is \nsurrounded by private lands on three sides.\n  The Pecos National Historical Park possesses exceptional historic and \narchaeological resources. The Park preserves the ruins of the great \nPecos pueblo, which was a major trade center, and the ruins of two \nSpanish colonial missions dating from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n  The Glorieta unit of the park protects key sites associated with the \n1862 Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, a significant event that ended \nthe Confederate attempt to expand the war into the West. This unit will \ndirectly benefit from the land exchange.\n  Similar bills passed the Senate in the 106th, 108th, and 109th \nCongresses, and I hope it finally will be enacted this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill I have \nintroduced today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe income threshold used to calculate the refundable portion of the \nchild tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today Congress is confronted with how to \nbest provide tax relief to American families earning slightly more than \nthe minimum wage. We can do that by expanding the availability of the \nchild tax credit to more working families.\n  In 2001, I pushed to make the child tax credit refundable for workers \nmaking around the minimum wage. As enacted in 2001, a portion of a \ntaxpayer's child tax credit would be refundable--up to 10 percent of \nearnings above $10,000.\n  In 2004, Congress passed the Working Families Tax Relief of 2004, \nwhich increased from 10 percent to 15 percent the portion of the child \ntax credit that is refundable. Although the legislation increased the \namount of the refundable child credit, it failed to increase the number \nof families eligible for the benefit. The consequences are serious for \nlow-income Americans living paycheck-to-paycheck. It means that tens of \nthousands of low-income families will be completely ineligible for a \ncredit they should receive.\n  This year, because the income threshold is indexed, only taxpayers \nearning over $11,750 are eligible to receive the refundable portion of \nthe child tax credit. Low-income families earning less than $11,750 are \nshut out of the child tax credit completely.\n  For example, a single mother who earns the current minimum wage and \nworks a 40 hour week, for all 52 weeks of the year, fails to qualify \nfor the refundable portion of the child tax credit. Since the mother \nearns $10,700, she is a mere $300 away from qualifying for the credit. \nWorse, if the single mother does not receive a raise the following \nyear, it will be even tougher to qualify because the $11,750 she \noriginally needed to earn is adjusted for inflation and will increase.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, the Working Family Child \nAssistance Act, with Senators Lincoln, Obama, and Rockefeller that will \nenable more hard-working, low-income families to receive the refundable \nchild credit this year. My legislation returns the amount of income a \nfamily must earn to qualify for the child tax credit to $10,000. \nMoreover, my bill would ``de-index'' the $10,000 threshold for \ninflation, so families failing to get a raise each year would not lose \nbenefits.\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\n  Most notably, my bill is identical to the refundable child credit \nproposal the Senate passed in May 2001 as part of its version of that \nyear's tax bill. Although I was able to ensure that a refundable child \ncredit would be part of the final bill sent to President Bush, \nconferees did index the $10,000 threshold to inflation despite my best \nefforts.\n  The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that this \nlegislation will allow an additional 600,000 families to benefit from \nthe refundable child tax credit. The Maine Department of Revenue \nestimates that 16,700 families in Maine alone would benefit from our \nproposal. Two thousand of these Maine families would otherwise be \ncompletely locked out of the refundable child tax credit under current \nlaw.\n  For example, my legislation provides a $113 child credit to a mom who \nearns $10,750 per year. That's money she could use to buy groceries, \nschool books, other family necessities, and even pay rent.\n  Our families and our country are better off when government lets \npeople keep more of what they earn. Parents deserve their per-child tax \ncredit, and my bill rewards families for work.\n  I am committed to this issue and have called on President Bush to \nwork with Congress so we can help an additional one million children, \nwhose parents and guardians struggle every day to take care of them.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to once again \nraise an issue that is near and dear to my heart--an issue that is of \ngreat importance to working families across this country. In 2001 and \nagain in 2003, Senator Snowe and I worked together to ensure that low-\nincome working families with children receive the benefit of the Child \nTax Credit. I come here today to again ask my colleagues to help me \nensure that low-income families aren't forgotten as we discuss tax \nrelief in the 110th Congress.\n  Unfortunately, although we have made great strides in ensuring that \nthe credit is a useful tool for our working families, in its current \nform it isn't working for everyone. We can and should take an important \nadditional step to improve it.\n  As some of my colleagues may be aware, to be eligible for the \nrefundable child tax credit, working families must meet an income \nthreshold. If they don't earn enough, then they don't qualify for the \ncredit. The problem is that some of our working parents are working \nfull-time, every week of the year and yet they still don't earn enough \nto meet the income threshold to qualify for the credit, much less to \nreceive a meaningful refund.\n  In 2006, the New York Times highlighted a report which shows that \nalmost one-third of our children live in families that do not qualify \nfor the child tax credit because family earnings are too low. When you \nbreak the findings down by race, it's even more disheartening--about \nhalf of all African American children and half of all Latino children \nare left out of the full child tax credit because their family's \nearnings are just too low to qualify.\n  It is wrong to provide this credit to some hardworking Americans, \nwhile leaving others behind. The single, working parent that is \nstocking shelves at your local grocery store is every bit as deserving \nas the teacher, accountant or insurance salesman that qualifies for the \ncredit in its current form. We must address this inequity and we must \nensure that our tax code works for all Americans, especially those \nworking parents forced to get by on the minimum wage.\n  In response, Senator Snowe and I have proposed a solution that will \nbuild on our previous efforts to make this credit work for those that \nneed it the most. Today, we are reintroducing the Working Child Family \nAssistance Act, legislation which de-indexes the income threshold and \nsets it at a reasonable level so that all working parents, including \nthose making the minimum wage, qualify for the credit. This is a \nsimple, easy solution to a serious problem.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration \nto correct this inequity and to ensure that those low-income, hard-\nworking families that need this credit the most do receive its \nbenefits.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Child Tax Credit \nand to support S. 218, a bill I've worked on with Senators Snowe and \nLincoln. Working families should get the tax relief they deserve, and I \nam proud to cosponsor this bill to help realize this aspiration. The \nChild Credit is an important component of our Federal tax code, and S. \n218 is an important step in making the credit more valuable and more \nfair for those who need it most.\n  Raising children is expensive and has become even more so in recent \nyears. The Child Tax Credit allows middle class families to claim a \ncredit of $1,000 per child against their Federal income tax. That's a \nbig help in covering these rising costs.\n  Importantly, the Child Credit also recognizes the particular \nvulnerability low-income families with children. Since the credit is \nrefundable to the extent of 15 percent of a taxpayer's earned income in \nexcess of $11,300, families earning more than that threshold level of \nincome get at least a partial benefit even if they have no Federal \nincome tax liability. The benefit may be small for families with low \nincomes, but every penny helps defray the rising costs of being a \nworking parent in America today.\n  Unfortunately, as currently structured, the Child Credit leaves more \nand more families out of the benefit each year. That's because the \nincome threshold for eligibility rises annually at the rate of \ninflation even though family incomes may not rise as fast. That means \nthat if you earn the minimum wage, or if your wage is low and you \ndidn't get a raise, or if you worked fewer hours than the year before, \nthen your tax refund probably shrunk. It may even have disappeared. \nGiven that an estimated four and a half million households with \nchildren experienced this decline last year alone, we must reverse this \nunintended--and unfair--effect.\n  In many cases, indexing the parameters of the tax system for \ninflation makes sense because it neutralizes the effects of inflation \non the tax system. In this case, however, indexing the threshold \nresults in an unfair tax increase for low-income, working families \nwhose incomes are not keeping up with rising costs. Recent data \nindicates that the typical low-income household actually saw its \nearnings decline during the first few years ofthis decade. At the same \ntime, the costs of housing, childcare, and driving to work have \nincreased sharply.\n  This bill returns the threshold to its original level of $10,000 and \nfreezes it, thereby expanding the benefit to include more kids and \nprotecting those families from unfair tax increases due to inflation. \nThis is an important step in improving the fairness of our tax code and \nproviding necessary support to working families.\n  In time, I hope we will do more. It is unfair that more than eight \nmillion children in families with incomes too low to qualify for even a \npartial credit get no benefit at all. These are families whose incomes \nare far below the Federal poverty level and whose children ironically \nhave the greatest needs--even as their parents pay an enormous share of \ntheir incomes in taxes and basic services, such as food, housing, and \nclothing.\n  America can do better. In the new Congress, I hope we will tackle the \nbroader challenge of ensuring that their parents have jobs that pay \nliving wages, a home they can afford, a school district that enables a \nlife of opportunity, a community that cares for its children, and the \nfaith that hard work and personal commitment payoff. America can do \nthis.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill as \na first step in addressing the broader goal of equal opportunity for \nall Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 220. A bill to authorize early repayment of obligations to the \nBureau of Reclamation within the A & B Irrigation District in the State \nof Idaho; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southern \nIdaho Bureau of Reclamation Repayment Act of 2007. This Act authorizes \nprepayment by landowners of their allocated portion of the obligations \nto the Bureau of Reclamation within A Irrigation District and will \nallow individual landowners to prepay their obligations if they so \ndesire. Additionally, the Act will allow the landowners who\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\nhave prepaid to be exempt from the acreage limitation provisions set in \nthe Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, thereby creating an appropriate \nmarket for the sale of those lands now owned by landowners who have \neither died or have retired.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this necessary \nbill through the legislative process quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 221. A bill amend title 9, United States Code, to provide for \ngreater fairness in the arbitration process relating to livestock and \npoultry contracts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to re-introduce the Fair \nContracts for Growers Act of 2007. This bill would simply instill \nfairness into contractual dealings between farmers and processors. It \nensures that parties to a dispute related to agricultural contracts \nhave a true choice of venues.\n  I introduce this legislation because I believe that anti-competitive \nactivity has become a grave threat to the family farmer. During the \nlast Farm Bill debate, I brought this same bill forward, along with \nseveral others. Despite this policy passing the Senate, remarkably the \nfinal Farm Bill included no provisions to address concentration.\n  So, earlier this year, I announced that I will be putting forward a \npackage of bills that will focus on anti-competitive activity in the \nagriculture industry. This bill is the first step of my agriculture \nconcentration agenda.\n  Today's legislation is one piece of the puzzle to help stop the \nunfair impact that vertical integration is having on the family farmer. \nIn the last several years we've seen a tremendous shift in agriculture \ntoward contract production. Under many of these contract arrangements, \nlarge, vertically integrated agribusiness firms have the power to \ndictate the terms of ``take-it-or-leave-it'' production contracts to \nfarmers.\n  Then, when there is a dispute between the packer and the family \nfarmer, and the contract between the two includes an arbitration \nclause, the family farmer has no alternative but to accept arbitration \nto resolve the dispute. These clauses limit farmers' abilities to \npursue remedies in court, even when violations of Federal or State law \nare at issue. This mandatory arbitration process puts the farmer at a \nsee disadvantage. Even in a situation where discrimination or fraud is \nsuspected, a farmer's only recourse under such a contract is to submit \nto arbitration. The farmer cannot seek redress in court, even if the \nresult is bankruptcy or financial ruin.\n  Make no mistake, arbitration is very useful in certain situations. It \nreduces the load on our courts, and can save parties the expense of \ndrawn-out litigation. This bill would not rule out arbitration-just \nforced arbitration.\n  The Fair Contracts for Growers Act would amend the Packers and \nStockyards Act to require that any contract arbitration be voluntarily \nagreed upon by both parties to settle disputes at the time a dispute \narises, not when the contract is signed. This would allow farmers the \nopportunity to choose the best form of dispute resolution and not have \nto submit to the packers. It ensures that a farmer, most often the \n``little guy'' in these dealings, is able to maintain his \nconstitutional right to a jury trial. It also gives him a chance to \ncompel disclosure of relevant information, held by the company, which \nis necessary for a fair decision.\n  During consideration of the Farm Bill, the Senate passed, by a vote \nof 64-31, the Feingold-Grassley amendment to give farmers a choice of \nvenues to resolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts. I \nurge my colleagues to join with Senator Feingold and me, along with our \nother cosponsors, in supporting this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Iowa Farmers Union,\n\n                                        Ames, IA, January 3, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of Iowa \n     Farmers Union, Women, Food and Agriculture Network (WFAN) and \n     the Iowa Chapter of National Farmers Organization to \n     reiterate our strong support for the Fair Contracts for \n     Growers Act, and to thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing this legislation.\n       Contract livestock and poultry producers are being forced \n     to sign mandatory arbitration clauses, as part of a take-it-\n     or-leave-it, non-negotiable contract with large, vertically \n     integrated processing firms. These producers forfeit their \n     basic constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must \n     accept an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely \n     limits their rights and is often prohibitively expensive. \n     These clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving \n     farmers little if any ability to seek justice if they become \n     the victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has \n     control over the information needed for growers to argue \n     their case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be \n     available to a grower's attorney through discovery. In an \n     arbitration proceeding, the company is not required to \n     provide access to this information, thus placing the farmer/\n     grower at an extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal \n     rights that are waived through arbitration are access to \n     mediation and appeal as well as the right to an explanation \n     of the decision.\n       Many assume that arbitration is a less costly way of \n     resolving dispute than going to court, but for the producer, \n     the opposite is usually true. The high cost of arbitration is \n     often a significant barrier to most farmers. The up-front \n     filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the magnitude of \n     the dispute itself, with farmers being required to pay fees \n     in the thousands of dollars just to start the arbitration \n     process.\n       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \n     resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by \n     two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant \n     party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-\n     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon. \n     Independent family farmers all over the U.S. will benefit \n     from a law that stops the abuse of arbitration clauses in \n     livestock and poultry contracts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Chris Petersen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 4, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley, On behalf of the Campaign for \n     Contract Agriculture Reform, I would like to thank you for \n     your leadership in introducing the Fair Contracts for Growers \n     Act.\n       With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods of \n     agricultural production, farmers are increasingly producing \n     agricultural products under contract with large processors. \n     In many cases, particularly in the livestock and poultry \n     sector, the farmer never actually owns the product they \n     produce, but instead makes large capital investments on their \n     own land to build the facilities necessary to raise animals \n     for an ``integrator.''\n       Under such contract arrangements, farmers and growers are \n     often given take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable contracts, \n     with language drafted by the integrator in a manner designed \n     to maximize the company's profits and shift risk to the \n     grower. In many cases, the farmer has little choice but to \n     sign the contract presented to them, or accept bankruptcy. \n     The legal term for such contracts is ``contract of \n     adhesion.'' As contracts of adhesion become more commonplace \n     in agriculture, the abuses that often characterize such \n     contracts are also becoming more commonplace and more \n     egregious.\n       One practice that has become common in livestock and \n     poultry production contracts is the use of mandatory \n     arbitration clauses, where growers are forced to sign away \n     their constitutional rights to jury trial upon signing a \n     contract with an integrator, and instead accept a dispute \n     resolution forum that denies their basic legal rights and is \n     too costly for most growers to pursue.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has \n     control of the information needed for a grower to argue their \n     case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available \n     to a growers' attorney through discovery. In an arbitration \n     proceeding, the company is generally not required to provide \n     access to this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at \n     an extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are \n     waived through arbitration are access to mediation and \n     appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the \n     decision.\n       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less \n     costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for \n     the farmer, the opposite is usually true. The high cost of \n     arbitration is often a significant barrier to most farmers. \n     The up-front filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the \n     magnitude of the dispute itself. For example, in one \n     Mississippi case, filing fees for a poultry grower to begin \n     an arbitration proceeding were $11,000. In contrast, filing \n     fees for a civil\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\n     court case are $150 to $250. Lawyer fees in a civil case are \n     often paid on a contingent-fee basis.\n       In addition, the potential for mandatory arbitration \n     clauses to be used abusively by a dominant party in a \n     contract has also been recognized by Congress with regard to \n     other sectors of our economy. In 2002, legislation was \n     enacted with broad bipartisan support that prohibits the use \n     of pre-dispute, mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts \n     between car dealers and car manufacturers and distributors. \n     The Fair Contract for Growers Act is nearly identical in \n     structure to the ``car dealer'' arbitration bill passed by \n     Congress in 2002.\n       Thank you again for introducing the Fair Contracts for \n     Growers Act, to assure that arbitration in livestock and \n     poultry contracts is truly voluntary, after mutual agreement \n     of both parties after a dispute arises. If used, arbitration \n     should be a tool for honest dispute resolution, not a weapon \n     used to limit a farmers' right to seek justice for abusive \n     trade practices.\n       I look forward to working with you toward enactment of this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Steven D.

As you know, \n     the National Family Farm Coalition provides a voice for \n     grassroots groups on farm, food, trade and rural economic \n     issues to ensure fair prices for family farmers, safe and \n     healthy food, and vibrant, environmentally sound rural \n     communities. Our organization is committed to promoting \n     justice in agriculture, which is stymied by current practices \n     that give farmers unfair and unjust difficulties when they \n     wish to arbitrate a contract dispute.\n       Therefore, the Fair Contracts for Growers Act is very \n     timely. With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods \n     of agricultural production, farmers are increasingly \n     producing agricultural products under contract with large \n     processors. Under these contracts, it is common for farmers \n     and growers to be forced to sign mandatory arbitration \n     clauses, as part of a take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable \n     contract with a large, vertically integrated processing firm. \n     In doing so, the farmer is forced to give up their basic \n     constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must accept \n     an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely limits \n     their rights and is often prohibitively expensive. These \n     clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving farmers \n     little if any ability to seek justice if they become the \n     victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.\n       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived \n     in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or \n     grower to prove their case.

Increasingly, \n     farmers and ranchers are confronted with ``take-it-or-leave-\n     it,'' non-negotiable contracts, written by the company. These \n     contracts require that farmers and ranchers give up the basic \n     constitutional right of access to the courts and sign \n     mandatory binding arbitration clauses if they want access to \n     a market for their products. These clauses are signed before \n     any dispute arises, leaving the producers little, if any, \n     ability to seek justice if they become the victim of \n     fraudulent or abusive trade practices.\n       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute \n     resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by \n     two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant \n     party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-\n     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon. Many basic \n     legal processes are not available to farmers and ranchers in \n     arbitration. In most agricultural production contract \n     disputes, the company has control of the information needed \n     for a grower to argue a case. In a civil court case, this \n     evidence would be available to the grower's attorney through \n     discovery. In an arbitration proceeding, however, the company \n     is not required to provide access to this information, thus \n     placing the grower at an extreme disadvantage. In addition, \n     in most arbitration proceedings, a decision is issued without \n     an opinion providing an explanation of the principles and \n     standards or even the facts considered in reaching the \n     decision. The arbitration proceeding is a private, closed to \n     effective public safeguards, and the arbitration decisions \n     are often confidential and rarely subject to public oversight \n     or judicia1 review.\n       Moreover, there is a growing perception that the \n     arbitration system is biased towards the companies. This \n     private system is basically supported financially by the \n     companies which are involved repeatedly in arbitration cases. \n     The companies also know the history of previous arbitrations, \n     including which arbitrators generally decide in the \n     companies' favor. This arbitration history is rarely \n     available to a farmer or rancher involved in a single \n     arbitration proceeding.\n       Arbitration is often assumed to be a less costly way of \n     resolving disputes than litigation. But this assumption must \n     be tested in light of the relative resources of the parties. \n     For most farmers and ranchers, arbitration is a significant \n     expense in relation to their income. One immediate financial \n     barrier is filing fees and case service fees, which in \n     arbitration are usually divided between the parties. A few \n     thousand dollars out of pocket is a minuscule expense for a \n     well-heeled company but can be an insurmountable barrier for \n     a farmer with a modest income who is in conflict with the \n     farmer's chief source of income. This significant cost \n     barrier to most farmers, when coupled with the disadvantages \n     of the arbitration process, can deny farmers an effective \n     remedy in contract dispute cases with merit.\n       The Sustainable Agriculture Coalition represents family \n     farm, rural development, and conservation and environmental \n     organizations that share a commitment to federal policy \n     reform to promote sustainable agriculture and rural \n     development.

Our member organizations included \n     thousands of farmers and ranchers with small and mid-size \n     operations, a number of whom have entered into agricultural \n     production contracts or are considering whether to sign these \n     contracts. As individuals, these farmers and ranchers do not \n     have the financial power or negotiating position that \n     companies enjoy in virtually every contract dispute. We agree \n     with Senator Grassley that, in the face of such unequal \n     bargaining power, the Fair Contract for Growers Act is a \n     modest and appropriate step which allows growers the choice \n     of entering into arbitration or mediation or choosing to \n     exercise the basic legal right of access to the courts.\n       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these \n     concerns, and your willingness to introduce commonsense \n     legislation to stop the abuse of mandatory arbitration \n     clauses in livestock and poultry contracts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Martha L.

A bill to require Senate candidates to file designations, \nstatements, and reports in electronic form; to the committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will once again introduce with \nthe, Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, and the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, a bill to bring Senate campaigns into the 21st \ncentury by requiring that Senate candidates file their campaign finance \ndisclosure reports electronically and that those reports be promptly \nmade available to the public. This step is long overdue, and I hope \nthat the fact that we now have two dozen or so bipartisan cosponsors \nindicates that the Senate will act quickly on this legislation.\n  A series of reports by the Campaign Finance Institute has highlighted \nthe anomaly in the election laws that makes it nearly impossible for \nthe public to get access to Senate campaign finance reports while most \nother reports are available on the Internet within 24 hours of their \nfiling with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The Campaign Finance \nInstitute asks a rhetorical question: ``What makes the Senate so \nspecial that it exempts itself from a key requirement of campaign \nfinance disclosure that applies to everyone else, including candidates \nfor the House of Representatives and Political Action Committees?''\n  The answer, of course, is nothing. The United States Senate is \nspecial in many ways. I am proud to serve here. But there is no excuse \nfor keeping our campaign finance information inaccessible to the public \nwhen the information filed by House candidates or others is readily \navailable. A recent Washington Post editorial called this delay \n``completely unjustified.'' I couldn't agree more, especially now, when \nthe Senate is debating ethics reforms designed to increase transparency \nand accountability to the public. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof this editorial be printed in the Record following the text of the \nbill.\n  My bill amends the section of the election laws dealing with \nelectronic filing to require reports filed with the Secretary of the \nSenate to be filed electronically and forwarded to the FEC within 24 \nhours. The FEC is required to make available on the Internet within 24 \nhours any filing it receives electronically. So if this bill is \nenacted, electronic versions of Senate reports should be available to \nthe public within 48 hours of their filing. That will be a vast \nimprovement over the current situation, which, according to the \nCampaign Finance Institute, requires journalists and interested members \nof the public to review computer images of paper-filed copies of \nreports, and involves a completely wasteful expenditure of hundreds of \nthousands of dollars to re-enter information into databases that almost \nevery campaign has available in electronic format.\n  The current filing system also means that the detailed coding that \nthe FEC does, which allows for more sophisticated searches and \nanalysis, is completed over a week later for Senate reports than for \nHouse reports. This means that the final disclosure reports covering \nthe first two weeks of October are often not susceptible to detailed \nscrutiny before the election. According to the Campaign Finance \nInstitute, in the 2006 election, ``[v]oters in six of the hottest \nSenate races were out of luck the week before the November 7 election \nif they did Web searches for information on general election \ncontributions since June 30. In all ten of the most closely followed \nSenate races voters were unable to search through any candidate reports \nfor information on `pre-general election (October 1-18)' donations.'' \nAnd a September 18, 2006, column by Jeffery H. Birnbaum in the \nWashington Post noted that ``When the polls opened in November 2004, \nvoters were in the dark about $53 million in individual Senate \ncontributions of $200 or more dating all the way back to July . . .''\n  It is time for the Senate to at long last relinquish its backward \nattitude toward campaign finance disclosure. I am encouraged by the \nsupportive statements from a number of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, including the new Minority Leader and Minority Whip, and the \nnew Chair of the Rules Committee. I urge the enactment of this simple \nbill that will make our reports subject to the same prompt, public \nscrutiny as those filed by PACs, House and Presidential candidates, and \neven 527 organizations. I close with another question from the Campaign \nFinance Institute: ``Isn't it time that the Senate join the 21st \ncentury and allow itself to vote on a simple legislative fix that could \nsignificantly improve our democracy?'' This Congress, let us answer \nthat question in the affirmative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It decried the senseless and costly loophole under \n     which people running for the Senate--alone among federal \n     political candidates and committees--aren't required to file \n     campaign finance reports electronically. In an age when such \n     reports can be filed with the click of a mouse, Senate \n     candidates submit their disclosures on paper, with weeks of \n     delay before they are transferred to a form available and \n     searchable on the Internet. As a result, in the final stretch \n     of campaigns, anyone interested in learning who is \n     bankrolling Senate candidates or how they are spending the \n     cash has to go page by page through voluminous reports. This \n     delay is so obviously unjustified that we expected the legal \n     glitch to be quickly fixed.\n       Naive us. Three years later, the situation remains \n     unaddressed. According to the Campaign Finance Institute, as \n     late as the week before Election Day, in all 10 of the most \n     closely followed Senate races, no detailed information was \n     available online about contributions between Oct. 1 and Oct. \n     18, the last filing period before the election. For six \n     candidates in those races--Democrats Ned Lamont (Conn.), \n     Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), and \n     Republicans Mike DeWine (Ohio), Rick Santorum (Pa.) and \n     Thomas H. Kean Jr. (N.J.)--the only financial information \n     available was from before June 30.\n       It would be easy to change the rule, and the Senate should \n     do so in the final days of the 109th Congress. More than 20 \n     senators, of both parties, have signed on to S. 1508, the \n     Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act. If any senator opposes \n     requiring electronic filing, none is willing to say so. \n     Majority Whip Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who was rumored to be \n     opposed to the change, says he is for it. Senate Rules \n     Committee Chairman Trent Lott (R-Miss.), whose panel has \n     jurisdiction in this area, said three years ago that it was \n     ``part of honesty in elections, I think. Make it \n     accessible.'' Now what's needed is for Mr. Lott to get \n     committee members' approval to speed the matter to the Senate \n     floor.\n       To put it bluntly: Republicans, why let the new Democratic \n     majority get credit for making this obvious fix? Do it now, \n     while you're still in charge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 224. A bill to create or adopt, and implement, rigorous and \nvoluntary American education content standards in mathematics and \nscience covering kindergarten through grade 12, to provide for the \nassessment of student proficiency benchmarked against such standards, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on the 5th anniversary of No Child Left \nBehind (NCLB), I rise today to introduce The Standards to Provide \nEducational Achievement for Kids (SPEAK) Act, a bill designed to start \nthe job of holding every child in America to the same high standards. \nAt its core, SPEAK will create, adopt, and implement voluntary core \nAmerican education content standards in math and science while \nincentivizing States to adopt them.\n  America's leadership, economic, and national security rest on our \ncommitment to educate and prepare our youth to succeed in a global \neconomy. The key to succeeding in this endeavor is to have high \nexpectations for all American students as they progress through our \nNation's schools.\n  Currently there are 50 different sets of academic standards, 50 State \nassessments, and 50 definitions of proficiency under the No Child Left \nBehind Act. As a result of varied standards, exams and proficiency \nlevels, America's highly mobile student-aged population moves through \nthe Nation's schools gaining widely varying levels of knowledge, skills \nand preparedness. And yet, in order for the United States to compete in \na global economy, we must strengthen our educational expectations for \nall American children--we must compete as one Nation.\n  Recent international comparisons show that American students have \nsignificant shortcomings in math and science. Many lack the basic \nskills required for college or the workplace. This affects our economic \nand national security; it holds us back in the global marketplace and \nrisks ceding our competitive edge. This is unacceptable.\n  America was founded on the notion of ensuring equity and opportunity \nfor all. And yet, we risk both when we allow different students in \ndifferent States to graduate from high school with very different \neducations. We live in a Nation with an unacceptably high high school \ndropout rate. We live in a Nation where 8th graders in some States \nscore more than 30 points higher on tests of basic science knowledge \nthan students in other States. I ask my colleagues today what equality \nof opportunity we have under such circumstances.\n  This is where American standards come in. Voluntary, core American \nstandards in math and science are the first step in ensuring that all \nAmerican students are given the same opportunity to learn to a high \nstandard no matter where they reside. They will allow for meaningful \ncomparisons of student academic achievement across States, help ensure \nthat American students are academically qualified to enter college or \ntraining for the civilian or military workforce, and help ensure that \nstudents are better prepared to compete in the global marketplace. \nUniform standards are a first step in maintaining America's competitive \nand national security edge.\n  While I realize there will be resistance to such efforts, education \nis after all a State endeavor; we cannot ignore that at the end of the \nday America competes as one country on the global marketplace. This \ndoes not mean that I am asking States to cede their authority in \neducation. What the bill simply proposes is that we use the convening \npower of the Federal Government to develop standards and then provide \nStates with incentives to adopt them.\n  At the end of the day, this is a voluntary measure. States will \nchoose whether or not to participate. States that do participate, while \nrequired to adopt the American standards, will be given the flexibility \nto make them their own. They will have the option to add additional \ncontent requirements, they will have final say in how coursework is \nsequenced, and, ultimately, States and districts will still be the ones \ndeveloping the curriculum, choosing the textbooks and administering the \ntests. The standards provided for under this legislation will simply \nserve as a common core.\n  The SPEAK Act will task the National Assessment Governing Board \n(NAGB) with creating rigorous and voluntary core American education \ncontent standards in math and science for grades K-12. It will require \nthat the standards be anchored in the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress' (NAEP) math and science frameworks. It will \nensure that such standards are internationally competitive and \ncomparable to the best standards in the world. It will develop rigorous \nachievement levels. It will ensure that varying developmental levels of \nstudents are taken into account in the development of such standards. \nIt will provide for periodic review and update of such standards. It \nwill allow participating States the flexibility to add additional \nstandards to the core. And, it establishes an American Standards \nIncentive Fund to incentivize States to adopt the standards. Among the \nbenefits of participating is a significant infusion of funds for States \nto bolster their K-12 data systems.\n  What I propose today is a first step. A first step in regaining our \ncompetitive edge. A first step in ensuring that all American students \nhave the opportunity to receive a first class, high-quality education. \nIt is not a step that I am taking alone.\n  The SPEAK Act has garnered endorsements from businesses, math/science \norganizations, foundations, and the education community, including the \nNational Education Association (NEA). Through the leadership of \nCongressman Vernon Ehlers in the House of Representatives it shares not \nonly bicameral, but bipartisan support. Together we have all come \ntogether to affect meaningful change in our public schools.\n  We live in an economy where you can no longer lift, dig or assemble \nyour way to success. Today, you've got to think your way to success so \nthat when public education doesn't work, when we fail to compete as one \nnation, our entire country gets left behind. Low expectations translate \nto an America that is less competitive on the world stage. If that \nhappens, we are going to wonder why we didn't do anything about it \nwhile we still had time.\n  Core American standards will set high goals for all students, allow \nfor meaningful comparisons of achievement across States, and help \nensure\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nthat all of our students are qualified to enter college. At the end of \nthe day, we all want what's best for our country and parents want \nwhat's best for their kids. With core standards, America will begin the \nwork of regaining its competitive edge in the global economy. And in \nthe life of every student, equality will be made a little more real \nwith introduction of this bill, as the skills and knowledge we expect \nof them are no longer made contingent on where they reside.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the SPEAK Act. \nAs we start holding our students to the same high standards, I expect \nthat we will be amazed at the excellence that follows. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Voluntary American education content standards; American \n              Standards Incentive Fund.\nSec. 6. Authorization of appropriations.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout the years, educators and policymakers have \n     consistently embraced standards as the mechanism to ensure \n     that every student, no matter what school the student \n     attends, masters the skills and develops the knowledge needed \n     to participate in a global economy.\n       (2) Recent international comparisons make clear that \n     students in the United States have significant shortcomings \n     in mathematics and science, yet a high level of scientific \n     and mathematics literacy is essential to societal innovations \n     and advancements.\n       (3) With more than 50 different sets of academic content \n     standards, 50 State academic assessments, and 50 definitions \n     of proficiency under section 1111(b) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)), there is \n     great variability in the measures, standards, and benchmarks \n     for academic achievement in mathematics and science.\n       (4) Variation in State standards and the accompanying \n     measures of proficiency make it difficult for parents and \n     teachers to meaningfully gauge how well their children are \n     learning mathematics and science in comparison to their peers \n     internationally or here at home.\n       (5) The disparity in the rigor of standards across States \n     yield test results that tell the public little about how \n     schools are performing and progressing, as States with low \n     standards or low proficiency scores may appear to be doing \n     much better than States with more rigorous standards or \n     higher requirements for proficiency.\n       (6) As a result, the United States' highly mobile student-\n     aged population moves through the Nation's schools gaining \n     widely varying levels of knowledge, skills, and preparedness.\n       (7) In order for the United States to compete in a global \n     economy, the country needs to strengthen its educational \n     expectations for all children.\n       (8) To compete, the people of the United States must \n     compare themselves against international benchmarks.\n       (9) Grounded in a real world analysis and international \n     comparisons of what students need to succeed in work and \n     college, rigorous and voluntary core American education \n     content standards will keep the United States economically \n     competitive and ensure that the children of the United States \n     are given the same opportunity to learn to a high standard no \n     matter where they reside.\n       (10) Rigorous and voluntary core American education content \n     standards in mathematics and science will enable students to \n     succeed in academic settings across States while ensuring an \n     American edge in the global marketplace.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation that I introduced last November along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, and that I am again \nintroducing today. The bill would expand the number of eligible \nrecipients of retroactive payments under the Traumatic Injury \nProtection under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, or ``TSGLI'', \nbenefit. Most of my colleagues have perhaps heard the story of how this \nimportant benefit became law and what its intended purpose is, but I \nbelieve it is worth repeating.\n  In April of 2005 I was visited by three servicemembers who were \nseriously injured during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). They were \nmembers of an organization called the Wounded Warrior Project, and they \ntold me of their lengthy recovery times at Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter and the financial toll that that period of convalescence had on \nthem and their families. They talked about wives, parents, and other \nrelatives who had taken long absences from work, and some who had even \nquit their work, in order to spend time with those recovering at Walter \nReed. And they told me that the Department of Veterans Affairs \ncompensation system was no help because, by law, those benefits do not \nkick in until after separation from service.\n  Based on their experiences, these wounded warriors recommended that I \npursue legislation to create a new insurance benefit for those with \ntraumatic injuries such as theirs. The insurance would pay between \n$25,000 and $100,000 as soon as possible after an injury occurred, \nthereby bridging the gap in assistance needed during the time of a \nwounded servicemember's recovery and the time of his or her separation \nfrom service. They asked that I make the legislation prospective only, \nmeaning that they, and hundreds of others, would go without any TSGLI \npayment. I honored that request and, together with Senator Akaka and \nother Members of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, introduced an \namendment to the 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill then \npending before the Senate.\n  A second degree amendment was later unanimously agreed to which \nauthorized retroactive benefit payments to all of those injured in the \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) theaters \nof operation--providing for TSGLI payments to hundreds of \nservicemembers who had been seriously injured since the start of the \nwars in Afghanistan and Iraq. At the time, the retroactive TSGLI \nprovision was consistent with other retroactive benefits approved \nwithin the Emergency Supplemental bill, such as $238,000 in combined \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and death gratuity benefits \nthat were provided retroactively to survivors of those killed in combat \noperations since the start of the War on Terror. Needless to say, the \nTSGLI amendments were approved by the Congress and enacted into law.\n  Fast forward to the present. TSGLI has been up and running since \nDecember 1, 2005, and provides financial assistance of $25,000 to \n$100,000 to traumatically injured servicemembers within, on average, 60 \ndays of the date of the injury causing event. As of January 5, 2007, \nalmost 2,233 wounded OIF/OEF servicemembers have benefited under the \nretroactive portion of the program. For those with injuries post \nDecember 1, 2005, it does not matter if an injury occurs as a result of \ncombat operations or training exercises--payment under TSGLI is \navailable in either situation; 626 wounded servicemembers have \nbenefited under this aspect of the program.\n  The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on the TSGLI \nbenefit in September 2006. The Committee received testimony from the \nWounded Warrior Project, the organization largely responsible for \nTSGLI's conception. While very pleased with the program overall, a \nserious concern was raised regarding the equity of only extending \nretroactive TSGLI payments to those injured during Operations Iraqi and \nEnduring Freedom. Mr. Jeremy Chwat, testifying for the Wounded\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nWarrior Project that day, used the example of one servicemember as \nrepresentative of others who are not now eligible for benefits:\n\n       Brave men and women like Seaman Robert Roeder who was \n     injured on January 29, 2005 when an arresting wire on the \n     aircraft carrier, the USS Kitty Hawk, severed his left leg \n     below the knee . . . Although the ship was on its way to the \n     Gulf and the training exercises being conducted were in \n     preparation for action in either Operation Enduring or Iraqi \n     Freedom, Robert's injury does not qualify for payment.\n\n  Furthermore, since enactment of the 2005 Emergency Supplemental, \nretroactive SGLI and death gratuity benefits combining $238,000 have \nbeen expanded to provide payments to survivors of all servicemembers \nwho died on active duty, whether in combat or not. The reason behind \nthe expansion of retroactive benefits was a recognition that military \nservice is universal in character; that each military man or woman, no \nmatter where they are serving, contributes in a unique way to make the \nUnited States Armed Forces second to none.\n  The legislation I am again introducing today, along with Senator \nAkaka, will make the TSGLI retroactive payment eligibility criteria \nconsistent with the other benefit program retroactive payment criteria \nI just mentioned. Thus, if this legislation is enacted, all \ntraumatically injured servicemembers who served between October 7, \n2001, and December 1, 2005, will be eligible for TSGLI payments, \nirrespective of where their injuries occurred. Unofficial estimates \nfrom VA suggest that there may be over 215 active duty personnel who, \nlike Seaman Roeder, sustained traumatic injuries during this time \nperiod while performing their military duties.\n  Both the Wounded Warrior Project and the National Military Families \nAssociation have expressed their support for this bill. And I now ask \nmy colleagues for their support. This is the right thing to do for our \nmilitary men and women.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill text be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to redesignate a Federal building in Albuquerque, New \nMexico, as the ``Raymond G. Murphy Department of Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center''; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nBingaman, to introduce legislation that will designate the Veterans \nAdministration Medical Center in Albuquerque, NM, the ``Raymond G. \nMurphy Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.''\n  Jerry Murphy is an extraordinary New Mexican who was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor for his heroic actions on February 3, \n1953, while serving in the Korean war. On that day in February 1953, \nMarine 2nd Lieutenant Murphy participated in a raid on Ungok Hill. In \nthe course of the operation, most of the senior officers in Lieutenant \nMurphy's unit were killed or wounded and the assault on the hill became \nstalled with many members of the Marine assault force pinned down and \ntrapped on the hill by enemy fire. Seeing his fellow marines in trouble \nand against orders Lieutenant Murphy organized and led a daring rescue \neffort. Under intense enemy fire, Murphy personally made countless \ntrips up the hill to evacuate and provide cover for the stranded \nmarines. Though he was wounded numerous times, Lieutenant Murphy \nrefused treatment for his wounds until all marines were accounted for \nand everyone else had been treated. Lieutenant Murphy was also awarded \na Silver Star for bravery in a previous action in 1952.\n  Jerry's personal mission to protect and aid his fellow servicemen and\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nwomen did not end on that hill in Korea, for 25 years he worked in the \nVeteran's Administration, VA regional office in Albuquerque, New \nMexico. While there Jerry worked tirelessly as a counselor in the \nDivision of Vocational Counseling to insure the men and women who \nserved and defended our Nation were able to make the transition to life \nin peacetime.\n  Unlike many of us who look to retirement as a time for personal \npursuits and relaxation, Jerry chose to carry on his work on behalf of \nveterans and until 2000 volunteered at the VA hospital in Albuquerque, \nNM.\n  For these reasons I am introducing this legislation today. Jerry \nMurphy is a true American hero who in war and peace dedicated himself \nto others. I think it only right that the medical center in Albuquerque \nbear his name in recognition of his great service to this country and \nits men and women in uniform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice \nAssistance Grant Program at fiscal year 2006 levels through 2012; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chambliss \nand a number of other co-sponsors in introducing the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant Reauthorization Act. This bill would \ntake the $1,095,000,000 amount which Congress authorized for the Byrne/\nJAG grant program in fiscal year 2006 in the Violence Against Women and \nDOJ Reauthorization Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-162), and reauthorize that \nsame amount for the program in each year through fiscal year 2012.\n  The ``Byrne/JAG'' program resulted from the 2005 consolidation of the \nEdward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance \nProgram, and the Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants.\n  Named after New York Police Officer Edward Byrne, who was killed in \nthe line of duty in 1988, it provides critical support to State and \nlocal law enforcement officials.\n  Byrne/JAG is a law enforcement funding program run by the Department \nof Justice. For more than 20 years, grants from Byrne/JAG and its \npredecessor programs have funded state and local drug task forces, \ncommunity crime prevention programs, substance abuse treatment \nprograms, prosecution initiatives, and many other local crime control \nprograms.\n  One of the most popular uses of Byrne/JAG funds is to support multi-\njurisdictional task forces, which help fight drug and firearm \ntraffickers, gangs, pharmaceutical diversion, and organized crime in \nAmerica's communities.\n  Results from Byrne/JAG are real. According to data compiled by the \nNational Criminal Justice Association from self-reported metrics \nsubmitted by State Administering Agencies for the 2004 grant year, task \nforces funded in part by Byrne/JAG grants were responsible for: 54,050 \nweapons seized; 5,646 methamphetamine labs seized; and $250,000,000 in \ncash and personal property seized, not including the value of narcotics \nseized. They were also responsible for removing massive quantities of \ncontrolled substances from America's streets, including: 2.7 million \ngrams of amphetamine and methamphetamine; 1.8 million grams of powder \ncocaine; 278,200 grams of ``crack'' cocaine; 73,300 grams of heroin; 75 \nmillion cultivated and noncultivated marijuana plants, and 27 million \nkilograms of marijuana.\n  As Ron Brooks, President of the National Narcotics Officers' \nAssociations' Coalition (NNOAC) testified last June, ``more than one-\nthird of all meth lab seizures were conducted by Byrne-funded task \nforces.''\n  We get good returns on this investment. The National Sheriff's \nAssociation estimates that, with 2,794 personnel in multi-\njurisdictional drug tasks forces, this equates to: 79 drug arrests per \nfull-time employee (221,475 total); 6 kilograms of cocaine seized per \nFTE. (17,991 total); 2 kilograms of meth seized per FTE, 5,452 kilos \ntotal''; 400 grams of heroine seized per FTE, 1,177 kilos total, 306 \nlbs. of processed marijuana per FTE, 855,309 total; and 3 meth lab \nresponses per FTE, 8,983 total.\n  And our rural communities are especially dependent on Byrne/JAG \ngrants. Byrne/JAG grants to the States are allocated 60/40, so that 40 \npercent of the funds must be set aside for distribution to local \ngovernments. In short, this is one of the only sources of federal funds \nfor sheriffs and police chiefs in many of our smaller towns and \ncounties.\n  When Byrne/JAG and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) \nprogram were well funded, state and local law enforcement officers \nproduced real results. It is no coincidence that, during this period, \nwe saw more than a decade of steady reductions in violent crime.\n  Unfortunately, Federal funding for these justice assistance programs \nhas been dramatically slashed in recent years. As late as Fiscal Year \n2003, the Byrne grant programs had been funded at a level of $900 \nmillion. In Fiscal Year 2004, however, it was reduced to $725 million. \nAnd in FY2005, Byrne/JAG was cut to $634 million.\n  That year in California, the Governor issued a notice to the law \nenforcement community, advising that this change would ``significantly \nreduce the amount of drug control and criminal justice funding in \nCalifornia''--by a whopping $14 million in one year, just for my State.\n  In Fiscal Year 2006, the program was cut even further, to only $416.5 \nmillion--amounting to a 54 percent cut from Fiscal Year 2003. In Fiscal \nYear 2006, and then again in Fiscal Year 2007, the President's budget \nproposed eliminating the Byrne program entirely.\n  In response, the Senate voted to restore Byrne funding in Fiscal Year \n2006 to its Fiscal Year 2003 level of $900 million, but that increase \nwas taken out of the final conference report.\n  For Fiscal Year 2007, the Senate again restored $900 million in a \nbudget amendment, but no appropriations bill was passed.\n  What have we seen in the wake of these cuts to State and local law \nenforcement and the Byrne/JAG program?\n  After a decade of declines, FBI reports for 2005 showed a rise in \nviolent crime in every region of our country--an overall increase of \n2.5 percent, the largest reported increase in violent crime in the U.S. \nin 15 years.\n  For the first six months of 2006, the numbers for violent crime were \neven worse--up again in every region, and with a surge of nearly 3.7 \npercent. And the number of robberies--which many criminologists see as \na leading indicator of future activity--was up by almost 10 percent. \nThe reduction in Byrne/JAG and other similar funding is not the only \nreason for this increase. Experts also cite the spread of criminal \nstreet gangs like MS-13, for example, as a major factor in the jump in \nviolent crime.\n  When we are faced with such challenges, however, the Byrne/JAG \nprogram has a clear role to play in addressing America's growing \nviolent crime problem.\n  A national integrated threat demands a national integrated response, \nwith State and local law enforcement leading the way, but with the \nFederal Government providing meaningful support. Byrne/JAG facilitates. \nthat design, by allowing State and local leaders to leverage resources \nin key areas,\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nand facilitating collaboration among those in law enforcement, \ncorrections, treatment, and prevention.\n  A review of programs around the country reveals that some Byrne/JAG-\nfunded task forces receive between $30 and $40 from State or local \nsources for every Federal dollar they receive. Rather than supplanting \nother sources, Byrne/JAG often leverages Federal dollars, by providing \nthe incentive needed for local agencies to cooperate, communicate, \nshare information and build good cases.\n  Because State and local cops account for 97 percent of all drug \narrests in America, further Byrne/JAG cuts will have a clear effect, as \nNNOAC President Ron Brooks testified: [T]ake away the Byrne-JAG drug \ntask forces and I guarantee you will have fewer lab seizures . . . The \nmeth supply will continue to grow, as will the toxic meth waste that is \nbeing dumped in many neighborhoods.\n  Unfortunately, some of this is already happening. After the recent \ncuts to Byrne/JAG, the governor of Texas eliminated funding for most \ndrug task forces in his State, because he decided the limited funding \navailable was needed instead for border enforcement. Narcotics officers \nthroughout the United States also report a similar trend of \neliminations and decreases of task forces.\n  Without multi-jurisdictional task forces, officers will revert to \nworking within their own stovepipes, arresting mere targets of \nopportunity instead of focusing on organizational targets that have a \ndisproportionate impact on the problem. Police officers will return to \nworking within their own teams rather than cooperating and using shared \nintelligence to identify wider drug trafficking investigations.\n  Since 9/11, we have understandably placed greater emphasis on the \nterrorist threat from abroad, and protecting our borders. But to save \nthe perimeter and lose the heartland to international drug cartels, \nAmerican street gangs, local meth cookers and neighborhood drug \ntraffickers would be a hollow victory indeed.\n  Last year, a group of 15 organizations--including NNOAC, the National \nTroopers Coalition, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, \nthe Major City Chiefs' Association, the National Sheriffs Association, \nthe National District Attorneys' Association, the National Alliance of \nDrug Enforcement Agencies, the National Association of Counties, the \nNational Association of Drug Court Professionals--all came together to \ncall for the Byrne/JAG program to be funded at the $1.1 billion level.\n  The 15 groups represented more than 456,000 law enforcement officers, \ndrug court judges, treatment practitioners, and prosecutors from over \n2,000 counties and more than 5,000 community prevention coalitions. And \nfor the 110th Congress, funding Byrne/JAG at the $1.1 billion level \nremains a top law enforcement priority.\n  Passage of this bill will respond to such requests from law \nenforcement, and also send a clear message that any further efforts by \nthis Administration to reduce or eliminate the Byrne/JAG program in the \nFiscal Year 208 budget will be strongly resisted by this Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 232. A bill to make permanent the authorization for watershed \nrestoration and enhancement agreements; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today \nreauthorizes a very successful cooperative watershed restoration \nprogram that I originally sponsored, and that was originally enacted \nfor the Forest Service, in the Fiscal Year 1999 Interior Appropriations \nbill. The original legislation lasted through Fiscal Year 2001 after \nwhich it was reauthorized by the Appropriations Committees, at my \nrequest, through Fiscal Year 2005 and then again through Fiscal Year \n2011. My bill passed the Senate in the 109th Congress, but \nunfortunately did not pass in the House before the end of the Congress. \nToday, I reintroduce the bill hoping that it can speedily pass both \nchambers.\n  The bill making what is commonly referred to as the Wyden amendment \npermanent authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to use appropriated \nForest Service funds for watershed restoration and enhancement \nagreements that benefit the ecological health of National Forest System \nlands and watersheds. The Wyden amendment does not require additional \nfunding, but allows the Forest Service to leverage scarce restoration \ndollars thereby allowing the federal dollars to stretch farther. During \nthe eight years the program has existed, the Forest Service has \nleveraged three dollars for every Forest Service dollar spent on these \nagreements.\n  The Wyden amendment has resulted in countless Forest Service \ncooperative agreements with neighboring state and local land owners to \naccomplish high priority restoration, protection and enhancement work \non public and private watersheds.

Mr. President, today I offered the bipartisan substitute \namendment. Four amendments are pending as well. Today, I alerted \nMembers to expect votes tomorrow. Also, I remind Members that all \nMembers of the 110th Congress have been invited to the Supreme Court \ntomorrow. There is a dinner. There is no cocktail hour and no \nreception. The dinner will begin promptly at 6:30 tomorrow evening. I \nhave been to these events over the years, and they are really good. We \nhave to reach out to our separate but equal branch of Government called \nthe judicial branch. I find all nine of those Justices to be the most \ninteresting people. They have such a tremendous responsibility. I think \nit will be good conversation, with a limited speech or two. I hope \nfreshman Senators can find it in their schedules to come. It is also \nfor the spouses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/09/senate-section/article/S310-6", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL\n\n  Mr. REID.
