Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 1784 and the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1784) to amend the Small Business Act to improve \n     programs for veterans, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a few months ago, I introduced the Military \nReservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity \nAct. As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I was gratified that I was able to work with Ranking \nMember Senator Snowe on behalf of this Nation's veterans. I was also \npleased that this bill was added by unanimous consent as an amendment \nto the Department of Defense Authorization, although disappointed when \nthe final House-Senate negotiated compromise did not make it as part of \nthe final bill.\n  In November, Senator Snowe and I sought to pass this bill in the \nSenate only to meet with objections from my respected colleague from \nOklahoma. I am pleased to say that Senator Coburn has worked with me in \ngood faith and that we have reached an agreement that addresses his \nconcerns. We have sought to protect the language that the House and \nSenate agreed upon and done our utmost to improve the resources that \nare available to our Nation's veterans. Although this bill is not \nperfect or exactly as I may have envisioned, it is an important step \nforward in supporting the American dream of business ownership for \nveterans and reservists.\n  Passing these provisions into law has been one of my highest \npriorities since becoming chairman of the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship in January. My first hearing as chairman was \ndevoted to veteran small business issues, and this bill arises directly \nfrom the complaints that we heard there. America's veterans and \nreservists have sacrificed enough in fighting for our country; they \nshouldn't have to sacrifice their jobs and their livelihoods when they \ncome home.\n  There are 25 million veterans in this country. In the last 4 years, \nalone, nearly 600,000 veterans have returned from serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Roughly 56 percent are reserve and National Guard members, \nwho continue to serve this Nation at unprecedented levels. This is \ntaking a toll not just on their families, but on their businesses as \nwell. We are in an era where employers do not want to hire reservists \nbecause they know they will be called up for lengthy deployments. At a \nSmall Business Committee hearing on veterans' issues earlier this year, \none of the witnesses raised concerns about a lack of employer support \nfor reservists due to the new policy that allows reservists to be \ncalled up for a second tour of 24 months.\n  I am also deeply concerned that recently discharged veterans have a \nhigher unemployment rate--double that of their civilian counterparts. \nIn addition, the number of service disabled veterans is increasing--\n167,000 discharged between 2002 and 2005-- and their self-employment \nrate is lower than the national average.\n  This bill is a first step in addressing these concerns and it builds \non important lessons we learned from Vietnam, not to leave another \ngeneration of veterans behind.\n  The Military Reservists and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization \nand Opportunity Act of 2007 takes a number of steps to improve the \nGovernment's role in supporting our veterans. Specifically, it \nreauthorizes the veteran programs in the Small Business Administration. \nThis legislation increases the funding authorization for the Office of \nVeteran Business Development from\n\n[[Page S15951]]\n\n$2 million today to $2.3 million over 2 years. In light of the large \nnumbers of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and \nincreased responsibilities placed on this office by Executive Order \n13360, it is high time that the Office of Veteran Business Development \nreceive the funding levels that it needs.\n\n  The bill also creates an Interagency Task Force to improve \ncoordination between agencies in administrating veteran small business \nprograms. One of the biggest complaints that our committee heard at the \n``Assessing Federal Small Business Assistance Programs for Veterans and \nReservists'' hearing held on January 31 was that Federal agencies do \nnot work together in reaching out to veterans and informing them about \nsmall business programs. This task force is an attempt to improve that. \nThe task force will focus on increasing veterans' small business \nsuccess, including procurement and franchising opportunities, access to \ncapital, and other types of business development assistance.\n  This bill also permanently extends the SBA Advisory Committee on \nVeterans Business Affairs. The committee was created to serve as an \nindependent source of advice and policy recommendations to the SBA, the \nCongress, and the President. The veteran small business owners who \nserve on this committee provide a unique perspective which is sorely \nneeded at this challenging time. Unfortunately, continuing uncertainty \nabout the committee's future has, at times, distracted the committee \nfrom focusing on its core function. Therefore, I have called for its \npermanent extension. It is clear to me that more needs to be done to \naddress the issues facing veterans and reservists, and the role this \ncommittee plays will continue to be important.\n  Additionally, I have taken a number of steps to better serve the \nreservists who are serving their country abroad while their businesses \nare suffering at home. Over the past decade, the Department of Defense \nhas increased its reliance on the National Guard and reserves. This has \nintensified since September 11 and increased deployments are expected \nto continue. The effect of this increase on reservists and small \nbusinesses continues to remain of concern. A 2003 GAO report indicated \nthat 41 percent of reservists lost income when mobilized. This had a \nhigher effect on self-employed reservists, 55 percent of whom lost \nincome.\n  In 1999, I created the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster \nLoan, MREIDL, program to provide loans to small businesses that incur \neconomic injury as a result of an essential employee being called to \nactive duty. However, since 2002, fewer than 300 of these loans have \nbeen approved by the SBA, despite record numbers of reservists being \ncalled to active duty. It is clear that changes need to be made, so \nthat reservists are informed about the availability of the MREIDL \nprogram and that the program better meets their needs. At the hearing \non January 31, we heard suggestions for a number of changes which would \nimprove the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, \nand I have included those changes in this bill. They include increasing \nthe application deadline for such a loan from 90 days to 1 year \nfollowing the date of discharge; creating a predeployment loan approval \nprocess; and improved outreach and technical assistance.\n  This bill also increases to $50,000 the amount SBA can disburse \nwithout requiring collateral under the MREIDL program. Reservist \nfamilies have already sacrificed enough when a family member goes away \nto serve their country and when their business is harmed as a result. \nThis loan program would allow reservist dependent businesses to access \nthe capital they need to stay afloat without having to sacrifice beyond \nthe service of the key employees. In order to give reservists time to \nrepay the loans, the non-collaterized loan created in this bill would \nnot accumulate interest or require payments for one year or until after \nthe deployment ends, whichever is longer.\n\n  There are two more provisions which will help this Nation's service \nmembers. One section of the bill will require the SBA to give priority \nto MREIDL loans during loan processing. Another provision will give \nactivated servicemembers an extension of any SBA time limitations equal \nto the time spent on active duty. This will make it easier for service \nmembers to serve their country while continuing to meet their \nobligations at home.\n  Lastly, this bill calls for two reports. One report will look at the \nneeds of service-disabled veterans who are interested in becoming \nentrepreneurs. As a result of the war on terror and improved medicine, \nwe are seeing more service-disabled veterans than we have seen in \ndecades. For some service-disabled veterans, entrepreneurship is the \nbest or only way of achieving economic independence. Therefore, it is \nessential that we understand and take steps to address the needs of the \nservice-disabled veteran entrepreneur or small business owner.\n  This bill also calls for a study to investigate how to improve \nrelations between reservists and their employers. In January, the \ncommittee heard that recent changes by the Department of Defense to \npolicies regulating the length and frequency of reservist deployments \nis harming the ability of reservists to find jobs and the ability of \nsmall business owners to continue hiring them. Understanding more about \nthis issue is important and essential to making sure that policymakers \ncan continue to support citizen soldiers and the small businesses that \nemploy them.\n  The bill also includes a number of other important provisions that \nwere added by the House. For instance, this bill includes language \ndirecting the Office of Veterans Business Develop to increase the \nnumber of Veterans Business Outreach Centers and requires them to \nimprove their participation in the Transition Assistance Program. This \nbill also creates a program reducing 7(a) loan fees for veterans, \nimproves Small Business Development Centers outreach to the veteran \ncommunity and instructs the Associate Administrator of the Office of \nVeterans Business Development to create and disseminate information \naimed at informing women veterans about the resources available to \nthem. I am pleased that the House and Senate were able to come to an \nagreement on these provisions.\n  Veterans possess great technical skills and valuable leadership \nexperience, but they require financial resources and small business \ntraining to turn that potential into a viable enterprise. A recent \nreport by the Small Business Administration stated that 22 percent of \nveterans plan to start or are starting a business when they leave the \nmilitary. For service-disabled veterans, this number rises to 28 \npercent.\n  We owe veterans and reservists more than a simple thank you for their \nservice. The least we can do is provide critical resources to help them \nstart and grow small business and to hold Federal agencies accountable. \nThat is what our bill does.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to once again urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of S. 1784, the Military Reservist and \nVeteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2007, \noffered by Senator Kerry and me, chair and ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I have spoken about \nthis bill on multiple occasions because it is truly critical that our \nfellow colleagues, in each Chamber and both sides of the aisle, \ncontinue to collaborate on our veterans' behalf and support swift \npassage of this legislation. This bipartisan legislation contains key \nprovisions from both S. 904, the Veterans Small Business Opportunity \nAct of 2007, which I introduced in March, and Senator Kerry's S. 1005, \nMilitary Reservist and Veteran Small Business Reauthorization Act of \n2007.\n  This legislation would have an immediate impact on our men and women \nfighting around the globe for the freedoms we enjoy every day. First, \nour bill makes vast improvements to the Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA, Military Reservist Economic Disaster Loan, \nMREIDL, program. The MREIDL program provides funds to businesses to \nmeet ordinary and necessary business expenses that they could have \nmade, if not for the deployment of a reservist who is one of their \nessential employees.\n  Specifically, the bill establishes a pre-application process so \nbusinesses can be prepared, in advance, to apply for an MREIDL and \nincludes a provision allowing businesses up to one year, as opposed to \n90 days, to apply. The legislation increases, from $1.5 million to $2 \nmillion, the maximum\n\n[[Page S15952]]\n\nMREIDL loan a business can take and raises, from $5,000 to $50,000, the \nlevel of uncollateralized MREIDL loans available to businesses. \nFinally, our changes to the MREIDL program would allow the SBA \nadministrator to defer the payment of principal and interest while the \nemployee is deployed.\n  The bill would also create a new interagency task force to coordinate \nthe efforts of Federal agencies necessary to increase capital and \nbusiness development opportunities for, and increase the award of \nFederal contracting opportunities to, small businesses owned and \ncontrolled by veterans. This type of coordinated and targeted effort by \nour Federal Government is long overdue.\n  Additionally, today's legislation would increase funding for the \nSBA's Office of Veterans Business Development, and permanently extend \nthe duties and responsibilities of the SBA Advisory Committee on \nVeterans Business Affairs. It would also allow small businesses owned \nand operated by veterans to extend their SBA program participation time \nlimitations by the duration of their owner's deployment.\n  While I have not provided an exhaustive list of this bill's \nprovisions and all that it would do, a simple review of the legislation \nwill reveal that it goes far toward helping our Nation's veteran \nentrepreneurs and our patriotic small businesses that employ \nreservists, despite the risk that deployments entail.

Mr. President, last night, when everybody was rushing \naround in the well during the last vote and wishing each other a Merry \nChristmas, I was reminded of something Senator Lott said yesterday \nmorning. He told us not to forget that we all have normal lives and \nfamilies to get home to and the same basic concerns in life as \neverybody else; and that if we forget that, then this body is in \nserious trouble.\n  It is in that spirit that I would like to wrap up the year in pretty \nmuch the same way I tried to open it, by urging a little more \ncooperation and civility. About a year ago now, I called on my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to take advantage of the rare \nopportunity divided government gave us to tackle big issues on a \nbipartisan basis. Beyond that, I said Republicans had a few basic \npriorities: keeping Americans safe and secure, protecting their basic \nfreedoms, protecting their wallets, and spending their money wisely. I \nsaid we would not hesitate to ensure these priorities by shaping worthy \nlegislation or by blocking legislation that would undermine them.\n  Looking back on the year, I think we have been pretty successful at \nit.\n  Early on, Democrats presented us with a minimum wage bill that \nundermined small businesses, and it did not pass. When they agreed to \ninclude a tax break, it sailed through by a vote of 94-3. We shaped \nthat one.\n  A little later, Democrats gave us an energy conservation bill that \nwould have led to higher taxes, and it did not pass. When they agreed \nto remove the tax hikes 6 months later, it passed easily, 86-13. We \nshaped that one.\n  Then they offered to extend a ban on the AMT middle-class tax hike \nfor 1 more year, but to cover the cost by imposing a new tax on the \nsame 23 million Americans who are about to be\n\n[[Page S15953]]\n\nwhacked by it. The AMT was never meant to hit middle-class families, so \na new tax to pay for the mistake was plainly unfair. When Democrats \nfinally took it out, the AMT fix passed the Senate 88-5. We shaped that \none.\n  Again and again, we have insisted the minority be heard and, in the \nend, we were. We have shaped a lot of legislation this year to ensure \nthat Republican priorities were addressed. We are proud of it.\n  We have also stopped a lot of things that we thought would undermine \nour security.\n  The most prominent example, of course, is Iraq. After last night, \nSenate Democrats had held 34 votes this year related to the war in \nIraq. And on every one that either attempted to substitute our judgment \nfor the judgment of our commanders or cut off funds for our men and \nwomen in the field, we prevailed.\n  So we have shaped a lot of things we thought were worthy, things like \nthe AMT fix and the energy conservation bill. And we have proudly \nblocked some things that we thought were just bad ideas altogether, \nlike pulling our troops out of Iraq before the Petraeus Plan had time \nto take hold.\n  But our intention from the start was always, if possible, to avoid \nconfrontation as an end unto itself. The history books are filled with \nexamples of the things Congress achieved when opposite parties \ncontrolled the White House and the Congress. That was always our first \noption.\n  Unfortunately, our friends seemed intent on forcing votes all year, \nwhether they be on Iraq or any number of domestic issues, that never \nhad a chance of either passing the Senate or of becoming law. The \npractical effect, of course, is that very little would get accomplished \nin the end.\n  But it didn't have to be that way. On the bills I have mentioned, \nDemocrats had a choice: they could have presented us first with the \nversion they knew we could cooperate on. Or, as we saw all too often, \nthey could present us with a partisan bill that could only serve them \nas a talking point. When they chose the former, we racked up some \nserious accomplishments together.\n  Over the last week, we have seen this kind of cooperation work on the \nenergy conservation bill and on the AMT.\n  I have actually enjoyed working with the distinguished majority \nleader all year. I won't be the first person to remark that he has a \ntough job. But he has shown a lot of patience this year, and he has put \nup with a lot. So I want to thank him for his collegiality and his \nfriendship.\n  I also want to thank him once again for speaking to the students at \nthe McConnell Center in Louisville in October. It meant a lot to the \nstudents, and it meant a lot to me. A lot of people seem surprised when \nI tell them the last two Senators I have had speak at the center are \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Reid.\n  All of us were put here by voters with vastly different backgrounds \nwho hold vastly different views. And the fact that we can work together \nand pass legislation that covers every one of them is really the glory \nof this institution and this country. But we will never be able to do \nthat if we are not gentlemanly and respectful. Trent had it right. We \ncan't lose sight of the important things.\n  In that spirit, I thank all of our colleagues and staffs on both \nsides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, for all the sacrifices \nthey have made this year and for all the grief they took from their \nconstituents, their wives, their husbands, and their kids for living \nthe kind of life we all live in this fishbowl. I know a lot of them are \non their way home at the moment. I am glad they are. I must say I am \nnot far behind. But I do want to wish them all a very warm, happy, and \nMerry Christmas with their families.\n  I might say to my good friend the majority leader and to all of our \ncolleagues, we are looking forward to a month off and then looking \nforward to getting back together at the end of January to see what we \ncan accomplish next year for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a statement I will give later in the \nday about what we have done this year. But I want to take this \nopportunity to reciprocate with the kind words the distinguished \nRepublican leader said on my behalf.\n  Without in any way taking away from the opportunities we have, \nSenator McConnell and I, as being Democratic and Republican leaders of \nthe Senate, the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, these are \nwonderful opportunities, honors neither one of us would ever imagine we \nwould have. I have been in government a long time, as has my friend the \nRepublican leader. We both recognize that we have to set an example for \nthe rest of the body in patience, in cordiality, and being gentlemen \nand friends to each other. I think we have done that.\n  We have gone through some difficult times, criticized not each other \npersonally but as to what has taken place there has been criticism. \nThat will continue, and there is nothing wrong with that. I would like \nto say my criticism is constructive in nature, and I hope that is how I \ntake any criticism that I get from the other side.\n  We have a lot to do next year. Next year will actually be more \ndifficult than this year because we will be in the midst of a \nPresidential election. For me, though, I will have three Democratic \nSenators back working full time. That will be very pleasant. We will \nnot have to try to arrange the schedule for all four of them.\n  Scheduling is hard because the Senate has changed over the years, \neven since I have been here. Schedules are now a lot determined by \nairplane schedules, not Senate schedules. But on the one hand, when \nSenators are forced to think about having to be here and not do their \nfundraising over a weekend, or going back to their States, we tend to \nget a lot done. We have had to, on occasion--several occasions this \nyear--say we are going to have to be in on the weekend, but with the \nexception of one weekend, or maybe two weekends, we were able to get \nthe same amount of work done had we stayed here all weekend.\n  So, again, I say to my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, the \nRepublican leader, we have a lot to look forward to next year. We are \ngoing to see a new President to replace President Bush. We hope that \nwill create, in the last year of President Bush's term, more cordiality \nbetween the two of us.\n  I have a meeting later today with the President's Chief of Staff. I \nhope that will bear fruit. One of the things we have to work on is to \ntry to not have to be in session during the entire next month. We have \nSenators lined up to cover that. I hope we can work something out with \nthe White House so that is not necessary because there is a significant \nnumber of Democratic nominations and a large number of Republican \nnominations we would like to clear. Hopefully, we can do that later \ntoday.\n  So I will be back later, but I do want to express my appreciation for \nthe kind words and thoughts of my friend, the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15953-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am joined on the floor by Katherine \nMcGuire,\n\n[[Page S15954]]\n\nwho is the staff director of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. This will be her last time on the floor of the Senate.\n  It was just about 11 years ago when I first came to Washington to \nserve the people of Wyoming in the Senate. As soon as I arrived, the \nfirst item on my agenda was to start to put staff together. I knew it \nwas an important first step because the key to whatever success we are \nable to achieve is always due in large part to the dedicated and loyal \npeople who work with us and for us.\n  In addition, that first staff is so important to a new Senator \nbecause our staffs help to set the tone for that first Congress and the \nbeginning of every Senate career. It is true that in the end, you are \nonly as good and effective as the people with whom you work and for \nwhom you work--as it turns out sometimes.\n  Now, I talked to everyone I could. I went through a mountain of \nresumes and slowly but surely began to make some progress. In a short \nweek, I went through orientation--with the leadership of my wife, we \nbought a house--and I interviewed over 100 people for my staff.\n  As I reviewed the credentials of an impressive group of applicants, I \nknew I would need someone to head up my staff who knew Wyoming. That \nmeant I would need to find someone who had Wyoming roots and understood \nthe needs of my home State. In addition, that person would need to know \nWashington and the Senate and how to help me and the rest of the staff \nget things done. I knew it would not be good enough to work hard if \nthat hard work and determination did not produce the results that we \nwere after.\n  It would not be easy to find someone who was equally at home in both \nWyoming and Washington, but when I had those qualifications in mind and \nstarted looking for such a person, one candidate rose to the top. That \nwas Katherine McGuire, and she was clearly the best and most obvious \nchoice for the job.\n  She had committee experience as well as State staff experience. She \nalso had a master's degree in agricultural economics. I represent an \nagricultural State, and I knew I would need that help. She helped to \nfuel expectations, which we were then able to meet. It is with a lot of \npride that I have been inducted into the Wyoming Agricultural Hall of \nFame, largely because of her efforts.\n\n  Now, I would never forget those early days. As is true with all \nSenators, our first office consisted of one room. It was actually a \nstoreroom for the credit union. That cramped space helped us to develop \na strong sense of teamwork right from the start because we were all in \nthe same room and everybody knew what everyone else was doing.\n  Now, fortunately, Katherine was there at the helm, and she helped to \ndirect the efforts of my legislative staff right from the start. She \nwas able to do so because she is a natural leader. She leads the best \nway, and that is by example. People on my staff know they can approach \nher with any ideas or suggestions they have, confident she will hear \nthem out and help them with whatever issue areas they have been \nassigned.\n  Thanks to Katherine, we were able to accomplish a great deal during \nmy first few years in the Senate. In more sessions than I could ever \ncount, Katherine showed she was a great negotiator and an even better \nstrategist. She is the best networker I have ever seen.\n  Her competitive spirit began to show itself in high school in her \nplay on the basketball team. It then expanded in college, and then \nblossomed when she played professionally in Europe. You do not want to \ntry to rebound an issue with her.\n  Then, when the opportunity came to chair the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions, once again, I knew I would need \nto put someone in charge of my committee staff who could handle the \nresponsibility and the opportunity we would have to take action on some \nissues of great importance not only to the people of Wyoming but to the \nrest of America as well. Once again, it did not take very long for me \nto feel certain that Katherine was the perfect choice for the committee \nstaff director position.\n  On the committee or on my personal staff, Katherine has proven \nherself time and time again, and over the years she has made a \ndifference in my work on a long list of topics that have come to the \nSenate floor. It would be impossible to name them all.\n  I want to mention my first big bill, though. It was drafted to keep \nWashington bureaucrats from being successful in their determination to \nmake methane gas into a solid, which, of course, would have taken away \nroyalties from property owners and even forced them to pay back back-\nroyalties. In my first year, in less than a month, the correction was \npassed by both the Senate and the House unanimously. That meant that \nKatherine, my team, and I had to talk to 535 Members in Congress in \nless than a month to get that result.\n  It was interesting later to watch the Supreme Court use that bill as \na basis for back payments to these same people. We could not do \nanything to solve anything before the legislation was passed because \nyou have to look to the future.\n  So that was our first big win, and, fortunately, more was to come, as \nKatherine headed up my team effort. I will just mention a few: the \nglobal HIV/AIDS law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the new MINER law to \nprotect miners of this country, the new Food and Drug Administration \nreform law, the Pension Protection Act, and a host of other successful \nbills that were signed into law. For every one of them, Katherine was \nalways there putting in long and extended hours, providing clear, \naccurate leadership and advice and doing everything she could to make \nour team vision come true.\n  Whenever I get the chance, I like to tell people who ask about my \nstaff that I was very fortunate to hire the people I did. In fact, I \nstill think that if staff work was an Olympic event, my staff would win \nthe gold medal--and Katherine would be the most valuable player.\n  Katherine was a natural fit for the captain of the team--a role she \nhas played very well. She is proof of the wisdom of the old adage that \na good captain makes everyone on the team better. Katherine has been \nsuch a good leader because she has always been willing to do what was \nnecessary to ensure a successful outcome. She has an unusual amount of \nabilities and talents, and an overdose of persistence that has helped \nher to get things done. She has never been one to talk about what she \nwould like to accomplish; she just takes action.\n  In the West, we like to say she rides hard. That has helped her to \nearn the respect and appreciation of not only my staff but all of the \nstaffs she has worked with and developed close ties to over the years.\n  I have always believed in something called the 80 percent rule. I was \nnot surprised to discover that Katherine understood my 80 percent rule \nso well because she had put it into practice long ago without even \nknowing the name. She knew that 80 percent of every issue can be \nbrought to agreement. People usually are willing to accept 80 percent \ninstead of nothing. It is the other 20 percent that is difficult to \nresolve. But by focusing on the 80 percent, impossible problems become \npossible and can be solved around here.\n  Katherine was also there to help support my vision to look for and \nfind the third way in dealing with conflicts. Her philosophy has always \nbeen fashioned after the old adage: We will either find a way or make \none. That attitude has always served to help her bring groups to the \ntable to reach compromises that seemed unlikely at best.\n  Now Katherine has decided to leave the Hill to take on another \nchallenge in her professional life. Katherine knows that life is an \nadventure, and constant change is a good thing. Now she will be moving \nto a new place to help spread our message.\n  As she leaves, I cannot thank her enough for all she has done for me \nand for Wyoming over the years. She has been a tireless worker, and she \nhas never hesitated to roll up her sleeves and get to work whenever and \nwherever she was needed.\n  I remember one long evening on the Senate floor. During my speech, in \nthanking people at the end, I mentioned that Katherine was an excellent \njuggler, referring to her ability to handle many tasks at the same \ntime. Her\n\n[[Page S15955]]\n\ndaughter was watching on C-SPAN2 and said: I didn't even know Mom could \njuggle.\n  Being a legislative director and a staff director has cost her a lot \nof time from home. But she has been able to work her family life into \nher work schedule as the top priority that it needs to be. Now she will \nhave more time to spend with her own team at home that needs her love \nand attention. Her husband David, along with her children Ellie and \nCooper, have all been very supportive during her Senate years. She is \nnow going to try something new, and once again her family will be there \nfor her, supporting her, and providing the assistance she will continue \nto need as she pursues her new career.\n\n  It will be difficult to say goodbye to Katherine. When she leaves the \nSenate, she will be greatly missed. Someday soon, we will have found \nsomeone to take on the responsibilities that she leaves behind, but we \nwill never be able to replace her. Her constant warm and genuine smile, \nher concern for all the people on her staff, and her unique ability to \nsize up a political situation immediately upon contact--unmatched. She \nhas been a tremendous addition to my personal and committee staffs, and \nwe will miss her daily presence in our lives.\n  Like most offices, our staffs are more than our legislative teams, \nthey are extended family. That will not change. She will forever be a \nmember of the Enzi family--another daughter.\n  The Senate is a place to work unlike any other in the world. It \nwelcomes only those with special skills and unique abilities and \nprovides them with a tremendous opportunity to make this great Nation \nof ours a better place in which to live.\n  In the end, that will be Katherine's legacy after 17 years of service \nin the Senate. On my staff, and before that, serving with Senator Al \nSimpson and Senator Richard Lugar, she has made the most of every \nopportunity she was given, and she can be proud of the record of \nsuccess she has compiled over the years in every area of her life.\n  We know from the Bible that we chart our course in life in our \nhearts, but God directs our steps. God has directed these new steps in \nKatherine's life, and I know she will continue to make the most of \nevery step that God moves her to take.\n  Good luck and God bless you and your family, Katherine.

Mr. President, I may need a little more than 10 minutes \nbecause this is an important speech for me.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity today to pay tribute to a wonderful \nwoman, dedicated public servant, health policy expert and my chief of \nstaff, Patricia Knight, or as many know her in the Senate--Trisha.\n  We were all sad to learn last week that, after over 34 years of \npublic service, Trisha has decided to leave the Senate family at the \nend of the year, which in the arcane ways of the Senate could be any \nnumber of days between now and December 31. In fact, had I been able to \nconvince her to stay until January 7, we would have been able to \ncelebrate with her the 34th anniversary of her first job on Capitol \nHill.\n  Trisha was born here in the District and grew up in Arlington. She \nprogressed through Jamestown Elementary School, Williamsburg Junior \nHigh School and Yorktown High School. We like to kid her about the fact \nthat this is the pathway that launched CBS newswoman Katie Couric.\n  When I first approached Trish about being my chief of staff, she \nquickly pointed out that she was not from Utah. However, always \nthinking on her feet, she rapidly concluded that graduating from \nSyracuse University, or Syracuse U, was close enough to 4 years in \nSyracuse Utah! And that became her story.\n  I might add that she graduated magna cum laude from Syracuse \nUniversity, where she majored in anthropology and photojournalism, \nwhich makes her in my mind uniquely qualified to work in this body.\n  Trisha never intended to work on Capitol Hill. She is the daughter of \na pair of Washington journalists, both deceased. But, I know they are \nwatching over her and are very proud of what she has accomplished.\n  She always reminds the young people who come to work in my office \nthat she got her first Federal job by walking up and down Constitution \nAvenue passing out resumes and the old Civil Service form SF-171.\n  She was initially hired as a temporary typist at the U.S. Department \nof Commerce, which it turned out was a lucky career start, because she \nfound out later she had flunked the typing test but they hired her \nanyway.\n  That became her launching pad for work in the office of our former \ncolleague, and then House member, Senator Jim Broyhill of North \nCarolina, the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n  He trained her well. She moved from caseworker, to legislative \ncorrespondent, to legislative assistant. I would like to say it was a \nmeteoric rise--but in those days the average Hill staffer stayed more \nthan 2 years. Trisha was there for almost 8 years--day, night, and many \nweekends.\n  I knew she would be a real asset to my staff because of her \nconsiderable government experience.\n  Before coming to the U.S. Senate, Trisha served in the executive \nbranch for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. It is \ninteresting that she worked at two cabinet agencies twice--the Commerce \nDepartment and Health and Human Services. The Cabinet secretaries she \nserved include Richard Schweiker, Margaret Heckler, Otis Bowen, M.D., \nLou Sullivan, M.D., and Bob Mosbacher.\n\n  Trisha is perhaps best known for her work at HHS--she served twice as \na deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human \nServices and is considered by many as one of the top health policy \nexperts in Washington, D.C. In that job, she was a line officer in the \nPublic Health Service, as well as a staffer for the Secretary, and she \nworked for some of my favorite people--Dr. Ron Docksai, Dr. Bob Windom, \nand Dr. James O. Mason.\n  In addition to her work for Senator Broyhill when he served in the \nHouse, she has also served on the staff of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, where she was minority clerk for the legendary Silvio Conte \nof Massachusetts on three appropriations bills: Commerce-State-Justice; \nLegislative Branch; and Foreign Operations.\n  I felt very fortunate when Trisha agreed to work in my office as a \nvolunteer after the defeat of President George H.W. Bush. In fact, I \ntried to hire her the first week, but she flippantly informed me I \ndidn't have the budget to do it.\n  A few months later, I found that money, and she joined my health \nstaff, rising quickly to become my health policy director.\n  She is one of the shrewdest, smartest, most effective legislative \nminds in the Senate. She deeply understands the legislative process and \nhas cultivated relationships with health policy experts throughout this \ncountry and\n\n[[Page S15956]]\n\naround the world. She truly knows everyone and the proper way to get \nthings done, on health care, and a whole range of issues. She has a \nrare combination of policy expertise and legislative know-how. In other \nwords, she not only knows what to do, she knows how to make it happen. \nThose are rare qualities anywhere; certainly around here.\n\n  She is very proud of her work in Senate infrastructure development, \nincluding her active membership in the Senate Chief of Staff \norganization and its executive committee. She has been a real leader in \nthat organization. She has worked hard to be a capable administrator \nand manager and to help develop our staff and our institutional \nknowledge.\n  She also takes pride in the young people whose careers she has helped \nlaunch on Capitol Hill. I often hear her tell young legislative staff--\nin the words of her good friend and mentor, Don Hirsch: ``Read the \nbill,'' as only she can say. I am a poor substitute.\n  The legislation she has worked on is really among the most important \nin my service on Capitol Hill. Trisha was by my side when we finally \npersuaded Congressman Waxman, Congressman Dingell, and Senator Kennedy \nto allow the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to go through. \nThe Governor of New Mexico, now running for President on the Democratic \nside, was my prime cosponsor on that bill.\n  It was a journey of several years. It was a legislative campaign that \nhas served as the model for many pieces of legislation since. And, I \nmight add, it was the only major health bill to be enacted in 1994, the \nyear of President Clinton's Health Security Act.\n  She was by my side in 1997, when Senator Kennedy and I worked with \nSenators Chafee and Rockefeller to enact the CHIP legislation in a \nrecord 144 days. People know how important that bill is. Virtually \neverybody in our society today recognizes the importance of the CHIP \nlegislation. I know she had hoped to stay on and see the \nreauthorization finished this year, but we will do all we can to get it \ndone next year. She has played a pivotal and extremely important role \nin that remarkable landmark legislation.\n\n  She has had an influential role in development of so many other \npieces of law--reforming the Food and Drug export laws, allowing \nmedical volunteers at Community Health Centers to be covered under the \nFederal Tort Claims Act, so many of the budget reconciliation bills, \nincluding the landmark Medicare Modernization Act, all of the major FDA \nbills we have considered in the past 2 decades, including the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Acts and the Medical Device User Fee Acts. \nThat is only mentioning a few of the bills and mainly in the health \ncare area--not counting all of the other areas where she has played a \npivotal and very important role. She also served on the Judiciary \nCommittee, where she worked on nominations, patents and controlled \nsubstances issues, among many, many others.\n  This week, as she is delighted to note, she assisted in seeing the \nfirst bill she drafted pass unamended--legislation to rename the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development as the Eunice \nKennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. I think most people who really know, knew how close I am \nto Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver and how much I love Eunice \nKennedy Shriver. This woman has given so much to our country. Frankly, \nshe is one terrific human being, as was her husband when he worked in \nso many positions in the Federal Government.\n  This was a bill that Trish drafted, helped to push through, along \nwith myself, and I am really pleased that Eunice Kennedy Shriver will \nbe memorialized. It is something she always took credit in--the \nNational Institue of Child Health and Human Development. She has worked \nwith children all over the world and deserves that distinguished honor.\n  The list on and on. There are some that have not become law yet--and \nI know she regrets that--but I think we may still see the Knight agenda \nenacted. Two of these are allowing vitamins to be purchased with food \nstamps--a commonsense measure for good nutrition, and even more \nimportantly, allowing FDA approval of biosimilars, my high priority.\n  Trish spearheaded for me the Kennedy-Hatch Biologics Price \nCompetition and Innovation Act of 2007, reported earlier this year by \nthe HELP Committee.\n  Trisha also is a walking rolodex. She knows everyone--including just \nabout every health policy expert in the country. When she made her \nannouncement on Friday, a flurry of e-mails came into the office. I \nwould like to share just a few of them which I think you will enjoy, \nand which show her true character.\n  One of my former staff directors for the Senate Labor Committee noted \nin response to her announcement:\n\n       I can't believe you plan to hang up your whip. Ringmasters \n     occasionally take breaks, but that doesn't mean they quit the \n     circus. Senator Hatch thinks the world of you, as do we all. \n     Whatever your final decision, I hope it keeps you in public \n     affairs.\n\n  One of Senator Kennedy's former staff directors said,\n\n       The planets are realigning. The tectonic plates of the \n     earth are shifting. The sea is parting. The world will never \n     be the same again.\n\n  Those Kennedy staffers always do go in for the hyperbole, don't they? \nThat is why they are so successful.\n  A leadership staffer noted:\n\n       It truly will be a loss to the whole Senate.\n\n  A Utah mayor and CEO told Patricia:\n\n       I cannot tell you how much we have appreciated your help. \n     You will be sorely missed. Your ability to make a difference \n     on Capitol Hill is evident. You have been a great friend and \n     ally. Your work ethic is unmatched by anyone I have seen on \n     the Hill. When you combine that with your knowledge of key \n     areas like HHS issues, you have been a very effective \n     government operative.\n\n  A Utah political leader noted:\n\n       Trisha is the brightest political strategist I have known \n     in all my years in politics. She has the ability to put \n     together a long-term strategy to deal with a crisis before \n     the crisis occurs. Her perspective and insight into issues is \n     unsurpassed.\n\n  And one last example, a former Robert Wood Johnson fellow in my \noffice noted:\n       You know, you were singlehandedly responsible for my whole \n     perspective change on the reality of government and its \n     operation . . . The amount of information you have in your \n     mind, from your experiences, and all that you have done for \n     others, is staggering.\n       You will always be a close and dear friend and my life/\n     career has been better for knowing you in that role. No \n     matter where you find yourself, my admiration and respect \n     will only grow. While I was there (and since), you made sure \n     that I had a life changing experience and got to see and hear \n     it all.\n\n  People on the ``outside'' who deal with many, many congressional \nstaff, hold Trisha in the highest regard--for her expertise, her \nmasterful strategic thinking, and for her straightforwardness, \nscrupulous honesty and sense of fair play. But more importantly, they \ngenuinely like her because she is, above all, a wonderful, generous \nperson.\n\n  Over the years, Trisha has spent weeks traveling through Utah, \nmeeting with county and city officials and getting a good feel for the \nissues and challenges Utahns are facing throughout our State. She has \nmade it a point to get to know our great State and know it well. She \nbrought to that task all she had learned in her government career, an \nexperience that undoubtedly helped our State in innumerable ways. In \nfact, when he heard she was leaving, our House colleague, \nRepresentative Chris Cannon, said:\n\n       It is the State's great loss.\n\n  Trisha has the love and respect of everyone in the Senate, in Utah \nand those whose lives she has touched.\n  I will always appreciate her wise counsel and deep commitment to me, \nto my staff and to the citizens of Utah. Her sense of humor has defused \nmany a tense time.\n  Trisha has been my right hand for many, many years--indeed, she is my \nlongest-serving chief of staff and I will miss her greatly. In fact, \none wag blogged upon hearing this news in the Salt Lake Tribune--I hope \nwhen she leaves she'll take Hatch with her. I thought that was a little \ncoarse myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S15957]]\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Dec. 15, 2007]\n\n             Hatch's ``Right Hand'' To Leave by Year's End\n\n                           (By Robert Gehrke)\n\n       Sen. Orrin Hatch's longtime chief of staff and policy \n     adviser on health issues, Patricia Knight, will leave the \n     senator's office before the end of the year, she said Friday.\n       Knight said she is leaving before a new law kicks in on \n     Jan. 1, 2008, restricting congressional staffers from \n     lobbying the chamber where they worked for two years. There \n     is a one-year restriction in place now.\n       ``It was extremely tough for me, but in the end I felt like \n     I owed it to myself for my future development to not be \n     limited,'' she said. ``That's the only reason I'm doing it \n     now. I love the job and Senator Hatch and working for the \n     people of Utah.''\n       Knight told the senator of her decision Thursday evening, \n     she said, and Hatch announced her imminent departure during a \n     staff meeting Friday morning.\n       ``Trish has a reputation as one of the best senior \n     legislative staff members of Capitol Hill. But those who know \n     her well realize that she is the best on the Hill,'' Hatch \n     said in a statement. ``She's been my right arm for years and \n     done more for the people of Utah and for this country than I \n     think anyone will ever realize.''\n       Hatch promoted Jace Johnson, his legislative director, to \n     take over as chief of staff. Johnson, a graduate of Brigham \n     Young University, has been with the senator for several \n     years, working on issues including transportation, trade, \n     welfare and telecommunications.\n       Knight was something of a character among the Senate chiefs \n     of staff. She would do needlepoint during meetings, enjoys \n     Neil Young concerts and has a dry, barbed sense of humor. She \n     likes to garden, spend time at the beach and take care of her \n     dogs, Frank and Maxie.\n       Knight came to work for Hatch the day after President \n     Clinton took office in January 1993, volunteering her \n     services temporarily after being forced out of her post as a \n     deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services with the change in administrations.\n       She was hired full-time and worked on Hatch's key health \n     care legislation, including helping to write the 1994 dietary \n     supplement legislation and the first State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program in 1997.\n       She has been Hatch's chief of staff since 1999, but \n     remained active in health policy, recently helping to \n     negotiate legislation regarding the Food and Drug \n     Administration's regulation of biologic treatments--things \n     like gene therapies, blood and tissue treatments and \n     vaccines.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Desert Morning News, Dec. 15, 2007]\n\n                  Hatch's Chief of Staff Stepping Down\n\n                        (By Suzanne Struglinski)\n\n       Washington.--Patricia Knight, chief of staff for Sen. Orrin \n     Hatch, R-Utah, will leave government service at the end of \n     the year, she told the senator Thursday. Knight started as a \n     volunteer in Hatch's office in 1993, a status that lasted \n     only a few months before she started working on health-care \n     policy. She has been his chief of staff since 1999 but has \n     worked for the federal government since 1973.\n       ``We will miss Trish terribly,'' Hatch said in a statement. \n     ``I know that this is the right time for her, after 34 years \n     serving our country, and I know she will be successful as she \n     moves her career to the private sector.''\n       Hatch said she has been his ``right arm for many years'' \n     and that the Virginia native ``has done more for the people \n     of Utah and for this country than I think anyone will ever \n     realize.''\n       Knight disagreed with the phrase that she is retiring as \n     she wants to do government consulting or some related work.\n       She based her decision to leave on the pending enactment of \n     a new law that would bar her as a former Senate staffer from \n     lobbying other Senate offices for a full year. Under current \n     law, she would only be banned from lobbying Hatch's office \n     for a year.\n       Knight feels the new law, designed to stop the so-called \n     revolving door between congressional offices and lobbying \n     shops, is a little unfair. She said it would limit her from \n     talking to senators and their staff members whom she does not \n     now know.\n       ``It's not like I have a big influence with people I \n     haven't met,'' Knight said.\n       Knight said she will miss Hatch's office and working with \n     the people of the state.\n       ``It's going to be different,'' she said. ``I'll be coming \n     at things from a different perspective.''\n       Jace Johnson, Hatch's current legislative director, will \n     become chief of staff, Hatch said.\n       Johnson and Knight have worked together on issues for \n     several years and ``he is well prepared to serve the people \n     of Utah and the country,'' Hatch said.\n       ``Trish has a reputation as one of the best senior \n     legislative staff members on Capitol Hill. But those who know \n     her well realize that she is the best on the Hill,'' Hatch \n     said.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will always be extremely grateful for the service she \nhas rendered. But more than that, she is a dear friend who could always \nbe counted on to tell me the truth. That was really important to me and \nhas always been.\n  Mr. President, I have been blessed to have superb staff in my 31 \nyears here in the Senate. The devotion staff have to the institution of \nthe Senate is understandable--we are all privileged to serve an \ninstitution that embodies the liberty and deliberation among free \npeople that the Senate represents.\n  But the devotion of staff to a Member is, for me, quite humbling. For \n15 years, Trisha Knight has given me and the Senate her expertise, her \nknowledge, and her advice.\n  I have been able to rely on her, literally, 24 hours a day during \nthese 15 years. I have depended on her to help me pass landmark \nlegislation, and surmount difficult challenges. I have relied on her \nadvice--even when she felt obliged to tell me what I didn't want to \nhear.\n  I have relied, without exception, on her integrity, and I am grateful \nfor every day I have had the pleasure of her good character.\n  We will all miss Trisha, but I suspect we will be seeing a lot of her \nin the future. We do have a saying: ``Once a Hatch staffer, always a \nHatch staffer,'' and we will expect her to adhere to that rule. And all \nthe other applicable rules and laws, I hasten to add.\n  So, as the first session of the 110th Congress draws to a close, I \nhope my colleagues will join me in expressing appreciation for Patricia \nKnight for her loyalty, her service, her counsel, her sacrifice, and \nher commitment to good policy.\n  Let me say I have worked with some wonderful people in my days. I \nhave had some terrific people help me. I have had people who have been \nloyal, decent, honorable, kind, honest people who have set examples \naround here and, frankly, every one of them has become a very good \nfriend.\n  In particular, I love Trisha Knight. I believe she has more than \ngiven her best to the Senate, the Congress, and to the Government of \nthe United States of America. I care for her, and I hope she will \ncontinue to stay in touch with me and with others in our office because \nwe are going to need her help. We are going to need her advice from \ntime to time. I hope she will always be there for us. I wish Trisha the \nvery best in whatever she chooses to do next. I pray for her continued \ngood health, success, happiness, love, and joy. She is a great one. I \nhave been very privileged to have her with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Patricia Knight \nwho is retiring next week after 10 years as Senator Hatch's Chief of \nStaff and 15 years playing a central role in health policy here in the \nSenate.\n  Although, I am sure Senator Hatch will describe her role in his \noffice, and her work on Judiciary Committee and Finance Committee \nissues, I wanted to rise and acknowledge her contribution to health \ncare policy. For the last 15 years, Ms. Knight has been a constant \nadvocate for improving the health care system. She has played an \nimportant role in every piece of device, drug, and supplement \nlegislation that has been enacted. She has not just overseen this \ndevelopment, but participated. My staff and I have enjoyed working with \nher, as she has made it very clear that she enjoys getting bills \nenacted.\n  In the last 3 years as chairman and now ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee, Ms. Knight has worked with my staff on all of the \nbioterrorism legislation, the biosimilar legislation, and the recently \nenacted FDA Reform Act. While being Senator Hatch's Chief of Staff, \nTrish worked tirelessly as she felt that this was important legislation \nthat needed to be done correctly. She helped organize Republican and \nbipartisan briefings, helped draft and revise language, and encouraged \neveryone late into the night.\n  Throughout her interactions she has been a pleasure to work with kind \nwords and funny nicknames for all. I thank her for her service and wish \nher the best of luck in her future endeavors. Surely, the Senate will \nmiss her.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the end of this year brings the loss of \none of this body's most talented, dedicated, and accomplished staff \nmembers. Patricia Knight, Senator Hatch's longtime chief of staff, is \nretiring after three decades of distinguished public service to the \nSenate, House of Representatives, and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with and knowing Ms. Knight for at\n\n[[Page S15958]]\n\nleast 13 years. My work with her began when Orrin Hatch and I teamed up \nin 1994 to pass the landmark Dietary Supplement Health and Education \nAct, DSHEA. That legislation, which assured continued consumer access \nto and better research into dietary supplements, is a testament to \nTrisha's mastery of health care issues, her commitment to legislating \nacross party lines, and her sharp attention to detail. Truly, without \nher, there would be no DSHEA today.\n  For the past nearly 30 years, Trisha Knight has been in the middle of \nalmost every major piece of health legislation enacted into law. From \nDSHEA to the Children's Health Insurance Program, from the Medicare \nprescription drug legislation to the FDA Modernization Act, her stamp \nis on a host of major laws that will endure for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, the American people owe a debt of gratitude to \nPatricia Knight. While most may not know her, they know and appreciate \nthe public policies she has helped create. She has worked day and night \nfor many years of public service. And all the while she carried with \nher a passion for public policy, an unflagging dedication to her bosses \nand great, sharp wit.\n  I wish Trisha all the best as she moves on and tip my hat to her for \na job well done. She will be missed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will speak as in morning business. I \nthank Senator Reed for giving me the opportunity to speak briefly \nbefore his remarks in support of legislation that I do hope the Senate \nwill act on today; that is, legislation to dedicate the post office in \nEast Hampton, NH, in honor of Army Ranger CPT Jonathan Grassbaugh, who \nwas killed in action on April 7 this year in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Hampstead, New Hampshire middle school \nstudents, school board officials, board of selectmen, and residents, I \nrise to honor a fallen hero, United States Army Ranger Captain Jonathan \nDavid Grassbaugh, by introducing a bill to designate the United States \nPostal Service facility at 59 Colby Corner in East Hampstead, NH, as \nthe ``Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh Post Office.''\n  Jon, as he was called by his family and friends, moved to East \nHampstead, NH, from St. Marys, OH, in 1989. He attended Hampstead \nCentral Elementary School and Hampstead Middle School where his mother, \nPatricia, is principal.\n  Jon graduated high school from Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, \nNew Hampshire, where he was a four-year honor student in the Class of \n1999. Jon left a remarkable impression on the Phillips Exeter \ncommunity; remembered for his manifestation of the motto ``Non Sibi'' \nor ``Not for Oneself,'' a Latin phrase inscribed on the Academy's seal. \nJon exemplified his passion for life through his persistent dedication \nto his studies, tireless volunteer efforts in school and the local \ncommunity, and commitment to the Academy's radio station, Grainger \nObservatory, and the school's Washington Internship Program.\n  Jon's illustrious high school years were prologue to a promising \nfuture, full of infinite potential. Jon enrolled at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity where he graduated in 2003, earning a bachelor's degree in \ncomputer science from the renowned Whiting School of Engineering.\n  At a young age, Jon's family instilled in him the importance of \nvolunteerism and service to the United States. Jon's father, Mark \nproudly served three and a half years as an Army Ranger during Vietnam, \nand his older brother, West Point Alum and Dartmouth Medical School \ngraduate, Army Captain Dr. Jason Grassbaugh, is currently serving as an \northopedic surgeon in Fort Lewis, WA. Jon continued this family \ntradition of service, joining the Johns Hopkins Army ROTC Program, and \neventually becoming battalion commander his senior year. He also became \na proud member of the Pershing Rifles fraternal organization, captained \nthe Ranger Challenge Team, and won the national two-man duet drill team \ncompetition.\n  In a storybook setting, Jon met Jenna Parkinson, a freshman ROTC \ncadet from Boxborough, MA, during his senior year. Jon and Jenna slowly \ngrew closer, watching movies together during spring break, sharing \nflights to and from school, and attending the military ball. A few \nshort years later, Jon proposed to Jenna on April 30, 2005, and the \nyoung couple subsequently married on June 9, 2006, in a Cape Cod \nceremony. Prior to their wedding day, Jon and Jenna filled out a \nquestionnaire for their officiate which asked, ``Where is a sacred \nspot, a place where you feel most connected, most at peace and most \ninspired?'' Jon's answer came in three loving words: ``With my wife.''\n  Following graduation, Jon completed U.S. Army Ranger School in April \n2004 and served his country both at home and abroad. He was assigned to \nthe 7th Cavalry in The Republic of South Korea and served as a member \nof the Army Hurricane Katrina Relief Team. Later, Jon was assigned to \nthe 5th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd \nAirborne Division in Fort Bragg, NC, where he and the now U.S. Army 2nd \nLieutenant Jenna Grassbaugh would reside.\n  Shortly after Jon and Jenna were married, he was deployed for a \nsecond tour of duty in Iraq. Tragically, on April 7, 2007, Jon was one \nof four soldiers who died while conducting a combat logistics patrol in \nZaganiyah, Iraq. Throughout Jon's distinguished military service, he \nreceived a number of accolades and commendations, including: the Bronze \nStar Medal, Purple Heart Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Army \nCommendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, Army Achievement \nMedal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, Korean Defense Service Medal, Humanitarian \nService Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Ranger Tab, Combat Action Badge, \nand Parachutist Badge.\n  Jon is remembered as a confident and mentally strong leader, whose \npoise under pressure, intelligence, compassion, and love for God, \ncountry and family transcends his passing. His valor on the field of \nbattle was equally as impressive as his undying loyalty to and love for \nhis squadron. One well-known anecdote recalls a combat operation in \nwhich Jon had pizza flown by helicopter from 100 kilometers away to \nwhere his troops were conducting combat operations in an effort to lift \nmorale. Jon left a legacy that continues to inspire our Nation's future \nleaders from Hampstead and Exeter, New Hampshire, Johns Hopkins, and \nthose he proudly served beside in Iraq.\n  On a deep and personal note, for those who had the sincere privilege \nand honor to meet Jon, it was evident his exuberance for life and new \nexperiences, ingenuity, and academic acumen destined him for greatness. \nBy the time of his death, Jon had achieved more than most individuals \ndo in a lifetime, a testimonial to his family's love and guidance \nthrough his young life, and Jenna's warmth and support as he fought for \nour Nation.\n  Today, Jonathan Grassbaugh rests in peace at one of our Nation's most \nhallowed and sacred grounds, Arlington National Cemetery--his rightful \nplace among generations of brave Americans who sacrificed their lives \nin defense of this country. His loved ones will forever remember him as \na loving husband, son, brother, and friend. Let it be known, the \ncitizens of New Hampshire and our Nation are eternally in debt to \nJonathan David Grassbaugh, an honorable son of New Hampshire, an \nAmerican Patriot, and a guardian of liberty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Hampstead, \nNH, Board of Selectmen's letter of support to dedicate the East \nHampstead, NH, Post Office, as the ``Captain Jonathan D. Grassbaugh \nPost Office'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 12, 2007.\n     Re Petition of dedication.\n\n       Dear Senator Sununu: Students of the Hampstead Middle \n     School prepared a petition to support honoring Captain \n     Jonathan Grassbaugh, who gave his life for our country. the \n     petition seeks to honor him by dedicating the East Hampstead, \n     NH, 03826 Post Office in his name.\n\n[[Page S15959]]\n\n       The petition was presented to the Hampstead Board of \n     Selectmen on Monday, December 10, 2007.\n       The Board of Selectmen accepted the petition and voted \n     unanimously to support the project.\n       Please find enclosed the petition along with the signatures \n     of 526 individuals.\n       Thank you for your help in moving this project forward.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n     Richard H.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the state of our \neconomy. Regrettably, the news is not good. Two weeks ago, the Mortgage \nBankers Association reported that the rate of home foreclosures and the \npercentage of loans in foreclosure is at the highest level ever \nrecorded by this organization. At the same time, surveys by the \nUniversity of Michigan and the Conference Board showed consumer \nconfidence at the lowest levels in many years. The financial troubles \nthat began with the subprime mortgage crisis last summer have now \nspread to all credit markets and created a liquidity crunch that \nthreatens our entire economy.\n  Some say these troubles are merely temporary. In fact, some say there \nare two economies--the real economy, with people getting up and going \nto work, and the economy of Wall Street, which is financial engineering \nand all sorts of incredibly exotic financial products. The reality is \nthese markets intersect. As a result, our whole economy is threatened \nnow by forces that may be temporary, but they are working themselves \nout in a very difficult way for the people of this country, the men and \nwomen we represent, our constituents.\n  Some contend that the market has undergone a correction since the end \nof cheap credit and speculation in the housing sector. They point to \njob figures and quarterly GDP growth as indications that the overall \neconomy, the real economy, is strong.\n  Frankly, I think we have to look critically at those assertions. What \ntroubles me more than the numbers--the GDP and all the other financial \nstatistics--is what I am hearing from Rhode Islanders and what I \npresume my colleagues are hearing from their constituents across the \ncountry. The mortgage crisis and credit crunch in many ways represents \na culmination of their fears and sort of the tangible acknowledgement \nof what they have been fearful of for many months. Lately, I have been \nstruck by how many people are finding it increasingly difficult to \nmaintain a decent standard of living, despite having a steady job. \nPeople tell me they feel squeezed by the rising costs of energy, food, \nhealth care, and higher education, while at the same time the size of \ntheir paychecks does not seem to be expanding at all.\n  For thousand of families in Rhode Island and millions of people \nacross America, wage stagnation has created a general feeling of \nanxiety. Instead of trying to get ahead, most people are finding it \nhard to get by. The subprime meltdown and subsequent credit crunch are \nadding additional stress to that equation. For some people, it has \npushed them to the brink of personal and financial crisis.\n  Today, we are living in an era of divided prosperity, where a few do \nextremely well--extraordinarily well--and the rest of us are struggling \nto keep up. The Bush administration has aided and accelerated this \ntrend of growing inequality, and its lax attitude toward regulation has \nallowed major economic liabilities to develop unchecked, allegedly for \nthe sake of allowing the market to function ``efficiently.''\n  The latest crises show markets are not always efficient, nor always \nequitable, and rampant speculation in the absence of oversight can \ncreate problems that cannot be quickly assessed or fixed. This \nPresident has perpetuated a system that encourages a fortunate few to \ncollect as much of the benefits of our economy as possible, while \nsharing very little with the rest of society.\n  At the same time, what we have seen developing are enormous blind \nspots that have begun to reveal themselves with disturbing frequency. \nThe tragedies of Katrina and the collapse of the bridge in Minneapolis, \nas well as the subprime crisis, and even our policies in Iraq are all \nevidence of the administration's consistent failure to plan for long-\nterm liabilities. Moreover, this shortsighted focus is reflected in \nmassive trade and budget deficits and the absence of any comprehensive \nplan to address our addiction to foreign oil or the skyrocketing cost \nof health care. These are creating real challenges for our country.\n  This year, the new majority in Congress has tried to set a different \ncourse, but, unfortunately, we have not had the cooperation or support \nof the President in any real sense of the word. As a result, we have \nmade some progress in addressing and correcting these issues but not \nnearly enough. In order to end the Bush era of divided prosperity, \nwhich some people speak of as two Americas, we have to, I think, \nreengage ourselves in a process of making sure America is competitive \nin the global economy and that it has sustainable policies that lead to \ntrue growth, which is shared by all Americans. We must reprioritize and \ntake a more serious approach to the policy challenges at hand.\n  Since World War II, every period of economic expansion has resulted \nin shared prosperity for most America. To be sure, growth varied by \ndegrees over time and from place to place, but in general the tradition \nin America has been that a rising tide will lift up all boats. Yet for \nthe past 6 years, under the Bush administration, this tradition of \nshared prosperity has not been sustained.\n  In my State, the Poverty Institute of Rhode Island announced last \nmonth that our median wage actually declined since 2000, which makes \nRhode Island the only State in New England to experience negative wage \ngrowth during this period. With stagnation in most places, we have \nactually seen negative growth. Since President Bush took office, the \nreal national median household income has declined by $962, from \n$49,163 in 2000, to $48,201 in 2006. In fact, between the first quarter \nof 2001 and the third quarter of 2007, real median weekly earnings fell \n1.2 percent, compared to 7.1 percent growth between 1996 and 2000 under \nthe Clinton administration. We have seen a startling change in the \neconomy affecting the families of America, whose incomes grew from 1996 \nto 2000 and have declined in real terms since then, and that reality is \nshaping the lives of millions of Americans.\n  While the President's economic policy has yielded extraordinary gains \nat the very top of the income scale, his fiscal policy has multiplied \ndifferences and exacerbated the disparity between the very wealthy and, \nfrankly, most everyone else.\n  According to data recently published by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, in 2005, real after-tax incomes jumped by an average of nearly \n$180,000 for the top 1 percent of households, while rising only $400 \nfor middle-income households, and $200 for lower income households, \nwhich signifies an extraordinary divergence in terms of the wealth of \nthe very few versus everyone else. That average income gain for the top \n1 percent is more than three times the total income of the average \nmiddle-income household.\n\n       Taken together with prior research, this new data indicates \n     that income is now more concentrated at the top of the income \n     scale than at any time since 1929. I grew up in an era where \n     we looked to the history of the lives of our parents who \n     endured a depression\n\n[[Page S15960]]\n\n     in which the economy collapsed, and then through the policies \n     of this Federal Government and State government, we saw a \n     rising tide literally lift up every family in America. We saw \n     a more equal distribution of wealth. In fact, many people \n     prospered. Now we are seeing a reconcentration of wealth that \n     has great consequences not only for our economy, but for our \n     society.\n\n  We pride ourselves as Americans on having a country where anyone can \nrise to the top, where opportunity will propel you forward, take the \nchances that are available to you. But what we are seeing in other \neconomic studies is, frankly, today we can predict the success of a \nchild based on the income of the parent more than we could 20, 30, and \n40 years ago. If your parents are wealthy, you are likely to stay \nwealthy. That was not the case 20, 30, and 40 years ago.\n  In his new book ``The Squandering of America,'' the economist Robert \nKuttner writes:\n\n       Between 2000 and 2006, the productivity of American workers \n     increased by 19 percent. But the total increases in wages \n     paid to all 124 million non-supervisory workers--\n\n  These are the blue-collar workers who come in every day, punch in, \nwork hard, go home, and take care of their families.\n\n       --was less than $200 million in 6 years--a raise of $1.60 \n     per worker--not $1.60 per hour, but a grand total of one \n     dollar and sixty cents in higher wages per worker over nearly \n     six years . . . Compare this $200 million total for all \n     nonsupervisory workers to the nearly $38 billion paid in \n     bonuses alone by the top Wall Street firms during the same \n     period.\n\n  That is $38 billion to those people who are extremely successful on \nWall Street versus $200 million for every nonsupervisory worker in the \ncountry.\n  Since 1997, the pay of CEOs of large corporations has increased to an \naverage of $10.5 billion per year, or about 369 times the average wages \nof a worker and 821 times the average wage of a minimum wage worker. \nSuch facts make it clear that most Americans are working harder and \nmore productively.\n  Yet these facts go against what many of us were taught in school \nabout the tenets of economics. I am referring to the basic idea that as \nthe economy becomes more productive, those productivity gains are \nshared, and as a result workers get more in their paychecks. That is \nnot happening. It is not happening as it should.\n  Let me give another example. According to ``Alpha'' magazine and the \nNew York Times, in 2006, the top 25 hedge fund managers combined earned \n$14 billion. That is enough to pay New York City's 80,000 public \nschoolteachers for nearly 3 years. Ask yourself: As a matter of social \nworth and value, should 80,000 public schoolteachers be paid for 3 \nyears with what 25 individuals have earned?\n  I understand there is a risk premium for the pay that these financial \nmanagers earn. They are not only talented, dedicated people, but they \nare also going in there and taking chances and rolling the dice and \ncreating innovation, entrepreneurship, and opportunities for others. \nBut still I must ask: Is this distribution of wealth and reward \ncommensurate with all the efforts of those teachers, men and women in \nurban school districts who are laboring to give kids a chance so they \ncan seize opportunities? As Americans, we have to stop and ask \nourselves why is this happening. Is there something we can and must do \nto make this country a little bit fairer?\n  Even some billionaires are concerned about this. Warren Buffett has \ncriticized the U.S. tax system for allowing him to pay a lower rate \nthan his secretary. Mr. Buffett paid 17.7 percent on the $46 million he \nmade last year. He did not try to avoid paying higher taxes, he simply \ntook the advantages that were in the tax code to which he--indeed, to \nwhich each of us--is entitled. Meanwhile his secretary, who earns \n$60,000, was taxed at 30 percent.\n  If you consider these inequities, these differences, it is hard to \nunderstand why the President is so adamant about protecting the tax \nrates for the top 1 percent of earners. The consequence of this is that \nwe also have fiscal complications. We have the most rapid deterioration \nof our Nation's fiscal health in the history of this country. In this \nadministration, we have swung from a projected surplus to a projected \ndeficit dramatically.\n  When the President took office, we had a surplus. Yet he has run a \nbudget deficit every year for the past 6 years. Over that period of \ntime, Bush's deficit spending has increased our national debt to nearly \n$9 trillion, which is virtually $30,000 for every man, woman, and child \nin America. He has pushed this country into record levels of debt to \nfinance tax cuts for individuals who, frankly, are earning at a level \nat which they do not need additional tax cuts.\n\n  Not only does it give more to those who already have a great deal, it \nalso starves the Government from funds to use for investing in the \nfuture productivity and prosperity of this country.\n  The only areas where the President has consistently supported more \nmoney have been for his tax cuts and for unlimited spending on his \npolicy in Iraq. With these items, there is no limit to what he will \naccept. A recent report released by the Joint Economic Committee \nestimates that the total economic cost of the war in Iraq has been \napproximately double the direct budgetary costs. We have been spending \nbillions, but the costs are much more than that. As we look to a \ndrawdown of our troops going forward, the JEC estimates that the total \neconomic cost of the war will reach $2.8 trillion for the entire 2003-\nto-2007 period, when you factor in veterans health care, the cost of \nequipping and replacing the materiel we have consumed in this war, and \nthe reinvestments we will need to make in our military. It is a huge \namount of money.\n  We are spending $10 billion per month on Iraq. Just 2 months of the \ncost of that war is roughly the same amount that was at issue between \nthe President and the Congress in our debate about the budget this \nyear. The President refused to spend $22 billion more than his limit on \ndomestic spending, but in 2 months, we will consume at least that much \nin Iraq without any revenue offsets, without any qualms, and without \nany additional considerations. Unconditional spending was the message \nhe sent to us last evening when he demanded that this Congress send him \nmoney for Iraq.\n  The President's policy seems to be not guns and butter but guns and \ncaviar--money for Iraq, money for Afghanistan without limit, without \nend, it appears, and benefits through the tax system for the very \nwealthiest Americans, not the rich, but the super-rich.\n  This year, the Government is effectively spending $49 billion to \nprovide tax breaks averaging $130,000 for those with incomes greater \nthan $1 million. And we are seeing the impact throughout this country. \nWe particularly see it as we go back to what has to be, I believe, the \nreference point for what we all do, and that is, what is happening to \nfamilies across this country.\n  In Rhode Island, the cost of health care premiums is rising twice as \nfast as wages and inflation. Premiums in Rhode Island increased 67 \npercent between 2001 and 2006. Wages did not increase that fast, I can \ntell you that. The number of people without insurance increased 50 \npercent in that same period. They cannot afford to pay for the cost of \ninsurance.\n  Gas prices have more than doubled in Rhode Island. The price of \nregular gas has jumped 95 percent from $1.52 when President Bush took \noffice to about $2.97 in June of 2007. People are spending more and \nmore money on getting to work, getting the kids to the Little League \ngames.\n  College education costs are rising in Rhode Island and across the \ncountry. Average tuition fees in Rhode Island have increased 6 percent \nfor our 4-year public colleges and 5 percent for our private colleges.\n  At the same time, the value of a home has been decreasing, and people \nare beginning to sense that decrease. A home used to be the great \nsource of economic security, economic wealth, economic flexibility, and \na hedge against the uncertainty of the economy, but now we are seeing \nin Rhode Island, and indeed across America, an explosion in \nforeclosures.\n  And we can also factor in the uncertainty of pensions. The fact is \nthat more and more of my constituents are being pushed from a defined \nbenefit to a defined contribution plan or in some cases to no pension \nat all. The erosion of traditional pensions is adding to this \nuncertainty.\n  The net effect of all of this is that many Rhode Islanders are \nworking longer hours but are barely able to maintain the same standard \nof living.\n  What we have to do is respond to these issues. We have taken some\n\n[[Page S15961]]\n\nsteps. We have passed, in terms of education, the College Cost \nReduction Act. This $20 billion increase in student aid is the result \nof this Democratic Congress and our priorities, but we have to do much \nmore.\n  We have moved forward with respect to some issues on housing, but \nprogress has come much too late and is still too little. We finally \ncleared the Federal Housing Administration Modernization Act, the FHA \nAct, which is going to increase the amount of loans the FHA can \nguarantee. That is going to get them back into the lending business. \nBut this action has come months after we should have moved more \npromptly, more efficiently, more effectively to do that.\n  We have to respond to this growing crisis now in terms of \nforeclosures. Secretary Paulson announced his plans recently and I \nthink the plans are important because at least they signal some action. \nHowever, I suspect they are probably inadequate for the scope of the \nproblem that is developing. We have legislation that is pending that \nhas to be moved that I think will be much more effective going forward.\n  On energy, this week, the President is signing an energy bill which \nis long overdue. It increases gas mileage, or CAFE, standards. But we \nhave to do more there, too. The tax provisions which are so essential, \nI think, to ensuring that there are incentives for alternate fuels, \nincentives in the marketplace so investors will put in money with the \nconfidence that they will be repaid, those tax incentives are still \nlanguishing. They have to be passed. Again, we have made progress, but \nit has not been adequate progress to date.\n  We have to deal with the broader sense of our dependency on oil. \nAgain, this energy bill is a very good step forward. It has to be \nsupported. It has to be advanced. It has to be extended.\n  When we look at the economy from the standpoint not of the \nmacroeconomic statistics of gross domestic product, when we look at the \neconomy not simply in the context of financial markets, when we look at \nthe economy from the standpoint of people who live in Harrisville, RI, \nor Harrisburg, PA, it is a tough economy. People at home are asking us \nto stand up and do something, to give them again the sense that when \nthey work and their productivity goes up, their wages will go up as \nwell; to give them the sense that they can actually provide for their \nfamily, maybe even put a little bit aside. Very few middle-income \npeople are putting anything aside these days. That is our challenge.\n  This Congress has taken some steps to meet that challenge in terms of \neducation policy, in terms of energy policy, in terms of at least \nbeginning to deal with the housing issue. We have a lot more to do, and \nwe need the cooperation of the administration.\n\n  I think this is a historic moment. Are we going to abandon our sense \nthat this country is based on opportunity for all of our citizens? Are \nwe going to abandon the sense that our economy works for all of its \ncitizens; that those who are creative and clever and take risks will \nget great rewards but that no one is going to be left behind, no one is \ngoing to be left without anything to show for working hard, working \nsmarter, and working better? I hope not.\n  I think that will be one of the ultimate judgments not just on this \nCongress and this administration but on our tenure as Members of the \nSenate as we go forth.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his consideration in allowing me \nto speak beyond the recess time, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate stands in recess until 2:15 p.m.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:46 p.m., recessed until 2:15 p.m. and \nreassembled when called to order by the presiding officer (Mr. Cardin).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15961-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15961-S15962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONSUMER EDUCATION\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, ever since my days as Deputy Special \nAssistant to the President for Consumer Affairs in the Nixon \nadministration, followed by 5 years on the Federal Trade Commission, \nconsumer education has been a top priority, especially with regard to \nhelping individuals protect their credit and improve their financial \nliteracy.\n  In fact, back in my days with the White House Consumer Office, we \nprepared an extensive manual called ``Consumer Education K through \n12.'' I traveled the country and encouraged schools to use this \nmaterial so that students could learn the importance of financial \nliteracy at an early age. So this is truly an issue that is near and \ndear to my heart, and I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee \nheld a hearing just last week entitled, ``Shopping Smart and Avoiding \nScams: Financial Literacy During the Holiday Season.'' As I said at \nthat hearing, it is unfortunate that today there is a particularly \nharmful practice called identity theft, an all too prevalent problem we \nmust continue to deal with. Identity thieves constantly create new \nscams to rob hard-working, law-abiding citizens of their good names, \ntheir credit and their security. The stakes could not be higher for the \nfamilies involved.\n  As you may remember, after last year's holiday shopping season, TJX, \nthe parent company of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, disclosed that it had \nexperienced a massive data breach, where the security of its customers' \nfinancial information was compromised. According to a filing with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, beginning in July 2005, and \ncontinuing over an 18 month period, at least 45.7 million credit cards \nwere exposed to possible fraud. As this example illustrates, identity \ntheft is often cited as one of the fastest growing crimes in the \nNation. According to a study conducted for the Federal Trade \nCommission, approximately 8.3 million Americans were victims of \nidentity theft in 2005, losing an average of $1,882 dollars each. In my \nhome State alone, an estimated 300,000 North Carolinians are victims of \nidentity theft and fraud each year. Without a doubt, this is an issue \nthat continually needs to be front and center on our radar screens, and \nwe need to do our part to educate people on ways to prevent identity \ntheft and inform them of what to do if, heaven forbid, they become a \nvictim. For example, the North Carolina Department of Justice site \ncalled ``NoScamNC.gov'' and the Federal Trade Commission's Web site, \nwww.ftc.gov, both provide useful information and tools to help \nconsumers protect themselves and take action if their personal \ninformation has been compromised or misused.\n  With regard to financial literacy, I believe clarification of credit \ncard agreements is high on the list to benefit consumers. There are \nmany well-intentioned laws that require credit card companies to fully \ndisclose their policies on rates, payments and terms of use. But \nunfortunately, the tangible effect of these laws is often multiple \npages of single-spaced typing in small font lettering, filled with \nsophisticated legal terminology. Who are they trying to fool? For gosh \nsakes, you shouldn't have to have a lawyer and a magnifying glass to \nunderstand a credit card user agreement. Some lending companies are now \nproviding consumers with a one-page summary of their disclosure \ninformation in a format similar to the nutrition information displayed \non products in your local grocery store. In fact, I'm proud that \nworking to get that clear, concise nutritional labeling was a top \npriority during my early days in the White House Consumer Office.\n  We must also continue to require that credit card companies provide \nfull disclosure regarding fees, interest rates, minimum payments and \nprivacy statements. It is imperative that this information be presented \nin the most consumer-friendly manner possible. This will benefit not \nonly the consumers, but also the credit card companies. By providing \nmore easily understood applications and monthly statements, card \nissuers can reduce losses due to defaults and also lessen the demand \nfor customer service to guide consumers through problems. It's a win-\nwin situation or, as they say, a no-brainer.\n  During this busy shopping season, and all year-round, we can each \nbenefit from sharpening our financial literacy and protecting our \npersonal information and credit.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S15962]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe I am by previous order to be \nrecognized for 30 minutes. My colleague from Michigan has asked for 5 \nminutes to precede that. I will be happy to grant that by consent, if I \nwill be recognized following her presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15962-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PREVENTION THROUGH AFFORDABLE ACCESS ACT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor his graciousness. It is my understanding that there will be an \nobjection to this unanimous consent request. At this point there is not \nsomeone on the floor to object, so I will briefly talk about what I am \nasking that we do, and then, as a courtesy to our colleagues on the \nother side, if we do not have someone here I will postpone the actual \nmotion. But let me just say, because I want to make sure I am only \ntaking a moment--I know Senator Dorgan has some important words--let me \njust say I will be asking unanimous consent that S. 2347, the \nPrevention Through Affordable Access Act, be discharged and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration and pass it.\n  Due to an unfortunate drafting mistake in last year's Deficit \nReduction Act, some safety net providers, such as family planning \nclinics and other health centers, cannot receive contraception from \ndrugmakers at nominal drug prices without violating Medicaid's best \nprice rule. These are drugs that in fact are donated. Since this law \nbecame effective in January, the provision has been a tremendous \nhardship for women across America and has driven up the cost of \ncontraception, family planning, by some 400 percent in some cases.\n  Because of this, many women cannot afford their prescriptions, and \nclinics are being forced to close because they can no longer receive \nthe donations they have traditionally received. This is sure to result \nin an unintended series of pregnancies among low-income women and \nstudents. This is very serious for women and families across America.\n  Hundreds of articles have been published documenting the impact of \nthis mistake. We understand our Republican colleagues have indicated \nthis was a mistake. This has affected low-income women and families on \ncollege campuses nationwide. Some clinics stocked up early, but their \nsupplies are running out. For too many clinics, especially in rural \nareas and on college campuses, they simply do not have enough resources \nto overcome this provision which, it was indicated, in fact was a \ntechnical drafting error. According to one family planning \norganization, over 200 clinics across 34 States serving half a million \npatients are at imminent risk of closing, and therefore women and their \nfamilies lose these important health care facilities.\n  In my own State, women in rural parts of Michigan will have limited \nor no access to contraception. I have already heard from rural health \nclinics, as well as universities, student clinics, how this provision, \npassed last year, is hurting women and potentially causing these \ncenters to close. Again, this is essential health care for women that \nis at risk.\n  I rise today to express my strong support for the Prevention Through \nAffordable Access Act. This bipartisan bill, introduced by Senator \nObama and myself and nearly 30 other Senators, is a commonsense \nsolution to a major problem affecting our Nation's family planning \nproviders. Historically, Congress has expanded access to affordable \nprescription drugs for vulnerable populations in America by permitting \npharmaceutical companies to offer what is called nominally priced \ndrugs, drugs that are either donated or provided at dramatically \nreduced prices, to certain health care providers.\n  What we are asking for today is merely a technical correction, to do \nthe right thing. The Prevention Through Affordable Access Act will not \ncost the Government anything and merely will allow pharmaceutical \ncompanies that are willing to continue to donate drugs to safety net \nfamily planning clinics to do that.\n  This is invaluable in terms of women's health care. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in doing the responsible thing by passing S. 2347 \nnow.\n  Congress must act responsibly now to ensure that family planning \nservices and birth control pricing are restored this year. For too many \nfamilies across America, this is an urgent situation. Women cannot wait \nuntil next session to have this mistake corrected and affordable birth \ncontrol returned.\n  At this point we do not have someone, I understand, on the floor to \naddress this from the other side, so I will delay actually asking for \nthe unanimous consent until a later point. I do intend to do so. It \nwould be my hope that, in fact, with such a large number of Senators \nsupporting this effort we would be able to get this done today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we near the end of this first session I \nwant to talk about a couple of things. I think perhaps today is the \nlast day, maybe tomorrow, I do not know for certain, but most of the \nbusiness that required votes was completed last evening by about 11 \no'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15962-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15962-S15966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FTC\n\n  First, I want to talk about some action that was taken yesterday by \nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin and \nCommissioners Tate and McDowell, forming a majority of three. In a 3-\nto-2 split, the Commission decided yesterday their main issue was the \nneed to relax the ownership rules so we can have more concentration in \nAmerica's media. It is exactly the wrong thing to have done. They have \ndone the wrong thing for the wrong reasons, despite the fact that the \nCongress itself has asked them not to do this.\n  The Commerce Committee, of which I am a member, has passed \nlegislation asking them not to vote so quickly on this rule. Members of \nthe Commerce Committee and other Senators, 27 in total, sent a letter \nto the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission this week and \nsaid: If you proceed to do this, we will introduce legislation to \nnullify and revoke the rule you are intending to pursue.\n  Now, despite that, yesterday the Chairman of the Federal \nCommunications Commission, having worked apparently the night before--\nat 1 a.m. he was still passing around materials about what his rule \nwas--drove through a new FCC rule to allow newspapers to buy television \nstations, to relax the cross ownership ban that has existed for some \nthree decades here. We have in this country a dramatic concentration in \nAmerica's media. A substantial portion of what most people in this \ncountry will see and hear and read today is controlled by a handful of \ncorporations; it's a massive concentration. It is not unusual for you \nto drive down the street and think you're listening to your hometown \nradio station, but it isn't. Oh, you think you are listening to your \nhometown radion station, but they are not there. It is very likely \nsomeone is driving down the road in Salt Lake City, UT, and hears the \ndisk jockey say: Well, it is a great morning here in Salt Lake City. \nThe sun is coming up, we have got a few clouds in the sky, it is going \nto be a beautiful day. The traffic is kind of light. You think, well, \nthis person obviously is in Salt Lake City, I am listening to a Salt \nLake City station. But, no, that person is actually in a basement \nstudio in Baltimore, MD, ripping from the Internet whatever that person \ncan find about Salt Lake City and then pretending he is broadcasting \nfrom Salt Lake City. It is going on all across the country and it is \ncalled voice tracking. Localism is gone in many companies that have \nradio stations and television stations. And yet the Federal \nCommunications Commission that is supposed to wear a striped shirt and \nbe a referee--that is what a regulator is about--the Federal \nCommunications Commission apparently believes we do not have enough \nconcentration in the media.\n  In one community in my home state, Minot, ND, one company bought all \nsix commercial radio stations. Think of that, bought all six of them. \nThere was an incident one night at 2 in the morning that threatened \npeoples' lives,\n\n[[Page S15963]]\n\nkilled one person, sent a lot of people to the hospital, when a plume \nof anhydrous ammonia enveloped that town from a train accident. The \ncitizens called the radio station, but could not get an answer. Nobody \nanswered the phone. Maybe if those six radio stations had been owned by \nsix local people, you think you may have found someone there? I would \nthink so, but yesterday the Federal Communications Commission said: \nWell, none of that matters. We want more concentration in the media. So \nthey passed a rule that allows cross ownership, that has been banned \nfor some 30 years, between newspapers and television stations.\n  Well, here is the media. Let's take a look at the media. They say: \nWell, we have got all of these new opportunities in the media. All of \nthese are different voices. We have got Internet, we have cable \nchannels, we have got so many more voices. Yes, more voices, the same \nventriloquist.\n  Let me describe why that is the case. News Corporation. Here is one \ncompany. Take a look at it. The Internet, books, production, \nprogramming, film, magazines, newspapers, satellite. One corporation. \nBy the way, that corporation has just purchased the Wall Street \nJournal.\n  Disney: Parks and resorts, magazines, radio, books, Internet, \nproduction, television, film. Time Warner. All of this media it owns: \nProgramming, magazines, the Internet, film, television, cable.\n  Viacom: The Internet, film, production, programming, radio \ntelevision. Well, I could go on. Let me go on to two more charts.\n  CBS Corporation, exactly the same thing. Go to the most popular \nInternet sites, who owns them? The same companies. General Electric. \nTelevision, programming, production, film, magazines, and on and on.\n  So we have now a Federal Communications Commission that says: You \nknow what we need? We need more concentration, less localism, less \nminority ownership, apparently. It is unbelievably arrogant what they \ndid yesterday. Let me describe why I think what they did yesterday was \narrogant.\n  They had a rule they were going to put out some while ago dealing \nwith migratory birds and communication towers. They said: This is an \nimportant rule. We will give 90 days for the American people to comment \non this rule. Ninety days. On a rule dealing with relaxing ownership \nlimits, they gave 28 days. Twenty-eight days.\n  Chairman Powell, the chairman before Chairman Martin, ran an FCC that \nincluded now-Chairman Martin. Four years ago he said he was going to \nput out a new ownership rule for the media. Here is what he proposed: \nIn one of America's largest cities a company could own the following: \neight radio stations, three television stations, the cable company, and \nthe newspaper, and it will be fine.\n\n  Well, it was not fine with me. Senator Trent Lott and I got the \nSenate to pass a resolution of disapproval of the rule. In the \nmeantime, the Federal court stayed the rule so it could not take \neffect. Here we are now back with the same issue, Chairman Martin \nleading the way. He says, well, this is a smaller step. Sure, it is a \nsmaller step. You have abrogated the right of the American people to \neven understand what you are doing. He says: Well, we had a 120-day \ncomment period. No, you did not, you had 28 days. You went out and held \nsome meetings, but there was no rule for people to comment on at that \npoint.\n  I want to make this point. What the FCC has done is arrogant. The \nchairman and the ranking member on the Commerce Committee asked them \nnot to do it, 27 Senators sent them a letter saying it is \ninappropriate, saying you should not be short-circuiting the right of \nthe American people to comment on this rule.\n  This Federal Communications Commission, operating with its strings to \nthe White House, has decided what we need in this country is more \nconcentration of the media. It is unbelievable to me. The last thing in \nthe world we need in this country is more concentration in the media. \nWhat we do need with respect to radio stations and television stations \nand, yes, newspapers are some basic connections in the communities in \nwhich they serve.\n  This notion of voice tracking and all of the other things that are \ngoing on, one person at a studio board is running four or five \nstations, sending out homogenized music, pretending he is in four \ncities at the same time, that is not what was intended when we decided \nto give for-profit companies the right to use the airwaves that belong \nto the American people free of charge.\n  They have a responsibility, a public interest responsibility, and a \nresponsibility to serve local interests. This Federal Communications \nCommission ought to hang its head for what it did yesterday. It is not \nover. We will bring to the floor of the Senate a resolution of \ndisapproval. I am convinced, and I predict, that the resolution of \ndisapproval will prevail on the floor of the Senate.\n  I would prefer to say nice things about a Federal agency, if only we \ncould find a Federal agency that takes some responsibility for doing \nwhat it is intended to do. You can look around. You can look at the \nSurface Transportation Board, an agency that is supposed to be a \nreferee with respect to the railroads. It is dead from the neck up; has \nbeen for years. There is no opportunity, no real opportunity, for \nanybody to have any opportunity to contest rail rates, for example.\n  I can go on and on with respect to regulators. It is too bad, because \nthe American people deserve better, in my judgment. The American people \nexpect better from this administration.\n  I want to speak on another couple of subjects this afternoon. First, \nI want to talk about the subprime loan issue, which affects almost \neveryone in this country because of the way it is affecting our \neconomy. The subprime crisis has at its roots a substantial amount of \ngreed and a lust for profits, that in my judgment injured basic common \nsense.\n  I want to read an advertisement that almost everyone has seen or \nheard when in the morning you get up, brush your teeth, maybe are \nlistening to the television set as you get ready for work, and you hear \nthis advertisement. We have all heard them. I wondered when I heard \nthem: Well, how on Earth can this work?\n  Here is one, Millennia Corporation: 12 Months, No Mortgage Payment. \nThat is right. We will give you the money to make your first 12 \npayments if you call in the next 7 days. We pay it for you.\n  Here is one from a company called Zoom Credit: Credit approval is \njust seconds away. Get on the fast track with Zoom Credit. At the speed \nof light, Zoom Credit will pre-approve you for a car loan, a home loan, \nrefinance, or a credit card. Even if your credit is in the tank, Zoom \nCredit is like money in the bank. Zoom Credit specializes in credit \nrepair, debt consolidation too. Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit. Who \ncares?\n  That is the advertisement from Zoom Credit.\n  Countrywide Financial, the largest mortgage lender in the country, \nhad this to say: Homeowners, do you want to refinance and get cash? \nCountrywide has a great reason to do it now. A no cost refinance. It \nhas no points, no application fees, no credit reporting and no third-\nparty fees. No title, no escrow, no appraisal fees. Absolutely no \nclosing costs. So you wind up with a lot more cash.\n  Now the advertisements that say: Have you been bankrupt? Have you \nbeen missing payments? Do you have bad credit? Come to us. Do those \nadvertisements say something to us about fundamentally bad business? It \ndoes to me.\n  Let me tell you what Countrywide Financial was doing. It is not just \nCountrywide; I am using it as an example. They began to offer hybrid \nmortgage loans. They offered loans where you paid interest only. You \nget a loan on your home, a new mortgage, and you pay no principal. You \njust pay interest only, and layer your principal in later at the end of \nthe mortgage.\n  Well, that was not enough. They decided: Well, we will do a payment \noption adjustable rate mortgage. That allows the borrower to pay only a \nportion of the interest and none of the principal, and the portion they \ndid not pay gets added to the back of the mortgage.\n  So you advertise, and you say: You know what, you have got bad \ncredit, you have been bankrupt, you are a slow pay, your credit rating \nis in the tank, tell you what, we will give you a subprime loan. Do you \nknow what? We will give you a loan at 2 percent. It will have to bounce \nup when it resets in a while, so you will have to pay a little\n\n[[Page S15964]]\n\nmore later, but we got this housing bubble going on, you know, bubbles \nnever burst. So buy this and flip it. If you cannot make the payment 2 \nyears from now when the interest rate resets, you can flip the house \nand make $30,000, $50,000, $100,000, do not worry, be happy.\n  In fact, some of this comes from cold calls to the home from brokers \nin some cases making $10,000 $20,000, $30,000 in fees, saying: What you \nneed is a new loan. It is a new loan that is going to have a 2-percent \ninterest rate. And, by the way, when we tell you what your monthly \npayment is going to be, we are not going to tell you that you have \nescrow payments on taxes and insurance. That will not be part of what \nwe tell you. So we will get you into this new mortgage loan, and we are \ngoing to have a prepayment penalty. You are locked into a circumstance \nwhere the rate is going to reset, and when it resets, you cannot pay it \noff early because you will have a big penalty. This from the largest \nmortgage lender in the country.\n  I don't know how one looks at this and understands the consequences \nof it for mortgage lenders that went hog-wild. They then gave people \nsubprime loans. It is called subprime because it doesn't quite measure \nup and has very unusual terms. What they do next with the subprime \nloans is they sell them quickly, and then they are securitized by \nperhaps a third party who sells them again, so they are sold in two or \nthree cases. It is like putting sausage together, the old story about \nhow sausage used to be made with sawdust. It is a filler used to make \nsausage. You get a container--in most cases the intestine--you fill it \nup with a little meat and sawdust, and then you slice it. That is what \nthey did with these mortgages. They took some subprime, they took some \nothers, they diced them, spliced them, securitized them, sold them two \nor three times.\n  Now we have a circumstance where a financial institution in France \nhas a massive problem because they are holding securities they didn't \nknow existed with subprime loans that were sliced and diced. What is \nthe incentive for the investor to buy these? The investor is greedy. \nThe broker is greedy. The mortgage lender is greedy. The investor who \nwants to buy these sliced-and-diced pieces of mortgage sausages is \ngoing to get a higher return because you have to reset the interest \nrate. That is going to jack rates way up, which means you get a higher \nreturn as an investor. Guess what. The center pole of the tent \ncollapses, and everybody is standing around wondering what on Earth \nhappened.\n  What happened was an unbelievable system filled with greed by \neveryone who should have known better, starting with television \nadvertising that said, ``Get a loan from us even if you are in \nbankruptcy because we are interested in helping you out, even if you \nhave bad credit,'' starting with that and ending on the other side with \nsophisticated investment banks and rating organizations believing they \ncan buy these pieces of mortgage sausage that, at its fundamental, \nnever added up, and they believe they can show big profits on their \nbooks. The result is now we see CEOs of some very large corporations \nwho are not only losing jobs, but the corporations are taking writeoffs \nof $8 billion, $10 billion. This is going to be a casebook study of bad \nbusiness in all business schools at some point.\n  The question is, How does it happen that all of this occurs outside \nof the view of regulators or outside of the concern of regulators? \nWhere was the Federal Reserve Board when all of this happened? Where \nwas Alan Greenspan? He was walking around scratching his head, worried \nthat we were going to pay down the debt too rapidly in the first part \nof this decade. He was the enabler for George Bush for deciding that \neven though we don't have a fiscal policy that has yet produced 10 \nyears of surplus--we had a surplus when President Bush took over, but \nthe prediction was for the next 10 years--even though we didn't yet \nhave that, he had an enabler in Alan Greenspan walking around \nscratching his head, trying to figure out how he could sell the Bush \npolicy by saying: I am really worried we are going to pay down the debt \ntoo quickly and it will have an adverse impact on the economy. He, more \nthan anybody, gave a green light to a bad fiscal policy. Even as that \nwas occurring, he apparently was looking the other way in a determined \nmanner as all of this was happening under his nose. It is the Federal \nReserve Board, yes, but it is also other regulators as well who should \nhave been involved. If ever there is a lesson that you need effective \nregulatory capability in a government, it ought to be now.\n  I was watching a wonderful series about the Presidency. It is \ndocumentaries about most of America's more recent Presidents during the \nlast century. One of them was about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, \nsomething he did during the 1930s that was unbelievably controversial. \nDuring the 1930s, he decided banks should be regulated. He did that for \na good reason. He decided there should be regulation of banks. He was \nexcoriated by American business and by banks. What on Earth are you \ntalking about? Why should banks be regulated?\n  The question is, What happened to effective regulation that began to \nbe created over some decades to protect the public interest, when we \nnow see in the year 2007 this kind of behavior, a subprime mortgage \ncrisis that at its roots is devoid of common business sense? Yet it \nhappened, and the smartest guys in the room--to describe the title of a \nmovie dealing with Enron--apparently were the ones who constructed it. \nNow we all pay the price.\n  Warren Buffett, one of the wonderful business leaders in this \ncountry, says: Every bubble will burst. Part of the housing bubble was \ncreated by subprime loans and by all of these folks deciding: We are \ngoing to get all these mortgage instruments out there, even if they are \nnot sound fundamentally. That helped exacerbate the bubble. The plain \nfact is, the bubble was destined to burst. Then what happened? What \nhappened is what we see now--substantial financial chaos, some \ncompanies running, trying to figure out what happened, and we have a \nlot of victims.\n  George Will suggests that nobody is a victim who got a home loan. I \nbeg to differ. The fact is, those who were getting cold calls from \nfast-talking mortgage brokers trying to put them in a mortgage they \ndidn't quite understand and could not afford, those folks have been \nvictimized. I don't pretend to know all the solutions, but I know the \nstart of a solution is to decide, No. 1, you can't be peddling this \nkind of thing. We have seen it before in other decades. It almost \nalways leads to collapse and chaos. Second, you can't effectively \nfunction in a financial system such as ours unless you have some \nregulatory capability.\n  I had recently written a piece about a new financing system that has \nemerged in our country and around the world--but especially it is \ndeveloping here--that represents the dark side of money. It is the \nequivalent of the dark matter in the universe, the dark money that \nexists that is outside of the sight of anybody. When you take a look at \nwhat is happening with respect to hedge funds and derivatives, a whole \nseries of things happening in our financial system that are outside of \nthe regulatory capability or even the sight of regulators.\n  I gave a speech talking about where the price of oil is. One of the \nsenior analysts of Oppenheimer says there is no reason that it ought to \nbe 5 cents above $55 for a barrel of oil. There is no justification for \nthe price of oil being a nickle above $55 a barrel. It is above $55 a \nbarrel because the futures market for oil has become an orgy for \nspeculation. We have hedge funds deep in the futures market for oil. We \nhave investment banks in the futures market for oil. There are reports \nthat some investment banks are actually buying storage facilities so \nthey can actually take the supply off the existing inventory, put it in \nstorage, and wait until the price goes up. There is so much going on in \nthis country's financial system that desperately needs the capability \nfor regulators to understand what is happening and take effective \naction to respond to it.\n  Mr. WEBB. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WEBB. If I may, this Senator came to the floor on other business, \nbut I followed the Senator's comments with some fascination and \ngratitude, quite frankly. I admire the Senator for coming down here \nweek after week and addressing issues that in many cases are conceptual \nissues that don't usually get the time for consideration in\n\n[[Page S15965]]\n\nthis body. One of the events that came to my mind when the Senator was \ntalking about Franklin Roosevelt's administration and his willingness \nto regulate banks--and we have seen such a push of late against any \nsort of Government regulation--was when Andrew Jackson vetoed the \ncharter for the second national bank, which was an act that Historian \nVernon Louis Parrington termed ``the most courageous political act in \nAmerican history.'' Andrew Jackson did it for exactly the same reasons \nas the Senator from North Dakota is stating. What Andrew Jackson said \nat that time was that if the charter of the second national bank came \ninto place, it would have created and perpetuated an unbridled \naristocracy in the United States. It would have allowed the \ncontinuation of aristocracy in a nation that was supposed to be a \ndemocracy.\n  I particularly associate myself with the remarks of the Senator when \nit comes to the verticalization of our communications industry. You can \nlook back in history. Whenever authoritarianism takes hold of a nation, \nthey do it through three entities. They take out the ability of people \nto worship. They attempt to decimate the family, and they go after the \nability of people to speak freely. In some cases, this verticalization, \nit can be argued, is simply economic. But certainly in a lot of areas, \nwhen you have this verticalization of ownership from film to TV to \nlocal TV stations to newspapers, it can affect people's access to \ninformation. It can affect people's ability to make reasoned judgments.\n  I wanted to interrupt the Senator for a few minutes to state my \nappreciation for his coming to the floor week after week and making \nthese points. I will be very strongly desirous of working with him on \nboth of those issues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. He said something about a year ago that I have long \nremembered because it is something I have been concerned about. He was \ntalking about the economy and about concentration in the economy. It \nrelates to what I was describing about big companies and the media. \nSenator Webb talked about the fact that we have reached a point now \nwhere the average CEO in America makes 400 times what the average \nworker makes.\n  I was doing some writing the other night about this issue. I talked \nabout hedge funds a few moments ago and their role in the subprime \nmortgage scandal. I was talking about what hedge fund managers are \nearning. From a recent Alpha Magazine report on compensation--the hedge \nfund manager who earned the most last year made $1.7 billion. James \nSimons did that. And $1.7 billion means he makes in 1 hour what the \naverage worker makes in a year, but he makes it every hour. The point I \nam making about this is the skewed nature of this economic system of \nours and what is happening in it.\n  My colleague will know that in recent days we have had a debate with \nPresident Bush about who the big spenders are and so on. The biggest \nspender by far has been President Bush. He has sent us budgets that \nrepresented the highest amount of spending and the biggest deficits we \nhave had for a long time. When we tried to pay for some things, we \nsaid: Let's do certain things and pay for them. The President said: Not \non your life. We will not allow you to pay for these things.\n  Here are the things we wanted to do to pay for some of those things, \nsome things that were worthy--for example, extending incentives for \nrenewable energy and so on. We said: Those people, including hedge fund \nmanagers, who are making a lot of money and are paying a 15-percent \nincome tax rate, which is a lower rate than the receptionist in the \noffice down the street is paid, they should be paying an income rate \nlike all Americans. The President said: Not on your life.\n  We described in a picture what is happening. We said: We want to shut \ndown tax scams that allow Wachovia to buy a sewer system in Germany, \nnot because they have expertise in German sewers; they want to buy the \nassets of a German sewer system so they can write off hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in taxes they would otherwise owe this country. The \nPresident said: No, you can't be doing that. That is a tax increase.\n  From David Evans, a really great reporter, I got a picture of this \nbuilding, the Ugland House, some while ago. This is a 5-story white \nhouse in the Cayman Islands, home to 12,748 corporations. Are they \nthere? No, it is a legal fiction. Lawyers have put them there legally \nso they can avoid paying U.S. taxes. The President doesn't want to shut \nthose things down. He said: No, if you shut this sort of thing down, we \ncall it a tax increase, even as the President is protecting these \nunbelievable opportunities for the wealthiest to avoid paying taxes, at \na time when the debt is increasing dramatically.\n  Here is what the President has done since the year 2002. He sent us \nemergency requests, none of it paid for, and said: I want it all added \nto the Federal debt. In 2002, he said: I want $50 billion. In 2003: I \nwant $76 billion. I don't want to pay for any of it. Add it right to \nthe debt. I am sending soldiers to Iraq and Afghanistan. When they come \nback, they can pay for the debt. In 2004: I want $87 billion. In 2005: \nI want $82 billion. In 2006: I want $92 billion. It is all emergency \nmoney outside the budget, all added to the Federal debt. In 2007: I \nwant $103 billion. And in 2008: I want $196 billion.\n\n  He has asked for over two-thirds of a trillion dollars and wanted to \ncharge it all to future generations, and he has gotten by with it. Then \nhe sits in the Oval Office and says: Well, I am the fiscal \nconservative. I do not think so. I grew up in a small town. I \nunderstood what a Republican was. They are an important part of this \npolitical system. The one thing you could count on from real \nRepublicans is they believed you ought to balance budgets. It is what \nit was in my hometown. It is what it used to be in this Chamber.\n  Now, that new brand is: Let's spend money, and let's add it to the \nFederal debt. This is not some Democrat that is doing this; this is \nPresident George W. Bush asking for over two-thirds of a trillion \ndollars and asking that none of it be paid for. We will send soldiers \nto war, but we will not have the courage to ask the American people to \nhelp pay the bill.\n  In recent days and weeks, we have been treated to quite a sideshow of \nthis administration describing their view of fiscal responsibility. \nThey have said the Senate wants to spend $22 billion more than the \nPresident in this year on things such as health, education, taking care \nof sick kids, improving America's classrooms, energy--a whole series of \nthings--weather assistance, home heating fuel in the winter. For all of \nthese things, the President says no. He says: You want to spend more \nthan I do here at home, so you are big spenders. You are $22 billion \nover my number. And, oh, by the way, I am $196 billion over your \nnumber. He says: I want that, and I don't want any of it paid for.\n  I think it is long past the time to start taking care of a few things \nat home, and I think there is a right and a wrong way to do it. It is \ntime we pay for that which we spend, and there are plenty of ways to do \nit. If we have the richest people in the country paying 15 percent tax \nrates, I think they ought to pay what others pay.\n  As I said, the second richest man in the world, Warren Buffett, is a \nremarkable businessman and an interesting guy and somebody I have had \nthe opportunity to know over the years. He said he did a little test in \nhis office in Omaha, NE. I think he said there were 30 or 40 people who \nworked in that central office. He checked--with the cooperation of his \nemployees--to find out what their effective tax rate was. Guess what. \nThe lowest effective tax rate in his office was Warren Buffett's. And \nhe said, to his credit: That is just wrong. Why should I pay a lower \ntax rate than the receptionist in my office? This is from the world's \nsecond richest man.\n  Very few in that stratosphere in income will take that position. Most \nof them are spending a lot of money to try to preserve what they have: \na 15-percent tax rate. In many cases, the top hedge fund managers in \nthis country are paying the 15-percent tax rate on massive earnings, \nand they have this President in the White House trying to do everything \nhe can--and so far successfully--preventing those of us in the Congress \nwho want to say to the wealthiest Americans: Pay the tax rate that the \nrest of us pay, that everybody else pays.\n\n[[Page S15966]]\n\n  The point I wanted to make, very simply, is this: The President has \nmade a big cause in recent weeks about being a fiscal conservative. \nThere is nothing fiscally conservative about an administration that \ntook a very large budget surplus and turned it into very large budget \ndeficits. There is nothing conservative about protecting tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest Americans. There is nothing conservative about proposing \ntwo-thirds of a trillion dollars of spending and wanting to add it to \nthe Federal debt. That is not conservatism. That is reckless fiscal \npolicy and one that ought to change.\n  One final point: The President, today, is signing an energy bill. We \nwrote an energy bill, and it is a good bill. It comes up short in two \nareas. We should have increased renewable energy provision in it that \nrequires that all electricity produced in this country should be \nproduced with 15 percent from renewable resources. That ought to be in \nthe bill. It is not in the bill that passed.\n  Second, we ought to have had the extenders, extending the production \ntax credit and other incentives for the renewables and other sources of \nenergy in order to make sure we are going to continue to push on \nrenewable energy incentives.\n  But having said that--we did not get that because of the President \nand his supporters--having said that, here is what we did get: We got \nan energy bill that, for the first time in 32 years, requires Detroit \nand the auto companies to make automobiles that have better gas \nmileage, 10 miles to the gallon in 10 years, beginning in the year \n2011. That is a significant change. I am proud to have been a part of \ncausing that change. I was the principal author of a legislative \ninitiative supported by SAFE, Securing America's Future Energy. That \ncalled for the increase in reformed CAFE standards. It called for a \nsubstantial increase in renewable fuels, which we have done by a 36-\nbillion-gallon renewable fuels standard to be achieved by 2022.\n  We have a title that is very good dealing with conservation and \nefficiency of virtually everything we use in this country today. We get \nup in the morning, we turn on a switch, and then we turn on a key. We \nsee light, and we start the car. We don't think much about energy, but \nit is central to our lives.\n  We are so unbelievably dependent on foreign sources of energy. Sixty \npercent of the oil we use comes from outside our country, much of it \nfrom troubled parts of our world. We have to change that.\n\n  I am proud of the bill we have passed in this Congress. It is a \nsignificant accomplishment. We need to come back next year, and do the \nrenewable energy piece, saying every kilowatt of electricity produced \nin the country should have 15 percent renewable. We can take energy \nright from the wind, and we can extend America's energy supply with \nrenewable energy.\n  I think while there are a lot of reasons we did not make as much \nheadway as we would have liked in this Congress--we are, after all, \nonly 51-49 in the Senate and about the same percentage in the U.S. \nHouse and a President who has a veto pen. Despite all of that, for the \nfirst time in nine years we increased the minimum wage. Those folks \nworking at the bottom of the economic ladder--the ones who work two \njobs, sometimes three jobs. I believe in 60 percent of the cases, it is \na woman trying to make ends meet, often trying to raise a family--for \nthe first time in 9 years, we increased the minimum wage to say to \nthem: You matter as well. You are at the bottom of the ladder, but \nthere are ways we can help you. And an increase to the minimum wage is \na significant accomplishment.\n  We passed a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and that was \nsignificant. We increased Pell grants and student loans. We did some \nimportant things in Congress. We passed an energy bill at the end.\n  Would we have wished we could have done more? Sure. But the fact is, \nwith this President in the White House, we were not able to get all the \nthings we wanted to get done. But we will. The future is about change. \nThe agenda that we care so much about is about change, about pivoting \nand beginning to take care of things in this country that have long \nbeen neglected.\n  Having said all of that, I feel optimistic. I like what we have done. \nI know this is a time that is very frustrating for the American people \nfor a lot of reasons: the war in Iraq, the subprime loan scandal, the \nmassive scandal of waste, fraud, and abuse in contracting for the war \nin Iraq and Hurricane Katrina, the most significant waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the history of this country.\n  I know why people are upset. They are upset about jobs going \noverseas, trade policies that, in my judgment, are bankrupt in terms of \nstanding up for this country's interests. But the fact is, all of those \nthings are things we can change. Step by step, we can make these \nchanges. That is why I feel optimistic.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15966-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15966-S15968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, anytime I am home in Oregon or have a \nchance to travel around the country, when I hear citizens talk about \nGovernment, they zero in on one word above all else. That word is \n``change.'' Americans want change in our foreign policy. Americans want \nchange in our energy policy. And above all, Americans want change in \nour health care policy at home.\n  So this afternoon I am going to spend just a few minutes talking \nabout some of the most urgently needed changes in American health care, \nand then how the Congress can go about setting those changes in place.\n  Above all else, Americans want changes in health care costs so as to \nhold down these staggering expenses. This country is going to spend \n$2.3 trillion this year on health care. There are 300 million of us. If \nyou divide 300 million into $2.3 trillion, you could go out and hire a \nphysician for every seven families in the United States. That is how \nstaggering the health care costs are in this country. You could \nliterally go out and hire a physician for every seven families in the \nUnited States, pay that doctor $200,000 for the year, and say: Doctor, \nyour job for the year will be to take care of seven families.\n  In fact, I know the Presiding Officer has a great interest in health \ncare as well. Whenever I bring this up at a townhall meeting, and \nphysicians are in the room, they usually say: Where do I go, Ron, to \nget my seven families? Because they think it sounds pretty good to \nchange the American health care system so they can do what they were \ntrained to do, which is, to be advocates for people, to stand up for \ntheir patients, to make sure they get the best shake for American \nhealth care.\n  Certainly, employers want changes to hold down the costs of health \ncare. Today, if you are opening a business in Coos Bay, OR, or Stowe, \nVT, you are competing in the global marketplace. You essentially spot \nyour foreign competition something like 20 points the day you open your \ndoors in Vermont or Oregon or anywhere else. That is because your \npremiums go up 13, 14, 15 percent a year, and your foreign competition \nbenefits from national health insurance. So that is what these crushing \ncosts mean for the business community.\n\n  If you are lucky enough to have health insurance in our country--and \nbecause the costs are going up so high--you are literally one rate hike \naway from going without coverage.\n  One of the reasons the costs hit people with insurance so hard is \nthat today in America, if you have coverage, you also pick up the bills \nfor those who don't have coverage. I am sure the distinguished \nPresiding Officer of the Senate hears the same thing I do at home. \nSomebody who has coverage, for example, is in a hospital and looks at \nthe expenses and the bill and it says something like Tylenol, $60. A \ncitizen comes to one of us at a townhall meeting and says to us: What \ndo you mean Tylenol costs $60? I could have gone to CVS or to some \nother pharmacy and I could have gotten Tylenol for $20. Why did it cost \nme that much? The reason it costs that much\n\n[[Page S15967]]\n\nfor somebody who has insurance is there are a lot of people in the \nhospital who don't have coverage and they couldn't pay for their \nTylenol, so the cost gets shifted over to the people who are insured.\n  So first and foremost, when it comes to changes in health care, we \nneed changes that rein in these staggering costs--costs that are going \nup far beyond what cost increases are elsewhere in the world.\n  The second area that is so critical to change in American health care \nis lowering the administrative costs in American health care. We have \nhigher administrative costs than any other country on Earth. Once \nagain, you see it at home and in your State when physicians and others \ncome to you. In my home State, in a typical doctor's office with a few \nphysicians, there is one person who will spend the entire day on the \nphone essentially trying to pry out information from insurance \ncompanies as to what they will pay on one claim or another. These are \nclerks trying to get information about an insurance company matrix, \ntrying to figure out what will be spent because this country still \nlacks a uniform billing system because there are so many differing \nsystems of paperwork and charges. This country's staggering \nadministrative costs are an area that desperately needs to be changed \nin American health care.\n  Most other parts of the country have simplified their record-keeping \nand their administrative costs. They use electronic record systems. \nToday, for example, the typical doctor's office has less technology to \nhold down administrative costs than the corner grocery store. So second \non my list of changes to American health care are steps that would be \ntaken to slow and reverse the crushing increase in administrative \ncosts, hassle for doctors, and needless time and heartache that go into \nadministering American health care.\n  The third area of change--something I know the Presiding Officer \nfeels very strongly about--is moving health care to prevention and \nwellness rather than sick care. The fact of the matter is that in the \nUnited States we don't have health care at all. What we have is sick \ncare. The Medicare Program shows this more clearly than anything else. \nMedicare Part A, for example, will pay huge checks for a senior \ncitizen's hospital bills. The check goes from the insurance carrier to \na hospital in Vermont or Oregon or anywhere else--no questions asked. \nMedicare Part B, on the other hand, the outpatient portion of Medicare, \nwill pay virtually nothing for prevention--virtually nothing to keep \npeople well, to keep them healthy, and to keep them from landing in the \nhospital and racking up all those huge hospital expenses under Part A. \nThat is a bizarre way, in my view, to run the Medicare Program. In \nfact, the Medicare Program, which is so biased in favor of sick care \nrather than wellness and prevention, runs the biggest outpatient \nprogram in the country that offers no rewards for, for example, \nlowering your blood pressure, lowering your cholesterol, stopping \nsmoking. The biggest outpatient program in the United States is Part B \nof Medicare. Available to more than 30 million older people in our \ncountry, it is the biggest outpatient program that offers no rewards \nfor sensible prevention. We have to change this bias. We can look at \nthe problem in this country of childhood obesity and the onset of type \n2 diabetes. If we don't focus on prevention, wellness, and keeping our \ncitizens healthy, we will see these continued increases in the costs of \nchronic care later in life, when heart disease, stroke, diabetes set in \nand our country racks up still additional health care costs because \nthere has been no focus on prevention.\n  Finally, it seems to me there has to be a much sharper focus on \nimproving quality in American health care. When people talk about \nchanging health care, they usually focus first on costs and that is why \nI brought it up initially. But they also want to make sure they get \nbetter quality care. Right now, with citizens reading reports, for \nexample, from the Institute of Medicine--about thousands and thousands \nof needless deaths, hospital deaths, other deaths--it is obvious that \nsteps need to be taken to improve the quality of our health care. Some \nof them are steps that certainly sound fairly simple: Better infection \ncontrol in our health care facilities, making sure sensible steps are \ntaken after an individual has a heart attack. Clearly, there needs to \nbe more focus on early diagnosis of illness, which I think is part of a \ncontinuum of better quality care that starts with prevention and zeroes \nin on early diagnosis. But those are some of the areas I think need to \nbe changed.\n  The reality is the reason for all these changes and the reason why \nthe country wants them is the health care system hasn't much kept up \nwith the times. For more than 150 million people, the employer-based \nsystem is pretty much what we had in the 1940s. I talked earlier, for \nexample, about the crushing toll it takes on employers, where they spot \ntheir foreign competition 18, 20 points the day they open their doors. \nBut let's think about what it means for individuals.\n  Right now, I can tell my colleagues a lot of individuals are very \nconcerned, as they see their employer hit with these crushing costs and \nthat every year their package will be skinnied down. There will be more \ncopayments and fewer services, and a lot of them are very worried about \nwhether their employer will be able to offer coverage at all. A lot of \nindividuals come to me at townhall meetings and say: Ron, I am 56, 57. \nI am not sure my employer is going to be able to hold onto our coverage \nat work, and what will I do if I lose coverage at work and I am not yet \neligible for Medicare. This, of course, would mean they might be \nwithout coverage between 57, 58, and 65. You can't be without health \ncare coverage, as the Presiding Officer knows so well, for 7 or 8 \nyears.\n\n  So the individual who has coverage at work is worried about the \ntrends, and in a lot of instances, that worker feels job-locked. They \nwould like, for example, to look at another position, say another \nposition that paid more, but they can't do that because they fear if \nthey gave up their current position, they would go into the marketplace \nand they would be uninsurable. They might have an illness. They might \nhave had a previous health problem. They know what goes on in much of \nthe marketplace--that there is a lot of insurance company cherry-\npicking and that the insurance companies screen out people who have \nthese health problems and try to send them over to Government programs. \nSo a lot of our citizens feel job-locked and unable to move. It is why \nI think one of the most important changes that is needed in American \nhealth care is to modernize the employer-employee system. Because what \nwe have today in 2007 isn't all that different from what we have had \nsince 1947. My view is that will be one of the most important changes \nthe country needs to look at in American health care.\n  Finally, let me touch on the other side of the prevention coin in \nAmerican health care. If we don't make changes and improve our system \nof health care prevention, what is surely going to happen is we will \nface increased costs for chronic health needs in America. Already, the \nevidence shows something like 6 percent of the Medicare population \nconsumes 60 percent of the overall Medicare bill. These are the people \nwho have problems with heart and stroke and diabetes--and the costs of \nchronic care go up and up and up. A modern health care system, one we \nought to be looking at going to in the future, would put a better focus \non chronic care management. So when you have an individual, for \nexample, with several of these conditions, there is an effort among \nphysicians and others to coordinate care. One of the best ways to do \nthat is to have something which has come to be known as a health care \nhome, where, in effect, an individual--a patient--can designate one \nperson to coordinate their care when they have these multiple kinds of \nproblems. But talk about the need for change: The Government does \nvirtually nothing to promote the chronic care management which I have \ndescribed and have had a chance to talk about with the Senator from \nVermont.\n  So we are going to have a chance to go home now for a few weeks and \ngo to the townhall meetings and the Chamber of Commerce lunches and the \nservice clubs. We are going to hear citizens talk about their hunger \nfor change in a lot of areas: foreign policy, energy policy, education \npolicy--a variety of areas. I think what they are going to\n\n[[Page S15968]]\n\ntalk about when it comes to addressing their concerns here at home is \nthe need for change in health care policy in America. They are going to \ntalk about what is going to be done to contain the costs, what is going \nto be done to reduce some of the mindless paperwork, how we can put \nmore focus on prevention and wellness, make better use of health care \ntechnology, and offer sensible policies that reward the coordination of \nmanaging cases for individuals with chronic conditions. These are the \nkey areas they talk about. It all comes down to a health care system \nthat doesn't work very well for them, No. 1. The issue becomes how can \nit be that a country such as ours--the richest country on Earth, with \nall these wonderful doctors and hospitals--cannot figure out how to \nmeet the health care needs of our people.\n  I believe we know what needs to be done. I have tried to outline a \nnumber of these key areas. As the Senator from Vermont knows, I have \noffered legislation with Senator Bennett of Utah--we have 13 cosponsors \non a bipartisan bill--that addresses these kinds of concerns. But now, \nwhen we are home and we have a chance to listen to folks, I think we \nwill have a chance also to talk about real priorities for our country, \nthe changes that are needed. We need to especially talk about the \nchanges that are needed in American health care so this country can end \nthe disgrace that we are the only Western industrialized Nation that \nhasn't been able to figure out how to get basic, essential health care \nfor all our citizens. We are up to it. It is now a question of \npolitical will and our willingness to embrace change.\n  I have appreciated the chance this afternoon to outline some of the \nmost important changes that are needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15968-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15968-S15969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, later today, Senator Schumer will bring up \nthe Criminal Background Check Improvement Act, which is an important \npiece of legislation. When this bill was originally hotlined, we asked \nthat it be held so that we could discuss the improvements to the bill.\n  This bill came out of the tragedy at Virginia Tech. It is important \nthat the American people understand that what we are changing in this \nbill would not have prevented what happened at Virginia Tech. What \nhappened to the individuals there was because the law we have on the \nbooks was not followed by the State of Virginia. They recognized that \nshortly thereafter and have made corrective action to it.\n  What is also important to note is that under the previous legislation \nwe have had, over $400 million a year was authorized to help the States \nimplement the programs so that somebody who is truly a danger to \nthemselves or others or has been admitted to a mental institution and \nconsidered mentally defective--that is a term of the bureaucracy--is \nnot allowed to purchase a gun. We all agree to that in this country. So \nwhen you don't follow the law, the laws don't work. Consequently, the \nfamilies are suffering great grief at this time because the law wasn't \nfollowed.\n  Too often, the first reaction of Congress is to hurry up and pass a \nbill. There are and have been in this bill some good ideas. But there \nwere some bad ideas. The idea of holding the bill to be able to work \nwith those who are offering the bill to get improvements has come \nabout. The principle is this: As we protect people from the dangers of \nweapons by withholding both criminals and those people who constitute a \nthreat to themselves and others, we can't do that if we are going to \nstep on the rights of those who have a right and who are not in that \ncategory.\n  I wish to take a moment to thank Senator Schumer for his hard work \nand Elliot of his staff for his hard work and to recognize my staff, \nJane Treat and Brooke Bacak and others on my staff who worked through \nthe last couple of months to improve this bill. We have come out to \nmake sure those people, veterans in this country who go out and defend, \nwith their lives, bodies, and their futures, our rights, aren't \ninappropriately losing their rights under this legislation.\n  It is interesting for the American people to know that at this time, \nif you are a veteran and you come home with a closed head injury and \nyou resolve that, then, in fact, by the time you wake up and recover \nover a year or 2-year period, you will have lost all your rights to \nbear an arm to be able to go hunting, to be able to skeet shoot, to be \nable to hunt with your grandchildren, without any notification \nwhatsoever that you have lost that right. That is the present law. That \nis what is happening.\n  We have 140,000 veterans with no history of mental deficiency, no \nhistory of being dangerous to themselves or others, who have lost, \nwithout notice, their right to go hunting, to skeet shoot, to have that \nkind of outing in this wonderful country of ours in a legal, protected \nsense. What this bill does is it attempts to address that by giving \nthem an opportunity for relief. It mandates that, first of all, they \nare notified if that happens to them so that they know they are losing \ntheir rights. What a tragedy it would be if a veteran who lost his \nrights but doesn't know it becomes incarcerated under a felony for \nhunting with his grandson because it is illegal for him to own, handle, \nor transmit a weapon? That is not what we intended to do in this \nCongress some 10 years ago. Yet that is the real effect of what is \nhappening.\n  Consequently, we are at a point now where we have agreed with the \nfact that we want to make sure--and we want to put the resources \nthrough this authorization--it covers those who could be a danger to \nthemselves and others, and we are going to help the States implement \nthis law, the law on the books, by authorizing significant sums to do \nthis. It is not a new authorization; $400 million was authorized \nbefore, but the appropriators didn't appropriate it. They chose to make \na higher priority. The most ever appropriated under this, I think, was \n$23 million a year.\n  So, in fact, what we want to do now is say we mean it, which means \nwhen it comes to appropriations time, this authorization will have no \neffect unless, in fact, we appropriate the money to the States to carry \nout this notification system. It is something we can and must do. It \nshows that when we work together to solve the problems and protect the \nfuture and honor the Constitution, the rights under the Constitution, \nwe can do that if people of good faith and of good intent work together \nto solve that.\n  My compliments to Senator Schumer and his staff and Hendrik Van Der \nVaart on my staff for the hours and hours we have put in to make sure \nthis happened.\n  A couple other key points. Sometimes the bureaucracy delays whether \nor not you are on this list. So we have said that, at the end of the \nyear, if they can't decide, it is going to be adjudicated that you \ncannot have a gun and you will have to prove that you can. That is fair \nenough, provided we create the means with which you can recover the \ncost of that adjudication. So if, in fact, you get to Federal court and \nyou win your case that there is not anything wrong with you, the \nFederal Government is going to pay your lawyer's fees and return your \nrights--the rights given to everybody else in this country--return your \nwrongly denied rights back to you.\n\n  Therefore, we really, truly do give access to those who have been \ninjured under this law and, at the same time, protect the rest of the \nAmerican public from those who could be injured when we don't follow \nthe law.\n  I also pay tribute to Congresswoman McCarthy. I served with her in \nthe House. She has been dedicated to this issue for years. She suffered \na terrible tragedy herself at the hands of somebody who was obviously \nderanged. This will mark a milestone for one of the things she wanted \nto accomplish during her service in the Congress.\n  It is my hope that others will not hold this bill. It is my hope that \nwhen it comes appropriations time, the moneys that are necessary to put \nthe people who really are a danger to themselves and others on the \nnational criminal background check, that they will get there, and that \nthose who should not be there will not be there. So it is a balance, a \nbalance for protection, but it is also a balance to preserve rights, \nespecially for our veterans--the very people who continue to\n\n[[Page S15969]]\n\nprotect our rights. They are going to be preserved.\n  Myself and Senator Schumer sent a letter to the ATF asking them to \nreconsider some of the wording in their ruling because it puts people \nin there who should not be. We are hopeful that they recognize that, \nand that they, because of a bipartisan query, do a rulemaking process \nthat really directs this where it should be. When that happens, we will \nhave finished everything we need to do, except get the dollars \nappropriated to implement this act.\n  Again, my hat is off to Senator Schumer and those who have worked \ntirelessly to get this done. It is with great appreciation for the \nmanner in which it was handled, and it is my hope that we will pass \nthis on and see the great accomplishments of protecting people from \nthose who are a danger to themselves and others.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I see that the very able Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Schumer, is on the floor. May I ask if he wishes me to yield \nto him.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from West Virginia if \nhe might yield to me 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am glad to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my distinguished colleague \nand our great leader from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for yielding. \nUnfortunately, at the end of session, there are many needs that \nintercede.\n  We have just heard that the hold on a bill will be lifted. I want to \nget it moving so it can get over to the House before they leave. Once \nagain, the Senator from West Virginia is not only gracious and capable, \nbut he has been kind to me from the day I came to the Senate, and it is \nsomething I will always treasure. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15969-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15969-S15970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NICS IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Leahy-Schumer \nsubstitute to H.R. 2640, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. I \nhave just been told a hold which had been placed against this bill is \nabout to be lifted.\n  At its core, this bill does something that has been too long in \ncoming. It gets States critical resources they need to upgrade the \nmental health and conviction records they use to screen prospective gun \nbuyers.\n  These records go into the national instant criminal background check \nsystem, the NICS, that we rely on to screen for those who should not be \nallowed to buy guns. It has the support, I am proud to say, of both the \nBrady organization and the NRA. This was a collaboration that occurred \nover the last year.\n  I also thank my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, and my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, because both agreed last \nnight on final language.\n  Today, millions of criminal and mental health records are \ninaccessible to the NICS, mostly because State and local governments \nhave noncomputerized or outdated records. Furthermore, the process is \nspotty, as States are not required by law to turn over all pertinent \ninformation that could prohibit a person from buying a gun. As a \nresult, many people who simply should not have guns are allowed to \npurchase them.\n  This bill will address that problem. In a word, without affecting a \nsingle law-abiding citizen's gun rights, the bill will make America \nsafe.\n  I started working on this legislation a long time ago in 2002, along \nwith my colleague Representative Carolyn McCarthy. That was when on \nLong Island, in my State of New York, a gunman who was a paranoid \nschizophrenic slipped through the cracks of the system and bought a .22 \ncaliber semiautomatic rifle. He then took that gun, walked into a \nmorning service at Our Lady of Peace Church and gunned down its beloved \npriest and one of its most prized parishioners.\n  So Representatives Carolyn McCarthy, John Dingell, and I worked on \nlegislation to help improve the background check system. We wanted \nthen, as we do now, to make sure no more dangerous people are allowed \nto get guns.\n  Over the years, as it often does, the political process played out. \nIt would pass one House but not the other, and the bill was stalled.\n  As this has gone on, we have not stopped working and have kept alive \nthe faith this legislation would one day become law. Through it all, \nevery one of us hoped desperately that there would not be another \npreventable tragedy, another time when the system failed. But on April \n16, 2007, our deepest fears came true.\n  I do not need to recite the facts of what happened at Virginia Tech. \nEvery one of us is aware of the unspeakable horror that took place on \nthe campus last April. We can never know if we could have prevented the \nshootings. What we do know, however, is that a very dangerous \nindividual with a history of mental illness was allowed to buy two \nhandguns.\n  It is a shame that we are again called to act on this 5-year-old \nlegislation in the face of tragedy. But now is Congress's moment to \ntake a huge step toward fixing a broken system.\n  The House passed a bill on June 13, 2007. Around the same time, \nChairman Leahy and I began work on a similar bill. As I said before, I \nthank Chairman Leahy for his leadership in recognizing the importance \nof this issue. We attempted to pass the bill by unanimous consent. \nSenator Coburn, as was his right as a Member of the body, held the bill \nbased on concerns he had.\n  Rather than try to go around our colleague, we worked with him. And I \nmust say, from the beginning, Senator Coburn acted professionally, \nrespectfully, and in good faith.\n  When it comes to guns, I do not agree with Tom Coburn on much, but he \nand I sat down at length and worked through our differences on this \nbill. I can say with full confidence, this bill is something on which \nboth of us can agree.\n  At the heart of the concerns of my friend from Oklahoma were fears \nthe bill, as originally drafted, could have the unintended consequence \nof jeopardizing the rights of law-abiding veterans.\n  This not being a gun control bill, and it has never been our intent \nto jeopardize the rights of lawful citizens and veterans, we have made \nchanges to address our colleague's concern, and he told me he will lift \nhis hold as a result.\n  Remember, I was an original sponsor of the Brady bill. I care about \nseeing the background check process work the right way. I will not \nsupport legislation I believe will hurt the system. But today we have a \ngreat accomplishment. It is fitting that at the end of this session we \nare there, proud of the bipartisan process. Chairman Leahy, Senator \nCoburn, Senator Kennedy, and I came up with a solution last night at \nabout 11 p.m. on the floor. Senators Coburn and Kennedy shook hands, as \nI watched, and we have come to an agreement. Through all this \nnegotiation, this bill has the backing of both the Brady Campaign to \nStop Gun Violence and the National Rifle Association.\n\n  So now the hard work is done. We must pass this legislation. We must \nget it back to the House for them to pass again before they adjourn, \nand then we must get it on the President's desk to be signed into law. \nThe parents of Virginia Tech families and millions of other Americans, \nincluding those at Our Lady of Peace congregation on Long Island are \nwaiting for this moment. We have waited a long time. As citizens and \nparents, we must do everything to see that we do not have another Our \nLady of Peace shooting or another Virginia Tech shooting. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the legislation.\n  I will say again this is an example of how the system should work, \nand in a few moments I will be asking unanimous consent to move the \nbill forward, but before doing so, I yield my time to my colleague from \nWest Virginia, because they are doing the paperwork, and I thank my \ncolleague from West\n\n[[Page S15970]]\n\nVirginia for his courtesy and his kindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu).

Madam President, soon the Senate will recess for Christmas. \nMembers will travel home to their families and to their States to share \nin Christmas parades and tree lightings, Christmas cantatas, and \nfestivals of lights. They will decorate their own trees and attend the \nChristmas season celebrations in their own churches. Some will make \ntrips to Iraq or Afghanistan, while others will comfort people who are \nstruggling to recover from wildfires or the recent devastating snow and \nice storms that have left so many homeless and without power. I join in \nthe prayers for their swift recoveries, and I rejoice in the fellowship \nand the support that are flowing to Americans in need all across the \nNation and all around the world. That fellowship and that support is \nthe true spirit of the Christmas season.\n\n     Everywhere, everywhere, Christmas tonight!\n     Christmas in lands of the fir-tree and pine,\n     Christmas in lands of the palm-tree and vine,\n     Christmas where snow peaks solemn and white,\n     Christmas where cornfields stand sunny and bright.\n     Christmas where children are hopeful and gay,\n     Christmas where old men [like I] are patient and gray,\n     Christmas, where peace, like a dove in its flight,\n     Broods o'er brave men in the thick of the fight;\n     Everywhere, everywhere, Christmas tonight!\n     For the Christ-child who comes is the Master of all;\n     No palace too great, no cottage too small.\n\n  Christmas is a special time, no matter where the season finds us. \nSomehow, Christmas lights create their special magic, whether they are \nhung on snow-laden pine trees or wrapped around stately palm trees. \nChristmas carols never fail to bring a nostalgic glow, as they bring to \nmind our childhood celebrations. The smells and fragrances of Christmas \nrecall their own delightful memories--the tang of pine boughs brought \nindoors, the spicy warmth of cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and mace, the \nlicorice scent of anise, the exotic aroma of nutmeg. Christmas baking \nis one of the best parts of the holiday--Erma always looked forward to \nthat part. Christmas baking is one of the best parts of the holiday, \nshe would say--as the house fills with mouth-watering aromas. My own \nchildhood Christmases were spare, not lavish, but they were full of \nlove, given to me by a wonderful old couple who have gone on now to \nmeet their reward in heaven.\n  Today's Christmases should be full of special food and lots of music, \nand if it were like it used to be, it would be played by me, that music \nwould be, on my fiddle, to entertain my mom and dad, their friends and \ntheir borders. My mom ran a boarding house. We never had very much at \nChristmas, not much compared to some of the extravagant gifts \nadvertised these days, but our simple celebrations left us more time to \nenjoy some company or the church services or read a Christmas story \ntogether.\n  Every family, every town builds its own Christmas traditions. Some \nfamilies visit or host Christmas open houses. Other families gather for \na traditional Christmas meal. In some towns, people bundle up to watch \nfloats go by in the annual Christmas parade, followed by a tree \nlighting ceremony. We have done that in the Nation's capital. I myself \nhave lit the tree. There are Christmas tree lighting ceremonies at the \nWhite House and on Capitol Hill. At Arlington Cemetery and at other \nveterans cemeteries around the Nation, the simple act of a single man \nhas grown into a Wreaths Across America, an effort to put fresh wreaths \non the graves of veterans across the Nation, honoring those who will \nnever be home again for Christmas. Other volunteer efforts send living \nChristmas trees to the troops overseas so they, too--our troops, your \ntroops, my troops; our soldiers, sailors, and our airmen--can share in \nthe Christmas season. In the busy press of family traditions, it is \nheartwarming to discover how many people still find time to remember \nand celebrate the sacrifices made by others.\n  Although Christmas can bring with it even busier schedules for \nalready busy people and monetary stresses for parents trying to make \nthe day a special holiday for their children, it is important to recall \nthe greatest gift of Christmas is the one embodied in the nativity \nscene--the great gift of unconditional love and hope wrapped in \nswaddling clothes, given by our Creator--our Creator Almighty God--to \ninspire us with His teachings of good will and caring toward all men.\n  And so, my colleagues, my friends, dear ones all of you; staff, those \nwho watch over us every day, it is my Christmas wish that we all keep \nmore of that Christmas spirit with us throughout the coming year. \nCharles Dickens said it best:\n\n       I will hold Christmas in heart, and try to keep it all the \n     year.\n\n  I guess it was the American editor and author, Oren Arnold, who lived \nfrom 1900 until 1980, who suggested a wonderful Christmas gift list for \nall of us:\n\n       To your enemy, forgiveness; to an opponent, tolerance; to a \n     friend, your heart; to a customer, service; to all, charity; \n     to every child, a good example; to yourself, respect.\n\n  Madam President, I wish you and Louisiana, near the great bay and the \nwaters which wash over the soil on which I used to walk with my wife--I \nwish you, Madam President, and everyone listening, a very Merry \nChristmas and a Happy New Year filled with peace and happiness. My God \nbless you all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first I extend my holiday greetings, my \nChristmas greetings, to my colleague and friend, Senator Byrd, as well \nas to you, Madam President, and my colleagues from New Jersey, \nPennsylvania, and everyone else in this Chamber. May God give a \nwonderful year to them and their families.\n  Madam President, I thank you for your help with this next particular \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2640 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2640) to improve the National Instant Criminal \n     Background Check System, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, the Senate took an important step \nforward to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem, NICS, the Nation's background check system for gun purchases. \nAlong with Senator Schumer, I have worked hard to craft this compromise \nlegislation that respects the rights of gun owners and, at the same \ntime, makes sure that the NICS system will work more effectively. This \ncompromise has not been easy, as many have strong views on issues \nsurrounding this bill, but working with Senators on both sides of the \naisle, we have forged strong, fair legislation to address serious \nshortcomings in the Federal program. Throughout the process, we have \ntaken great care to make sure Federal law governing who can own or \npossess a firearm remains unchanged. The Senate language makes clear \nthat the correct records will go into the NICS system, that any records \nimproperly in NICS will be removed promptly, that legal notice and due \nprocess considerations will be required in Federal proceedings, and \nthat the States have sufficient support to meet the goals of the bill. \nWe have been responsive to the legitimate concerns of veterans and \nadvocates on both sides of the issue, and at the same time, we have \nworked hard to correct weaknesses that have been exposed by the tragic \nevents of the last year.\n  The senseless loss of life at Virginia Tech this spring revealed \nserious flaws in the NICS system, particularly in the transfer of \nmental health information\n\n[[Page S15971]]\n\nrelevant to gun purchases between the States and the Federal \nGovernment. Deficiencies in the current NICS system, including a \nsignificant lack of funding, permitted the perpetrator of this terrible \ncrime to obtain firearms and ammunition despite having a mental health \nhistory that made him ineligible to buy or possess a firearm under \nFederal law. He was able to pass a background check and purchase the \nweapons he used in his attacks because data was missing from the NICS \nsystem.\n  In response to this devastating tragedy, the Judiciary Committee \nworked hard to produce a comprehensive legislative proposal related to \nissues of school safety, and in August unanimously reported the School \nSafety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007, SSLEIA, to the full \nSenate. As part of this legislative package, we drafted title II of \nSSLEIA to include an amended version of the NICS Amendment Improvement \nAct of 2007, H.R. 2640, that passed the House in July. Today, the \nSenate passed a revision of title II from SSLEIA, as the Leahy-Schumer \namendment to H.R. 2640, which closes the gaps in the NICS system that \nallowed the purchase of the firearms that were used in the Virginia \nTech killings. I hope the House of Representatives will take up and \npass H.R. 2640, as amended, as soon as possible.\n  The Leahy-Schumer amendment largely mirrors the language of H.R. 2640 \nas passed by the House. But it also makes modest but important changes \nto that bill in order to ensure this new law works effectively and \nfairly for all Americans. It creates a legal regime where the reporting \nof disqualifying mental health records, both at the State and Federal \nlevels, will be improved. This bill will also require Federal agencies \nto report mental health and other disqualifying records into NICS and \nwould create significant new incentives for States to report this same \ninformation. These basic features of the amendment are the same as in \nthe House bill. Additionally, the bill contains provisions directing \nFederal agencies to establish relief from disabilities programs through \nwhich individuals who have overcome a disqualifying mental illness or \ndisability may reclaim their rights, and urges the States to do the \nsame.\n  As I reviewed this issue, however, I determined that additional \nchanges were necessary both to improve the NICS system further and to \nbetter enable States like Vermont to implement these improvements. By \ntempering the penalties for insufficient participation by the States in \nmeeting the bill's goals, and increasing incentives for full \nparticipation, I am hopeful that the bill will strengthen the \npartnership between Federal and State authorities in search of a common \ngoal. The NICS system is only as good as the information that is \nreported into it, and to achieve success in improving NICS, we must \nrecognize and adequately support the States in this challenging \nundertaking.\n  I want to thank Paco Aumond, director of Criminal Justice Services at \nthe Vermont Department of Public Safety, for working with me to \nidentify those changes in the legislation to ensure that Vermont and \nthe many similarly situated States will be more easily able to make the \ncomprehensive improvements necessary for a more effective NICS system.\n  Nothing can bring back the lives tragically lost at Virginia Tech, \nand no legislation can be a panacea, but the bill we pass today will \nbegin to repair and restore our faith in the NICS system and may help \nprevent similar tragedies in the future.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent a Leahy-Schumer substitute \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third \ntime and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate, and that any statements related to the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we celebrate this holiday season \nwith our families, as we gather with those we love and give thanks for \nour tremendous blessings, we remember how incalculable the losses have \nbeen to the families of the 3,888 soldiers who have been killed in \nIraq. Their losses cannot be tallied, not in the number of Christmas \nnights spent without the one they loved; not in the number of days \nsince their wives, husbands, parents, and children left home forever. \nWe cannot calculate the strain on the 28,661 wounded soldiers and their \nfamilies, many of whom will be spending this precious time of the year \nin a military hospital, coping with their blindness, living with only \none leg or arm, sleeping through nightmares of the battlefield instead \nof the beautiful dreams they used to know this time of year.\n  As we hold them in our hearts--as well as all of the men and women in\n\n[[Page S15972]]\n\nuniform across the globe who serve to protect the country and to \npromote its interests, for which we have eternal gratitude--as we hold \nthem in our hearts and express that gratitude, we also watch our money \nslip away from us in Iraq. That is a casualty we can and must count.\n  I have come to the floor over the last 2 months to talk about the \ncost of Iraq to us at home. The lives lost in Iraq cannot have a price \nput to them. Their sacrifice and that of their families have no price. \nThe human suffering of those who have been wounded also has no price.\n  But there is also a price that is calculable at home, and it is what \nthe war is costing not just in dollars from our Treasury and debt cast \nupon on the next generation of Americans, but what it is costing in \nlost opportunities at home. There is a brutal holiday irony that is no \ncause for festive spirit in Washington.\n  The irony is this: President Bush and his Republican allies in \nCongress held hostage some key investments we need to make right here \nin our country, in order to extract a promise of more money for the war \nin Iraq.\n  They are asking for more than $150 billion more for Iraq next year, \nbut at one point they threatened to starve the entire Government of \nfunding over a difference in the Federal budget that amounts to less \nthan one-tenth of what the President wants to spend on the war next \nyear. He was ready to shut the whole Government down over the \ndifference of what amounts to less than one-tenth of what the President \nwants to spend on the war next year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Shame.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. This holiday season we wondered if President Bush \nwanted to be Scrooge to America and Santa Claus to Iraq. Over the last \nseveral months I have spoken many times about what the American \npresence in Iraq is costing at home. The true cost of the $455 billion \nwe have spent on that war and the $10 billion per month we continue to \nspend might never be more clear than it is right now, at a time when \nCongress debated the budget for almost the entire Federal Government.\n  While we have been here crunching numbers, American families are \nfeeling the crunch of a few numbers themselves: the interest rate on \ntheir mortgage that is about to jump beyond what they can afford, the \nprice on the gas pump when they fill their tank, the price of heating \noil and natural gas, higher grocery bills, fare hikes or threats of \nhikes on public transportation, and the skyrocketing costs of providing \nmedical care for themselves and their children.\n  The President's consistent threats to veto funding for Federal \nGovernment operations forced across-the-board cuts to programs and \nservices that so many Americans are counting on. This winter, as snow \nand ice fall on roads across America, people are waiting for better \nways to travel. They are waiting for expanded, affordable public \ntransportation, progress on efficiency, and new sources of fuel and \npower. They are waiting for our Nation to fill our energy portfolio \nwith something other than the usual energy sources.\n\n  The omnibus spending bill the Senate approved this week would inject \nanother $1.7 billion in the development of renewable sources of energy, \nsuch as solar, wind, and geothermal. It is an important step--but it \ncould have been much greater.\n  Republicans have consistently objected to bigger steps. They said \nweaning us off fossil fuels is too expensive. Meanwhile, they have \ninsisted that oil companies need more multimillion-dollar tax cuts. \nMeanwhile, we spend enough money to pay for that entire renewable \nenergy package in Iraq in just 5 days--in just 5 days.\n  Mr. BYRD. Five days.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Energy independence for our country, stopping giving \nforeign countries that wish us harm the ability to have the resources \nto make that harm happen, and that we could have funded for 5 days in \nIraq. Those are the choices that we make.\n  Mr. BYRD. Hear that? Five days.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Five days, Senator Byrd.\n  Cancer patients going through the dark winter of their illness are \nwaiting on lifesaving treatments that only intensive scientific \nresearch can discover. Congress has a bill before it to fund that \nresearch, but President Bush vetoed the funding once, and his allies in \nCongress have whittled it down as much as they could. The cost of the \nfunding increase for that cancer research, to turn the winter of their \nillness into the spring of possibility? It is $329 million, or less \nthan 1 day in Iraq.\n  Mr. BYRD. Less than 1 day.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. This winter, while President Bush asked for billions \nmore for security for the streets of Baghdad, he says we cannot afford \nto bring security to the streets of our own hometowns. The Senate \nproposed spending $55 million, in part to hire police officers \nspecially trained to stop child sexual predators. We have seen the \nfantastic growth of the Internet--and that is great. It brings many \ngood things with it. But it also brings challenges. The President did \nnot just force funding to stop child sexual predators to be cut in \nhalf, he sliced it to less than a third of what it was. We could have \nmade up the difference and fully funded the program to stop child \nsexual predators with what it costs to be in Iraq for just about 2\\1/2\\ \nhours.\n  Being able to successfully have the law enforcement capability to \npursue child sex predators versus 2\\1/2\\ hours in Iraq. Where are all \nthe family values we hear talked about so often? What ever happened to \nrecognizing the importance of our children, who are truly our greatest \nasset, but also our most vulnerable asset? What are our values? What \nare our priorities?\n  There are too many provisions in this big funding bill that are \nabsolutely essential, too many to name here. But the victims of the \ncuts that the President and his Republican allies have called for, the \nmillions of Americans waiting for clean power that will not be \nproduced, the cancer patients who are waiting for research that will \nnot be allowed to happen, the communities trying to stop child sexual \npredators who are waiting for police officers who will not be hired: \nThese people are also too many to name.\n  In that sense, even beyond the lives lost overseas, the cost of the \nwar in Iraq has been incalculable. If there is one thing we must all \nacknowledge right now, it is this: The war in Iraq is not free, it is \nnot without consequences here at home, and no one should be pretending \nthat this war is free.\n  The Bush administration likes to parrot the line that we are fighting \nthem over there so we do not have to fight them here. But Americans \nhave figured out what they mean, and what they mean is: We are spending \nall our money over there so, by the way, we did not have it to spend \nhere.\n  Above all, this is a question of values. Do we value our children, \nand value protecting them? Do we value our schools and the education we \nwant our children to have so they can continue to make America the \nglobal competitive leader? Do we value the men and women who wear the \nuniform, not just by marching in a parade on Memorial Day or going to a \nVeterans Day service, which we should, but by taking care of their \nhealth care and their disabilities and taking care of their survivors, \nfor those who commit the ultimate sacrifice, as a grateful nation truly \ndoes? Or will we neglect those and other priorities such as the health \ncare of our children and of our families?\n  The Democratic budget bill set out for our values a clear and serious \ntest. We cannot allow the budget to have a heart as cold as the ice on \nour front steps. We cannot let our financial stability melt away, and \nwe cannot continue to let more of our money burn up in a war that has \ntaken so much from so many for so long.\n  At year's end, we speak of renewal, we return to our families and \nwitness a rebirth of hope. This season is about the best in each and \nevery one of us. This season, decisions we make are going to test how \nwe operate as a government and test what we stand for as a nation. \nThere is no better time than now to let the best in American values \nguide our way: generosity, equality of opportunity, cooperation with \none another, turning to each other instead of against each other.\n  We have the power to end unnecessary suffering and waste, and the \nchance to approach these tasks with a fresh sense of urgency that they \nrequire. As we rest and dream in the company of those we love, let us \nremember that December is the darkest\n\n[[Page S15973]]\n\ntime of the year, but it is also the turning point when the sun begins \nto shine more and more each day.\n  Together we offer our wish, our hope, and our prayers that the dreams \nthat have carried us so far of peace on Earth, good will toward all may \nyet still come true.\n\n\n                             Thanking Staff\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to take the opportunity to \nacknowledge the individuals in my now second year here in the Senate \nwhom I have seen work incredibly hard, but very rarely get \nacknowledged, all of those who help us as we preside: the clerks, who \nkeep all of the documentation that comes before the Senate moving; the \nParliamentarians, who try to keep us in some degree of order as we move \nalong the way; the party secretaries and their staffs, who do such a \ngreat job on informing us as to what is happening and to try to keep \nsomewhat of a schedule in terms of our lives here in the Senate; to \nthose in the cloakroom who also produce that service; to the pages who \nhave done a great job.\n  It was a privilege to have the opportunity to talk to so many of \nthem. I think they are going to carry their experiences here with them \na lifetime, and I am sure that maybe we will see some of them in this \nChamber in the future.\n  To all of those who make this institution the greatest democratic \ninstitution in the world operate the way it successfully operates, my \ndeepest thanks, my best for the holiday season.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15973-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The 495th out \nof Fort Richardson has all come home. They have come home after 15 \nmonths being over in Iraq, doing incredible work under incredibly \ndifficult situations.\n  We mourn the loss of those who are not home, who will not be home. \nBut today in Anchorage, the community is coming together to say: \nWelcome back. Please let us know how we can support you and your \nfamilies, not only at this holiday season, but throughout the year, and \nsupport you for all the support you have given us.\n  We take time during the holiday season to show our thanks, to show \nour appreciation to so many. But I wish to recognize the soldiers and \nthe veterans from Alaska, from throughout the whole country, who have \ngiven so much and who continue to give so much. We want them to know \ntheir sacrifices in serving us, whether it be in Afghanistan or in \nIraq, have not gone unnoticed. Their sacrifices have certainly not gone \nunnoticed by my fellow Alaskans.\n\n  When I was in Iraq earlier in the year, I had the pleasure of meeting \nwith soldiers and guardsmen from Anchorage, Fairbanks, Seward, \nSoldotna, Eagle River, Slana, and Wasilla, all over the State. In \nhearing their stories and their commitment, you cannot help but feel \nproud as an American. I was certainly proud as an Alaskan. Every day I \nhave Alaskans who write my office to praise the servicemen and the \nservicewomen who have returned and those who are still in combat. \nSometimes it is a quick e-mail, saying: I support all of those who are \nserving, and other times they are very long, heartfelt letters praising \nour heroes and truly expressing a solidarity with them for the \nsacrifice they have made.\n  The fact that Alaska has the largest number of veterans per capita, I \nthink says a lot about our State's character. Our Alaska veterans are \nsome of the most exemplary in the Armed Forces. The 172nd Stryker \nBrigade out of Fairbanks was on tour in Iraq, and they were extended to \n16 months. But when they were asked to give more, they remained strong, \nthey remained proud. Last week, I received an e-mail from the former \ncommander of the 172nd, and he sent along an article of an Iraqi, a \nyoung Iraqi girl who had been blind. Some of the solders in the 172nd \nhad helped facilitate this young girl coming to the United States for \neye surgery. This young child, this beautiful little Iraqi girl, is now \nable to see. She was given that gift of sight because of the caring and \ncompassion of these solders.\n  Another story was shared with me by the former commander. He noted \nthat on December 12, SGT Gregory Williams from the 172nd was presented \nwith the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest award for \nvalor, for his actions while in combat in Baghdad. Despite being \ninjured himself when their vehicle was struck by a bomb, Sergeant \nWilliams was able to return fire and help a wounded comrade to safety. \nTo date, there have only been eight Distinguished Service Crosses \nawarded since the war began in 2001. So we are very proud of SGT \nGregory Williams.\n  We say that we do things a little bit differently in Alaska. We enjoy \ndoing things a little differently. There was one Alaskan marine who was \nover in Iraq. He discovered that he had some hidden talents he did not \nimagine. His innovative approach to searching out insurgents earned him \na Marine Corps Commendation Medal. SGT Aaron A. Henehan led his squad \nto search out and detain 18 black list or high-value insurgents while \nin his third tour in Iraq. He is an adventurous young man. Sergeant \nHenehan was barely out of high school and was anxious to see the world \nwhen he first thought of signing up to serve his country. September 11 \nand the outbreak of war did not cause his decision to waiver an inch.\n  Sergeant Henehan deployed in April of 2003 and spent his first tour \nin the town of Babylon. He served his country well. Like many who \nfought alongside him, he began to learn the undercurrents, the inner \nworkings of Iraqi society. He returned for a second tour to Husaybah, \nnear Iraq's border with Syria in August of 2004. At that time Husaybah \nwas a dangerous town.\n  Sergeant Henehan served his second tour in Iraq with distinction, but \nstill he felt he needed to do more. Before deploying for his third and \nfinal tour in February of 2006, he told his friends and his family back \nhome that he wanted to make a difference in Iraq, a sentiment many \nAmerican soldiers and guardsmen share. He spent a lot of time between \nhis second and his third tours thinking about what he might be able to \ndo differently, how he could learn from his experiences in the two \ndeployments prior, and how he might be able to achieve a better result.\n  Combining his Marine training with information he learned from a \nretired Los Angeles police officer who was deployed to Iraq to teach \nthe troops urban tactics, Sergeant Henehan approached his third tour \nwith what he referred to as a beat cop mentality. He wanted to approach \nthe problem of rounding up insurgents as if he were a native of the \narea. He spent his free time studying the tribal history and the \ngeography of Husaybah for hours at a time. The ability to put his plan \nin motion, Sergeant Henehan says, was made possible in part by \nOperation Steel Curtain, which had cleared Husaybah block by block, and \nset up outposts called ``firm bases'' throughout the city.\n\n[[Page S15974]]\n\n  So upon returning for his third tour, Sergeant Henehan immediately \nnoticed that after this push, while not always willing to openly \nsupport the coalition forces, Iraqis felt safe enough to give him tips \non where the insurgents were hiding. This change in mentality, coupled \nwith Sergeant Henehan's knowledge of family and tribal connections, \nallowed him to determine which people to ask about each of the 18 high-\nvalue insurgents he located. He knew exactly who would be willing to \ntip him off about a social rival or historic foe.\n  Traveling with an interpreter, Sergeant Henehan had a talent for \nremembering names and personal details. He took every opportunity he \ncould to talk with locals and learn about the town's social \norganizations and tribal boundaries, often returning several times to \ntalk with the same families to gain their trust. He would bring with \nhim candy, good humor, even doctors. He would knock on the doors and \npolitely ask to chat. Entire families opened up to him. Sometimes it \nwould start with a toy given to a child, sometimes it was a heartfelt \nconversation with a shopkeeper. The response he got astonished \neveryone, including the insurgents hiding out in the town.\n  The 12 marines in his squad called him a fair but tough leader with \nwhom they felt very safe. His intense and proactive preparation for the \nmore than 80 combat missions which he led and his personal attention to \neach of his 12 soldier's well-being gave them a sense of security. \nThey, too, noted how his relaxed Alaskan exterior quickly helped earn \nhim the respect of the townspeople.\n  Even more remarkably, Sergeant Henehan's reputation for being fair \nand caring allowed him to detain all 18 high-value insurgents without \nany real violence. These 18 also led him to their associates, \nsignificantly disrupting insurgent operations in that part of Al Anbar \nProvince.\n  Sergeant Henehan remained behind after his unit returned to the \nStates to train new troops about how he had learned to wage urban \nwarfare while gaining the trust of the townspeople. The downturn in \nviolence in Al Anbar can be linked perhaps in part to his efforts and \nthe efforts of those like him.\n  Sergeant Henehan is currently attending a California community \ncollege and plans to transfer to a larger State school after completing \nhis distribution credits. He wants to major in computer games and even \ntalks of one day creating video games that more accurately portray what \nwar in the modern era is like. He has already begun organizing \nphotographs from his three tours to use as backdrops. Clearly, his \ntalent for careful planning and his desire to share his knowledge and \nexperiences with others did not leave with his donning of civilian \nclothes.\n  I wish him the best in all of his future endeavors, just as I wish \nthe best for all Alaskan veterans and those now serving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15974-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to take a few moments to speak \non the issue of Medicare reimbursements for physicians, particularly \nthose in rural and frontier States. We have moved forward a temporary \nfix of Medicare reimbursement for physicians, essentially for 6 months. \nI wish to speak to the issue for Alaska and other rural parts of the \ncountry.\n  In Alaska, many of our Medicare beneficiaries, even without this \npotential 10-percent reimbursement cut, lack the ability to see a \nprimary care physician unless they have the means somehow to pay out of \npocket for doctor visits. Without congressional action on a long-term \nstrategy--longer than 6 months--to increase Medicare reimbursements, \nthese cuts threaten access to care as fewer and fewer doctors are able \nto afford seeing Medicare patients. An American Medical Association \nsurvey shows that 60 percent of physicians reported they would be \nforced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they treat if the \nimpending reimbursement cuts go through.\n  I get so many calls on a daily basis from seniors asking me to fix \nMedicare. They want to be able to continue to see their doctor. I know \nI am not the only Member who receives these calls. It is unfortunate, \nbut America's seniors every year are thrust in the middle of this \nMedicare reimbursement debate out of fear that they are going to lose \ntheir health care provider to Medicare cuts.\n  In 2003, with great fanfare, we provided a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. At that time, I asked the question: We can have a wonderful \ndrug benefit, but what good is the benefit if there is no physician to \nwrite the prescription?\n  The Presiding Officer knows how big a State it is; she has had the \nopportunity to come for a visit. We are bigger than California, Texas, \nand Montana combined. ``Rural'' in Alaska has a new meaning. The \nphysician shortage crisis in Alaska has been magnified because of our \ngeography, distance, and size.\n  What many people might not realize is what is happening to our \npopulation. We have always been viewed as a young pioneering State \nwhere the average age is the early 20s and predominantly male--a \nwilderness image. But we have grown and matured. Our elderly population \nis the fastest growing senior population per capita in the Nation \nbehind Nevada. That is a statistic which would surprise many people.\n  The Mat-Su Valley, an area just north of Anchorage, is the fifth \nfastest growing region among seniors nationally. Yet, think about that \nstatistic and compare it with what is happening with our physician \nratio. Alaska has the sixth lowest ratio of physicians to population in \nthe United States. Outside of the Anchorage area, our ratio of \nphysicians to population is the worst in the Nation.\n  To put it into context, we had a field hearing the first part of the \nyear to understand how bad the situation is as far as access to care. \nTo reach the national average of physician-to-patient ratio, Alaska \nneeds a net increase of 980 physicians statewide or 49 more physicians \nper year. I go into some of these hospitals, VA clinics, and community \nhealth centers. They have been waiting years trying to find not only \ndoctors but all within the medical profession, whether it is outpatient \ntherapists all the way up to cardiologists. Fairbanks, our second \nlargest city, got its first cardiologist this year.\n  According to the Anchorage Daily News, our largest newspaper, it \ncosts 65 cents on the dollar to care for a patient in Alaska, and yet \nMedicare only reimburses 22 to 35 cents on the dollar. In addition to \nlow reimbursement, we have other factors that drive the cost up. We \nhave higher salaries, a higher cost of living, higher equipment costs, \nand higher transportation costs. Higher energy costs add to that.\n  We had a field hearing earlier in the year and had an individual \ntestify before the committee. He was later quoted in the Anchorage \nDaily News:\n\n       The costs [to practice] were so exorbitant and the fees for \n     reimbursement were so low for Medicare patients, at the end \n     of the day I could actually owe money for working a ten-hour \n     day.\n\n  The sustained growth rate formula which has been in place since 1997 \ncalls for nearly 40 percent in cuts over the next 8 years, even as \npractice expenses continue to increase. So how do we expect to entice \nmore physicians to practice and care for our seniors, our veterans, if \nwe threaten to cut Medicare reimbursements every year?\n  We know the time for Congress to act is now. I ask my colleagues, \nthose on the Finance Committee, let's work on legislation that will \nprovide a long-term reimbursement fix to ensure continuous care for the \nelderly, who may otherwise be left without access to care in the \nneediest of times. This is something we all must work to advance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15974-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15974-S15975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR TRENT LOTT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, yesterday was a day of tribute to one \nof our colleagues, a gentleman who has served his State and this \ncountry admirably for many years. I have not had the privilege to serve \nin the Senate with our colleague for as long a period as many of those \nwho spoke yesterday, but I think we know it doesn't take long to \nrealize how important has been the contribution of the Senator from \nMississippi to this institution. I listened yesterday to so many of the \nkind words. I heard repeated time after time: statesman, leader of an \ninstitution, truly a statesman.\n  We all know of Trent Lott's tremendous dedication to the institution \nthat is Congress, 34 years of public service between the House and \nSenate, his creation of the whip organization in the\n\n[[Page S15975]]\n\nHouse that emphasized Member-to-Member contacts and outreach that are \nso important in building relationships, election to the Senate in 1988, \nSenate majority leader in 1996, and then Republican whip earlier this \nyear. We don't want to lament the loss of a tremendous asset, but we \nneed to always remember to celebrate those accomplishments, learn from \nthem.\n  I learned that if there was a problem that needed to be resolved, you \ncould go to Trent to resolve it. When there was a compromise that \nneeded to be brokered, Trent could figure out how to make that happen.\n  I learned that when there was a shortage of tomatoes at the Lott \nhousehold, Trent knew he could just go a couple doors down the street \nand find some tomatoes in a friendly neighbor's yard. My husband and I \nhave been neighbors with Trent and Tricia these past 5 years. As \nneighbors, we share a lot of things. We share a lot of leaves. He blows \nthe leaves down the sidewalk to my house, and my husband will blow the \nleaves back down to his house--good, friendly neighbors. I have always \nappreciated that.\n  Truly, whether it is the quick conversation between Members during \nvotes or whether it is the closed-door sitdown when he comes to the \noffice and says: Lisa, I want to talk to you about this, Trent knows \nthe pulse of the Senate.\n  I would watch him on the floor. He was like a butterfly. He would \ncome over and alight next to somebody, have a quick conversation, a \ntalk, and then he would move over to another area and do the same \nthing, kind of going from person to person, always working but always \nfriendly and always working to find a path forward. His ability to \ndevelop those relationships and work out a deal to everyone's \nsatisfaction is a skill I certainly look to as a model for how the \nSenate should operate.\n  It is with great fondness that I wish my friend, my colleague, my \nneighbor well in his future endeavors.\n  I wish him and Tricia well and truly love as they embark on their \nnext adventure. We do know there will be adventures. I thank him for \nhis friendship, his service to this Nation and to this institution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 455, S. 1498; \nthat the committee-reported amendments be considered and agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, without further intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Coburn, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Captive Primate Safety Act, S. 1498, \nis an important, bipartisan bill promoting the humane treatment of \nanimals and protecting public health and safety from the considerable \nrisks associated with primate pet ownership and trade.\n  On May 24, 2007, I introduced S. 1498, with Senators Vitter, \nLautenberg, Lieberman, and Menendez. Senator Ensign is also a \ncosponsor.\n  Nonhuman primates are susceptible to many biological agents that \ninfect human beings, including tuberculosis, Ebola/Marburg, and \npoxviruses. Because of the serious health risk, importing nonhuman \nprimates into the United States for the pet trade has been banned by \nFederal regulation since 1975. In addition, many States already \nprohibit these animals as pets. Still, there is an active trade in \nthese animals. Estimates are that 15,000 are in private hands; however, \nas the trade is largely unregulated, the number may be much higher. \nBecause many of these animals move in interstate commerce, Federal \nlegislation is needed.\n  This legislation amends the Lacey Act to prohibit transporting \nmonkeys, great apes, lemurs, and other non-\nhuman primates across State lines for the pet trade. The bill has no \nimpact on trade or transportation of animals for zoos, medical and \nother licensed research facilities, or certain other licensed and \nregulated entities.\n  The Captive Primate Safety Act is supported by the Humane Society of \nthe United States, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association, Defenders of Wildlife and the \nWildlife Conservation Society and many other environmental \norganizations and animal welfare groups.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, thank you. I appreciate your attention in \npresiding today, on a day when people are headed home. We are grateful \nfor your presence here.\n  I join so many others--I do not want to be too redundant, but it is \nimportant to repeat expressions of gratitude--like a lot of people \nhere, I have a lot of gratitude in my heart: gratitude for my wife \nTerese and my family for supporting me in my first year in the Senate; \ncertainly for my staff--like so many Senators here could say of their \nown staff--I know it is true of mine; I have a great staff, and I am \ngrateful for their help and their support and professionalism for \nalmost a full year now; for the staff here in the Senate--I could go to \nany Senate office, but especially in the Chamber itself, all those who \nwork so hard, day in and day out, year in and year out, to make this \nplace work, and to guide even those veteran Members on parliamentary \nquestions, but especially some of the first-year Senators.\n  We are grateful for your skill, your knowledge, and your \nprofessionalism, and we wish you and your families a happy holiday \nseason at this time.\n  The same goes for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, who have \nbeen so supportive of me as a first-year Senator. I will mention two in \nthe interest of time: Senator Reid, our majority leader, the majority \nleader of the entire Senate, and also, of course, the leader of the \nDemocratic side of the aisle--a great leader for our party, but even \nbeyond that, a great leader for the Senate. He is a man of great \ncompassion and decency, someone who cares about changing the direction \nof the country, to move us in the right direction. He has done that \nvery well. I am honored to serve with him.\n  Senator Lott is going to be leaving us. I had the privilege of \npresiding yesterday when I heard all of the testimonials to his \nservice. I was honored to be a small part--a witness of that Senate \nhistory. We wish Senator Lott and his family all of God's blessings at \nthis holiday season. But also beyond the season, we wish him the best \nof luck in his new life outside of the Senate. We are grateful for his \nservice.\n  I have one more note of gratitude and best wishes, and that is to \nthose who are serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan and around \nthe world--those men and women in our military the world over who are \ndoing that brave and noble service every day. We are thinking of them. \nWe pray for them at this time, as we try to throughout the year. But \nespecially we are thinking of them and their families at this holiday \nseason.\n  (Mr. SALAZAR assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15975-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15975-S15977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AMERICAN FAMILIES IN CRISIS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am going to try to be about 5 minutes. I \nwant to highlight a couple of issues, not only because it is this \nseason but I think especially because it is this season, the holiday \nseason.\n  When we think about families coming together, we think about hope, \nand we think about caring for people. We think about exchanging gifts. \nIt is a time of happiness. But for some families it is not so. It is a \nvery difficult time for a lot of families--not only during the holiday \nseason but the winter season.\n  I was struck, unfortunately, in a very negative way the other day. I \nthink it was yesterday. I picked up the Washington Post and read a \nstory about President Bush's speech about the economy. We can go \nthrough that and debate what he said, but one of the first sentences in \nthat article quoted him as follows--when he was talking about the \neconomy:\n\n\n[[Page S15976]]\n\n\n       There's definitely some storm clouds and concerns.\n\n  ``There's definitely some storm clouds and concerns.'' That is a \nquotation from that article from the President of the United States. I \nhave to say, I have never seen a crisis in the lives of a lot of \nfamilies so understated, and I think irresponsibly so. I hate to say \nthat, but there is no other way to say that in any other way.\n  It is not, Mr. President, just some ``concerns'' and some ``storm \nclouds.'' We are way beyond storm clouds for a lot of Americans. There \nare so many Americans who face the crisis of not having enough to eat \nthis season. This Government can do something about it. We know that. \nWe all know that if we are honest with ourselves. There are families \nwho do not have enough resources or enough power in their own lives to \nbe able to access the resources to heat their homes, so they are cold \nat this time.\n  There are a lot of other families who are facing other crises--health \ncare costs and others, the subprime crisis. We could go down the list: \nthe price of fuel, gasoline, and home heating oil. We could go down the \nlist. But it is a crisis, and for a lot of hard-working Americans, they \nare bracing for a winter storm that has nothing to do with snow and \nice. Many of these same working families are one emergency away from \nfinancial disaster.\n  In light of that challenge they face, I sent a letter to the \nPresident just over a week ago--actually before he made the statement \nabout the storm clouds and some ``concerns.'' It is lot worse than \nthat, I would respectfully submit to the President. I am not going to \ngo through the letter. I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the \nPresident dated December 10, 2007, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2007.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Hardworking Americans are bracing for a \n     winter storm that has nothing to do with snow and ice. Many \n     working families are just one emergency away from financial \n     disaster. Escalating costs of home heating, gasoline, food, \n     and health care threaten to leave these families hungry and \n     in the cold. In light of these circumstances, I urge you to \n     provide emergency assistance to help local food banks and \n     other programs meet the rising need this holiday season.\n       This winter, home energy prices are projected to reach \n     record levels, increasing by more than 15 percent over last \n     year. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy is \n     predicting higher demand for home heating because the \n     upcoming winter is expected to be colder than the last. The \n     states' energy assistance directors estimate that with this \n     combination of higher prices and higher usage, the average \n     family will pay $2,157 for home heating oil this winter, $693 \n     more than last winter.\n       Meanwhile, family hunger and food insecurity is on the \n     rise. Last year alone, the United States Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) reported that 35.5 million Americans did \n     not have enough money or resources to get food for at least \n     some period during the year. This was an increase of 400,000 \n     over 2005 and an increase of 2.3 million since 2000.\n       Families in states like Pennsylvania, particularly families \n     with children, increasingly face difficulty meeting the needs \n     to heat their homes and feed their loved ones. This kind of \n     family crisis can have both immediate and longstanding \n     effects. Research shows that babies and toddlers in families \n     struggling to keep up with their home energy needs are more \n     likely to be in poor health, have a higher risk of \n     developmental problems, and have greater food insecurity.\n       Faced with the choice of eating or heating, many of these \n     families are seeking help from food banks and emergency \n     heating assistance programs. Yet America's food banks are \n     facing critical shortages. Rising demand coupled with sharp \n     drops in federal supplies of excess farm commodities and \n     declining donations have forced food banks to cut back on \n     rations, distribute supplies usually reserved for disaster \n     relief, and in some cases, close their doors because of the \n     lack of federal assistance.\n       Similarly, rising food costs and limited funding are \n     placing great strain on the Women Infants and Children \n     Nutrition Program (WIC), threatening service to some of the \n     8.5 million low-income pregnant and postpartum women and \n     young children who participate in the program.\n       Under your proposed budget for the fiscal year 2008, more \n     than 500,000 low-income women, infants, and children would \n     lose access to food and nutrition services.\n       I was proud to join the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry Committee in unanimously approving a 2007 Farm Bill \n     that includes over $5 billion in additional funds for federal \n     food assistance programs. Passage of this bill will provide \n     extra funding for food banks, increase food assistance to \n     working families with high child care costs, and increase \n     food assistance for low-income seniors. While the full Senate \n     continues to work on this important legislation, we must take \n     steps to immediately address the hunger-relief needs of \n     millions of Americans across this nation.\n       Compounding matters, states report that they have \n     insufficient resources to meet expected demands for home \n     energy assistance. That is why Congress rejected your funding \n     proposal for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (LIHEAP), which would have cut the number of households \n     assisted by 1.1 million, from 5.6 million to 4.5 million. \n     Instead, we passed a bill to maintain the LIHEAP block grant \n     at its current level of $1.98 billion and increase emergency \n     contingency funding by $250 million to $431.7 million to meet \n     the expected higher demand in the upcoming winter. \n     Unfortunately, your veto of this bill stopped that relief in \n     its tracks.\n       America's working men and women, seniors, and children \n     desperately need your immediate help this holiday season. \n     Specifically, I urge you to provide emergency assistance to \n     help local food banks and other programs meet the rising need \n     this winter season. While optimally The Emergency Food \n     Assistance Program (TEFAP) needs an infusion of $27 million, \n     I strongly urge you to transfer as much funding as is \n     feasible to shore up America's emergency food supplies \n     throughout the upcoming winter months. I also urge you to \n     approve an appropriation that includes no less than $5.96 \n     billion to fully fund the WIC program for FY08 and to approve \n     the Farm Bill nutrition funding, including funding for TEFAP \n     and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), when \n     approved by Congress. Finally, I urge that you use your \n     authority to release the remaining $20 million in the \n     contingency fund for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program (LIHEAP).\n       As a nation, we must do all we can to bring light to \n     families facing the darkness of hunger and cold during the \n     holidays and throughout the winter. As we count our blessings \n     in this season of hope, let us bring comfort to those who are \n     vulnerable and need our help.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important request.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Robert P. Casey, Jr.,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I will not read the letter, but I outlined some of these \nchallenges people have in their lives. I asked him to do a couple of \nthings. These things are not difficult to do. These things, literally, \nrequire his signature on either legislation that has just been passed \nor using his discretionary power as the most powerful elected official \nin the world to release small sums of money in the scheme of our entire \nFederal budget.\n  I will wrap up with this, four things I have asked him to do \nbasically in this letter. First of all, No. 1, provide emergency \nassistance to help local food banks and other programs meet the rising \nneed this winter season. There is story after story. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, you know it from your home State of Colorado. We \nknow it all over the country. There is article after article about food \nbanks stretched in a way they have not been. It seems as if the same \nstory has been written across the country. Never before, in 20 years, \nsome would assert, have we seen this. We have not seen this in years. \nThey do not have enough resources to meet the demand of those who are \nhungry.\n  So I would ask the President to use his power--his power to provide \nthat emergency assistance to those who are hungry. He has the power to \ndo that.\n  Secondly, I ask the President to use his power to give full meaning \nto a great program, the Emergency Food Assistance Program, known here \nin Washington, like everything else, with an acronym, EFAP, the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program. It needs an infusion. This would be \nthe optimal situation, if the President would do this for the American \npeople. It needs an infusion, right now, of at least $27 million. I ask \nthe President to get that done. And I think he could if he wanted to do \nthis.\n  I urge him also to approve the bill we just passed, that massive \npiece of legislation last night. A lot of good things are in that bill. \nI will mention one or two. One is the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram--a tremendous program that helps pregnant women and postpartum \nwomen, as well as young children, with nutrition and other assistance. \nThank goodness the bill we passed has $6 billion for it. I am told that \nis full funding.\n  I ask the President to sign that legislation for a lot of reasons--\nhundreds of reasons--but if he has no other reason,\n\n[[Page S15977]]\n\nto look at that part of that bill, the Women, Infants, and Children's \nProgram during this holiday season; to sign the farm bill because of a \nlot of reasons, but in this context because of the nutrition funding \nwhich is included in it that I mentioned, as well as other nutrition \nincreases. There are billions of dollars more for nutrition in the farm \nbill. So I ask the President, No. 3, to sign the farm bill.\n  And No. 4, and finally, to release the remaining $20 million in \ncontingency funding for the so-called LIHEAP program--another acronym, \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. A lot of people know \nabout it and depend on it. Just $20 million; a tiny eyedrop worth of \nmoney in terms of a Federal budget into the trillions.\n  I ask the President not only to read a letter and not only to respond \nto it, but, most importantly, to take action which is asked for in this \nletter and the pleas for help from families across America. U.S. \nSenators, Members of Congress, and others have asked this President to \ndo his part in this holiday season because the President, just like the \nCongress, has power--power to help people, power to improve their \nlives, and power to do all he can to help them every time throughout \nthe year but especially at this time of the year.\n  I conclude with this: In this season of hope, let it be said of those \nwho have power--real power--let it be said of those who have power that \nthey helped those who are hungry, those who are cold, and those who \nwill live through yet another season of despair. Let it be said of us, \nand let it be said of the President, that he fulfilled and met his \nobligation to help those Americans who need it, especially in this \nseason.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to review the outcome of last \nevening's debate and vote on the Iraq amendment that I offered along \nwith Senators Reed, Voinovich, Hagel, Snowe, Reid, Smith, and Salazar.\n  The amendment expressed the sense of the Congress that the missions \nof the U.S. forces in Iraq should transition to counterterrorism \noperations, and training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi forces, as \nwell as force protection, and that--and this is, perhaps, the most \ncritical, the important part of the amendment we voted on--that it \nshould be the goal to complete that transition by the end of 2008.\n  The vote on our amendment was 50 yeas and 45 nays.\n  Legislating on Iraq is a difficult matter because of the need to gain \n60 votes in order to overcome a filibuster, and it was made perhaps \neven more difficult last night because the Republican leader stated \nthat the President would veto the Consolidated Appropriations Act if it \ncontained our amendment.\n  Now, imagine that. The President of the United States would veto \nfunds for the troops if 60 or more Senators simply expressed their \nnonbinding opinion that a goal should be to bring most of our troops \nhome by the end of next year. I would hope the President would welcome \nat least the nonbinding advice of the Congress and not threaten funding \nfor the troops if that advice were forthcoming.\n  Despite a great deal of pressure, including the veto threat, our \namendment secured six Republican votes--more Republican votes than \namendments to change course in Iraq have secured to date. Senators \nVoinovich, Hagel, Snowe, Smith, Collins, and Dole joined 44 of the 46 \nDemocrats who were present to produce a 50-vote majority in favor of \nour amendment.\n  I am confident that at least four of the five absent Senators would \nhave supported our amendment, as they have done in the past. So we \nwould have had 54 votes in favor of our amendment, which would have \nbeen the most votes thus far for this type of a policy change in Iraq.\n  Now, what does that majority Senate vote mean, last night's majority \nvote? What message does it send to the White House, the American \npeople, the Iraqi political leadership, and the Iraqi people?\n  I believe the message is that more and more Senators are embracing \nthe view that the American people reflected during the last election a \nlittle over a year ago; namely, that we want to change course in Iraq, \nand we want to have a reasonable timetable for the return of most of \nour troops, and that we have reached the limits of our patience with \nthe Iraqi political leadership. I hope the President takes full notice \nof last night's majority vote, although the majority will was thwarted \nby a filibuster. I am sure he is aware of the vote, since the \nRepublican leader said the President would veto the legislation if it \ncontained our amendment.\n\n  I hope the American people understand a growing majority of the \nSenate agrees with their view that we need to establish a goal for the \nreduction of most of our forces in Iraq and the goal should be most \nshould leave Iraq by the end of next year.\n  I hope the Iraqi political leaders understand a growing majority of \nthe Senate is willing to vote to change course in Iraq as a way to \nbring pressure on them to make the long-promised political compromises \nthat virtually everyone agrees are required to end the violence in \nIraq.\n  I hope Prime Minister Maliki, in particular, understands what the \nU.S. Department of State said on November 21 about him and the other \npolitical leaders in Iraq. This is an extraordinary finding by the \nDepartment of State. I hope it gets somehow or other through to Prime \nMinister Maliki. Here is what the Department of State report said:\n\n       Senior U.S. military commanders now portray the \n     intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as the \n     key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq, rather than al-\n     Qaida terrorists, Sunni insurgents, or Iranian-backed \n     militias.\n\n  I wish the President of the United States would read his own State \nDepartment report so that not only would the majority of the Senate \nadopt resolutions intending to put pressure on the Iraqi leadership by \ntelling them the open-ended commitment of American forces is over, but \nthat the President of the United States would tell the Iraqi leaders \nwhat his own State Department said in that November 21 report. It is so \nimportant that I am going to repeat it:\n\n       Senior U.S. military commanders now portray the \n     intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as the \n     key threat facing the U.S. effort in Iraq, rather than al-\n     Qaida terrorists, Sunni insurgents, or Iranian-backed \n     militias.\n\n  I hope the members of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, the Iraqi \nParliament, understand they must find a way to bring about \nreconciliation or face the consequences of squandering that window of \nopportunity provided by the military successes of the surge that, as \nGeneral Odierno notes, will not be open forever. As I did after my trip \nto Iraq last August, I once again express my personal hope that the \nIraqi Parliament will replace Prime Minister Maliki with someone who is \nwilling to strongly push national reconciliation and to replace that \nPrime Minister with someone less connected to a sectarian group.\n  Finally, I wish to note that while last night's vote relative to Iraq \nwas the last such vote this year, it is not the last vote the Senate is \nlikely to hold on our policy in Iraq. The $70 billion approved last \nnight is only about one-third the amount the administration has sought \nfor Iraq and Afghanistan. The next time the Congress considers funding \nfor the war in Iraq, of the many factors that Members will no doubt \nconsider, none will be more important than whether Iraqi political \nleaders have compromised with each other and assumed responsibility for \nthe future of their own country.\n\n\n                   Thanking Staff and Senator Salazar\n\n  As others of my colleagues, let me add my thanks to our staffs, the \nSenate staff, our pages, all the people who make it possible for us to \ntry to do the\n\n[[Page S15978]]\n\nbest job we can do. We don't often express our thanks to our staffs, to \nour pages, but this is surely the appropriate time of year to pause for \na moment to express that gratitude to them. Without their support, \nwithout their assistance, it would not be possible for us to function. \nThey make it possible for us to do a lot better than we otherwise would \nand even to make it possible for us to do some important things once in \na while.\n  I wish to also express my thanks to the Presiding Officer. General \nSalazar I almost called Senator Salazar--Senator Salazar has been of \ninvaluable assistance to me on so many matters, and I know that feeling \nexists with other Members of the Senate. As I talk about Iraq this \nafternoon, looking at our Presiding Officer, Senator Salazar, I am \nreminded of the countless numbers of times and the efforts Senator \nSalazar has made to try to pull this body together to see if we \ncouldn't make a difference in terms of Iraq policy. That effort to \nachieve a bridge across the aisle, to bring Senators together, is \nsomething which Senator Salazar does as well as any Member of this \nbody. Even though we don't often or always succeed in achieving \nbipartisan results, we would achieve them far fewer times but for the \nassistance and help of our Presiding Officer. So I wish to add my \nthanks to him as well.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15978-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15978-S15980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening, in the \nclosing hours of the year 2007, to make a few comments.\n  First, at the beginning of this year, the beginning of this Congress \nand the first year, I believe, we have been a Congress of robust \nachievement, which has made significant change, and that we must also \ncontinue to be agents of change in the future because additional change \nis needed. We have done some good things for this country. There is \nmuch more change we need to do.\n  We have made change in moving forward and seeking a new direction in \nIraq and holding the administration accountable on that issue. There is \nmore we have to do in achieving that new direction in Iraq.\n  We have made significant change in terms of moving forward toward \nenergy independence. There is more work we need to do to achieve real \nenergy independence.\n  We moved forward in crafting the best farm bill, in my view, in \nseveral decades. We need to get that farm bill across the finish line.\n  We made progress in the Senate dealing with health care issues, \nincluding passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program. But we \nsomehow need to get that over the President's veto pen and start \naddressing the other issues relating to health care and health care \nreform.\n  We have made progress in the arena of education, with passage of the \nHigher Education Authorization Act and providing financial aid to \nstudents across the country and the passage of the Head Start Program. \nBut we now know we still need to move ahead and make more progress and \nbe agents of change with respect to No Child Left Behind.\n  We have made significant progress in the Wounded Warriors Act, \nproviding the resources we need to take care of our nearly 25 million \nveterans in America. We need to make sure we stay on top of those \nissues with 1\\1/2\\ million veterans returning from Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom. It is important that we not lose sight of \nthe Nation's promise to take care of our veterans.\n  There has been a lot of good work done, but there is still more work \nahead. We must, in this Senate Chamber, figure out a way to continue to \nbe agents of change to bring about change in the direction of America.\n  I want to comment on a couple of the subjects I touched on.\n  First, Iraq. Iraq remains the major national/international foreign \npolicy issue of the United States. The Presiding Officer, the senior \nSenator from Michigan, has helped lead us from the wilderness in which \nwe found ourselves with respect to the war in Iraq to move forward to \nwhat I consider to be a different level of debate today in America.\n  For the first 6 years of this administration, they essentially \ncontrolled all of the cards. It was only with the change in leadership \nin the Senate and in the House of Representatives that, today, there is \naccountability that is occurring with respect to the war in Iraq.\n  The senior Senator from Michigan, the very distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, has really led us in the search for \ntrying to find that new direction for Iraq. It was the Senator from \nMichigan who conceived of the fact that we needed to move away from \nhaving our troops in a combat mission over to the more limited missions \nof counterterrorism, force protection, border security, and moving \nforward in the more limited presence in Iraq, and sending, as he has so \noften said on the floor of the Senate, an unmistakable message to the \nIraqi Government and the Iraqi people that it is they who have to get \nIraq together. It is not up to us in America or to our troops on the \nground to resolve the political problems Iraq faces today. That \nunmistakable message the Iraqis have received would not have been \nreceived had it not been for the leadership of Senator Levin, Senator \nReid, and others in this Chamber who stood up and said we need to have \na new direction in Iraq.\n  There may be some around the country who are saying: Well, what has \nhappened, because we are still in Iraq and the money is still being \nprovided to our troops? But there has been a significant change that \nhas occurred. We know last night, for example, on the vote that \noccurred with respect to the funding of our troops in Iraq, the $70 \nbillion provided to our troops was provided to make sure our troops are \nnot without money as they carry out the mandate of the Commander in \nChief. But it was not the $196 billion that was requested by the \nPresident of the United States. It was an installment. It is the first \ntime we get to a point where there is this kind of sequential funding. \nThat will allow the Congress and the Senate, under the leadership of \nSenator Levin, the Presiding Officer, to continue to move forward to \ntry to seek a new direction in Iraq and to continue to hold the \nadministration accountable with respect to its efforts on the ground in \nIraq.\n  Yes, when I look at the issue of Iraq, from my perspective and \ninvolvement, I believe we have made significant progress in terms of \ncreating a new direction and a new momentum in Iraq. I appreciate the \neffort of the chairman of the Armed Services Committees in that debate. \nI appreciate his leadership and for inviting me and others to go with \nhim to Iraq a year or so ago, along with Senator Warner. We were on the \nground meeting with Iraqi officials, as well as our military \nleadership, to make sure we had the best information as we move forward \nwith the issue on Iraq.\n  Secondly, I wish to comment on energy. For me, the issue of energy is \none of the most important signature issues of the 21st century. I don't \nthink we can do anything that is any less important. This is of \nmonumental importance not only to the people of America but to our \nentire globe and all of civilization.\n  The legislation we passed this year, which the President signed \ntoday, is legislation that is important because it moves us forward in \nterms of getting a higher level of efficiency with respect to how we \nuse oil, with respect to how we use electricity in our homes and \nbuildings, and with respect to how we deal with carbon sequestration, \nto begin dealing with global warming. But there is more work we must do \nto move forward with an energy package that is something that is doable \nhere among all of us in this Congress. We need to make sure the jet \nengine powers this clean energy economy into the 21st century, created \nout of the Finance Committee, which lost by 1 vote--we had 59 votes in \nthe Senate to get that\n\n[[Page S15979]]\n\npackage adopted--and that we get that across the finish line in the \nyears ahead.\n\n  The automobile companies in our country need to have that financial \nassistance included in that finance package for them to be able to make \nthe transition that is so important to get the higher efficiencies we \nare asking them to make. There is still a significant amount of work we \nmust move forward with when we deal with energy.\n  In my view, the inescapable force that ought to bring us together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, progressives and conservatives, ought to be \nthe issue of national security. It ought to be the issue of the \nenvironmental security and the economic opportunity we have for our \nNation. I hope our successes on energy this year are the beginning of a \nfoundation that will continue to build in the years ahead.\n  Thirdly, on the farm bill, I am very proud of the work Senators \nHarkin, Conrad, Chambliss, Grassley, Baucus, and others accomplished in \nthat effort. It is interesting to note that 78 Senators voted for that \nfarm bill just last week. That is more U.S. Senators voting for that \nfarm bill than any farm bill in the last quarter century. If the \nPresidential candidates had been here, we would have had 82 or 83 votes \nfor that farm bill. It is a very good bill on what we do in our \ninvestments in nutrition and conservation and renewable energy, in all \nof those things which are important to making sure we have food \nsecurity in America.\n  It is my hope that, as we move forward into a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives, that legislation can move forward to the \nPresident so it can be signed into law so that we can make sure we \nmaintain the food security of America and that we also open a new \nchapter for American agriculture as rural communities and agriculture \nhelp us grow our way to energy independence.\n  On health care, it is a tougher issue, it is a tough issue, where \nthere has not been significant concern or any concern, frankly, from \nthis administration with respect to dealing with this crisis \nbankrupting so many American businesses and causing pain to so many \nAmerican families. When we think about the statistics, the fact is \nalmost 50 million Americans today don't have health insurance. In \nColorado, almost 20 percent of the population of the State doesn't have \nhealth insurance. It is a crisis in America.\n  Yes, the White House has not seemed to really want to move forward \nwith any kind of change with respect to health care that will address \nthe pain occurring across America. We tried to make some movement in \nthat direction by providing health insurance to 10 million children in \nAmerica. If we are going to deal with health insurance, it seems we \nneed to start providing that insurance to the most vulnerable, the \nchildren of our country. Yet twice the President vetoed the bills \npassed out of this Chamber and out of the House. It is my hope that we \ncan return to deal not only with children's health insurance but other \nhealth insurance issues that are on the table.\n  Fifth, I come from a family--just like the Presiding Officer's \nfamily--who very much has recognized the importance of education. We \nvery much see that the American dream is made possible through opening \nup those opportunities to come about through education.\n  I remember growing up on our farm, where my father would come around \nthe table, and as we were gathered around the table with the kerosene \nlamp--because we didn't have electricity and a telephone at the ranch--\nhe would say he was a poor man and there was not much he could leave us \nin terms of a legacy of wealth or a very large ranch. But the one thing \nhe would say to those eight children gathered around that table was \nthat he wanted them to get a good education. He would say: If you get a \ngood education, which you will get because I will insist on it, that is \nsomething I prefer to give you over anything else in life in terms of \nriches because an education is something no one can ever take away from \nyou.\n  Mr. President, until this year, there had been, in the last 6 years, \na policy of disinvestment in education in America. Through the \nleadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, the higher education \nprograms we reauthorized and funded will provide financial aid and \neducational opportunity to millions in America. To my own small State \nof Colorado, about $560 million of additional financial aid will be \nmade possible to the young people who are seeking a higher education.\n  The passage of the Head Start Reauthorization Act is another \ninvestment in our young people. I come from a background of having \nserved my State as attorney general. During the time I was attorney \ngeneral, I was one of the participants and cochairs of an organization \ncalled Fight Crime: Invest in Children. We had a simple agenda. We were \ncrime fighters, law enforcement, and attorneys general, but we realized \nit was important for us to keep kids out of trouble in the first place. \nSo, as a consequence, our agenda was simple: invest in early childhood \neducation and in afterschool programs. I think the investment we are \nmaking in Head Start and the reauthorization of that program is part of \nthat agenda, and I very much appreciate the leadership of the Senate in \ngetting that done.\n  Finally, returning to an issue in which Senator Levin, Senator Akaka, \nSenator Murray, and others have been so much at the point of the spirit \nin leading us to a new level of investment and protection of our \nveterans, this bill, which we approved last night, which is now being \nconsidered in the House, which will move forward to the President, \nwill, for the first time, invest in veterans health care at a level \nthat the independent budget of the veterans service organizations have \nrecommended. It is the first time that we have met those funding \nlevels.\n  The Wounded Warriors Act, which is included in that legislation, will \nopen up a whole new chapter of taking care of those who serve our \ncountry. I appreciate the leadership, again, of those who have been \ninvolved in that effort.\n  When I look back at what we have done in 2007 in the Senate and the \nCongress, yes, it has been a year of robust achievement, but it is also \na fact that there is much change that is still needed. I look forward \nto working with the Presiding Officer and with the rest of my \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, in achieving that change \nthat is so much needed.\n  Let me quickly, also, as we move forward to this holiday season, say \nthank you to the troops who are overseas and to their families for \ntheir service and for their sacrifice. As we think about that service \nand that sacrifice, it is important for us to take stock that this is a \nreal sacrifice.\n  The statistics today, December 19, 2007, do not gloss over the \nreality of war and the horrors and sacrifice of war: Total Americans \nkilled in Iraq, 3,896; total Coloradans from my State killed in Iraq, \n54; total soldiers from Fort Carson in Colorado Springs who have been \nkilled in Iraq, 226; total Americans killed in Afghanistan, 468; total \nColoradans killed in Afghanistan, 8; and the number of wounded over \n30,000; the number of wounded in Iraq alone 28,711; the number wounded \nin Afghanistan, 1,840.\n  For those of us who have visited Walter Reed, as most of us have, we \nsee the horrors of war with our wounded warriors. It is important that \nwe honor them. It is important that we remember them. It is important \nthat we pray for them in these times and we pray for their families as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, finally, I say thank you to the leadership in the \nSenate, especially to majority leader Harry Reid, the man from \nSearchlight, NV. As he said earlier, even today in some of our \nmeetings, he was a Capitol policeman. He never, frankly, thought \nsomeday he would be elected to Congress and then be elected to the \nSenate and much less to serving as the majority leader essentially in \ncharge of this institution, and yet he is there today.\n  I am very proud of his work, as are all the rest of my colleagues. \nThrough some very difficult times and difficult procedures, he has led \nus to have the robust achievements we have been able to accomplish in \n2007. I am very proud of the fact that he is in charge as the leader of \nthe agent of change as we move forward into the new year.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your time. I thank you for your \nleadership and example in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S15980]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar).

Mr. President, when we come back in January--we are coming \nback on the 22nd--we are going to immediately move to the Indian Health \nCare Reauthorization Act. I have spoken to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Dorgan. We are going to do everything we can to \nfinish that legislation on January 22. If we can't finish it January 22 \nor early on January 23, we are going to move immediately to FISA. I \nhave had a meeting today, for example, with General Hayden and Admiral \nMcConnell, to talk about FISA. I have told them it is going to be very \ndifficult to get this done. It expires on February 1. It is something \nwe need to do. It would be in the interests of everyone to have that \nlegislation extended for a year. I offered to do that earlier \nyesterday, and the White House said, no, that wasn't a good idea.\n  We are going to do everything we can to complete that legislation \nquickly when we get back, after we do the Indian Health Care \nReauthorization Act.\n  Also, one of the things we are going to do is, there is one Senator \nwho has held up scores of pieces of legislation that have already \npassed the House. These bills have all been reported out of the \ncommittee by Senators Bingaman and Domenici. They are very important \npieces of legislation dealing with the jurisdiction of that committee. \nWhat we are going to do, and what we have done, is all those bills that \nhave passed the House of Representatives, we put them into one vehicle \nover here so we will have one vote.\n  I have offered to Senator Coburn, who is holding these up--I said, I \nam willing to let you have two or three votes on these. We have been \nmore than reasonable waiting to work through this, in my opinion. I \nthink it is unreasonable that he has held these up. We are going to \ncomplete this legislation one way or the other as soon as we complete \nthese other items I mentioned.\n  I will have more to say about this in a little while, but I spoke to \nthe Republican leader today, and we both have a good feeling about how \nwe have ended the session. Both of us didn't get exactly what we \nwanted, but there was a feeling of cooperation and bipartisanship. I \nhope that spills over into next year--I certainly hope so, and I know \nSenator McConnell feels that way.\n  I would like to spend a minute on nominations.\n  My staff, Ron Weich, who does such a wonderful job for me, indicates \nI said FISA should be extended for 1 year. It should be extended for 30 \ndays, so we have an opportunity to legislate that during that period of \ntime. I appreciate my staff correcting that statement I made.\n  We have been working with the White House for the last several days \nin an effort to reach an agreement that works for both sides regarding \nnominations. We were unable to reach such an agreement before the \nThanksgiving holiday. That led to my calling the Senate into pro forma \nsessions to avoid the President's very objectionable recess \nappointments. My hope was I could avoid that prospect for the coming \nholiday. I tried very hard to work with the President. But he indicated \nhe would still use the period of time that we would be in recess to \nappoint objectionable nominees.\n  I said go ahead--here are some. We will give you these--for example, \nthe head of the Federal Aviation Agency, somebody on the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve Board, the Chemical Safety Board. Go \nahead and do those recess appointments.\n  He wanted a person who cannot get through the Judiciary Committee to \nbe Assistant Counsel to the Attorney General, a man by the name of \nBradbury. I talked to various members of the Judiciary Committee \nyesterday. They don't think the man is somebody who should be confirmed \nby the Senate. I would say, without a lot of hesitation, there is no \nchance he would be confirmed. It is my understanding he has already \nbeen recess appointed. I can't understand why the President wouldn't do \nwhat we have suggested.\n  My only solution is to prevent this and call a pro forma session \nagain. I thought these jobs--there are more than 50 of them, career-\nending opportunities for a lot of these people. These are very \nimportant jobs. All of them have to be confirmed by the Senate. I could \nbe a Grinch. I could tell the President I will not move any nominations \ngiven his demand to make controversial recess appointments. That would \nmean more than 50 Republican nominees would not move forward today. So \nduring the holidays it would be: Well, maybe when we come back in a \nmonth we can do something.\n  The Republicans would get about 60 nominations. We would get eight.\n  But I am not going to do that. I am not going to be the Grinch. We \nare going to go into pro forma sessions so the President cannot appoint \npeople we think are objectionable, but I am not going to meet \nstubbornness with stubbornness. It is not good for the body politic; \njust because someone is being unreasonable means we have to be \nunreasonable.\n  Think about this. Because the President wants one person whom we \ncannot get out of the Judiciary Committee, he is willing to hold \neverything up. It doesn't sound like much of a compromise to me. I \ncan't understand the rationale behind this.\n  I have spoken with Josh Bolton. Josh Bolton is a very pleasant person \nto deal with. He has a boss, and that is the President of the United \nStates. So I called Josh Bolton and told him, as unreasonable as I \nthink our President is being, I am not going to be unreasonable. We are \ngoing to confirm these appointments this evening; as I said, about 60 \nfor the Republicans, 8 for the Democrats. And I will keep the Senate in \npro forma session to block the President from doing an end run around \nthe Senate and the Constitution with his controversial nominations.\n  I hope this is a Christmas present for these people. These are \nimportant jobs, and I wish them well in their jobs. I wish them all a \nMerry Christmas and a happy New Year with their new positions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15980-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND THE \n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the Republicans have taken the very unusual \nstep of objecting to a majority vote on their own nominee, Mr. Hans von \nSpakovsky. I offered them that option. The option was rejected. Mr. von \nSpakovsky is a very controversial nominee, but I said: Let's have a \nvote on him. Now, remember, we are not asking for 60 votes. We say: \nHave a simple majority vote. By that action, not accepting that offer, \nthe Republicans are blocking the Senate from ensuring that the Federal \nElection Commission can function at perhaps the most important time--\nduring a Presidential election year. What they have done will ensure \nthat the FEC is unable to enforce the new ethics bill we enacted. The \nagency is in the midst of rulemakings on that law.\n  There are two conclusions I draw from the objections of the \nRepublicans: First, even Republicans find Mr. von Spakovsky so \nobjectionable that he would be defeated on a majority vote; and second, \nfacing possible defeat for their own nominee, the Republicans would \nprefer to hold the remaining three unobjectionable nominees hostage and \nrender the FEC unable to function in the next election.\n  We have offered them a majority vote. We said: We will take a \nposition, a majority vote on all three. They said: No, now we want 60. \nSo the FEC will be unable to function during the next election.\n  Both the New York Times and Washington Post recently editorialized \nabout the absolutely critical importance of ensuring we have a \nfunctional FEC during a Presidential election that promises to bring \nrecord sums of money into our political system. Democrats agree. We are \nprepared to have a majority vote on each of the nominations. But this \nnominee has been controversial since the President recess-appointed him \nalmost 2 years ago. That controversy stems from his well-documented \nwork as a Justice Department lawyer in the Voting Rights Section.\n  The Republicans say he is a person whose work on matters that \nsuppress minority voting, such as voter ID and the Texas redistricting, \nhas nothing to do with his responsibility at the FEC, which we feel \nbordered on illegality, if not being unethical. Work on matters to \nsuppress minority voting has everything to do with the Federal Election \nCommission. So I take issue with their statements that it means \nnothing.\n  The problem my colleagues and I have with him is that his prior work \ndemonstrates that he is at least a partisan manipulator of our Federal \nelection laws. That, it seems to me, is highly relevant to the advice-\nand-consent duty the Constitution puts in our care as Senators, but \nthat is a decision each Senator in this body should be permitted to \nmake. We are not going to be able to do that. Republican action today \nprevents us from making it.\n  Remember, a simple majority vote on their nominee, but they want 60 \nvotes on ours.\n  It is important to note how we got here and the concessions that have \nbeen made on our side.\n  His history, not surprisingly, led to a number of Senators on our \nside of the aisle, Democrats--we imposed a 60-vote threshold on the \nnomination. We originally wanted 60 votes on this nomination. On the \nother side of the aisle, Republicans demanded that the Senate only \nconsider the nomination of the remaining three noncontroversial \nnominees if he was confirmed by the Senate. These two positions could \nnot be further apart. In view of that impasse, I have long suggested \nthat the White House withdraw his name and substitute a new name of the \nPresident's choosing. Despite this, the nomination has endured.\n  As the days ran short in this session, my Democratic colleagues \nindicated to me that they would reconsider and allow a majority vote on \neach of the nominees. That resulted in my ability to make this offer to \nRepublicans of a majority vote, and I thank my colleagues for their \nwork with me in this regard. I appreciate very much that we could have \na 50-vote margin on this controversial nomination and on the rest. That \nwork should have meant that the FEC would continue to function. The \nFederal Election Commission will not be able to function. It should \nhave meant that campaign finance laws would be enforced in the next \nelection. It should have meant that the FEC would be able to complete \nits new binding rules as it relates to bundling, but it will not \nbecause Republicans have obstructed a vote on these nominees, including \na vote on their own.\n  The Republicans seek confirmation even though a majority of Senators \nmay not support that nomination. That, it seems to me, is truly \nextraordinary.\n  A lot has been said about the precedents of FEC appointments. A \nRepublican Senator came out here yesterday and said there is precedent \nfor this. Arguments made yesterday are that essentially FEC nominations \nalways move as a package, always move together. But that is, of course, \nsimply not true. It is true that FEC nominees have usually moved as \npairs by unanimous consent, and that pairing of nominees is generally a \nrule on all boards and commissions: Here is a Republican, here is a \nDemocrat; let's get it done. We do not need a lot of time on the floor. \nThat is a fact, not by reason of precedent as much as by reason of \nnecessity. Nomination pairing occurs because it gives both sides a \nreason to come to the table and confirm nominees.\n\n  There are also cases of FEC nominees not moving together by unanimous \nconsent. One recent case is that of former FEC Commissioner Brad Smith. \nMr. Smith was very controversial on our side of the aisle and required \na rollcall vote, which he got. He succeeded in winning confirmation.\n  There are also cases I have known where a Republican President did \nnot respect the Democratic selection of an FEC nominee. For example, \nPresident Reagan refused to send the Democratic selection of Tom Harris \nbecause the Republicans objected to his nomination.\n  These different examples do show there is no single precedent about \nhow nominations are handled. As is so often the case of nominations, a \nlot depends, as it should, on the actual identity of the nominee in \nquestion. I do think, however, that as a rule the offer of a majority \nvote on a nominee is presumptively fair. If the nominee is so \ncontroversial that he cannot win the support of a majority of Senators, \nthe Constitution and the rules of this body dictate the appropriate \noutcome for that nominee.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues on the other side will reconsider \nthis position. I would hope this White House would reconsider their \nsupport for this controversial nomination. If they do not, the \nresponsibility for a defunct FEC rests squarely on their shoulders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15981-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15981-S15984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have reached the end of a long, hectic, \nat times contentious and frustrating but unquestionably productive \nfirst year of the 110th Congress.\n  We welcomed back our friend and colleague, Senator Tim Johnson, who \nhas made an extraordinary recovery, and we were so happy this week to \nsee him walk in the Senate Chamber.\n  We lost a friend in Craig Thomas, said hello to his successor, Dr. \nJohn Barrasso, and said goodbye to Senator Trent Lott last night.\n  We held an unusual three Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies, three \nof them this year. That is very unusual.\n  We honored the Tuskegee Airmen for showing America that valor is \ncolor-blind.\n\n[[Page S15982]]\n\n  We awarded a Gold Medal to Dr. Norm Borlaugh for putting food on the \ntables of billions of people--not millions but billions. This scientist \nfigured out a way to grow a lot of food very quickly.\n  The Dalai Lama was awarded the Gold Medal for planting seeds of peace \nthroughout the world.\n  Of course, we tried to address the major issues that affect us at \nhome and abroad. Although these efforts occasionally ended in \nfrustration, the record will show we also made real progress on behalf \nof the American people in spite of the fact that yesterday the record \nwas broken--62 filibusters in 1 year; in 1 year, they broke the 2-year \nrecord. The record previously was 61 filibusters in a 2-year period. \nYesterday, it was broken in a 1-year period.\n  But as we return home to spend the holidays with our families and \nconstituents, all 100 Senators can say with confidence that we have \ntaken steps to make our country safer, stronger, and more secure--I \nguess after last night, with Senator Lott's resignation, all 99 of us.\n  This Congress put working families first. We passed the first \nincrease in the minimum wage in a decade to get the hardest working but \nleast paid Americans more to make ends meet. Remember, 60 percent of \nthe people who draw minimum wage are women, and for the majority of \nthose women, that is the only money they get for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  We passed a bill to help Americans avoid foreclosures and keep their \nhomes. According to RealtyTrac, Nevada has seen 47,000 foreclosure \nfilings this year alone. This legislation is desperately needed.\n  We invested in community health centers, high-risk insurance pools, \nand rural hospitals to give lower income Americans a better chance for \nhealthy lives.\n  We passed--and I was with the President as he signed it at the \nDepartment of Energy building today; he signed a landmark energy bill \nwhich will save consumers money on their heating bills, lower gas \nprices, and begin to stem the tide of global warming. For the first \ntime in 32 years, we have increased fuel-efficiency standards--\nextremely important. We could have done better. I am happy we got this \ndone. We were one vote short because we could not get another \nRepublican, one vote short of passing legislation dealing with energy \nthat would have been so wonderful. It would have given long-term tax \nincentives for our great entrepreneurs in America to invest in solar, \nwind, geothermal, bio. But we will be back in the next few months and \ntry that again. I feel confident that we will pick up another vote.\n  We also have invested in education with funding for title 1, special \neducation, teacher quality grants, afterschool programs, Heat Start, \nand student financial aid--the most significant change in higher \neducation as it relates to keeping kids in school and letting them go \nto school since the GI bill of rights. On higher education, we believe \nthat all children, regardless of the wealth of their parents, should \nhave an opportunity to go to college.\n  This Congress also made our country safer.\n  After 3 years of inaction by the Republican-controlled Congress, we \nfinally have implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, \nwhich helps secure our most at-risk cities. It gives our first \nresponders the communications tools they need in an emergency and \nimproves oversight of our intelligence and homeland security systems.\n  We provided funds to replace the equipment our National Guard and \nReserve have lost because of the war in Iraq.\n  We secured permanent funds for western wildfires and other disaster \nrelief that makes our country safer.\n  This Congress has supported our courageous troops with more than \nwords but action. Despite the President's opposition, we gave every man \nand women in uniform an across-the-board 3.5-percent pay raise. We \nprovided much needed funds for body armor and other protective gear to \nkeep our troops safe during this combat that they fight in Afghanistan \nand Iraq.\n  We exposed the awful neglect at Walter Reed and other military health \ncare centers. We passed the Wounded Warrior Act and other legislation \nthat ensures the veterans receive the physical and mental health care \nthey need.\n  A fair reading of the Record will show that we have not accomplished \neverything we had hoped. This was not for lack of effort by us. On \nissue after issue, a majority of the Senate expressed support for \nchange, only to be thwarted by Republicans in the minority wedded to \nbusiness as usual, the status quo.\n  On Iraq, a bipartisan majority of Senators consistently supported \nchanging course. Like the American people, this majority is saddened to \nsay that after nearly 5 years, nearly 4,000 American lives lost, more \nthan 30,000 wounded, a third of them grievously wounded, and some say \nas much as $800 billion spent, there appears to be no end in sight for \nthe Iraq war. But last night, I think we showed that even Republicans \nare losing support for this war. The President asked for $200 billion; \nthey got $70 billion. So even the Republicans understood that the \nPresident should not have a blank check.\n  Unfortunately, the President still refused to heed the call of the \nAmerican people to responsibly end the war, as Republican supporters in \nCongress continue to stand by him. On more than 40 separate occasions, \nthe President's supporters denied the Senate from even voting on a \nchange in course. Only once did they step aside and let the majority \nspeak, and on this occasion the President wielded his veto pen and \nhalted our efforts to begin a phased redeployment of our forces from \nIraq so we can focus on those who attacked us on September 11, bin \nLaden and al-Qaida.\n  Just today, the Washington Post reports that the people of Iraq \nbelieve they would be better able to reconcile the nation without our \ncombat presence.\n  A major story in the Washington Post today pronounced that the Shias \nand all their different sects, the Sunnis and all the different Sunni \nsects, and the Kurds, all agree that the invasion is the problem in \nIraq today. We are an occupying force. I quote: The Iraqis believe our \npresence ``is the primary root of the violent differences among them \nand see the departure of `occupying forces' as the key to national \nreconciliation . . . ''\n  This has been clear for a long time, and the President should start \nlistening. The war will soon be starting its sixth year. Even as the \nwar rages on, this Congress has made a difference. Before Democrats \ntook control of Congress, the President's Secretary of Defense was \nnamed Rumsfeld. He and the Bush White House and the Cheney White House \nconducted the war with total impunity. No dissent was tolerated. The \npatriotism of those who raised questions was attacked openly. Billions \nof taxpayer dollars were given to companies such as Halliburton with \nlittle or no accountability. But this year, Democrats have fought the \nPresident's recklessness in the harsh light of day. We forced the \nPresident to set benchmarks for legislative and political progress and \nrequired regular reports on whether these benchmarks were being met, \nwhich has shown that the surge has failed to reach its main objective--\nas set forth by the President, not us--political reconciliation. We \ncompelled General Petraeus to testify. He has said repeatedly the war \ncannot be won militarily; it can only be won politically. We brought to \nlight the Blackwater controversy and have begun to untangle the web of \nmassive financial mismanagement in Iraq that has cost American \ntaxpayers dearly.\n  Do I feel enough has been done? Of course not. Too many Republican \nSenators continue to fall in lockstep with the President on the war. It \nis frustrating for all of us who so desperately want to change course. \nThe Iraq war has not been the only source of frustration. Bush-Cheney \nRepublicans have set an all-time record for obstruction. They have \nalmost made a sport of it. If my Republican colleagues had reached \nacross the aisle to work with us more often, as we tried to do with \nthem, they would have found us willing and eager to find more common \nground.\n  Children's health insurance, about 15 million people have no health \ninsurance in the country. But sadly, some of those people are little \npeople. They are children. What we tried to do and did do on a \nbipartisan basis--and I appreciate my Republican colleagues for \nsticking with us--we passed twice a\n\n[[Page S15983]]\n\nchildren's health initiative that the President vetoed, a bill that \nwould give 10 million children the opportunity to go to the doctor when \nthey are not feeling well or even maybe for a checkup. They would have \na place to go if they were in an automobile accident or some injury was \nsuffered. The President vetoed that. So what do we have now? We have \n5.5 million less children who have more limited benefits than we would \nhave given them. Instead of 10 million children with a very nice \ninsurance policy, we have 4.5 million children with a bad insurance \npolicy--better than nothing but not a good one.\n  It is my goal for the coming year to redouble our efforts of finding \ncommon ground. I am hopeful my Republican colleagues will join us. I \nbelieve this year's session will be remembered more for progress than \nsetbacks. Yesterday Senator McConnell said: ``We have come to a very \nsuccessful conclusion of this year's Congress.''\n  I agree and thank my Republican counterpart for those words. He and I \nhave gone through some difficult times this year. The Senate has gone \nthrough some difficult times. Senator McConnell and I have criticized \neach other at times, never personally but on a political basis. That is \nhow it is supposed to be. Senator McConnell has been at all times a \ngentleman. I have done my best to reciprocate.\n  I thank my 50 Democratic Senators I have the honor of being able to \nbe the leader of for entrusting me with the office of majority leader. \nI am grateful for the opportunity to be a Senator. I am grateful for \nthe opportunity to be the leader of these 50 wonderful men and women. I \nwill continue to do the best I can during the next year, recognizing my \nfailings and weaknesses, but also working on what strengths I have to \nthe best of my ability.\n  I also take an opportunity to thank this staff, the people before the \nPresiding Officer, who do everything they can to make us look good. \nThey work so hard. Some of us got home by midnight last night. Many of \nthese people were here much later than that. When we get here in the \nmorning, they are here earlier than we are. These are people who do all \nkinds of different work. I have been in Congress for 25 years. I don't \nunderstand all of what they do, but what they do makes our jobs \nmeaningful and successful.\n  As we speak, we have plainclothes police officers here to protect us \nfrom the evil people who are trying every day to infiltrate this \nbeautiful building and do harm to us and this building. I was a Capitol \npoliceman, very proud of that. I carried a gun for the U.S. Capitol \nPolice when I was going to law school. I am always trying to recognize \ntheir good work on our behalf.\n  Without identifying individuals by name, I am so grateful for the \nhelp I get. But I would be remiss if I did not mention two people, and \nthat is Marty Paone, whom I depend on every day I am here--there are \nfew hours I am here that I don't depend on him--and, of course, Lula \nDavis who runs this floor with an iron hand. I am not going to go \nthrough the entire staff, Trish and Tim and everybody, but I wanted to \ngive special recognition to those two people who do so much for me on a \ndaily basis. Then my personal staff: My chief of staff Gary Myrick, who \nworks so hard and is separated from his family a lot more than he wants \nto be. That includes my entire staff, who devote long hours to me and \nthe Senate and to our country. I am very grateful.\n  As I told my caucus today, these staff people are so well educated, \nso well trained, do so many different things. But they are interested \nin public service, trying to make this country a better place. That is \nwhat we are all here trying to do for our country. I wish every one a \nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as we bring the session to a close, I \nwant to spend a moment speaking about how far we have come this year. \nOur leader, who was speaking about accomplishments, is someone whom we \nshould all be thanking for his leadership in bringing us to a point \nwhere we have been making changes that affect middle-class families all \nacross America in a very positive way. There is a lot more to do. We \nare anxious, frustrated, pushing hard, because there is a lot more to \ndo. But we have made a great start. We have made a downpayment on the \nchange families are asking us to make. It has not been easy because we \nhave seen an effort of continually trying to block change, of \nfilibusters which are a way to drag things out, slow things down, stop \nthings from happening. It is quite extraordinary.\n  In the past, the highest number of filibusters was 61 over a 2-year \nperiod. Our Republican colleagues actually beat that in 1 year, 62 \ndifferent times running the clock out, slowing things down. It was \nextraordinary to me as a member of the Agriculture Committee--and the \ndistinguished Senator in the chair is also a committee member as well--\nto see almost 3 weeks of filibustering on the farm bill, an effort to \naddress food security and energy security and move us forward on farm \npolicy. Fortunately, we were able to get beyond that. But we have been \nable to get beyond this extraordinary wall of objections over and over \nagain because of the amazing and consistent and dedicated leadership of \nour leader and all of those in leadership, our committee chairs and \nothers who have been so dogged and diligent about wanting change to \nhappen.\n  I did want to particularly recognize Senator Reid, who is more \ncommitted to our fight to maintain the American dream and quality of \nlife for families and businesses and farmers and Americans all across \nthe country than anybody I know. I thank him for that.\n  We have achieved tremendous gains. We have seen change happen. We \nhave raised the minimum wage this year. We have created open doors in a \nreal way for people to go to college--for low-income families, we \nraised the Pell grant twice this year--but also to make sure that \nmiddle-income students can afford to borrow at lower interest rates, \ncutting interest rates in half in order make it possible to go to \ncollege and have the American dream. We have passed so many different \nbills that address our safety and security and opportunity for \nfamilies. There is so much more to do. But we are focused. As we come \nto the end of this year and we think about all of what is affecting \nfamilies today, all the pressures that families feel, it is important \nto say one more time that we understand, we get it. We are working very \nhard because time is of the essence.\n  Frankly, there are things that should have been done that haven't \nbeen done. We are going to be right back at it in January.\n  I am proud of the fact that we have addressed one of the major \nconcerns for families in Michigan and all across the country who face \nthe loss of a home because of the mortgage crisis, because of predatory \nlending practices or other circumstances in which they find themselves \nin a situation of losing their home.\n  Last week on Friday we were able to pass FHA reform that will allow \nmore people to get refinancing for their homes. This is an important \nstep. I am pleased to have led the effort to make sure the law was \nchanged so that if somebody loses their home or refinances below their \nmortgage value, they don't end up getting hit with another tax bill on \ntop of losing their home. We have a lot of families right now who are \ncoming up to Christmas. They don't have a place to put the Christmas \ntree. They don't have a home now, or they are worried about whether \nthey will be able to have their home next Christmas. There are \ntremendous pressures that families are experiencing on all sides.\n  We have been able to take two steps to address that: one, to make \nsure that if a family finds themselves in that situation, they don't \nalso have the insult of adding a tax bill to their economic \ncrisis. That is great. I am very proud of that. I am proud we were able \nto work together with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the \nHouse and in the Senate and the President. I commend the President for \nworking with us on that issue. I am hopeful he will do more of that. We \nneed him working with us on hundreds of things that will make a \ndifference in people's lives. But I am pleased in this one area where \nwe were able to do that.\n\n[[Page S15984]]\n\n  People are feeling squeezed. As the distinguished Presiding Officer \nknows, people are feeling squeezed on all sides in their lives. Too \nmany people are seeing their wages go down, if they have a job. They \nsee their health care costs go up, their gas prices go up, their health \ncare costs go up--all the costs--the costs of college going up.\n  One by one, we are addressing those issues. We are focused on making \nchange happen, to help families working hard every day who want to make \nsure the American dream is there for their kids and for their \ngrandkids, who love this country. They are people who love this country \nand say: Hey, what about us? Is anybody paying attention to us? The \nmajority of Americans who are working hard every single day, following \nthe rules, who love their family, love their faith, and want to know \nsomebody is paying attention to their needs and their lives and their \ndesire to have that American dream and to have the American way of \nlife. So we understand that.\n  I am proud to be part of the majority that has made a commitment to \naddress those things--whether it is bringing down the cost of college, \nraising wages, being able to address the costs of gas and energy; \nwhether it is addressing food and nutrition and conservation and \nalternative fuels or the mortgage crisis.\n  The common theme for us is: Making change happen for middle-class \nAmericans and those who love our country and want us to help them be \nable to keep that American dream, by having the rules be fair and \nhaving it make sense for them in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15984-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15984-S15985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to offer a \nunanimous consent request to pass H.R. 4341, which is a 3-month \nextension of something called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. We \ncall it TAA.\n  But first I wish to speak for a moment about this program, because \nwhen we talk about families, when we talk about middle-class families--\npeople who love this country, who play by the rules every day, and want \nto know that they can take care of their kids and have a job and a home \nand all those things we want for our children--we have a group of \npeople in this country who, through no fault of their own, have found \nthemselves losing their job because of this global economy we have--\nsomething called trade, jobs being shipped offshore.\n  Certainly, I support trade. We all support trade. But I want to \nexport our products, not our jobs. Back when the free trade laws were \npassed, NAFTA and others, there was a commitment made by the Federal \nGovernment to help those who are caught in the middle, who lost their \njob because of trade policy.\n  Their job goes away, and the Federal Government is the one passing \nthese trade laws. So the Federal Government said: OK, we are going to \nhelp people transition to new jobs, to be able to get the help, the \nsupport they need--some help for health care in the short run and be \nable to go back to college, go to community college, go to trade \nschool, whatever they want to do to be able to transition, to be able \nto keep their standard of living, and, again, to keep their way of \nlife.\n  We are in a situation right now where the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram will expire at the end of this year, and we have been pushing \nvery hard for a simple 3-month extension. The House sent to us a simple \n3-month extension of the current law until we can revise and update the \nlaw.\n  Now, I have to also say, I am very pleased, as a member of the \nFinance Committee, to be working with our chairman, to have joined him \nin introducing a very important bill to improve trade adjustment \nassistance, to be able to expand what we can do to more adequately meet \nthe needs of workers and families and communities and small businesses \nthat are impacted by unfair trade situations or the loss of jobs \nthrough trade.\n  But, right now, we have an immediate situation, an immediate \nsituation going on that will affect thousands--tens of thousands, \nhundreds of thousands--of Americans across the country if this law \nexpires. We have been doing everything possible to be able to simply \nget a 3-month extension. We did that once back in September--a 3-month \nextension. We are asking for another 3-month extension so we can pass \nthis broader, more up-to-date law that will help more people.\n  When I think about this issue, it is something that is shocking to \nme, to think we would even have to be struggling with our Republican \ncolleagues about a 3-month extension. I think about Greenville, MI, on \nthe west side of Michigan, a town of about 8,000 people, who saw their \nElectrolux plant--they made refrigerators--that employed 2,700 people--\nthey did a great job; they worked in three shifts; they were making a \nprofit--but the company decided they could make a bigger profit if they \nmoved to Mexico.\n  After a lot of discussion with the State, myself, and others in the \nFederal Government--how could we help them be able to stay--they said: \nDo you know what. You can't compete with $1.57 an hour and no health \nbenefits, no pension benefits in Mexico. So they left.\n  The people in Greenville, MI, have been counting on the Federal \nGovernment to keep its promise through trade adjustment assistance, to \nbe able to help them pick themselves up and continue their lives.\n  This is not some theoretical debate. I know these people. I know \npeople in communities all across Michigan who have been told: Gee, we \nare sorry this current race to the bottom in trade, where you go to the \nlowest wage around the world, is affecting you. We are sorry about \nthis, but at least there is the thing called TAA, trade adjustment \nassistance, that can help you.\n  Well, right now this is running out. It may not be there for new \npeople who find themselves in a situation similar to the folks in \nGreenville. That is outrageous. When we think about the obstruction \nthat has gone on, on this floor over and over and over again, the 62 \ndifferent filibusters, the obstructions, the objections that have gone \non, you would think, a few days before Christmas, the holidays--a time \nof charity and good will--we could come together, that our colleagues \nwould join with us and simply allow a current law to continue for 3 \nmonths--just 3 months. That is it; just 3 months.\n\n  Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues have held this issue hostage \nover a totally unrelated issue. They have wanted to tie this to a \ndispute regarding the FAA. Certainly, the FAA is important, but they \nwant to tie it to a dispute there and are blocking our efforts to \nsimply move forward on a 3-month extension of something that directly \nhelps working people in this country--families, communities. It helps \nfamilies be able to stay intact, be able to move into this new economy, \nnew world that everybody is talking about that involves a different \nkind of trade policy.\n  Our leader has offered that we will deal with trade adjustment \nassistance, a 3-month extension, but also address the unrelated \nRepublican FAA proposal on its own, that both would be dealt with but \ndealt with separately. For some unknown reason, that was not \nacceptable. There has been a desire to tie them together and to object \nto proceeding on this very important effort to support families and to \nmake sure nobody falls through the cracks come January 1.\n  That is the least we can do in the Senate. If this program expires, \nunemployed men and women all around America are going to be in a \nposition to be denied the help they need to be able to continue on with \ntheir lives. Those who are currently involved in the program will be \nable to continue to receive help, but I can assure you, coming from a \nState in great transition right now, with thousands of people falling \ninto that situation, where they need trade adjustment help, we have \npeople who have been waiting and waiting and waiting and will find \nthemselves in a situation on January 1 with no help.\n  This is not acceptable. This is absolutely not acceptable. It does \nnot have to happen. There is absolutely no reason for this. We have a \nsimple House bill in front of us--no secrets; very simple. Very simple: \nextend this critical program through Christmas, through New Year's. Get \nus into the new year so we can work out any other differences and let \nfamilies be able to know we understand and we are not going to use \nunemployed men and\n\n[[Page S15985]]\n\nwomen, who are unemployed through no fault of their own--the plant \npicks up and goes to Mexico, goes to China, goes someplace else. This \nis not their fault. They want to work. They are great workers. They are \ngoing to continue to find a way to work. But to hold them as pawns at \nthis time is shameful.\n  So, Mr. President, I am being told there is going to be a Republican \nobjection. I received a note to that effect. I am told there is no one \nhere who is able to object at this time. But due to the courtesies of \nthe Senate, I will not ask, although I am very tempted, I have to tell \nyou--but due to the courtesies involved in the Senate, and the rules of \nthe Senate, I will not proceed to ask for unanimous consent because, in \nfact, I have received a notice that the Republicans will, in fact, be \nobjecting one more time, one more time, one more time to our ability to \nsupport and help working men and women and their families for the next \n3 months.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15985-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING AIP CONTRACT AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Congress is currently considering proposals \nto extend contract authority for the Airport Improvement Program, which \nis known as AIP. If lawmakers--that is us--are unable to reach an \nagreement and fail to pass legislation extending contract authority \nbefore Congress adjourns for the year--that will be in a few minutes--\nthe funding for critical safety, security, and capacity projects at \nairports throughout the country will be delayed.\n  The omnibus does not contain any funding authority from the aviation \ntrust to pay for airport grants. The short-term extension includes such \nfunding authority for 6 months and has formula changes that allow the \nDepartment of Transportation to run the program with only half a year's \nfunding. If the separate FAA extension isn't passed, the Department \nwill not be able to make any grants to airports.\n  Lack of contract authority for the Airport Improvement Program grants \nwould cause significant impact. Unless rectified through authorization, \nthe program would lose a construction season for airports that have had \nto bid contracts early due to winter weather for work in the spring and \nsummer.\n  Delaying these funds would be particularly hard on small airports \nthat rely on this funding as the primary source of revenue for \ninfrastructure projects and those airports in parts of the country with \nshort construction cycles.\n  Since Congress has been unable to pass a multiyear Federal Aviation \nAdministration authorization bill, airports are urging Congress to pass \nlegislation that will extend the authority through the end of March for \na total of 6 months of funding.\n  Extending this contract authority through the end of March would \nprovide airports with more than $1.8 billion in AIP funds. Extending \nthe AIP contract authority through the end of March will allow the FAA \nto fully fund the Letter of Intent Program, which provides funding for \ncritical infrastructure projects at major commercial airports around \nthe country.\n  It was my intention to ask unanimous consent to pass S. 2530, the \nFederal Aviation Administration Extension Act for 2007, which was \nintroduced earlier. It is my understanding that there would be a \nRepublican objection, so, sadly, I will withhold asking for that \nconsent.\n  I am disappointed that this is not going to be able to go forward. \nThere are many airports around the country, airports in Pennsylvania, \nand I am sure in Nevada and other parts of the country that, simply \nwill be unable to do what they need to do for the people who are so \ndependent on them, especially these rural airports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15985-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, last week, I was pleased to support \npassage of the FHA Modernization Act, S. 2338. This legislation will \nupdate the FHA program so that it once again is better able to provide \nmany low-income and first-time homebuyers another option as they try to \nsecure a mortgage for a new home or to refinance an existing mortgage \nunder more affordable terms.\n  As some consumers experience credit tightening in the home mortgage \nand other financial markets, a byproduct of issues in the subprime \nmortgage market, the availability of stable financing alternatives is \ncritically important to reducing the negative effects of the current \nmarket turmoil.\n  While the FHA Modernization Act is not a silver bullet, it represents \na responsible step the federal government can take to benefit thousands \nof borrowers around the country.\n  Additionally, in the last several days Congress passed a measure, \nwhich I cosponsored, that encourages homeowners and their lenders to \nwork out alternative payment plans that prevent individuals from losing \ntheir homes. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, H.R. 3648, will \nprotect taxpayers from an IRS tax bill in the event they have a portion \nof their mortgage debt forgiven. Under current law, homeowners entering \nforeclosure or refinancing their mortgage at a lower loan value due to \na drop in housing prices, face an unfair and unwarranted tax. The last \nthing someone struggling to stay in their home needs is a huge tax \nobligation on income that they never saw. I expect the President to \nsign this legislation into law in the coming days.\n  In addition to the legislation recently advanced by Congress, the \nFederal Reserve proposed a rule this week that would prohibit lenders \nfrom making so-called ``no documentation'' loans where a borrower's \nincome or assets are not verified; prohibit lenders from engaging ``in \na pattern or practice'' of lending without considering a borrower's \nability to repay a loan; restrict prepayment penalties on certain\n\n[[Page S15986]]\n\nloans; and require lenders to establish escrow accounts for property \ntaxes and homeowners insurance.\n  The proposed rule would also restrict ``yield spread premiums'' that \nexceed the amount a consumer had agreed to in advance; prohibit \ncoercion of an appraiser to misrepresent the value of a home; prohibit \ncertain deceptive advertising practices; and improve certain truth-in-\nlending disclosures.\n  While I look forward, as a member of the Banking Committee, to \nreviewing the Fed's proposed regulations in the coming weeks, the \ncommittee should proceed cautiously as it considers more aggressive \nattempts to address current issues in the housing market. With the \nhousing correction already under way and with the restricted credit \navailability that we are now experiencing, some of the proposals that \nhave been floated may have the unintended consequence of exacerbating \nreduced credit availability at exactly the wrong time. Others may \nunnecessarily use taxpayer dollars to encourage unwise behavior in the \nfuture.\n  Any further legislation in this area needs to be thoroughly reviewed \nto ensure that it will have a positive effect on homeownership in this \ncountry, both now and in the future, and not simply rushed through \nCongress for the sake of political expediency.\n  One piece of legislation that the Senate Banking Committee should \naddress as soon as possible is GSE reform. The House passed legislation \nearlier this year that strengthens the oversight of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. With the ongoing difficulties in the housing market, now \nmore than ever it is imperative that Congress act to guard against \nthreats to our capital markets and to protect against any possible \nnegative consequences for taxpayers that could arise without proper \noversight of these institutions. Fannie and Freddie have had a number \nof problems over the past several years and are so centrally important \nto the mortgage market that any further problems could have serious \nrepercussions that could spread throughout our financial markets.\n  The GSE's regulator needs to be strengthened so that Fannie and \nFreddie can continue their important role in supporting the mortgage \nmarket. Any efforts to enhance their role in the mortgage market must \nnot move forward until fundamental regulatory reform is enacted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15986-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15986-S15987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, last night I indicated my strong concerns \nabout the omnibus appropriations bill, a bill that I expected to \ninclude all domestic spending as well as funding for the war in Iraq. \nNotably, I discussed my grave misgivings about funding for the \nPresident's disastrous, ongoing and ill-conceived war. I also raised my \nunease with last-minute additions of loan guarantees for questionable \nenergy sources, such as the building of new nuclear power and for coal-\nrelated energy, especially coal to liquids.\n  Last night, I voted against an amendment to provide the President \nwith a blank check for his war. Until even later in the evening, I \nthought that the war funding would be attached to the domestic spending \nlegislation set for vote that evening. However, it was clear by the \ntime of the domestic spending vote that the Iraq war funds were kept \nseparate. I remain very concerned with the nuclear and coal loan \nguarantees that were inserted, I decided that, on balance, the domestic \nspending bill that would fund, among other important priorities, \ncommunity health centers and health care for many Americans in need, \ndeserved my support. I regret the insertion of the ill-conceived loan \nguarantees and will work with my colleagues to address them.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the famous test pilot Chuck Yeager once \nsaid: ``Any landing you can walk away from is a good one. But a perfect \nlanding is one where you can fly the plane the next day.''\n  When it comes to homeland security, the Omnibus appropriations bill \nwhich Congress approved last night is a good landing in the sense that \nwe can all go home for the recess having improved funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security over the President's wholly inadequate \nbudget request.\n  But it is not a perfect landing because it leaves some important \ninitiatives stuck on the ground due to either a lack of funding or \nmisplaced priorities.\n  First the good news: Overall the omnibus includes $38.7 billion for \nthe Department of Homeland Security, DHS, for fiscal year 2008, \nincluding $2.7 billion in emergency funds for border security and other \nneeds.\n  This is significant improvement over the President's $34.3 billion \nrequest, with the additional money going to help our first responders \nand State and local governments purchase equipment and receive the \ntraining they need to effectively respond to man-made or natural \ndisasters; to better protect our ports and railways; to increase \nsecurity on our borders and in our airports, and to confront the \nlooming threat of terrorists attacking us at home with improvised \nexplosive devices, or IEDs.\n  Specifically, the bill includes $950 million for FEMA's State \nHomeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP--the full level authorized in \nthe Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of \n2007, which Senator Collins and I authored. SHSGP grants provide \ncritical support for prevention, planning and response efforts by State \nand local governments. They help fund training, exercises and equipment \nfor our Nation's first responders and support fusion centers that allow \nofficials to share information that can prevent terrorist attacks.\n  The omnibus also includes a combined $750 million for the assistance \nto firefighters grants and SAFER grants programs, both of which provide \nvital support to the nation's courageous fire fighters.\n  Also, the emergency management performance grants program, which \nsupports all-hazards planning and preparedness, received an increase of \n$100 million over last year's level for a total of $300 million.\n  And a new interoperable communications grant program, included in the \n911 implementation bill, will receive $50 million in funding a positive \nstep towards what I hope will be a greater commitment to provide \ndedicated funding for what is still the number one priority of state \nand local officials.\n  FEMA which is in the midst of a much needed transformation prescribed \nin the Post Katrina Emergency Management Act, which I also co-authored \nwith Senator Collins also does well in the Omnibus, receiving $724 \nmillion $189 million above its fiscal year 2007 level. This includes an \nadditional $100 million for FEMA's core operations programs, which are \ncritical to the agency's efforts to turn itself into a world-class \nresponse agency capable of leading our Nation in preparing for and \nresponding to a catastrophe which it clearly was unable to do with \nHurricane Katrina in 2005.\n  Rail and transit security grants receive $400 million, $225 million \nabove 2007. These much needed investments will help improve security in \ntransportation modes which have been largely neglected, relative to \nairline security, even though terrorists have time and again \ndemonstrated that they are primary targets.\n  Port security grants are funded at $400 million as authorized by the \nSAFE Port Act $190 million above last year's level. The legislation \nalso includes $13 million for the secure freight initiative and global \ntrade exchange programs--funding which will further help close another \nglaring weakness in our homeland defenses.\n  I am a vocal proponent of comprehensive immigration reform. This \nincludes reforms to strengthen of our borders. The omnibus moves us \ncloser to that goal.\n  The bill provides $6.8 billion for Customs and Border Protection, \nCBP, to improve security at the borders, including funds to continue \nlimited use of National Guard troops on the border and hire 3,000 \nadditional border patrol agents.\n  The bill also provides $1.2 billion for border security fencing to \ncomplete 370 miles by the end of fiscal year 2008 and almost $15 \nmillion for additional unmanned aerial systems to patrol the border.\n  And the omnibus includes $475 million for the U.S. VISIT program used \nto track the entry and exit of foreign\n\n[[Page S15987]]\n\nvisitors and $36 million for a new electronic travel authorization for \ntravelers from Visa Waiver Program countries which was authorized by \nthe 911 implementation bill.\n  I am also pleased that another initiative I advocated--the \ndevelopment of a national strategy for use of closed circuit \ntelevisions to enhance national security--was included in the final \nomnibus package.\n  The omnibus also helps us strengthen chemical security by providing \n$50 million--a significant increase over the President's original \nrequest--to protect chemical facilities from terrorist attacks. We know \nthat chemical sites pose a serious homeland security vulnerability and \nwe must ensure that DHS can help them enact meaningful security \nmeasures as soon as possible. I am also pleased that this legislation \nsafeguards the ability of states and localities, who are our partners \nin homeland security, to enact stricter chemical security standards \nwhere appropriate.\n  Finally, the omnibus also includes a $10-million increase for the \nOffice of Bombing Prevention that Senator Collins and I added as an \namendment on the floor.\n  We have to confront the fact that highly lethal and simple-to-make \nIEDs have become the preferred weapon of terrorists and the Department \nof Homeland Security must have adequate resources to help State and \nlocal officials defend against this likely threat.\n  But, as I said earlier, there are some problems with this bill and I \nhope we can improve upon it next year.\n  To begin with, this bill contains a record amount of earmarks for \nhomeland security--$443.8 million by my count. Earmarks can be \nvaluable, but I fear that at this kind of record level we run the risk \nof being forced to take money away from more important initiatives.\n  For instance, the pre-disaster mitigation grant program, which was \nnot previously earmarked, now contains 96 specific earmarks totaling \n$51.3 million--nearly half the total appropriation for this program \ndesigned to mitigate the impact of future disasters.\n  Also, regrettably, the omnibus appropriations bill does not include \nfunding for a consolidated headquarters for DHS, which is essential to \nestablishing a unified culture at the Department.\n  Currently, DHS is spread throughout 70 buildings across Washington \nand the Capital region, making communication, coordination, and \ncooperation between DHS components a significant challenge.\n  The elimination of this funding simply prolongs an unacceptable \nstatus quo and hinders the homeland security mission, and I will work \nhard to restore this funding in future appropriations.\n  Finally, I am deeply disappointed that the omnibus bill unnecessarily \ndelays full implementation of the Western Hemisphere travel initiative, \nWHTI, until June 1, 2009.\n  Inadequate inspection of travelers to the United States from Canada, \nthe Caribbean, and Mexico was identified by the 9/11 Commission, the \nGAO, and the State Department as a critical vulnerability to our travel \nsystems. The language hardening the implementation deadline included in \nthe Omnibus bill ties the hands of DHS and prevents it from finalizing \nadditional security enhancements before such date.\n  Again, the Omnibus appropriations bill is a good landing but not a \nperfect one and I hope as we begin wrestling with next year's budget we \ncan make the appropriate fixes that will get certain needed programs \noff the ground.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as vice chairman of the Senate Sportsmen's \nCaucus, I am concerned about misguided efforts by some in Congress to \nban Federal funding from flowing to international wildlife conservation \norganizations and programs that support regulated recreational hunting, \nparticularly on the African continent.\n  The facts are clear. Twenty-three African counties currently license \napproximately 18,500 hunters, generating over $200 million annually in \nthe process. Regulated recreational, sport, and trophy hunting is \nsaving many animal species in Africa. Licensed and regulated tourist \nhunting boosts local economies and propagates wildlife by providing \nforeign governments and villagers a financial incentive to protect and \nconserve local wildlife populations.\n  In September of this year, I joined my colleagues on the leadership \nteam of the Senate Sportsmen's Caucus in sending a letter to our \nconferees negotiating the Department of State and Foreign Operations \nfunding bill with the other Chamber. We laid out the facts and noted \nthat even the National Geographic News reported in March 2007 that \n``trophy hunting is of key importance to conservation in Africa by \ncreating [financial] incentives to promote and retain wildlife as a \nland use over vast areas . . .''\n  Tourist hunting has proven to be a valuable tool to conserve wildlife \nand habitat and has contributed to the survival of the African \nelephant, white and black rhino, leopard, markhor, argali, and other \nspecies.\n  Trophy hunting organizations such as the Dallas Safari Club located \nin my State of Texas have a vested interest in promoting the welfare of \nwildlife and they provide countless resources that eliminate human \nsuffering and improve livelihoods in remote areas of the world by \nconserving wildlife, growing local economies, and reducing poverty.\n  It is my hope that all Members of Congress will recognize the \npositive impact that conservation and hunting organizations have on the \npreservation of species, and that Federal partnership with these groups \nleverages significant private sector contribution to global wildlife \nconservation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15987-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15987-S15988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CIVILIAN RESERVE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has \nbeen pursuing for a number of years the establishment in the State \nDepartment of a civilian reserve to work on postconflict \nreconstruction. Our first meeting on this issue was in December 2003. \nIts need has become increasingly apparent as time has passed, and it is \nnow urgent that we adopt the legislation authorizing the civilian \nreserve and providing the Department the funding and authorities it \nneeds to get the job done.\n  Senator Lugar has provided leadership in both the committee and in \nworking with the executive branch on this issue, and Senator Biden and \nI have worked closely with him in developing the concept and pursuing \nits implementation. In April 2007, Senator Lugar, joined by Senator \nBiden and myself, introduced S. 613, the Reconstruction and \nStabilization Act of 2007. Senators Warner, Collins, and Durbin are \nalso cosponsors of S. 613. We demonstrated that the legislation has \noverwhelming support in this body when it passed by unanimous consent \nin the 109th Congress. It should now be taken up again, passed in the \n110th Congress, and sent to our House colleagues for their immediate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an op-ed by Senator \nLugar and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that appeared in the \nDecember 17 Washington Post titled ``A Civilian Partner for our \nTroops'' printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 17, 2007]\n\n               (By Richard G. Lugar and Condoleezza Rice)\n\n                   A Civilian Partner for Our Troops\n\n\n              Why the U.S. Needs A Reconstruction Reserve\n\n       It is unusual in Washington when an idea is overwhelmingly \n     supported by the president, a bipartisan majority of the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the State Department, and \n     both the civilian and military leadership of the Pentagon. \n     But that is the case with the proposed Civilian Reserve \n     Corps, a volunteer cadre of civilian experts who can work \n     with our military to perform the urgent jobs of post-conflict \n     stabilization and reconstruction.\n       Creating such an institution is essential for our national \n     security, and the Senate should authorize the creation of the \n     corps. Over the past decade and a half, the United States has \n     learned that some of the greatest threats to our national \n     security emerge not only from the armies and arsenals of \n     hostile nations but also from the brittle institutions and \n     failing economies of weak and poorly governed states.\n       We have learned that one of the central tasks of U.S. \n     foreign policy for the foresee-able future will be to support \n     responsible leaders and citizens in the developing world who \n     are working to build effective, peaceful states and free, \n     prosperous societies.\n       Responding to these challenges is a job for civilians--\n     those who have the expertise and the experience in the rule \n     of law, governance, agriculture, police training, economics \n     and finance, and other critical areas. The\n\n[[Page S15988]]\n\n     State Department and the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development are working heroically to meet this need.\n       But the truth is, no diplomatic service in the world has \n     within its ranks all the experts or expertise needed for this \n     kind of work. As a result, from Somalia and Haiti to Bosnia \n     and Kosovo, and now to Afghanistan and Iraq, our government \n     has increasingly depended on our men and women in uniform to \n     perform civilian responsibilities.\n       The military has filled this void admirably, but it is a \n     task that others can and should take up. The primary \n     responsibility for post-conflict stabilization and \n     reconstruction should not fall to our fighting men and women \n     but to volunteer, civilian experts.\n       That is why President Bush called for the establishment of \n     a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps in his 2007 State of the \n     Union address. ``Such a corps would function much like our \n     military reserve,'' he said. ``It would ease the burden of \n     the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with \n     critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America \n     needs them.'' Both the State Department and the Pentagon \n     support this initiative.\n       The Senate has likewise recognized the need for a stand-\n     alone rebuilding capacity, and last year unanimously passed \n     legislation to create a Reconstruction and Stabilization \n     corps within the State Department. Legislation before the \n     Senate would take further steps to establish the operational \n     elements necessary for this work. The bill has three parts:\n       First, it calls for a 250-person active-duty corps of \n     Foreign Service professionals from State and USAID, trained \n     with the military and ready to deploy to conflict zones.\n       Second, it would establish a roster of 2,000 other federal \n     volunteers with language and technical skills to stand by as \n     a ready reserve.\n       Third, it would create the Civilian Reserve Corps the \n     president called for, a group of 500 Americans from around \n     the country with expertise in such areas as engineering, \n     medicine and policing, to be tapped for specific deployments. \n     The corps could be deployed globally wherever America's \n     interests lie, to help nations emerging from civil war, for \n     instance, or to mitigate circumstances in failed states that \n     endanger our security.\n       If Congress acts soon, the administration may be able to \n     deploy the reconstruction corps in Iraq and Afghanistan. But \n     future conflicts are equally important. If we are to win the \n     war on terrorism, we cannot allow states to crumble or remain \n     incapable of governing.\n       We have seen how terrorists can exploit countries afflicted \n     by lawlessness and desperate circumstances. The United States \n     must have the right non-military structures, personnel and \n     resources in place when an emergency occurs. A delay in our \n     response can mean the difference between success and failure.\n       Congress has already appropriated $50 million for initial \n     funding, and an authorization to expend these funds is \n     required. The bill is widely supported on both sides of the \n     aisle and could be adopted quickly.\n       Yet this legislation is being blocked on the faulty premise \n     that the task can be accomplished with existing personnel and \n     organization. In our view, that does not square with either \n     recent experience or the judgment of our generals and \n     commander in chief.\n       It would be penny-wise but pound-foolish to continue to \n     overburden our military with reconstruction duties. We urge \n     Congress to stand up for our troops by giving them the \n     civilian help they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15988-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15988-S15989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATOR TRENT LOTT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments this morning \nto pay tribute to our colleague from Mississippi, Senator Trent Lott.\n  Senator Lott has been at the center of every major policy debate in \nthe Congress for more than three decades.\n  Senator Lott was a fierce and effective advocate for limited \ngovernment. No one who has been involved in debating budget, tax, or \nhealth policy with Senator Lott--as I frequently did on the Finance \nCommittee--can question his commitment to conservative principles of \ngovernment.\n  But what made Senator Lott effective was that he understood that \nothers had different views, and he understood the importance and art of \ncompromise. He was driven to produce results, and he was unrelenting in \nhis efforts to build coalitions to pass legislation and make things \nbetter for the American people. He recognized that, in the Senate, \ncompromise is necessary to get things done. As majority leader, he was \nable to find policies that could hold his caucus together and at the \nsame time win support from the Clinton White House and moderate \nDemocrats.\n  In more recent years, he has played a key behind-the-scenes role in \nbridging differences between the parties. No one was better at counting \nvotes and knowing the limits of his negotiating flexibility. When Trent \nLott told you he could produce the votes for a proffered compromise, he \ndelivered. You could count on it.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Senator Lott had an uncanny ability to \npersuade and cajole people to get a deal. He has a great sense of humor \nand a seemingly unparalleled ability to develop friendships and \nrelationships with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and \nboth ends of the Capitol. He always knows who the key players are, and \nwhat will bring them to the table. These skills have produced a great \nrecord of accomplishments for Mississippi and the Nation.\n  Personally, I will miss his quick wit, his insights, and his \nfriendship. As Senator Lott prepares to leave the Senate, I wish him \nand his wife Tricia all the best.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Senator Lott is true gentleman: agreeable, \ngood-humored and kind in nature. When I think of Trent Lott, the words \nconsensus and congeniality come to mind. These words come to mind \nbecause Trent has become one of the greatest mediators this body has \never seen, his ability to bring all parties on an issue to the table \nand when the negotiations are done, each person leaves with a smile on \ntheir face. Senator Lott's humor and affable personality made working \nwith him a pleasure, even when a compromise could not be found and the \ntime for negotiating was over, nobody would leave the table feeling \nalienated, or hurt they left with Trent still a friend and eager to \nwork on the next solution.\n  Trent Lott's 34 years of service to his country as a Member of \nCongress will forever be remembered in chapters of our Nation's history \nand by his constituents of Mississippi. But the one who deserves just \nas much thanks and gratitude is his college sweetheart and wife Tricia. \nWhile Trent has been dedicated to his job and country for the past 34 \nyears, he has been devoted to his family.\n  Senator Lott's congeniality could be attributed to his humble \nbeginnings, southern upbringing, or a number of things, but no matter \nthe reason he still remains a humble man with many friends and a man \nwho is truly kind to others. As I have grown to know him through our \nwork here in the Senate, I have seen that his kindness stretches beyond \nthe walls of his duties on this floor and to all who encounter him. \nTrent always has a smile on his face and extends pleasantries to \neveryone he passes. Here in Washington, it is easy for one to be \nconsumed by self-importance and it is easy to forget to treat others as \nwe wish to be treated, but he never did. While in the lobby of another \noffice, Senator Lott will have a candid conversation with the much \noverlooked staff manning the front desk or anyone in his path--he will \ngo out of his way to make sure everyone is greeted with warm hello.\n  I have agreed with Senator Lott on many issues, and I have disagreed \nwith him on many as well, but in each scenario we always ended with a \nhandshake and a good laugh. This institution is losing a man who could \nbring people together and allow bitter enemies to lay down their \nswords.\n  This is a man who will be missed by many and I wish Senator Lott the \nbest of luck as he retires from his years of political service.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished colleague from the great State of Mississippi, Senator \nTrent Lott.\n  As a reformer, a defender and a leader, Trent Lott leaves behind a \nlegacy in the U.S. Senate, the fruits of which we will reap for years \nto come. In 1996, Trent joined with colleagues to enact an historic \nwelfare reform bill. He pushed for reform again when he supported \nPresident Bush's tax cut package early on in the administration. Trent \nhas never been afraid to step forward in faith toward what he knows is \nright.\n  A champion for a strong national defense, Trent supported the \nPresident's military action in Iraq as well as increased defense \nspending. As a defender himself, Trent understands the importance of a \nstrong military and the value of rewarding those who valiantly serve \nthis country. In 1998, he urged Congress to raise the pay for our \nmilitary men and women, an act that hadn't occurred in a decade.\n  As the first man to serve as the whip in both the House and the \nSenate, Trent could not have accomplished\n\n[[Page S15989]]\n\nany of the aforementioned achievements and many others without his \ninnate ability to lead. Leadership is not easy. The weight of good \nleadership is often a difficult load to bear, but Trent Lott upheld his \nroles as senator, majority leader and whip with an admirable level of \ndignity and integrity throughout his tenure.\n  As a new Senator, I have been touched by Trent's candor, patience, \nunique charm, and by observing the tremendous relationship he has with \nhis wife Tricia. Professionally, I have benefited greatly from his \nknowledge and experience about how to effectively make a difference in \nthe U.S. Senate. He is a gifted negotiator, and his strong leadership \nwill be greatly missed. For more than three decades, Senator Lott has \nbeen a great public servant to the people of Mississippi in Congress. I \nextend my best wishes to Trent and Tricia as they begin the next phase \nof their lives together.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to wish farewell to an honored \ncolleague and a good friend: Senator Trent Lott. Trent served in \nCongress for 34 years, and has represented the State of Mississippi in \nthe Senate for 18; during that time, he distinguished himself as both a \ndedicated and effective party leader, and a symbol of bipartisan \ncompromise. Few Senators play both roles so well.\n  Those who know Trent often describe his personal charisma and his \nnatural leadership abilities. Those abilities have been on display for \ndecades, manifesting themselves as early as his college days at Ole \nMiss, where Trent was a fraternity president, a cheerleader, and a \nwell-known presence on campus. Trent brought his budding political \nskills to Washington, where he served as a staffer on Capitol Hill \nbefore he was elected to Congress himself, in the first of a long \nseries of wide-margin victories.\n  From 1973 to 1988, Trent represented Mississippi's conservative 5th \nDistrict, serving on the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate \nscandal, as well as in the Republican leadership. As Republican whip, \nhe helped build broad coalitions to pass important domestic and \nnational security legislation.\n  In 1988, Trent was elected to the Senate by eight percentage points \nover his opponent and never again faced a close race, winning \nreelection overwhelmingly in 1994, 2000, and 2006. His skill at \nnegotiation made him a Senate natural, and his party entrusted him with \nits highest leadership responsibilities: majority whip in 1995; \nmajority leader in 1996; and, in a widely remarked-upon comeback, whip \nagain just last year.\n  Newt Gingrich called Trent ``the smartest legislative politician I've \never met.'' And though I often disagreed on the issues with Trent, not \nto mention Newt, I just as often admired his acumen. I couldn't begin \nto list the important legislation shepherded through this body by the \nSenator from Mississippi: education reform, defense spending, trade \nlegislation, the ratification of NATO expansion, the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and much more. But even as he worked \non matters of national and international import, he always had time for \nthe people of Mississippi: he helped expand his state's highway system, \nbrought research funding to its universities, and dedicated himself to \nMississippi's economic recovery in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. \nIndeed, the challenged posed by that destructive storm convinced Trent \nto put off retirement until this year; and I am sure that the people of \nhis state are grateful for the time he could lend to their recovery \nefforts.\n  In his memoirs, Trent compared leading the Senate to ``herding \ncats.'' But today, at least, the members of this most difficult body \nhave found some unanimity: We are united in our affection for Trent \nLott and in our sadness at his departure. We will miss his legislative \ntalent, his rich baritone, his taste in seersucker suits, and his fine \nhead of hair. But we trust that he and his dear wife Tricia have many \nhappy years ahead, and we wish them all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15989-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXPLANATORY STATEMENT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 2664\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, today, we face a major setback to the \neffort to advance American exports and freer international trade. Some \non the other side of the aisle are threatening to kill trade adjustment \nassistance, or TAA.\n  Trade adjustment assistance provides training, health, and income \nbenefits to trade-displaced workers. It has been integral to America's \ntrade policy since 1962. That is when President Kennedy first created \nthe program.\n  TAA has helped America's workers to improve their competitiveness. It \nhas helped workers to retrain and retool. And it has provided Americans \nthe security of knowing that the government will help them if trade \ncauses a displacement.\n  Trade adjustment assistance has been vital to my home State of \nMontana. Since the last TAA reauthorization in 2002, more than 1,500 \nMontanans have participated in the TAA program. It has helped workers \nespecially in the lumber industry to retrain and re-enter the \nworkforce.\n  In May, one particular Montanan, Jerry Ann Ross of Eureka, testified \nabout trade adjustment assistance before the Senate Finance Committee. \nJerry's story is like that of many Montanans who have been laid off \nfrom American lumber mills.\n  Jerry worked at a lumber mill for 13 years. But then in 2005, she \nlost her job. That is when she became eligible for trade adjustment \nassistance. With TAA's help, Jerry entered a training program at \nFlathead Valley Community College. She expects to graduate this month.\n  With TAA's help, Jerry has updated her skills. She has made herself \nmore competitive in the workforce as a construction superintendent and \nan accountant. Jerry's is one of many TAA success stories around the \ncountry.\n  At the Finance Committee hearing, we also learned that the current \ntrade adjustment assistance is not perfect. It needs to be updated. We \nneed to improve it to reflect today's globalized economy.\n  That is why in July, along with Senator Olympia Snowe, I introduced \nthe Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act. Our bill would \ncorrect the flaws of today's program.\n  Our bill would extend TAA benefits to service workers. Service \nworkers account for four out of five jobs in our economy. Our bill \nwould extend TAA benefits to workers whose companies outsource to \nChina, India, and other countries with which America does not have a \nfree-trade agreement. Our bill would increase training funds for \nStates. It would make sure that States have enough money to retrain \nworkers. And our bill would increase the portion of the health care tax \ncredit that the\n\n[[Page S15990]]\n\nGovernment provides to ensure that trade-displaced workers have access \nto health care coverage while they are retraining.\n  The House passed similar legislation in November. But the Senate has \nnot yet completed the job. That is why a 3-month extension of trade \nadjustment assistance is critical. It would keep the current program \ngoing. It would provide time for Congress to complete its work on \nreauthorizing the program.\n  Last week, the House passed a 3-month extension of the TAA program. \nThe House bill is fully offset. It is noncontroversial. That bill \nshould have passed easily in the Senate. But instead, some on the other \nside of the aisle have chosen to hold it up. Their dispute is over an \nunrelated issue. As a consequence, some on the other side of the aisle \nare close to allowing trade adjustment assistance to expire.\n  TAA expiration would send a horrible message to America's workers, \nespecially those who depend on trade adjustment assistance. TAA \nexpiration would also send a terrible message about the 2008 trade \nagenda. If the Senate cannot pass a 3-month extension of trade \nadjustment assistance, I am not sure what the Congress can do on trade \nnext year.\n  Reauthorization and modernization of trade adjustment assistance is \nmy No. 1 trade priority for 2008. It is the right thing to do. American \nworkers deserve no less.\n  Unless Congress passes a robust TAA bill next year, I don't see how \nwe can move pending trade agreements. trade adjustment assistance has \nto come first.\n  So, Mr. President, I call on my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who are holding up this modest extension of trade adjustment to \nthink again. I call on them to allow this useful program to continue, \nand I call on them to step back from what could be a major setback to \nAmerican exports and freer international trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15990-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15990-S15991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to speak on an issue that is \nextremely important to families all across the country--consumer \nproduct safety. I have spent the past year working with several of my \ncolleagues to reform and reinvigorate the agency charged with \nprotecting consumers from unsafe products, the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, CPSC. These efforts have resulted in good progress. We have \nrestored the Commission's ability to conduct business without a quorum, \nwe have provided historic increases in CPSC's funding, and we have \npassed pool safety legislation to protect children from drain \nentrapment.\n  Earlier this fall, I introduced legislation, S. 2045, the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission Reform Act of 2007, to ensure the CPSC has \nthe authority and tools they need to protect families from dangerous \nimported products. We have all seen enough evidence in the press and on \nour retailers' shelves to know that reform is needed. Senators Inouye, \nDurbin, Klobuchar, Bill Nelson, Brown, Schumer, Menendez, Casey, and \nHarkin have all joined me in this historic effort, and their \ncontributions to the bill have been enormous. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee reported S. 2045 in October by voice vote. Since that time, \nwe have been working in a bipartisan fashion to move our legislation \nout of the Senate and to provide these protections for the American \npublic.\n  As many of you are aware, the House of Representatives is scheduled \nto consider their version of CPSC reform today. I applaud the House for \ngetting involved in this very important issue and was pleased to see \nthat many of the ideas we developed in S. 2045 were incorporated into \nthe House bill. I believe this effort is a very important first step to \nreauthorize this agency and provide it with some of the tools necessary \nto work more diligently on behalf of the American consumer. This is a \ngoal that I share with all cosponsors of my bill, many of my colleagues \nin the Senate, and my counterparts in the House. While the House bill \nis a good step, I believe S. 2045 contains many additional reforms \ncritical to improving our consumer product safety laws. I also believe \nthe Senate now stands poised to build upon the actions of the House and \nprovide even greater assurances to the American public.\n  Though I would have preferred to accomplish this task this year--and \nwe have worked very hard to make this a reality--it seems the timing of \nthe rest of the week simply makes this task nearly impossible. I would \nsay to my colleagues in the Senate that we are very close to achieving \nbipartisan compromise to allow this bill to go forward early next year. \nI have expressed to the majority leader my desire to continue to move \nforward with S. 2045, and I hope to secure time for floor consideration \nat the earliest possible time when Congress returns in January. \nConsumer product safety is too important to the American people to not \ngive them our very best effort, and I believe the Senate needs time to \nconsider this legislation on the Senate floor.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight some areas of concern that \nI have with the House legislation where the Senate legislation provides \ngreater protection, areas that I hope to improve upon when Congress \nreturns next year. To begin, S. 2045 provides greater reauthorization \nlevels for a longer length of time than H.R. 4040. While the House \nseeks to reauthorize the CPSC for three years, S. 2045 reauthorizes the \nCPSC for 7 years. S. 2045 provides over $526 million more in authorized \nfunding than H.R. 4040. Our legislation takes a long term approach to \nreauthorize the agency, which I believe brings stability to the agency \nin addition to their enforcement efforts. The last time the CPSC was \nreauthorized was in 1990 for only a 2-year period. During the 17 years \nbetween the last authorization and now, the CPSC has withered on the \nvine, a victim of underfunding and understaffing. I believe the \nsystemic problems that have surfaced over these 17 years demonstrate \nthe need for looking forward to the future as we debate \nreauthorization.\n  The Senate bill also gives greater authority to State attorneys \ngeneral to assist the CPSC in their consumer product enforcement \nefforts. While H.R. 4040 only provides State attorneys general with a \nvery limited role in protecting consumers, S. 2045 ensures that these \nofficials can act as real cops on the beat, looking out for consumers \nand restoring confidence in the marketplace by enforcing the provisions \nof the entire Consumer Product Safety Act, not limited sections.\n  S. 2045 also furthers the mission of the CPSC by placing more \ninformation about dangerous products in the hands of families when the \ndangers become known instead of allowing manufacturers to bog down the \ndisclosure of information through lengthy court battles. S. 2045 will \nallow parents to make educated and cautious decisions about the \nproducts they are placing in their homes. While the House bill only \nseeks to clarify the existing statute in this respect, the Senate bill \ncan actually place real and timely information in the hands of \nconsumers. I believe such a result can only enhance the security and \nwell-being of our fellow Americans.\n  One very important difference between the House and Senate version of \nthis legislation is the standards set for testing children's toys. H.R. \n4040 asks the CPSC to decide if current voluntary standards are \nfeasible for manufacturers' testing procedures and whether they should \nbe adopted. It is very obvious to me, as well as millions of moms, \ndads, and grandparents around the country that testing requirements \nmust be elevated. S. 2045 would make these voluntary standards \nmandatory for testing and safety.\n  Furthermore, S. 2045 adds real teeth to the enforcement capabilities \nof the CPSC. Though I applaud the House for increasing civil penalties \nto which a violator may be subject to $10 million, I do not believe \nthis level is sufficient to deter bad actors. Placing dangerous \nproducts in the hands of American consumers must not be the cost of \ndoing business. S. 2045 increases the cap in civil penalties to $100 \nmillion and strengthens criminal penalties for those aggravated \nviolators that seemingly show a disregard to the health and safety of \nconsumers and the laws enacted by this body. H.R. 4040 does not remove \nthe requirement that the CPSC notify violators of noncompliance prior \nto seeking criminal penalties. This may seem minor, but this provision \nof the Consumer Product Safety Act has hamstrung the CPSC's ability to \npursue egregious violators to the point\n\n[[Page S15991]]\n\nwhere only one such violator has been pursued. Even the President's \nImport Safety Working Group has recommended this change.\n  Last, S. 2045 provides important protections for employees who stand \nup for public safety by blowing the whistle on unsafe products or \npractices. These whistleblower protections are extremely important to \ncatching unsafe products before they enter the stream of commerce. \nEmployees are often on the front lines of consumer product safety, and \nI believe they deserve protection from retribution if they report \nactivities they believe to be in violation of the law. H.R. 4040 does \nnot provide whistleblower protections.\n  There are many other areas I could highlight where S. 2045 can \nprovide more meaningful reform than H.R. 4040, but I believe these to \nbe some of the most important. I would like my colleagues to know of my \ncommitment for this body to consider and pass meaningful consumer \nproduct safety reform next year. I will continue to work tirelessly on \nthis legislation over the holiday recess, and I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues across the aisle to pass bipartisan legislation. I \nthank them for their hard work during this process and am encouraged \nwith the progress we have made in just the past few days.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the cosponsors of this legislation for \ntheir leadership and persistence on consumer product safety. This has \ncertainly been a team effort, and I look forward to continuing to work \nwith them to resolve this matter when we return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15991-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FEDERAL EXECUTIVE BOARDS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the accomplishments and \ngood work of the Federal Executive Boards, FEBs, across the country. \nFEBs bring together Federal agencies outside of the Washington, DC \nmetropolitan area to better serve the community.\n  Federal Executive Boards were established in 10 major regions across \nthe country by President John Kennedy in 1961 as a way for Federal \nagencies outside of Washington to communicate with each other and \naddress local issues affecting the Federal employee community. Since \nthen, they have grown to include 28 metropolitan areas and serve \nhundreds of thousands of Federal employees.\n  The boards are made up of senior officials from each Federal agency \nin a given geographic region. They are quasi-agencies that receive \nvoluntary funding from local Federal agencies in the region. They \noperate with a lean structure of one or two staff members who create \npartnerships between the Federal, State, and local governments to \nachieve common goals. FEBs also offer training workshops, coordinate \npreparedness exercises, and disseminate information on office closures.\n  I am very proud to have a strong and active FEB in Honolulu that \nserves the Federal agencies in the Pacific.\n  To this extent, earlier this fall, I held a hearing on the role FEBs \ncan play in preparing Federal communities for a pandemic influenza \noutbreak. Many public health experts believe that we are overdue for a \npandemic outbreak, and the question is not a matter of if, but when. In \nthis effort, I asked the Government Accountability Office to evaluate \nthe work of FEBs in preparing their constituency for a pandemic \noutbreak. What I found was a lot of dedicated individuals building \npartnerships and developing procedures to prepare for a public health, \nnatural, or manmade emergency. They are doing important work, but they \nare operating without a lot of resources.\n  Because of their natural role in communicating with and coordinating \nFederal agencies, emergency preparedness and response has become a \ncentral component to the mission and activities of FEBs. For example, \nthe Honolulu-Pacific FEB, which serves my home State of Hawaii, is a \nresource for emergency response plans, pandemic influenza preparedness, \nand continuity of operations plans.\n  Similarly, the Minnesota Federal Executive Board has taken to heart \nthe need for better coordination with State, local, and private \npartners in the event of a pandemic or other emergency, and it has \norganized a number of emergency training exercises that bring together \nthese partners.\n  Unfortunately, not all FEBs have the resources or support to be so \nactive. At the hearing earlier this fall, the representatives from the \nFEBs testified to the instability of their funding and the difficulty \nin planning events without a known budget. The Executive Directors make \ndo with what they are given, but often that is not much.\n  The Office of Personnel Management oversees the FEBs and has been \nworking with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop a \nstrategic plan that would address funding, performance standards, and \nprovide guidance to FEBs on their role in the event of an emergency. \nOPM is hoping to produce the plan early next year, and I anxiously \nawait its release. The more support we can provide them, the more \neffective our federal agencies will be.\n  I would like to commend the work being done by FEBs, especially the \nHonolulu-Pacific FEB, and I will continue to support their efforts to \nbuild a strong Federal community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15991-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ABSENTEE VOTING\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the importance of \ncounting the votes of military personnel and American citizens living \nabroad. These votes--defined as Uniformed and Overseas Citizens \nAbsentee Voting Act votes, UOCAVA--are consistently neglected.\n  According to an Elections Assistance Commission, EAC, report issued \nin September, less than 17 percent of the estimated 6 million \npotentially eligible overseas voters sought to participate in the 2006 \nelections. This concerns me greatly. Further, of the 992,034 requested \noverseas ballots in 2006, only 333,179 were actually counted--leaving \npotentially more than 66 percent of overseas voters that wanted to vote \nin 2006 disenfranchised.\n  In June, the GAO released a report that urged the EAC, and other \nFederal agencies, to better serve our UOCAVA voters. I believe that the \nEAC has an opportunity to rectify this situation now.\n  The fiscal year 2008 Omnibus appropriations bill includes $115 \nmillion that will be distributed to the States so that they can proceed \nto implement the Help American Vote Act. All State and local elections \nofficials are aware of the difficulties receiving and counting ballots \nfrom overseas military personnel and citizens living abroad. The \nDepartment of Defense, through the Federal Voting Assistance Program, \ncontinues to struggle with this problem.\n  The EAC report recommends that states make a great effort to ensure \nthat obstacles to voting experienced by members of the service members \nand citizens living abroad--including voter registration, ballot \nreceipt, and ballot return--should be reduced, minimized, or \neliminated. To this end, several States intend to use HAVA funds to \nimplement plans that will allow them to better serve these severely \ndisenfranchised voters. For these reasons, I urge the EAC to clearly \nnotify interested States that HAVA funds are available to facilitate \nthe voting process for UOCAVA voters. I further urge the EAC to \ndistribute 2008 HAVA funding to those States as soon as possible, so \nthat UOCAVA voters do not remain disenfranchised for the 2008 \nelections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15991-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15991-S15992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TIM JOHNSON INPATIENT REHABILITATION PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear \nfriend and fellow Midwesterner who is close to each of us, South Dakota \nSenator Tim Johnson. After suffering a rare brain hemorrhage last year, \nSenator Johnson had a tall mountain to climb in his recovery. He worked \nhard and followed a rigorous rehabilitation regimen. The results are \nobvious. He has had an outstanding recovery--due in large part to his \nintense determination to get better, the support of his family and \nfriends, and the quality rehabilitation care that he received--and \ncontinues to receive. Senator Johnson was able to return to the Senate \nearlier this year. It is a great honor to serve with Senator Johnson, \nand we are all grateful to have him back.\n  As many know, we recognized Senator Johnson's outstanding recovery by \nrenaming S. 543, legislation aimed at preserving access to \nrehabilitation hospitals the ``Tim Johnson Inpatient\n\n[[Page S15992]]\n\nRehabilitation Preservation Act of 2007.'' This legislation aimed to \nblock implementation of a bureaucratic rule change that severely limits \nseniors' access to rehabilitation hospitals. Senator Johnson's recovery \nthrough rehabilitation treatment is an inspiration to many who have \nsuffered from similar conditions and other brain injuries. The care \nthat he received from his team at the National Rehabilitation Hospital \nwas outstanding and their service was critical to his return to the \nSenate. I believe that it is crucial that we preserve access to similar \nrehabilitative care for many of America's senior citizens.\n  Four years ago, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \npromulgated a new rule that would severely limit the types of \nrehabilitation treatments available to Medicare patients. The rule \nknown as the ``75 percent rule'' would require rehab hospitals to \nensure a certain percentage of patients fall into one of 13 specific \ndiagnoses. That percentage was set to increase to 75 percent--forcing \nrehab hospitals to turn away patients and limit rehab services in their \ncommunity. I know firsthand how harmful this can be, as my own mother \nfaced inadequate care before finally receiving the rehabilitation \nservices she desperately needed.\n  The 75 percent rule was set to close the doors of rehabilitation \nhospitals and push seniors away from the care they desperately needed. \nAs many of you know, I have been working with a number of my colleagues \non an inpatient rehabilitation Medicare fix for the last several \nCongresses.\n  Yesterday, the Senate passed the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP \nExtension Act of 2007, which included our provision to freeze the 75 \npercent rule compliance threshold permanently at 60 percent, ensuring \nrehabilitation hospitals have the flexibility to serve a variety of \npatients who desperately need quality rehabilitation treatment to \nrestore their physical function and return home to their families and \ndaily lives.\n  Without our Nation's rehabilitation capacity, other Americans may not \nhave access to the same kind of care that brought my close friend back \nto the Senate.\n  I want to offer special thanks to Senator Johnson for lending his \nname to our efforts and putting a familiar face on the importance of \nrehabilitation care. I also want to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley, \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, as well as \nSenators Bunning, Stabenow, Snowe, Kerry, Schumer, and each of the 60 \ncosponsors of the Tim Johnson Inpatient Rehabilitation Preservation Act \nof 2007. Their support was critical in pushing for a permanent fix to \nthe 75 percent rule and provided those Americans who need \nrehabilitation treatment with a gift this holiday season--access to \nquality treatment and the hope for recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15992-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PREVENTION THROUGH AFFORDABLE ACCESS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since January, safety net clinics that \nprovide basic health care services to women have been in a financial \ncrisis. This happened because a provision in the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005 has inadvertently prohibited drug companies from providing the \ndeep discounts to them on contraceptives. All year, hundreds of family \nplanning clinics, university health centers and other safety net \nclinics have been unable to provide affordable contraception to their \nlow-income constituency. Prices have skyrocketed in some instances from \n$5 a pack to $50 a pack. Already some colleges, including those in my \nhome State of Massachusetts, have had to stop offering contraceptives. \nThis crisis affects an estimated 3 million college women, and hundreds \nof thousands of low-income women who are finding birth control priced \nout of reach.\n  The Prevention Through Affordable Access Act is a no-cost, technical \nfix that will restore nominal prices to these entities, and in turn \nensure that university students and low-income women once again have \naccess to affordable birth control. It will not cost the Federal \nGovernment a dime--but it will be invaluable to women's health.\n  Thirty Senators have demonstrated their support for this fix S. 2347. \nCongress must act now to ensure that this problem is fixed this year \nand a continuing crisis is averted. Women have waited long enough. I \nurge passage of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15992-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COURT SECURITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate passed a \ncompromise version of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. It \ntook several months to negotiate the minor differences between the \nHouse and the Senate bills, simply because we were not allowed to go to \nconference. Then we had to work for over a month to remove a hold \nplaced on the legislation. When it finally passed the Senate on Monday \nnight, we expected that the House of Representatives would pass it \nwithout delay. Unfortunately, one of the compromise provisions \ntriggered a problem that would have prevented passage in the House.\n  We corrected that problem late last night with an enrolling \nresolution that strikes the provision of section 502 that caused a \nbudgetary problem. Fortunately, we were able to maintain the important \nprovision of life insurance benefits for our dedicated magistrate \njudges.\n  I appreciate the work of Senators Specter and Kyl to make sure that \nwe were able to pass this resolution late last night and I look forward \nto the House of Representatives passing both the resolution and the \nCourt Security Improvement Act without further delay.\n  I urge the President to sign this vital legislation, introduced 11 \nmonths ago, without delay so that we can protect the dedicated judges, \nand other personnel who serve as part of our Nation's justice system. \nThe security of our Federal judges and our courthouses around the \nNation is at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15992-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15992-S15993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TREE ACT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the leadership of the Senate Finance Committee regarding the \ntimber tax provisions that are commonly referred to as the ``TREE \nAct.'' These provisions were included in the tax title of the Energy \nbill, which, regrettably, was deleted from the bill that the Senate \npassed last week. On a brighter note, they have been included in the \ntax title of the farm bill, which passed the Senate last week.\n  As a matter of tax policy, enactment of the TREE Act is extremely \nimportant. It reforms the rules that apply to both corporations and \nindividuals who own timber, thereby improving the international \ncompetitiveness of the U.S. timber industry.\n  Enactment of the TREE Act also is time-sensitive. timber companies \nthat continue to be organized as corporations are under intensifying \npressure to reorganize. In that case, a corporation that owns \nsubstantial manufacturing facilities would be forced to sell some of \nthose facilities, and to make other structural changes, in order to \ncomply with the relevant tax rules that it would newly become subject \nto. This would be likely to cause disruptions in some of the affected \ncommunities, and also would make it harder for U.S. companies to \ncompete internationally. To forestall these adverse consequences, \nCongress must act quickly.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased that the Senate has enacted the TREE Act as \npart of the farm bill, and I believe that it is critical for Congress \nto enact a new farm bill, including the TREE Act, early next year. I \nwould like to ask the chairman and ranking members of the Finance \nCommittee whether they share this view.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas, in supporting the need to enact the timber tax \nprovisions--also known as the Timber Revitalization and Economic \nEnhancement Act, TREE Act--in a timely manner.\n  This tax policy is as important to Oregon as it is to other timber-\ngrowing regions of the United States. The forest products industry is a \ncornerstone of Oregon's economy and culture. Oregon is home to more \nthan 9.5 million acres of privately owned forests and more than 75,000 \npeople earn their living working for the forest products industry. In \nfact, Oregon is the No. 1 producer of lumber in the United States.\n  While disappointed that the TREE Act was a part of the tax title \nremoved\n\n[[Page S15993]]\n\nfrom the version of the energy bill passed by the Senate, I am pleased \nthe Senate was able to include the TREE Act provisions in the farm bill \npassed last week.\n  It is crucial for Congress to enact early next year the TREE Act. I \nwill work with my colleagues to see the TREE Act enacted in early 2008. \nIt matters to all who grow trees--companies of all sizes and small tree \nfarmers as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate Senators Lincoln's and Smith's leadership on \nthis issue and I share their view. Although I had concerns about a \nsomewhat similar provision that was considered in 2006, the fact that \nthat there is now a consensus in support of the TREE Act in the U.S. \nforest products industry, and that modifications have been made, have \nled me to support the TREE Act, and to work to include it in both the \ntax title of the Energy bill and the tax title of the farm bill. I \nunderstand the time constraints, and pledge to work with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and the Senator from Oregon, other interested Senators, \nand with the leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee to see that \nthe TREE Act is enacted as part of the farm bill or other appropriate \nvehicle early in 2008.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree. I have supported the enactment of the TREE Act \nfor several years, and will work to see it enacted early in 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15993-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RENEWING THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the past month has been marked by several \nhigh profile, tragic shootings. Across the country, Americans have been \nattacked in places once thought safe, by people wielding deadly \nfirearms. There can be little doubt that the plague of gun violence is \ncontinuing to permeate our society. At what point will we say act.\n  Early Sunday morning December 9, a young man entered a Christian \nmissionary center in the Denver suburb of Arvada, carrying an assault \nrifle and approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Shooting randomly, \nhe gunned down two staff members in their mid-20s and wounded two \nothers. Just over 12 hours later, the same gunman walked into a church \n75 miles away in Colorado Springs and killed two sisters, 18 and 16 \nyears-old, and wounded six others, before shooting himself.\n  Four days earlier, on December 5, a young man entered a busy mall in \nOmaha, NE, carrying an assault rifle. Spraying bullets at people at \nboth point blank range and from the third-floor balcony, sending \nholiday shoppers running as dozens of shots echoed throughout the mall. \nBefore he turned the gun on himself, the gunman had killed eight people \nand wounded five others, two critically.\n  Of course, these were only the shootings that captured national \nheadlines. Hundreds of others fell to their deaths this past month at \nthe hands of someone with a firearm. This month caps a year that \nwitnessed the worst ever school shooting in the United States, when a \nstudent killed 32 classmates and staff members at Virginia Tech \nUniversity. Each one of these horrific events emphasizes the need for \ncommon sense gun legislation. Together they scream out for change. As \n2007 draws to a close I once again urge my colleagues to help put an \nend to these kind of tragedies by renewing the assault weapons ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15993-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ``NIMROD NATION''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Sundance Channel recently aired a \ndocumentary entitled ``Nimrod Nation.'' This eight-part series explores \nthe world of small-town American life through the lens of the town of \nWatersmeet, MI, and their local high school basketball team.\n  Small towns have always been an important part of our country's \ncultural heritage. The communities and institutions that make up small \ntowns are an essential and enduring aspect of the political, economic \nand social fabric of our nation. Nearly one quarter of all Americans \nlive in rural areas, approximately the same percentage as live in \ncentral cities.\n  With only 1,400 residents, Watersmeet is a rural town in Michigan's \nUpper Peninsula. The town is surrounded by the Ottawa National Forest \nand the Cisco Chain of Lakes. It is located in a region with a high \nconcentration of Nordic descendants and Native Americans. In an area \nwith not a single movie theater, the residents turn to, among other \nthings, pastimes such as hunting, fishing, and cheering on their local \nathletic teams.\n  Director Brett Morgen traveled to Watersmeet in 2004 to film three \ncommercials for an ESPN promotional campaign. There he discovered the \nWatersmeet Nimrods basketball team. The nickname came from the Biblical \nking Nimrod, a mighty hunter, fisherman and outdoorsman. The \ncommercials highlighted the team's unusual name, and they sold close to \n$550,000 worth of Nimrod-brand merchandise as a result of this \npublicity. Mr. Morgen later returned to Watersmeet to document the \nNimrod's 2005-6 basketball season while creating a series about the \nrural town.\n  ``Nimrod Nation'' uncovers one of the many diverse cultures we have \nin Michigan. The residents of Watersmeet have expressed enthusiasm \nabout the series. It explores the making of head cheese, talks with the \ntown's older citizens at a local cafe, and covers the community's \npassion for the Nimrod basketball team. These events are woven together \nto create a portrait of what life in the Upper Peninsula is all about.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing the \nimportance of small towns to our country, as well as the congratulating \nresidents of Watersmeet, MI, as their town is showcased in the \ndocumentary ``Nimrod Nation.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15993-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15993-S15994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO RICHARD A. LAUDERBAUGH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I announce the \ndeath of Richard A. Lauderbaugh, a distinguished and admired former \nlegislative counsel and counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, on \nDecember 3, 2007. Mr. Lauderbaugh was a recognized health policy expert \nwith particular expertise in Medicare and Medicaid. He served with \ndistinction on the staff of the Finance Committee under the \nchairmanship of Senator Lloyd Bentsen from 1989 until 1992. During this \nperiod, he was closely involved in the development of Medicare \nlegislation that established a fee schedule for physician services and \nmeasures to prevent program fraud and abuse.\n  Mr. Lauderbaugh, a native of Pittsburgh, PA, moved to Washington in \n1981 after earning his bachelor's degree from the University of \nRochester, a law degree from the Columbia University School of Law, and \na Ph.D. in history from Washington University in St. Louis. He was \nappointed associate counsel in the Office of the Legislative Counsel of \nthe Senate, where his expertise in legislative drafting and his grasp \nof complex policy issues were invaluable.\n  Mr. Lauderbaugh also served 2 years as Washington counsel for the \nAmerican Hospital Association, where he provided legal and policy \nadvice on a variety of issues including health care reform and hospital \npayment policies under the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. In 1992, he \njoined Health Policy Alternatives, a Washington-based policy consulting \nfirm specializing in Medicare and Medicaid policy and legislation, as a \nprincipal. In this position, he worked closely with a wide range of \nclients including health facility and professional associations, \nmanufacturers, consumer advocacy groups, and private foundations. On a \nnumber of occasions, he worked with my staff in the preparation of a \nbill to ensure access to emergency medical services. His work on a \nvariety of policy issues contributed to the introduction and passage of \nmany health care bills in the House and the Senate.\n  Throughout his 26-year career, Mr. Lauderbaugh was widely recognized \nfor his expertise in drafting Federal legislation, for his extensive \nknowledge of the history of Medicare and Medicaid, and his creative \nskill in designing public policies. More important, he was a gentleman \nwho patiently helped the experienced or novice staffer or client \nnavigate the complex world of health policy. His dedication to the \nhighest professional standards and his loyalty to friends and family \nwere hallmarks of his distinguished career.\n\n[[Page S15994]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our \ndeepest sympathy to Mr. Lauderbaugh's sister Paula Bradley and her \nhusband William, of Albuquerque, NM. We are grateful for his service to \nthe Senate and for his many contributions to public policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15994-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15994-S15995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY FAUCI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize Dr. Anthony Facui, Director of the National Institutes of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, for his numerous contributions \nin medical research and specifically his work on HIV/AIDS, avian flu \nand anthrax. Even in a city such as Washington, which is filled with \ndriven and motivated people, Dr. Fauci is a cut above. As Director of \nNIAID, he has worked tirelessly to lead the fight against AIDS and has \nbeen instrumental in shaping our understanding of how this disease \nworks. I am proud to have worked with Dr. Fauci and would like to take \nthis opportunity to submit the following article recounting the \nremarkable work and career of Dr. Fauci for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2007]\n\n                           The Honored Doctor\n\n                     (By Sue Anne Pressley Montes)\n\n       Routinely, his gray Toyota hybrid is parked from 6:30 a.m. \n     until late at night outside Building 31 at the National \n     Institutes of Health in Bethesda. Sometimes his colleagues \n     leave notes on the windshield that say things like, ``Go \n     home. You're making me feel guilty.''\n       But Anthony S. Fauci has made a career of long hours, \n     exhaustive research and helping the public understand the \n     health dangers stalking the planet. As director for 23 years \n     of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \n     at NIH, his milieu is the stuff that scares the daylights out \n     of most people: bioterrorism, deadly flu epidemics, the \n     enduring specter of AIDS.\n       Fauci, who is equally at home in the laboratory, at a \n     patient's bedside, at a congressional hearing or on a Sunday \n     morning talk show, scarcely has time to collect all the \n     accolades that come his way. But this has been an \n     extraordinary year. In the spring, he won the Kober Medal, \n     one of the highest honors bestowed by the Association of \n     American Physicians. In July, President Bush awarded him the \n     National Medal of Science. And today, he receives one of \n     medicine's most prestigious prizes, the $150,000 Mary Woodard \n     Lasker public service award, as ``a world-class \n     investigator'' who ``has spoken eloquently on behalf of \n     medical science,'' according to the Lasker Foundation.\n       No one deserves the honors more, his associates agree.\n       ``Dr. Fauci is the best of his kind,'' said former U.S. \n     surgeon general C. Everett Koop, 90, who has often sought \n     Fauci's medical advice and counts himself as a friend.\n       For someone else, this might be heady stuff. But Tony \n     Fauci, 66, has never strayed far from his down-to-earth \n     Brooklyn roots or his Jesuit training, with its emphasis on \n     service and intellectual growth. Beginning his career in the \n     lab--viewed by many as a backwater of medicine--he soon \n     became the chief detective probing a mystery that would \n     encircle the world. Before AIDS even had a name, he made the \n     ``fateful decision,'' he said, to make it the focus of his \n     research.\n       ``It was a matter of destiny, I think, but by circumstance \n     alone I had been trained in the very disciplines that \n     encompassed this brand-new bizarre disease,'' he said. ``This \n     was in my mind something that was going to be historic.''\n       He and his researchers would make breakthroughs in \n     understanding how HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, \n     destroys the body's immune system. Years ago, he assumed a \n     public role, calmly explaining the latest health scares on \n     talk shows such as ``Face the Nation.'' Through four \n     presidential administrations, he has led efforts that \n     resulted in Congress dramatically increasing funding to fight \n     AIDS.\n       Today, as Fauci helps direct the president's emergency plan \n     for AIDS relief in Africa and elsewhere, he also is leading \n     the fight against such infectious diseases as anthrax and \n     tuberculosis. In his $250,000-a-year position, he oversees \n     1,700 employees and a $4.4 billion annual budget.\n       ``Fauci doesn't sleep,'' said Gregory K. Folkers, his chief \n     of staff. ``He's the hardest-working person you'll ever \n     encounter.''\n       The doctor's curriculum vitae supports that assertion. The \n     bibliography alone is 86 pages, listing 1,118 articles and \n     papers he has written or contributed to. (An example: ``The \n     Role of Monocyte/Macrophages and Cytokines in the \n     Pathogenesis of HIV Infection,'' published in \n     ``Pathobiology'' in 1992.) He has given more than 2,000 \n     speeches, rehearsing with a stopwatch to whittle down his \n     remarks. He has received 31 honorary doctoral degrees.\n       Vacations are seldom on the agenda. Often, his wife and \n     three daughters accompany him to events. This summer, it was \n     the International AIDS conference in Sydney. But he is seldom \n     found sitting by the pool behind his Northwest Washington \n     home. And retirement, he said firmly, is ``not on the radar \n     screen.''\n\n\n                           Exceptional Child\n\n       He learned to question early.\n       It didn't make sense to him when the nuns at his school \n     said that you had to go to church to get into heaven. His \n     beloved paternal grandfather, an immigrant from Sicily, spent \n     his Sunday mornings cooking. What about him?\n       ``I remember going up to him one day. `Grandpa, why don't \n     you go to Mass?' And he said: `Don't worry about it. For me, \n     doing good is my Mass,' '' Fauci said.\n       The experience made him determined to do good through his \n     work. He was 7.\n       The Faucis lived in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, \n     above the family drugstore operated by his father, Stephen, a \n     pharmacist.\n       Fauci's only sibling, Denise Scorce, recalls that he was a \n     well-rounded kid who liked to play ball but only after he did \n     his homework.\n       ``He was very normal in every way, but you kind of knew he \n     was special,'' said Scorce, 69, a retired teacher who lives \n     in Northern Virginia. ``Everything he did was perfect.''\n       Fauci won a full scholarship to Regis High School, a Jesuit \n     institution in Manhattan. Later, he enrolled in another \n     Jesuit school, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, \n     Mass.\n       ``The Jesuit training is wonderful. I don't think you can \n     do any better than that,'' he said. ``I always quote, \n     `Precision of thought, economy of expression.' ''\n       Although he had an aptitude for science, he received his \n     1962 bachelor's degree in Greek/pre-med. He took the minimum \n     number of science courses required for acceptance at Cornell \n     University Medical College.\n       ``I was very, very heavily influenced by the classics and \n     philosophy, which I think had an important part in my \n     ultimate interest in global issues and public service,'' he \n     said. ``I was interested in broader issues.'' I always tried \n     to look at things at 40,000 feet as well as down in the \n     trenches.''\n\n\n                         Encounter With ACT UP\n\n       One of the most dramatic episodes during Fauci's tenure at \n     NIH occurred in 1989, when angry ACT UP demonstrators swarmed \n     his building, demanding to be heard.\n       Fauci, like many top government officials, was accused of \n     not doing enough to fight AIDS. The tactics were attention-\n     getting: smoke bombs, staged ``die-ins,'' chalk bodies drawn \n     on sidewalks.\n       ``He was public enemy number one for a number of years,'' \n     said writer and activist Larry Kramer, who led the charge. \n     ``I called him that in print.

Instead of firing \n     her, as she feared, he asked her out to dinner. They were \n     married in May 1985.\n       The Faucis live in a renovated 1920s home in the Wesley \n     Heights neighborhood. Grady, 55, has a doctorate in \n     philosophy and ethics from Georgetown, and she heads the \n     section on human subjects research at the NIH's Department of \n     Clinical Bioethics.

Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize Dr. Anthony Facui, Director of the National Institutes of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, for his numerous contributions \nin medical research and specifically his work on HIV/AIDS, avian flu \nand anthrax. Even in a city such as Washington, which is filled with \ndriven and motivated people, Dr. Fauci is a cut above. As Director of \nNIAID, he has worked tirelessly to lead the fight against AIDS and has \nbeen instrumental in shaping our understanding of how this disease \nworks. I am proud to have worked with Dr. Fauci and would like to take \nthis opportunity to submit the following article recounting the \nremarkable work and career of Dr. Fauci for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 2007]\n\n                           The Honored Doctor\n\n                     (By Sue Anne Pressley Montes)\n\n       Routinely, his gray Toyota hybrid is parked from 6:30 a.m. \n     until late at night outside Building 31 at the National \n     Institutes of Health in Bethesda. Sometimes his colleagues \n     leave notes on the windshield that say things like, ``Go \n     home. You're making me feel guilty.''\n       But Anthony S. Fauci has made a career of long hours, \n     exhaustive research and helping the public understand the \n     health dangers stalking the planet. As director for 23 years \n     of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \n     at NIH, his milieu is the stuff that scares the daylights out \n     of most people: bioterrorism, deadly flu epidemics, the \n     enduring specter of AIDS.\n       Fauci, who is equally at home in the laboratory, at a \n     patient's bedside, at a congressional hearing or on a Sunday \n     morning talk show, scarcely has time to collect all the \n     accolades that come his way. But this has been an \n     extraordinary year. In the spring, he won the Kober Medal, \n     one of the highest honors bestowed by the Association of \n     American Physicians. In July, President Bush awarded him the \n     National Medal of Science. And today, he receives one of \n     medicine's most prestigious prizes, the $150,000 Mary Woodard \n     Lasker public service award, as ``a world-class \n     investigator'' who ``has spoken eloquently on behalf of \n     medical science,'' according to the Lasker Foundation.\n       No one deserves the honors more, his associates agree.\n       ``Dr. Fauci is the best of his kind,'' said former U.S. \n     surgeon general C. Everett Koop, 90, who has often sought \n     Fauci's medical advice and counts himself as a friend.\n       For someone else, this might be heady stuff. But Tony \n     Fauci, 66, has never strayed far from his down-to-earth \n     Brooklyn roots or his Jesuit training, with its emphasis on \n     service and intellectual growth. Beginning his career in the \n     lab--viewed by many as a backwater of medicine--he soon \n     became the chief detective probing a mystery that would \n     encircle the world. Before AIDS even had a name, he made the \n     ``fateful decision,'' he said, to make it the focus of his \n     research.\n       ``It was a matter of destiny, I think, but by circumstance \n     alone I had been trained in the very disciplines that \n     encompassed this brand-new bizarre disease,'' he said. ``This \n     was in my mind something that was going to be historic.''\n       He and his researchers would make breakthroughs in \n     understanding how HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, \n     destroys the body's immune system. Years ago, he assumed a \n     public role, calmly explaining the latest health scares on \n     talk shows such as ``Face the Nation.'' Through four \n     presidential administrations, he has led efforts that \n     resulted in Congress dramatically increasing funding to fight \n     AIDS.\n       Today, as Fauci helps direct the president's emergency plan \n     for AIDS relief in Africa and elsewhere, he also is leading \n     the fight against such infectious diseases as anthrax and \n     tuberculosis. In his $250,000-a-year position, he oversees \n     1,700 employees and a $4.4 billion annual budget.\n       ``Fauci doesn't sleep,'' said Gregory K. Folkers, his chief \n     of staff. ``He's the hardest-working person you'll ever \n     encounter.''\n       The doctor's curriculum vitae supports that assertion. The \n     bibliography alone is 86 pages, listing 1,118 articles and \n     papers he has written or contributed to. (An example: ``The \n     Role of Monocyte/Macrophages and Cytokines in the \n     Pathogenesis of HIV Infection,'' published in \n     ``Pathobiology'' in 1992.) He has given more than 2,000 \n     speeches, rehearsing with a stopwatch to whittle down his \n     remarks. He has received 31 honorary doctoral degrees.\n       Vacations are seldom on the agenda. Often, his wife and \n     three daughters accompany him to events. This summer, it was \n     the International AIDS conference in Sydney. But he is seldom \n     found sitting by the pool behind his Northwest Washington \n     home. And retirement, he said firmly, is ``not on the radar \n     screen.''\n\n\n                           Exceptional Child\n\n       He learned to question early.\n       It didn't make sense to him when the nuns at his school \n     said that you had to go to church to get into heaven. His \n     beloved paternal grandfather, an immigrant from Sicily, spent \n     his Sunday mornings cooking. What about him?\n       ``I remember going up to him one day. `Grandpa, why don't \n     you go to Mass?' And he said: `Don't worry about it. For me, \n     doing good is my Mass,' '' Fauci said.\n       The experience made him determined to do good through his \n     work. He was 7.\n       The Faucis lived in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, \n     above the family drugstore operated by his father, Stephen, a \n     pharmacist.\n       Fauci's only sibling, Denise Scorce, recalls that he was a \n     well-rounded kid who liked to play ball but only after he did \n     his homework.\n       ``He was very normal in every way, but you kind of knew he \n     was special,'' said Scorce, 69, a retired teacher who lives \n     in Northern Virginia. ``Everything he did was perfect.''\n       Fauci won a full scholarship to Regis High School, a Jesuit \n     institution in Manhattan. Later, he enrolled in another \n     Jesuit school, the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, \n     Mass.\n       ``The Jesuit training is wonderful. I don't think you can \n     do any better than that,'' he said. ``I always quote, \n     `Precision of thought, economy of expression.' ''\n       Although he had an aptitude for science, he received his \n     1962 bachelor's degree in Greek/pre-med. He took the minimum \n     number of science courses required for acceptance at Cornell \n     University Medical College.\n       ``I was very, very heavily influenced by the classics and \n     philosophy, which I think had an important part in my \n     ultimate interest in global issues and public service,'' he \n     said. ``I was interested in broader issues.'' I always tried \n     to look at things at 40,000 feet as well as down in the \n     trenches.''\n\n\n                         Encounter With ACT UP\n\n       One of the most dramatic episodes during Fauci's tenure at \n     NIH occurred in 1989, when angry ACT UP demonstrators swarmed \n     his building, demanding to be heard.\n       Fauci, like many top government officials, was accused of \n     not doing enough to fight AIDS. The tactics were attention-\n     getting: smoke bombs, staged ``die-ins,'' chalk bodies drawn \n     on sidewalks.\n       ``He was public enemy number one for a number of years,'' \n     said writer and activist Larry Kramer, who led the charge. \n     ``I called him that in print. I called him very strong, \n     hateful things. . . . But Tony was smart enough to sit down \n     and talk with us.''\n       Fauci read the leaflets the group distributed and others \n     threw away. ``If you put it in the context of they were human \n     beings who were afraid of dying and afraid of getting \n     infected and forget the theater, they really did have a \n     point,'' he said.\n       When police officers moved to arrest the protesters, Fauci \n     stopped them.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life and \nwork of one of our Nation's great artists, Sheila Isham, on her 80th \nbirthday.\n  Sheila was born in New York City, 80 years ago today. She grew up in \nCedarhurst, just outside the city, and on an 80-acre island in the St. \nLawrence River in Canada, which for years lacked both electricity and \nrunning water. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1950 and married \nHeyward Isham, an officer in the U.S. Foreign Service, and the couple \nmoved to Berlin. There began her path to becoming an artist.\n  Sheila became the first foreigner to gain admission to the Berlin Art \nAcademy in the years following World War II. There, she studied with \nHans Uhlman, a student of abstract painter Kasimir Malevich, and \nabsorbed the works of Wassily Kandinsky.\n  In 1955 Heyward Isham was posted to the American embassy in Moscow, \nand the Ishams moved to Russia, where life became very restricted. \nSheila has told of having to import several years' worth of food from \noutside the country, of being watched and followed constantly, and of \nbeing unable to meet with other artists or to draw freely. A 2004 \nprofile in the St. Petersburg Times reported that ``once, Isham was \nalmost arrested by a vigilant Soviet officer who noticed that an \nAmerican was drawing a building, which, according to Isham, turned out \nto be a center for KGB interrogations.''\n  But Sheila continued her work. She met George Kostakis, a prominent \ncollector of the Russian avant-garde, including works by Malevich, \nKandinsky, Tatlin, Popova, Goncharova, and Larionov, and she traveled \nthrough Georgia, St. Petersburg, Yalta, Sochi, and Tblisi to sketch and \nmeet with local artists and writers.\n  After a few years back in the United States, Sheila and her family \ntraveled to Hong Kong, where she would live and work for 5 years. She \ntaught contemporary arts at the Chinese University, exhibited her work \nin China and Japan, and studied with a master of classical Chinese \ncalligraphy. ``I chose calligraphy because it seemed to me to be \nabstract and perfect at the same time,'' she said.\n  On her return to America in 1965, Sheila began painting, exploring \ncolors and the nexus between Eastern and Western cultures. She would \nlater live and travel in France, Haiti, India, and finally New York, \nwhere she has made her home.\n  Sheila Isham's work is part of the permanent collections of some of \nAmerica's most important institutions, including the Corcoran Gallery \nof Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Library of Congress, the Museum of \nModern Art in New York, the Smithsonian, the National Museum for Women \nin the Arts, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She has been the \nsubject of major one-person exhibitions at the Smithsonian, the \nCorcoran, and the Russian Museum, and countless gallery and traveling \nexhibitions, including at the Island Arts Gallery in Newport, Rhode \nIsland.\n  Sheila's life has not been without periods of darkness. Susan Fisher \nSterling, the chief curator of the National Museum for Women in the \nArts, wrote: ``In unpredictable and often dramatic ways, Sheila Isham \nhas been challenged by forces that threatened to overwhelm her . . . \nyet, despite these upheavals, her spirited work prevails.''\n  After a fire destroyed many works in her Washington, DC, studio, \nSheila said: ``I thought that the burnt studio looked like a painting, \nlike a myth, something you might want to take the picture of. I had to \ncome to terms with that. I became freer in a way.''\n  When her daughter Sandra contracted HIV/AIDS through a blood \ntransfusion, Sheila began work on the enormous, five-painting Victoria \nseries, which she calls ``at once a celebration and a working through \nthe darkest period of my life.'' She said: ``It spans all human \nemotions from love to terror to hope and finally triumph and joy. It is \nan epic poem in paint, expressed in brilliant color and strong forms.'' \nThe series was exhibited for the first time in its entirety by the \nNational Museum of Women in the Arts in 2005, 9 years after Sandra \npassed away.\n  Sheila Isham's work reflects the iconic melting pot of our Nation's \nhistory. Though she draws inspiration from places as diverse as postwar \nBerlin, Russia, China, Haiti, France, and New York City, her work \nremains clearly and vibrantly American. Her art, which resides all over \nthe world, is itself an ambassador both for her creative vision and for \nher country. We are enriched by her talent and her acquaintance.\n  Alexander Borovsky, head curator of contemporary art at the Russian \nState Museum, wrote this:\n\n       As an artist, Isham is marked by an incredible \n     restlessness. Even the calm of an ``oasis'' created by her \n     own hand . . . is only relative. She continually explores new \n     paths and returns to the old. Few artists--including Isham, I \n     expect--can say precisely what they are seeking. Having \n     mastered the art of return, Sheila Isham knows to whom it is \n     that she returns--to herself. Truly a rare gift in \n     contemporary art.\n\n  I come to the Senate floor today to offer congratulations to Sheila \non her 80th birthday. I trust this day will be an occasion for all of \nus to recognize her extraordinary contribution to American art, and \nanticipate the many achievements still to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15995-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15995-S15996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SCOTT HIGGINS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the extraordinary \nachievements of petty officer Scott Higgins of my State of Rhode \nIsland, who today will be awarded the Coast Guard Commendation Medal \nfor his efforts in the heroic rescue of the crew of the sailboat Sean \nSeamour II off the coast of New Jersey in May.\n  On May 7, Aviation Machinery Technician 2nd Class Higgins was part of \na four-man Coast Guard HH-60 helicopter crew, including LCDR Nevada \nSmith, LT J.G. Aaron Nelson, and aviation survival technician 2nd class \nDrew Dazzo, deployed in response to a distress signal from the 44-foot \nsailing vessel Sean Seamour II. The vessel, on a recreational sailing \ntrip from Green Coves Spring, FL, to Portugal's Azores Islands, had \ncapsized amidst the hurricane-force winds of Subtropical Storm Andrea. \nThe three sailors aboard were forced to evacuate to a small raft just \nbefore their ship was swallowed by the ocean.\n  Higgins, serving as flight mechanic, worked closely with Nelson, who \npiloted the helicopter, and Dazzo, the team's rescue swimmer, to \nexecute their mission. Working quickly and expertly, Higgins lowered \nDazzo over and over again into the towering waves to reach the sailboat \ncrew. Once the first two sailors had been lifted to safety, Higgins and \nNelson demonstrated what the Coast Guard's Summary of Action called \n``the utmost of crew coordination, teamwork and aeronautical skill'' as \nthey hoisted Dazzo only 30 feet above the water to position him closer \nto the life raft and the last survivor.\n  As Higgins worked to raise the final survivor from the ocean, he felt \nthe hoist cable begin to fray with the rescue basket still 100 feet \nbelow the helicopter and the rescue swimmer still in the water. Despite \nsuffering from exhaustion and the effects of saltwater inhalation, \nDazzo waited to request an emergency pickup until he could see that the \nlast survivor was in the aircraft.\n  Again demonstrating extraordinary skill and teamwork in a life-or-\ndeath situation, Higgins managed to get the rescued sailor safely \naboard and immediately redeploy the compromised hoist cable to retrieve \nDazzo. In the midst of an intense storm, all aboard were safely \nreturned to shore.\n  Higgins and the rest of his team successfully rescued the crew of the \nSean Seamour II despite a punishing storm that threatened their lives \nand the lives of those they were sent to help. As the Coast Guard's \nSummary of Action stated:\n\n       High winds, treacherous seas and extreme off-shore \n     distances created a situation that required intense \n     operational risk management, exacting crew coordination, and \n     incredible skill and courage. Without the complete \n     competence, concentration, and professionalism of every \n     crewmember, this operation could have had a disastrous \n     outcome. Each crewmember was essential to the life saving \n     rescue of three mariners.\n\n  The Coast Guard Commendation Medal recognizes meritorious service \nresulting in unusual and outstanding achievement. The courage, bravery, \nand skill demonstrated by Machinery Technician Higgins in May shows \nthat he is more than worthy of this great honor.\n\n[[Page S15996]]\n\n  I offer my congratulations to petty officer Scott Higgins and to all \nthose whom the Coast Guard recognizes today. His achievements have \nbrought honor both to him and to his home state of Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15996-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ARTICLE BY RABBI MICHAEL COHEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate an article by Rabbi Michael Cohen who is director of special \nprojects at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies. Rabbi Cohen \nrecently submitted the article entitled ``The Genesis of Diversity'' to \nthe New York Times. In this article, Rabbi Cohen eloquently reminds us \nthat environmental and biological diversity is not simply a thought or \nsomething we simply sit back and observe. Rather we are constant \nparticipants in the act of diversity and as such it is our \nresponsibility as human beings to protect our environment. This article \nserves as a reminder of the importance of preserving environmental and \nbiological diversity during this holiday season.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rabbi Michael M. Cohen's \narticle entitled ``The Genesis of Diversity'' be printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Genesis of Diversity\n\n                        (By Rabbi Michael Cohen)\n\n       In 1968 Hanukkah and Ramadan ended on the same date. The \n     next day was Christmas Eve. That evening, one quarter of the \n     world's population saw, for the first time, images taken by \n     the Apollo 8 astronauts of the earth from a lunar orbit. The \n     earth, a beautifully colored marble ball floating across the \n     black backdrop of the universe, also looked lonely and \n     vulnerable. Those pictures captured the imagination of the \n     world, triggering something in the consciousness of humanity \n     that gave birth to the environmental movement and, two years \n     later, the first Earth Day.\n       To frame that moment, a shared historic moment that would \n     transcend all the divisions of the world, the Apollo 8 crew \n     read from the beginning of the Bible, the first ten lines \n     from the Book of Genesis. The opening chapters of Genesis not \n     only include the account of the creation of the earth but \n     over and over tell us of the importance of diversity.\n       All of creation is called ``good,'' reminding us of the \n     value of the multiplicity of the world that we live in. The \n     text also teaches us, by describing everything that is \n     created before humans as ``good,'' that all things have \n     intrinsic value in and of themselves beyond any value that we \n     may place on them. Once humans are created, ``very good'' is \n     the adjective applied by the text. An anthropocentric reading \n     of the text would say this is because the world was created \n     for our needs, and once we are in place we can do what we \n     want with the world. A biocentric reading of the text says \n     that ``very good'' only means that creation as described \n     in the text was complete, and that we humans were the last \n     piece of the biological puzzle.\n       This reading is supported by the reality that if humans \n     were to disappear from the face of the earth all that had \n     been created before us would go on quite well, actually \n     better, without our presence. However, if a strata of the \n     diversity of life that had been created before humans were to \n     disappear, we, and all that had been created after it, would \n     no longer exist. In a bit of Heavenly humor on Darwin's \n     survival of the fittest, it is actually the smallest and \n     least physically strong species, like the butterflies, bees, \n     and amoebas, that hold the survival of the world in place. \n     Unlike the other species of the planet, we have the power to \n     commit biocide if we do not protect and preserve those \n     smaller forms of life.\n       The importance of diversity is emphasized a few chapters \n     later, in the story of Noah, where Noah is told to bring \n     pairs of each species onto the ark so that after the flood \n     they can replenish the earth. After the flood, God places a \n     rainbow in the sky as a reminder to never again destroy the \n     world. It is both a symbol and a metaphor: a single ray of \n     light refracted through water, the basic source of all life, \n     produces a prism of colors. As with the Creation story, we \n     are again reminded that the foundation of diversity is that \n     we all come from one source. On its most profound level, this \n     understanding should give us all the awareness that we have a \n     relationship with and are connected to the rest of humanity \n     and creation.\n       Immediately following the story of Noah we read about the \n     Tower of Babel. The whole account takes up only nine verses. \n     The conventional reading is that its message is one against \n     diversity; the babel of languages at the end of the story is \n     understood as a punishment. The Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu \n     Leibowitz presents a different reading of the text. For \n     Leibowitz, Babel represents a fascist totalitarian state \n     where the aims of the state are valued more than the \n     individual. In such a society, diverse thought and expression \n     is frowned upon. The text tells us that everyone ``had the \n     same language, and the same words.''\n       We read in the genealogies that link the Noah and Babel \n     stories that the ``nations were divided by their lands, each \n     one with its own language, according to their clans, by their \n     nations.'' Leibowitz sees the babel of languages not as a \n     punishment but a corrective return to how things had been and \n     were supposed to be.\n       That is still our challenge today. Diversity is not a \n     liberal value; it is the way of the world. We know that the \n     environment outside of our human lives is healthier with \n     greater diversity, coral reefs and rain forests being prime \n     examples. It is also true for humanity. We are better off \n     because of the different religions, nations, cultures, and \n     languages that comprise the human family. The Irish Potato \n     Famine was caused because only one variety of potato was \n     planted. Without diverse crops, the disease spread easily \n     on a large and deadly scale.\n       In one of his State of the Union addresses, former \n     President Bill Clinton said, ``This fall, at the White House, \n     one of America's leading scientists said something we should \n     all remember. He said all human beings, genetically, are 99.9 \n     percent the same. So modern science affirms what ancient \n     faith has always taught: the most important fact of life is \n     our common humanity. Therefore, we must do more than tolerate \n     diversity--we must honor and celebrate it.''\n       The opening of the Bible understands diversity not as a \n     noun but as a verb; diversity is the basic action for life as \n     we know it on this planet. Its importance is underscored by \n     the fact that three accounts in its opening chapters \n     highlight diversity as a foundation of the world we live in. \n     Such an orientation is essential for our survival as a \n     species.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15996-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15996-S15997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DONNA ANTHONY: IN MEMORIAM\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have a saying in my Senate office: Once \na member of the Harkin family, always a member of the Harkin family. On \nMonday, with the passing of Donna Anthony, a longtime staffer in my Des \nMoines office, we lost a very valuable and dear member of our family.\n  It seems like just yesterday that I was presenting Donna with a pin \nrecognizing her 20 years of service to the people of Iowa as a Senate \nemployee. In Donna's case, that wasn't ``service to the people of \nIowa'' in the abstract; it was service to thousands of individual \nIowans whose lives she touched in very real, concrete ways.\n  Donna was one of those people who give bleeding-heart liberals a good \nname. She was always on a personal mission to save the world, or at \nleast as many people as she could.\n  She was constantly taking up the cause of people who are down on \ntheir luck, whether it was a senior citizen getting stiffed by \nMedicare, an immigrant family who desperately needed a visa, a victim \nof domestic violence, you name it. Her title may have been ``caseworker \nsupervisor,'' but these were not just cases to her, they were people--\nand she took each one to heart. She put the passion in compassion.\n  I remember in Catholic school being taught that Saint Jude was the \npatron saint of lost causes. Well, I was blessed to know Saint Donna, \nthe patron saint of people in dire need. Saint Jude intercedes with \nGod. Saint Donna interceded with the Federal Government--which may be \nmore challenging. She was constantly working her little miracles.\n  Donna certainly came through for me--again and again. I long ago lost \ntrack of the number of people thanking me for the work that Donna did. \nAnd her personal loyalty was just extraordinary. She was always looking \nout for my best interest and for ways to make me look good.\n  I remember when I was in Iowa Falls this past August, meeting with \nthe economic development group. They had heard about the great work \nDonna had done for Marshalltown, and they wanted her to do the same for \nIowa Falls.\n  In fact, what she did in Marshalltown was typical of Donna Anthony \ngoing the extra mile, going the extra 10 miles. She worked closely with \nthe Marshalltown Chamber of Commerce when they started making their \ntrips to Washington to lobby for assistance. She drove back and forth \nto Marshalltown for countless meetings and served as an all-round \ncounselor and advocate for their projects. The Marshall County sheriff, \nTed Kamanches--a prominent Republican--became a big supporter of mine \nbecause of the great work Donna did for his police force, including \nhaving a Federal drug task force placed in Marshalltown.\n  Twenty years ago, Donna started out in my Des Moines office as \nreceptionist\n\n[[Page S15997]]\n\nand front-desk person. She kept getting calls from people on the north \nside of Des Moines who wanted me to do something to stop prostitution \nin the area. Donna went to bat for them, and that is how she got her \nstart in community casework and making connections with local law \nenforcement. She had a knack for bringing people and agencies together \nand helping them to get things done. This was the beginning of a long \nand fruitful relationship not only with neighborhood groups in Des \nMoines but with law enforcement officials all across Iowa.\n  Mr. President, there is an old expression that we make a living by \nwhat we make, but we make a life by what we give. For 20 years in my \noffice, Donna gave her all for the people of Iowa. She touched \ncountless lives. And she made a life to be proud of.\n  I can offer no higher praise for Donna--or anyone else, for that \nmatter--than that she was a good, decent, and caring human being. I \nvalued her friendship, her counsel, and her incredibly hard work. I \nthink I speak for all of us in the Harkin Senate family in saying that \nwe love Donna very much, and we are deeply grateful that she was a part \nof our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15997-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICK G. HECK\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to honor Mr. Patrick G. Heck, who \nis retiring this month following 23 years of dedicated Federal service. \nPat has served the Finance Committee and all Americans extremely well \nduring his eight years as tax counsel for the U.S. Senate Committee on \nFinance, and as chief tax counsel for the past 4 years.\n  As a college freshman, Pat began his congressional career as a file \nclerk for his Congressman. Throughout his distinguished public service \ncareer, Pat's tireless dedication has earned the respect of his peers, \nfamily, and community. Pat commands the respect of both Democratic and \nRepublican staff throughout the Senate. Pat is a graduate of the \nGeorgetown University Law Center, with an LL.M. in taxation. He \nreceived his J.D. from the University of Toledo College of Law, and is \na graduate of American University, with degrees in political science \nand economics.\n  Prior to joining the Finance Committee staff, Pat served as assistant \ncounsel on the Select Revenue Subcommittee of the House Committee on \nWays and Means. While there, Pat was responsible for leading hearings \non intercompany transfer pricing, Internal Revenue Service collection \nand enforcement. Before that, he was an attorney with the Internal \nRevenue Service's Office of Chief Counsel.\n  I know the members of the Senate Finance Committee join me in \ngratitude for Pat's sage advice on tax policy matters. His efforts have \nhelped to shape the legislative agenda for tax administration and tax \nreform. He cares deeply about these issues and the effect they have on \nhard-working Americans. With his ever-meticulous style, Pat has helped \nme to delve into the important issue of the ``tax gap,'' energy tax \nincentives, tax cuts for individuals and small businesses, and taxpayer \nrights.\n  Pat also helped me develop the idea of extending the time period \nduring which Americans could make tax-exempt contributions to help \nvictims of the tsunami disaster in 2005. This change helped facilitate \na floodgate of tax-exempt contributions for these victims.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Pat Heck \nfor his many years of outstanding service and in wishing him well for \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15997-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-WHITEWATER FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, they often say that the third \ntime is the charm, and now the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater knows \nwhy. After UW-Whitewater's football team came so close to winning the \nNCAA Division III National Football Championship 2 years in a row, this \nyear they triumphed, winning the big game and becoming Division III's \nreigning champions. Their fantastic season marked the first Division \nIII football championship in UW-Whitewater's history.\n  The hard work of the Warhawk football team culminated in a 31-21 \nvictory over two-time defending champion Mount Union College in the \nAmos Alonzo Stagg Bowl on December 15, 2007, in Salem, VA. The Warhawks \nbolted to an early 17-0 lead and beat back the comeback attempt of \nMount Union, which had come into the game having won 37 contests in a \nrow.\n  I commend Coach Lance Liepold for his dedication and hard work \nthroughout his rookie season as head coach. I also congratulate Justin \nBeaver on being named the championship game's Most Outstanding Player, \nand the winner of the Gagliardi Trophy as the best player in Division \nIII.\n  The continuing success of University of Wisconsin-Whitewater football \nhas made the people of Wisconsin, and alumni throughout the country, \nvery proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15997-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN HONOR OF G.

Raymond ``Ray'' Empson, who for the past 11 years has \nserved as president of the national nonprofit organization, Keep \nAmerica Beautiful, Inc., and has announced his well-deserved retirement \neffective December 31 of this year.\n  Keep America Beautiful, the organization that many remember as the \noriginator of the famous ``Crying Indian'' public service advertisement \nin 1971, has been an important part of the fabric of American \ncommunities since 1953. Rooted in a nonpartisan and ``hands-on'' \napproach to improving communities and the environment, KAB forms \npublic-private partnerships that engage everyone in improving not just \nthe physical beauty of their hometowns, but their economic vitality and \ncivic engagement, as well. I am proud that the state of Connecticut is \nhome to the organization's national headquarters in Stamford.\n  During Ray Empson's tenure, Keep America Beautiful has grown to over \n570 local affiliate organizations in communities from coast to coast. \nThrough his leadership, and expansion of the signature event, The Great \nAmerican Cleanup, KAB and its affiliates have removed millions of tons \nof litter from the American landscape; planted millions of trees that \nimprove our communities; conserved our natural resources by recycling \ntons of raw material; improved hiking, biking and nature trails; and \nmost importantly, educated millions of Americans of all ages in \nsustainable behaviors that prevent litter and reduce waste.\n  Given all these accomplishments, I can't help but think of Ray \nEmpson's retirement in bittersweet terms. While I am certainly happy \nfor him and wish him all the best, I can't help but think what a loss \nit will be for the country when he steps down. I am certain, however, \nthat his commitment to the environment and his dedication to improving \nthe quality of life in America's communities will serve as a strong \nexample to all those who know him and have worked with him and will \nguide the future leadership of KAB.\n  Thank you G. Raymond Empson.

Mr. President, during this holiday season, my \nthoughts are with the countless nonprofit organizations in my State of \nOregon that provide assistance to those in need. Ever since the days of \nthe pioneers, when folks from miles around would gather for community \n``barn raisings,'' the spirit of neighbor helping neighbor has been an \nimportant part of the Oregon story.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to the Family Resource Center in the \nsouth coast community of Reedsport, which, over the past decade, has \ngained a reputation as one of Oregon's most innovative and successful \ncommunity organizations. Jointly supported by Lower Umpqua Hospital and \nthe Reedsport School District, the Family Resource Center resulted from \na community brainstorming meeting to identify ways to help Reedsport \narea families better access services. A decade after that session, the \nFamily Resource Center averages 550 contacts a month and serves as a \nmodel of how entities can\n\n[[Page S15998]]\n\nwork cooperatively for the betterment of the community, and how an \nentire community can get information and services in a nonstigmatizing \nenvironment.\n  Through a series of generous grants and donations, the Family \nResource Center has been able to supply a tremendous number of \nservices, including acting as an outreach office and an information \nclearinghouse for many government and nonprofit agencies; providing \nspace for an alternative school and an infant care center; offering a \n``connections'' program that matches up people in need of household \nfurniture and appliances with those who have those items to give away; \nspearheading a school supply drive; providing mental health counseling \nand drug and alcohol evaluation; offering Red Cross babysitting courses \nand Oregon Child Care Basics workshops; offering victims' services, \nincluding women's support and sexual assault support groups, offering \nlegal aid and paralegal services, and the list goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, the late Oregon Governor Tom McCall once said, \n``Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red sky. They are \nindividuals who say, ``This is my community and it is my responsibility \nto make it better.'' I am confident that all those who--through their \ntime, talents, and treasure--have helped to write the remarkable 10 \nyear history of the Family Resource Center are true heroes because they \nhave truly made Reedsport a better place in which to live, work, and \nraise a family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15998-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GEORGE PARASKEVAIDES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and pay \ntribute to George Paraskevaides, a world-renowned titan of industry, a \nmuch-beloved humanitarian, and a most esteemed philanthropist.\n  Throughout his exceptional life, George Paraskevaides, in word and \ndeed, exemplified the ageless precepts of ancient Greece: excellence, \neducation, civic engagement, and a love for mankind. And, at every \nturn, George not only lived up to those ideals--he lived them out in a \nway that was an example and inspiration to all.\n  Although an Athenian by birth, George moved his family to Cyprus \nwhere he pursued his studies and obtained a formal education in \narchitecture, and where he would form with Stelios Joannou what would \nbecome the legendary contracting and civil engineering firm of Joannou \n& Paraskevaides--or J And today, J is one of the largest \ndevelopment companies in the world, employing more than 16,000 people \nand engaged in projects for airports, hotels, highways, homes, and \nsports arenas to name just a few. Underpinning J's success is its \nhallmark attention to quality and its reputation for completing \nprojects on time and on budget.\n  Through the years, however, in true Greek fashion, George was never \ncontent with building on his own success alone, and, time and again, \ndemonstrated a generosity of spirit that was undeniably an ennobling \nforce worldwide. His philanthropy was legendary. To cite just a few \nexamples, he contributed to the Children's Heart Fund Hospital in \nMinneapolis, the Surgical and Transplant Foundation, and the Cyprus \nHeart Association. He funded countless scholarships for less fortunate \nCypriots and founded the Cyprus Kidney Foundation. Perhaps his most \nhistoric gesture occurred during World War II when, at the request of \nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill, George Paraskevaides assisted \nin building an airport runway for U.S. Allies to use--an act which to \nthis day is remembered for its decisive courage and lasting impact.\n  It should, therefore, come as no surprise that George Paraskevaides \nhas been recognized globally for his immeasurable concern for his \nfellow man. The prestigious honors include the Order of the British \nEmpire by Queen Elizabeth II, the Saint Marcus Medal from the Vatican, \nthe St. Paul's Medal by the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of North and \nSouth America, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive \nAssociation, AHEPA, Philanthropic Award, and many, many others too \nnumerous to mention. For 91 years, Greece, Cyprus, and the world were \nall blessed by the presence and good works of George Paraskevaides, and \nhow profoundly fitting it was that Cyprus held a State funeral in his \nhonor earlier this month.\n  Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos characterized George best when \nhe described him as ``a model of humanism, dignity, and kindness. His \nname became synonymous with the ideals of philanthropy and selfless \nlove towards our fellow man.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S15998-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CARROLL COLLEGE\n\n   Mr. TESTER.

Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge COL Jefferson \nJoseph DeBlanc, Sr., for his dedicated service to Louisiana and the \nUnited States of America. I would like to take some time to make a few \nremarks on his accomplishments.\n  In 1940, Colonel DeBlanc left school in order to pursue a career in \nthe military. After joining the Marine flight program, he enlisted in \nthe Naval Reserve where he received elimination flight training. He \ncontinued his illustrious military career in the Marines, achieving the \nrank of captain on June 1, 1943, and transferred to the Marine Aircraft \nGroup 11 overseas.\n  In November 1944, he returned overseas for his second tour of duty. \nHe joined the Marine Fighting Squadron 422 in the Marshall Islands and \nremained stationed there until May 1945, joining Squadron 212 in order \nto fight in the Okinawa campaign. In his two tours of duty in the \nPacific at Guadalcanal and Okinawa, he shot down nine enemy aircraft. \nOn December 6, 1946, President Truman awarded him the Nation's highest \ndecoration for valor and bravery, the Congressional Medal of Honor \n``for his conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life \nabove and beyond the call of duty.'' Colonel DeBlanc received this \nmedal for shooting down five enemy Zeros in the Solomons. He went on to \nbe decorated with more than 10 medals, including the Purple Heart, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, and multiple Gold Stars.\n  Colonel DeBlanc later received a master's degree in education. He \nworked with the St. Martin's Parish School Board and taught physics at \nMt. Carmel in New Iberia.

Doc. 103-\n     39), subject to the declarations of section 2, to be made \n     under articles 287 and 298 of the Convention, the \n     declarations and understandings of section 3, to be made \n     under article 310 of the Convention, and the conditions of \n     section 4.\n       Section 2. Declarations Under Articles 287 and 298.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) The Government of the United States of America \n     declares, in accordance with article 287(1), that it chooses \n     the following means for the settlement of disputes concerning \n     the interpretation or application of the Convention:\n       (A) a special arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance \n     with Annex VIII for the settlement of disputes concerning the \n     interpretation or application of the articles of the \n     Convention relating to (1) fisheries, (2) protection and \n     preservation of the marine environment, (3) marine scientific \n     research, and (4) navigation, including pollution from \n     vessels and by dumping; and\n       (B) an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with \n     Annex VII for the settlement of disputes not covered by the \n     declaration in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) The Government of the United States of America \n     declares, in accordance with article 298(1), that it does not \n     accept any of the procedures provided for in section 2 of \n     Part XV (including, inter alia, the Sea-Bed Disputes Chamber \n     procedure referred to in article 287(2)) with respect to the \n     categories of disputes set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), \n     and (c) of article 298(1). The United States further declares \n     that its consent to accession to the Convention is \n     conditioned upon the understanding that, under article \n     298(1)(b), each State Party has the exclusive right to \n     determine whether its activities are or were ``military \n     activities'' and that such determinations are not subject to \n     review.\n       Section 3. Other Declarations and Understandings under \n     Article 310.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations and understandings:\n       (1) The United States understands that nothing in the \n     Convention, including any provisions referring to ``peaceful \n     uses'' or ``peaceful purposes,'' impairs the inherent right \n     of individual or collective self-defense or rights during \n     armed conflict.\n       (2) The United States understands, with respect to the \n     right of innocent passage under the Convention, that--\n       (A) all ships, including warships, regardless of, for \n     example, cargo, armament, means of propulsion, flag, origin, \n     destination, or purpose, enjoy the right of innocent passage;\n       (B) article 19(2) contains an exhaustive list of activities \n     that render passage non-innocent;\n       (C) any determination of non-innocence of passage by a ship \n     must be made on the basis of acts it commits while in the \n     territorial sea, and not on the basis of, for example, cargo, \n     armament, means of propulsion, flag, origin, destination, or \n     purpose; and\n       (D) the Convention does not authorize a coastal State to \n     condition the exercise of the\n\n[[Page S16004]]\n\n     right of innocent passage by any ships, including warships, \n     on the giving of prior notification to or the receipt of \n     prior permission from the coastal State.\n       (3) The United States understands, concerning Parts III and \n     IV of the Convention, that--\n       (A) all ships and aircraft, including warships and military \n     aircraft, regardless of, for example, cargo, armament, means \n     of propulsion, flag, origin, destination, or purpose, are \n     entitled to transit passage and archipelagic sea lanes \n     passage in their ``normal mode'';\n       (B) ``normal mode'' includes, inter alia--\n       (i) submerged transit of submarines;\n       (ii) overflight by military aircraft, including in military \n     formation;\n       (iii) activities necessary for the security of surface \n     warships, such as formation steaming and other force \n     protection measures;\n       (iv) underway replenishment; and\n       (v) the launching and recovery of aircraft;\n       (C) the words ``strait'' and ``straits'' are not limited by \n     geographic names or categories and include all waters not \n     subject to Part IV that separate one part of the high seas or \n     exclusive economic zone from another part of the high seas or \n     exclusive economic zone or other areas referred to in article \n     45;\n       (D) the term ``used for international navigation'' includes \n     all straits capable of being used for international \n     navigation; and\n       (E) the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage is not \n     dependent upon the designation by archipelagic States of \n     specific sea lanes and/or air routes and, in the absence of \n     such designation or if there has been only a partial \n     designation, may be exercised through all routes normally \n     used for international navigation.\n       (4) The United States understands, with respect to the \n     exclusive economic zone, that--\n       (A) all States enjoy high seas freedoms of navigation and \n     overflight and all other internationally lawful uses of the \n     sea related to these freedoms, including, inter alia, \n     military activities, such as anchoring, launching and landing \n     of aircraft and other military devices, launching and \n     recovering water-borne craft, operating military devices, \n     intelligence collection, surveillance and reconnaissance \n     activities, exercises, operations, and conducting military \n     surveys; and\n       (B) coastal State actions pertaining to these freedoms and \n     uses must be in accordance with the Convention.\n       (5) The United States understands that ``marine scientific \n     research'' does not include, inter alia--\n       (A) prospecting and exploration of natural resources;\n       (B) hydrographic surveys;\n       (C) military activities, including military surveys;\n       (D) environmental monitoring and assessment pursuant to \n     section 4 of Part XII; or\n       (E) activities related to submerged wrecks or objects of an \n     archaeological and historical nature.\n       (6) The United States understands that any declaration or \n     statement purporting to limit navigation, overflight, or \n     other rights and freedoms of all States in ways not permitted \n     by the Convention contravenes the Convention. Lack of a \n     response by the United States to a particular declaration or \n     statement made under the Convention shall not be interpreted \n     as tacit acceptance by the United States of that declaration \n     or statement.\n       (7) The United States understands that nothing in the \n     Convention limits the ability of a State to prohibit or \n     restrict imports of goods into its territory in order to, \n     inter alia, promote or require compliance with environmental \n     and conservation laws, norms, and objectives.\n       (8) The United States understands that articles 220, 228, \n     and 230 apply only to pollution from vessels (as referred to \n     in article 211) and not, for example, to pollution from \n     dumping.\n       (9) The United States understands, with respect to articles \n     220 and 226, that the ``clear grounds'' requirement set forth \n     in those articles is equivalent to the ``reasonable \n     suspicion'' standard under United States law.\n       (10) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     228(2), that--\n       (A) the ``proceedings'' referred to in that paragraph are \n     the same as those referred to in article 228(1), namely those \n     proceedings in respect of any violation of applicable laws \n     and regulations or international rules and standards relating \n     to the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from \n     vessels committed by a foreign vessel beyond the territorial \n     sea of the State instituting proceedings; and\n       (B) fraudulent concealment from an officer of the United \n     States of information concerning such pollution would extend \n     the three-year period in which such proceedings may be \n     instituted.\n       (11) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     230, that--\n       (A) it applies only to natural persons aboard the foreign \n     vessels at the time of the act of pollution;\n       (B) the references to ``monetary penalties only'' exclude \n     only imprisonment and corporal punishment;\n       (C) the requirement that an act of pollution be ``willful'' \n     in order to impose non-monetary penalties would not constrain \n     the imposition of such penalties for pollution caused by \n     gross negligence;\n       (D) in determining what constitutes a ``serious'' act of \n     pollution, a State may consider, as appropriate, the \n     cumulative or aggregate impact on the marine environment of \n     repeated acts of pollution over time; and\n       (E) among the factors relevant to the determination whether \n     an act of pollution is ``serious,'' a significant factor is \n     non-compliance with a generally accepted international rule \n     or standard.\n       (12) The United States understands that sections 6 and 7 of \n     Part XII do not limit the authority of a State to impose \n     penalties, monetary or non-monetary, for, inter alia--\n       (A) non-pollution offenses, such as false statements, \n     obstruction of justice, and obstruction of government or \n     judicial proceedings, wherever they occur; or\n       (B) any violation of national laws and regulations or \n     applicable international rules and standards for the \n     prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine \n     environment that occurs while a foreign vessel is in any of \n     its ports, rivers, harbors, or offshore terminals.\n       (13) The United States understands that the Convention \n     recognizes and does not constrain the longstanding sovereign \n     right of a State to impose and enforce conditions for the \n     entry of foreign vessels into its ports, rivers, harbors, or \n     offshore terminals, such as a requirement that ships exchange \n     ballast water beyond 200 nautical miles from shore or a \n     requirement that tank vessels carrying oil be constructed \n     with double hulls.\n       (14) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     21(2), that measures applying to the ``design, construction, \n     equipment or manning'' do not include, inter alia, measures \n     such as traffic separation schemes, ship routing measures, \n     speed limits, quantitative restrictions on discharge of \n     substances, restrictions on the discharge and/or uptake of \n     ballast water, reporting requirements, and record-keeping \n     requirements.\n       (15) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate discharges into the marine environment resulting \n     from industrial operations on board a foreign vessel.\n       (16) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate the introduction into the marine environment of \n     alien or new species.\n       (17) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     articles 61 and 62, a coastal State has the exclusive right \n     to determine the allowable catch of the living resources in \n     its exclusive economic zone, whether it has the capacity to \n     harvest the entire allowable catch, whether any surplus \n     exists for allocation to other States, and to establish the \n     terms and conditions under which access may be granted. The \n     United States further understands that such determinations \n     are, by virtue of article 297(3)(a), not subject to binding \n     dispute resolution under the Convention.\n       (18) The United States understands that article 65 of the \n     Convention lent direct support to the establishment of the \n     moratorium on commercial whaling, supports the creation of \n     sanctuaries and other conservation measures, and requires \n     States to cooperate not only with respect to large whales, \n     but with respect to all cetaceans.\n       (19) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     article 33, the term ``sanitary laws and regulations'' \n     includes laws and regulations to protect human health from, \n     inter alia, pathogens being introduced into the territorial \n     sea.\n       (20) The United States understands that decisions of the \n     Council pursuant to procedures other than those set forth in \n     article 161(8)(d) will involve administrative, institutional, \n     or procedural matters and will not result in substantive \n     obligations on the United States.\n       (21) The United States understands that decisions of the \n     Assembly under article 160(2)(e) to assess the contributions \n     of members are to be taken pursuant to section 3(7) of the \n     Annex to the Agreement and that the United States will, \n     pursuant to section 9(3) of the Annex to the Agreement, be \n     guaranteed a seat on the Finance Committee established by \n     section 9(1) of the Annex to the Agreement, so long as the \n     Authority supports itself through assessed contributions.\n       (22) The United States declares, pursuant to article 39 of \n     Annex VI, that decisions of the Seabed Disputes Chamber shall \n     be enforceable in the territory of the United States only in \n     accordance with procedures established by implementing \n     legislation and that such decisions shall be subject to such \n     legal and factual review as is constitutionally required and \n     without precedential effect in any court of the United \n     States.\n       (23) The United States--\n       (A) understands that article 161(8)(f) applies to the \n     Council's approval of amendments to section 4 of Annex VI;\n       (B) declares that, under that article, it intends to accept \n     only a procedure that requires consensus for the adoption of \n     amendments to section 4 of Annex VI; and\n       (C) in the case of an amendment to section 4 of Annex VI \n     that is adopted contrary to this understanding, that is, by a \n     procedure other than consensus, will consider itself bound by \n     such an amendment only if it subsequently ratifies such \n     amendment pursuant to the advice and consent of the \n     Senate.\n       (24) The United States declares that, with the exception of \n     articles 177-183, article 13 of Annex IV, and article 10 of \n     Annex VI, the provisions of the Convention and the Agreement, \n     including amendments thereto and rules, regulations, and \n     procedures thereunder, are not self-executing.\n       Section 4.

A bill to provide liability protection to volunteer pilot \nnonprofit organizations that fly for public benefit and to the pilots \nand staff of such nonprofit organizations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as one of the Senate's commercially \nlicensed pilots, I rise to talk about an issue near and dear to my \nheart--flying. As many in this Chamber know, I love flying and have \nflown thousands of hours, attended the well-known AirVenture aviation \nevent in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, each year, and even recreated Wiley Post's \ntrip around the world. I have received notable recognition for this \nbeloved hobby.\n  Today, I am here to acknowledge a group of people who share my love \nof flying--volunteer pilots. Non-profit, charitable associations called \nVolunteer Pilot Organizations, VPOs, provide the resources to help \nthese self-sacrificing men and women serve people in need.\n  There are approximately 40 to 50 VPO's in the United States ranging \nfrom small, local groups to large, national associations. Air Charity \nNetwork, ACN, is the Nation's largest VPO and has seven member \norganizations that collectively serve the entire country and perform \nabout 90 percent of all charitable aviation missions in the U.S. ACN's \nvolunteer pilots provide free air transportation for people in need of \nspecialized medical treatment at distant locations due to family, \ncommunity or national crises. They also step in when commercial air \nservice is not available with middle-of-the-night organ transplant \npatient flights, disaster response missions evacuating special needs \npatients, and transport of blood or blood products in emergencies.\n  ACN and its more than 8,000 volunteer pilots use their own planes, \npay for their own fuel, and even take time from their ``day'' jobs to \nserve people in need. These Good Samaritans will provide charitable \nflights for an estimated 24,000 patients this year alone and their \nsafety record is phenomenal. In their more than 30 years of service, \nthe pilots of ACN have flown over 250,000 missions covering over 80 \nmillion miles and have never had a fatal accident.\n  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, ACN aircraft were the \nfirst to be approved to fly in disaster-response teams and supplies. \nSimilarly, in 2005, ACN pilots flew over 2,600 missions after \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, reuniting families torn apart by the \ndisaster and relocating them to safe housing. Their service was \ninvaluable to the thousands of people they saved during these national \ncrises.\n  Despite this goodwill, there is a loophole in the law that subjects \nthese heroes and charitable organizations to frivolous, costly \nlawsuits. Currently, although volunteer pilots are required to carry \nliability insurance, if they have an accident, the injured party can \nsue for any amount of money--the sky is the limit. It would be up to a \njury to decide on an amount. If that amount is higher than the \nliability limit on a pilot's insurance, then the pilot is at risk of \nlosing their personal investments, home, business and other assets, \npotentially bringing them financial ruin.\n  Additionally, the cost of insurance and lack of available non-owned \naircraft liability insurance for organizations since the terrorist \nattacks of September 11 prevents VPOs from acquiring liability \nprotection for their organizations, boards, and staff. Without this \ninsurance, if a volunteer pilot were to have an accident using his or \nher own aircraft, everyone connected to the organization could be \nsubject to a costly lawsuit, despite the fact that none of those people \nwere directly involved with the dispatch of the flight, the pilot's \ndecisions, or the aircraft itself.\n  Exposure to this type of risk makes it difficult for these \norganizations to recruit and retain volunteer pilots and professional \nstaff. It also makes referring medical professionals such as hospitals, \ndoctors, nurses, social workers, and disaster agencies like the \nAmerican Red Cross, less likely to tell patients or evacuees that \ncharitable medical air transportation is available for fear of a \nliability suit against them. Instead of focusing on serving people with \nmedical needs, these organizations are spending considerable time and \nresources averting a lawsuit and recruiting volunteers.\n  This is why today I am introducing the Volunteer Pilot Organization \nProtection Act of 2007, which I cosponsored in the last two Congresses, \nto help close this costly loophole. My bill amends the Volunteer \nProtection Act of 1997, VPA, which was intended to increase \nvolunteerism in the United States, to include groups such as ACN and \nthe American Red Cross in the list of types of organizations that are \ncurrently exempt from liability. More specifically, it will protect \nvolunteer pilot organizations, their boards, paid staff and non-flying \nvolunteers from liability should there be an accident. It will also \nprovide liability protection for individual volunteer pilots over and \nabove the liability insurance that they are currently required to \ncarry, as well\n\n[[Page S16008]]\n\nas liability protection for the referring agencies who inform their \npatients of charitable flight services.\n  Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate in the past several \nCongresses and passed overwhelmingly in the House in the 108th Congress \nby a vote of 385-12 and by voice vote in the 109th Congress. Clearly, \nthe Volunteer Pilot Organization Protection Act has significant \nsupport. The companion version, H.R. 2191, was introduced in May by my \ncolleague, Congresswoman Thelma Drake, with ten original, bipartisan \ncosponsors.\n  My bill will go a long way to help eliminate unnecessary liability \nrisk and allow volunteer pilots and the charitable organizations for \nwhich they fly to concentrate on what they do best--save lives. Please \njoin me in supporting the Volunteer Pilot Organization Protection Act \nof 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 2521. A bill to provide benefits to domestic partners of Federal \nemployees; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 2007, which my \ngood friend from the other side of the aisle, Senator Smith, and I \nintroduced last Congress and are introducing again today, along with 19 \nother cosponsors.\n  This legislation is another step in the process to make the Federal \nGovernment more competitive in an ever-changing business world. It \nwould require the Government to extend employee benefit programs to the \nsame-sex domestic partners of Federal employees. It is sound public \npolicy and it makes excellent business sense.\n  Under our bill, Federal employee and the employee's domestic partner \nwould be eligible to participate in health benefits, Family and Medical \nLeave, long-term care, Federal retirement benefits, and other benefits \nto the same extent that married employees and their spouses \nparticipate. Employees and their partners would also assume the same \nobligations that apply to married employees and their spouses, such as \nanti-nepotism rules and financial disclosure requirements.\n  The Federal Government is our Nation's largest employer and should \nlead other employers, rather than lagging behind, in the quest to \nprovide equal and fair compensation and benefits to all employees. That \nthousands of Federal workers who have dedicated their careers to public \nservice and who live in committed relationships with same-sex domestic \npartners receive fewer protections for their families than those \nmarried employees is patently unfair and, frankly, makes no economic \nsense.\n  Just ask the leaders of more than half of the Fortune 500 companies \nwho already extend employee benefit programs to their employees' \ndomestic partners. The fact is that most of America's major \ncorporations now offer health benefits to employees' domestic partners, \nup from 25 percent in 2000. Overall, more than 9,700 private-sector \ncompanies provide available benefits to employees' domestic partners, \nas do several hundred State and local governments and colleges and \nuniversities.\n  General Electric, Chevron, Boeing, Texas Instruments, IBM, Raytheon, \nBP, Hospital Corporation of America, Lockheed Martin, Duke Energy \nCorp., and AT are among the major employers that have recognized the \neconomic benefit of providing for domestic partners. The governments of \n13 States--including, I might add, my home State of Connecticut--and \nabout 145 local jurisdictions across the land, as well as multiple \neducational institutions, have joined the trend. They aren't all doing \nthis just because it is the right thing to do. They are also doing it \nbecause it is good business policy.\n  Non-federal employers have told surveyors that they extend benefits \nto domestic partners to boost recruitment and retain quality \nemployees--as well as to be fair. The Federal Government needs to \ncompete against the private sector companies to recruit and retain the \n``best and the brightest,'' to safeguard the Nation by serving in \nessential areas such as homeland security, national defense, and \nenvironmental protection and to help make sure that American taxpayers \nget their money's worth. The Government will always be at a definite \ndisadvantage in competing for and retaining highly qualified personnel \nif it cannot match the domestic-partner benefits programs provided by \nleading non-federal employers.\n\n  Furthermore, coverage of domestic partners adds very little to the \ntotal cost of providing employee benefits. Based on the experience of \nprivate companies and State and local governments, the Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that offering benefits to the same-sex \ndomestic partners of Federal employees would increase the cost of those \nprograms by less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent.\n  Our former ambassador to Romania and Dean of the Foreign Service \nInstitute recently felt obliged to quit the Foreign Service because the \nState Department does not offer the kind of domestic partnership \nbenefits that this bill would provide. Let me read a line from his \nfarewell speech. He said, ``. . . I have felt compelled to choose \nbetween obligations to my partner--who is my family--and service to my \ncountry. That anyone should have to make that choice is a stain on the \nSecretary's leadership and a shame for this institution and our \ncountry.''\n  Those are powerful and poignant words, and it is a tragedy that a \nloyal and talented public servant--who described the Foreign Service as \nthe career he was ``born for . . . what I was always meant to do''--\nfelt he had to leave the Service because his Federal employee benefits \nwould not enable him to adequately care for the needs of his family.\n  I call upon my colleagues to express their support for this important \nlegislation. It is time for the Federal Government to catch up to the \nprivate sector, not just to set an example but so that it can compete \nfor the most qualified employees and ensure that all of our public \nservants receive fair and equitable treatment. It makes good economic \nand policy senses. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na bill summary be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2521\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Federal employees and their domestic partners will \n     also be subject to the same employment-related obligations \n     that are imposed on married employees and their spouses.\n       In order to obtain benefits and assume obligations, an \n     employee must file an affidavit of eligibility with the \n     Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The employee must \n     certify that the employee and the employee's same-sex \n     domestic partner have a common residence, share \n     responsibility for each other's welfare and financial \n     responsibilities, are not related by blood, and are living \n     together in a committed intimate relationship. They must also \n     certify that, as each other's sole domestic partner, they \n     intend to remain so indefinitely. If a domestic partnership \n     dissolves, whether by death of the domestic partner or \n     otherwise, the employee must file a statement of dissolution \n     with OPM within 30 days.\n       Employees and their domestic partners will have the same \n     benefits as married employees and their spouses under--\n       Employee health benefits.\n       Retirement and disability plans.\n       Family, medical, and emergency leave.\n       Group life insurance.\n       Long-term care insurance.\n       Compensation for work injuries.\n       Death, disability, and similar benefits.\n       Relocation, travel, and related expenses.\n       For purposes of these benefits, any natural or adopted \n     child of the domestic partner will be treated as a stepchild \n     of the employee.\n       The employee and the employee's domestic partner will also \n     become subject to the same duties and responsibilities with \n     respect to federal employment that apply to a married \n     employee and the employee's spouse. These will include, for \n     example, anti-nepotism rules and financial disclosure \n     requirements.\n       The Act will apply with respect to those federal employees \n     who are employed on the date of enactment or who become \n     employed on or after that date.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, today to introduce legislation that will entitle \nFederal employees with same-sex domestic partners to the same \nemployment benefits that are available to married Federal employees and \ntheir spouses and families. Under the Domestic Partnership Benefits and \nObligations Act of 2007, employees and their domestic partners would \nhave similar access to employee health benefits, retirement, and \ndisability plans, family medical and emergency leave, group life and \nlong-term care insurance, compensation for work injuries, death and \ndisability benefits, and relocation and travel expenses.\n  More and more American corporations, as well as State and local \ngovernments, are offering domestic partner benefits. Approximately half \nof Fortune 500 companies now offer health benefits to employees' \ndomestic partners. That is up from 25 percent in 2000. In all, more \nthan 9,700 private companies as well as several hundred State and local \ngovernment and universities and colleges offer these benefits.\n  Private and governmental employers are offering domestic partner \nbenefits for a variety of reasons. Chief among these reasons are \nrecruitment and retention of employees. To be competitive, companies \nwant to attract and retain the best and the brightest in the workforce \nregardless of their family status. Offering work-life benefits has been \nan important tool to retain valuable employees. In addition, more \nemployers providing domestic partner benefits may result in a more \nstable workforce. If an employee's domestic partner has access to \npreventative health care, the employee is less likely to take prolonged \nabsences from the job to care for their partner.\n  While all these reasons are meritorious, we introduced this \nlegislation as a matter of equality. It is just the right thing to do. \nThe Federal Government should lead by example and that should start \nwith equal treatment of all employees.\n\n[[Page S16010]]\n\n  Recently, a top State Department employee and former Ambassador to \nRomania, Michael Guest, announced his decision to leave Government \nservice. At his retirement ceremony, Ambassador Guest stated, ``Most \ndeparting ambassadors use these events to talk about their successes . \n. . But I want to talk about my single failure, the failure that in \nfact is causing me to leave the career that I love.'' The failure which \nMike spoke of was his inability to convince the Federal Government to \nextend employee benefits to same-sex couples. Because the Federal \nGovernment does not offer domestic partner benefits, Ambassador Guest \nexplained that he ``felt compelled to choose between obligations to my \npartner--who is my family--and service to my country.''\n  This legislation will help to ensure that no other Federal employee, \nlike Ambassador Guest, will be faced with a similar dilemma--that is, a \nchoice between one's family or service to their country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Domestic \nPartnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 2007, being introduced \ntoday by Senators Lieberman and Smith. I cosponsored this legislation \nin the last Congress and I am pleased to do so again.\n  This important legislation would provide domestic partners of Federal \nemployees the same protections and benefits afforded to spouses of \nFederal employees. These benefits, available for both same and \nopposite-sex domestic partners of Federal employees, would include \nparticipation in applicable retirement programs, compensation for work \ninjuries and insurance benefits, including life, Family and Medical \nLeave and health insurance.\n  Equal pay for equal work is a cornerstone of our country's bedrock \nprinciples, and so too should equal access to important benefits. \nInsurance benefits, work incentives and retirement options comprise a \nsignificant portion of all employee compensation. By not offering \ndomestic partnership benefits to its employees, the Federal government \nis unfairly withholding these valuable options from dedicated employees \nacross the country.\n  The idea that benefits should be extended to same sex couples has \nbecome increasingly prevalent in America's largest and most successful \ncompanies, state and local governments, and in educational \ninstitutions. Over half of all Fortune 500 companies provide domestic \npartner benefits to their employees, up from just 25 percent in 2000. \nOffering domestic partnership benefits to Federal employees would \nimprove the quality of its workforce, demonstrate its commitment to \nfairness and equality for all Americans, and bring the Government in \nline with some of the Nation's largest employers.\n  Providing benefits to domestic partners of Federal employees is long \noverdue. It is the right thing to do, it is the sensible step to take \nin the interest of having a fair and consistent policy, and I hope that \nthe Senate will act quickly on this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2522. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee \ncomprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2008; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation, the MediKids Health Insurance Act of \n2007. This legislation will provide health insurance for every child in \nthe U.S. by 2014, regardless of family income. My long-time friend from \nCalifornia, Congressman Stark, introduced companion legislation earlier \nthis year in the House. He has worked tirelessly to improve access to \nhealth care for all Americans, and I am pleased to join him once again \nto advocate on behalf of America's children.\n  This past year, the majority in Congress made it clear that improving \nhealth care access for children was a priority. I proudly worked with \nmy colleagues in a truly bipartisan fashion to reauthorize and expand \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, to meet the serious \nhealth care needs of children in a very cost-effective manner. This \nlegislation, which had the support of Democrats and Republicans in both \nchambers of Congress, would have maintained health insurance coverage \nfor the over 6 million children currently enrolled and expanded health \ninsurance coverage to an additional 4 million uninsured children. \nUnfortunately, the President, in vetoing this legislation not once, but \ntwice, has shown the nation that providing health insurance to children \nis simply not a priority. I am outraged by the President's decision to \nveto this legislation multiple times, but I remain committed to making \nhealth insurance a reality for all children.\n  Congressman Stark and I have introduced our MediKids legislation in \neach of the last four Congresses because we know how vital health \ninsurance is to a child. Children with untreated illnesses are more \nlikely to miss school, leaving them at a disadvantage both in their \nhealth and education. Also, parents with sick children must miss work \nto care for them. These factors make it less likely uninsured children \nwill move out of poverty and present significant barriers to becoming \nproductive members of society. We can have a positive impact on our \nchildren's lives today, as well as tomorrow, by guaranteeing health \ninsurance coverage for all. Children are inexpensive to insure, but the \nrewards for providing them with health care during their early \neducation and development years are invaluable.\n  Despite the well-documented benefits of providing health insurance \ncoverage for children, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there \nare still over 9 million uninsured children in America. We can and must \ndo better. Our children are our future. No child in this country should \never be without access to health care. This is why I am proud to \nreintroduce the MediKids Health Insurance Act.\n  This legislation is a clear investment in our future--our children. \nEvery child would be automatically enrolled at birth into a new, \ncomprehensive federal safety net health insurance program beginning in \n2009. The benefits would be tailored to meet the needs of children and \nwould be similar to those currently avable to chldren through the \nMedicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment, EPSDT, \nprogram. Families below 150 percent of poverty would pay no premiums or \ncopayments, while those between 150 and 300 percent of poverty would \npay graduated premiums up to 5 percent of income and a graduated \nrefundable tax credit for cost sharing. Families above 300 percent of \npoverty would pay a small premium equivalent to \\1/4\\ of the average \nannual cost per child. There would be no cost sharing for preventive or \nwell-child visits for any child.\n\n  MediKids children would remain enrolled in the program throughout \nchildhood. When families move to another state, Medikids would be \navailable until parents enroll their children in a new insurance \nprogram. Between jobs or during family crises, Medikids would offer \nextra security and ensure continuous health coverage to our Nation's \nchildren. During the critical period when a family climbs out of \npoverty and out of the eligibility range for means-tested assistance \nprograms, MediKids would fill in the gaps as parents move into jobs \nthat provide reliable health insurance coverage. Our program rests on \nthe premise that whenever other sources of health insurance fail, \nMediKids would stand ready to cover the health needs of our next \ngeneration. Ultimately, every child in America would grow up with \nconsistent, continuous health insurance coverage.\n  Like Medicare, MediKids would be independently financed, would cover \nbenefits taylored to the needs of its target population, and would have \nthe goal of achieving nearly 100 percent health insurance coverage for \nthe children of this country just as Medicare has done for our Nation's \nseniors and individuals with disabilities throughout its more than 40-\nyear history. When Congress created Medicare in 1965, seniors were more \nlikely to be living in poverty than any other age group. Most were \nunable to afford needed medical services and unable to find health \ninsurance in the market even if they could afford it. Today, it is our \nNation's children who shoulder that burden of poverty.\n  Children in America are nearly twice as vulnerable to poverty as \nadults. It is time we make a significant investment\n\n[[Page S16011]]\n\nin the future of America by guaranteeing all children the health \ncoverage they need to get a healthy start in life.\n  Congress cannot rest on the success we achieved by expanding Medicaid \nand passing the Children's Health Insurance Program. Although each was \na remarkable step toward reducing the ranks of the uninsured, \nparticularly uninsured children, we still have a long way to go, as is \nevidenced by the millions of children who are still uninsured.\n  It's long past time to rekindle the discussion about how to provide \nhealth insurance for all Americans. Americans have told us loud and \nclear that they want leadership in solving the health insurance crisis. \nThe bill I am introducing today--the MediKids Health Insurance Act of \n2007--is a comprehensive approach toward eliminating the irrational and \ntragic lack of health insurance for so many children in our country. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report on long-term revenues.\n       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 9 million American children are uninsured.\n       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care \n     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, \n     which result in lifetime costs to themselves and to the \n     entire American economy.\n       (3) Although SCHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending \n     a health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the \n     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, they \n     alone cannot achieve 100 percent health insurance coverage \n     for our nation's children due to inevitable gaps during \n     outreach and enrollment, fluctuations in eligibility, \n     variations in access to private insurance at all income \n     levels, and variations in States' ability to provide required \n     matching funds.\n       (4) As all segments of society continue to become more \n     transient, with many changes in employment over the working \n     lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety net of \n     health insurance which follows children across State lines, \n     already a major problem for the children of migrant and \n     seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all \n     families in the United States.\n       (5) The medicare program has successfully evolved over the \n     years to provide a stable, universal source of health \n     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, \n     and provides a tested model for designing a program to reach \n     out to America's children.\n       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American \n     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling \n     all children born after December 31, 2008, in a program \n     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and \n     allowing those children to be transferred into other \n     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either \n     private insurance, SCHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible \n     to do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in \n     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other \n     sources of insurance is lost.\n       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to \n     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and \n     children eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid would continue to be \n     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of \n     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in \n     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, \n     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a \n     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.\n       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without \n     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare \n     program.\n       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the \n     special needs of children and updated over time.\n       (10) The financing of the program can be administered \n     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums \n     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's \n     earned income tax credit).\n       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the \n     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last \n     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate \n     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the \n     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity \n     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation \n     of Americans will decline.\n       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always \n     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a \n     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.\n\n     SEC. 2. BENEFITS FOR ALL CHILDREN BORN AFTER 2008.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Social Security Act is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new title:\n\n                     ``TITLE XXII--MEDIKIDS PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 2201.

A bill to establish the National Affordable Housing Trust \nFund in the Treasury of the United States to provide for the \nconstruction, rehabilitation, and preservation of decent, safe, and \naffordable housing for low-income families; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, while we are facing new difficulties in the \nmortgage and subprime markets, we cannot forget the ongoing and \ndeepening crisis that affordable rental housing presents for our \nNation. Long-term changes in the housing market have dramatically \nlimited the availability of affordable rental housing across the \ncountry and have severely increased the cost of rental housing that \nremains. As a result, more and more families are forced to pay more \nthan 50 percent of their income for housing. In 2005, a record 37.3 \nmillion households paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing \ncosts, according to the Nation's Housing 2007 Report from the Joint \nCenter\n\n[[Page S16015]]\n\nfor Housing Studies at Harvard University. Approximately 17 million \nfamilies paid more than half of their incomes on housing costs. This is \nunacceptable. Our Nation must act to ease this rental housing crisis by \nproducing more affordable housing options.\n  We can no longer ignore the lack of affordable housing and the impact \nit is having on families and children around the country. I believe it \nis time for our Nation to take a new path--one that insures that all \nAmericans, especially our poorest children, have the opportunity to \nlive in decent and safe housing.\n  Housing construction is a critical part of our economy. \nUnfortunately, just yesterday the Commerce Department reported that \nconstruction of new homes dropped by 5.5 percent last month, the lowest \nlevel since April 1991. The overall construction decline left home \nbuilding 24.2 percent below the level of activity a year ago. \nResidential construction has seen the largest share of job losses, more \nthan 192,000 since March 2006.\n  The question is, what do we do today to face--and to finance--this \nmounting challenge?\n  In September 2000, I wrote and introduced the original National \nAffordable Housing Trust Fund legislation. Today, along with Senator \nSnowe, I am again proposing to address the severe shortage of \naffordable housing by introducing legislation that will establish a \nNational Affordable Housing Trust Fund and begin a rental housing \nproduction program.\n  The Affordable Housing Trust Fund that is established in this \nlegislation would create a production program that will ensure 1.5 \nmillion new rental units are built over the next 10 years for extremely \nlow-income families and working families. The goal is to create long-\nterm affordable, mixed-income developments in areas with the greatest \nopportunities for low-income families. Sixty percent of Trust Fund \nassistance will be awarded to participating local jurisdictions. Forty \npercent of Trust Fund assistance will be awarded to States, Indian \nTribes and insular areas. A proportionate amount of funds to the States \nmust go to rural areas. If the total amount available for the Trust \nFund is less than $2 billion, then there is a $750,000 minimum funding \nthreshold for local jurisdictions.\n  All funding from the Trust Fund must be used for low-income families, \ndefined as those families with incomes below 80 percent of the State or \nlocal median income. However, if the funding for the trust fund is less \nthan $2 billion for any year, then the income ceiling is reduced to 60 \npercent of local median income.\n  The funding from the Trust Fund can be used for construction, \nrehabilitation, acquisition, preservation incentives, and operating \nassistance to ease the affordable housing crisis. Funds can also be \nused for downpayment and closing cost assistance by first time \nhomebuyers.\n  The Trust Fund will be funded through amounts transferred from the \nFederal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan \nMortgage Corporation under Title XIII of the Housing and Community \nDevelopment Act of 1992. It will also be funded through any amounts \nappropriated under the authorization in the Expanding American \nHomeownership Act of 2007, relating to the use of FHA savings for an \naffordable housing grant program. Finally, the Trust Fund will be \nfunded through any amounts as are or may be appropriated, transferred \nor credited to such fund under any other provisions of law.\n\n  The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund bill is cosponsored by a \nbipartisan group of Senators. Earlier this year, the House of \nRepresentatives passed legislation, introduced by House Financial \nServices Chairman Barney Frank, to establish a National Affordable \nHousing Trust Fund by a 264-148 vote. It has been endorsed by more than \n5,700 community organizations led by the National Low-Income Housing \nCoalition and including the National Association of Realtors, the \nNational Association of Home Builders, Children's Defense Fund, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, National Coalition for the Homeless, and others. \nI am pleased that Senator Reed, within the Government Sponsored \nEnterprise Mission Improvement Act, included legislative language \nwithin the Affordable Housing Block Grant section to provide grants to \nan Affordable Housing Trust Fund.\n  Enacting the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund will help reverse \nthe recent declines in housing jobs, starts, permits and construction \nin every State. It will help small businesses across the Nation \ncontinue to produce the jobs that are critical to our economic security \ntoday and in the future.\n  During this time of rising rents, increased housing costs, and the \nloss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we are \nnot doing more to increase the amount of housing assistance available \nto working families. The need for affordable housing is severe. Many \nworking families have been unable to keep up with the increase in \nhousing costs. In 2005, one in seven households was considered to be \n``severely housing cost burdened.''\n  For too many low-income families and their children, the cost of \nprivately owned rental housing is simply out of reach. Today, working \nfamilies in this country increasingly find themselves unable to afford \nhousing. According to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, in \nMassachusetts, the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment is \nalmost $1,200 per month. In order to afford this apartment without \npaying more than 30 percent of income on housing, a household must earn \nover $47,000 per year. This means teachers, janitors, social workers, \npolice officers and other full-time workers are having trouble \naffording even a modest two-bedroom apartment.\n  The cost of rental housing keeps going up. According to the Consumer \nPrice Index, CPI, contract rents began to rise above the rate of \ninflation in 1997 and have continued every year since. Rental costs \nhave outpaced renter income gains for households across the board. Low \nwage workers have been hardest hit by the increase in the cost of \nrental housing.\n  Because of the lack of affordable housing, too many families are \nforced to live in substandard living conditions putting their children \nat risk. Children living in substandard housing are more likely to \nexperience violence, hunger, lead poisoning and to suffer from \ninfectious diseases such as asthma. They are more likely to have \ndifficulties learning and more likely to fall behind in school. Our \nNation's children depend upon access to affordable rental housing.\n  At the same time the cost of rental housing has been increasing, \nthere has been a significant decrease in the number of affordable \nrental housing units. According to Real Capital Analytics, the number \nof rentals in larger multifamily properties converted to for-sale units \njumped from just a few thousand in 2003 to 235,000 in 2005. New \nconstruction of multifamily buildings intended for rental use dipped \nfrom 262,000 units in 2003 to 184,000 in 2006. Simultaneously, the \nnumber of renter households increased by 1.2 million. The decline in \naffordable rental units has already forced many working families \neligible for Section 8 vouchers in Boston to live outside the city \nbecause there are no available rental housing units that accept \nvouchers.\n  The loss of affordable housing has exacerbated the housing crisis in \nthis country, and the Federal Government must take action. We need to \nenact the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund to jumpstart the \nproduction of affordable housing in the U.S.\n  Decent housing, along with neighborhood and living environment, play \nenormous roles in shaping young lives. Federal housing assistance over \nthe past generation has helped millions of low-income children across \nthe Nation and has helped in developing stable home environments. \nHowever, changes in the housing market clearly show that we need to \ntake additional steps to both produce and maintain affordable housing \nunits. Otherwise, many more children and their families will live in \nsubstandard housing or will become homeless. These children are less \nlikely to do well in school and less likely to be productive citizens. \nThey deserve our best efforts and require our help.\n  I ask all Senators to support the National Affordable Housing Trust \nFund Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2527. A bill to prohibit the obligation or expenditure of funds \nfor the Osprey tiltrotor aircraft; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n[[Page S16016]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrescind funds appropriated for the procurement of the V-22 and CV-22 \nOsprey. This aircraft has been the subject of significant controversy \nbecause of safety, technical, and cost problems. In 1991, then-\nSecretary Dick Cheney tried to cancel the program altogether. I have \nlong advocated for more extensive testing of the aircraft to evaluate \ndesign defects that render the Osprey unstable and technical problems \nthat have already cost the lives of 30 servicemembers. New problems \nwere discovered as recently as June 2007.\n  I appreciate that the military is in need of additional helicopters, \nparticularly as a result of the high operational tempo in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Given the fact that the Osprey costs significantly more \nthan other aircraft that can meet the same need, I believe we should \nshift to a safer, more economic program.\n  This bill would rescind funds appropriated for the program through \n2008. That includes $2.8 billion in previously appropriated but \nunobligated funds and $2.9 billion in funds appropriated for fiscal \nyear 08. The Defense Department estimates it will spend an additional \n$28.6 billion to purchase a total of 458 Osprey through 2018. Ending \nthis troubled program could produce savings of over $34.3 billion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ:\n  S. 2528. A bill to authorize guarantees for bonds and notes issued \nfor community or economic development purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Full Faith \n& Credit in Our Communities Act of 2007. Strong communities form the \nbedrock of a successful economy and ultimately, a healthy society. For \ncommunities to be strong and families to prosper, there must be \neconomic opportunity. Economic opportunity, in turn, depends on access \nto capital. Unfortunately, many communities across our Nation lack this \nfundamental tool for financial prosperity and self-sufficiency.\n  We must provide economic opportunity not only today, but also lay the \ngroundwork so that future generations can thrive and prosper, and we \nmust do it in a way that fosters real and permanent change rather than \nshort-term solutions. We cannot simply rely on short-term band aids \nthat serve to only mask the vast inequalities in income and \nunacceptable levels of poverty that plague our Nation. We must invest \nin our Nation's future. We must close the wealth gaps that are growing \nwider each day in this country by investing in our citizens and closing \nthe opportunity gap. We must invest in entrepreneurship, ownership, and \neconomic growth--but we must do so in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  Federal resources are scarce. We must focus our efforts and invest in \nsuccessful programs that give us the biggest bang for our buck. CDFIs \nhave a history of prudently using scarce public funds to leverage \nadditional private funding to finance emerging domestic markets. They \nare able to lend successfully in these markets in part because CDFIs \nbuild their borrowers' capacity by combining their financing with \ntechnical assistance such as homeownership counseling, entrepreneurial \ntraining, and financial literacy education. CDFIs finance small \nbusinesses, homeownership, affordable rental housing, childcare \nfacilities, charter schools, and other needed development resources. \nAbout 1,000 CDFIs operating in the U.S. manage more than $25 billion in \nassets, providing much-needed financial services to low-income \ncommunities across the U.S.\n  Unfortunately, CDFIs have limited access to capital due to the \nrelatively small size of, and lack of awareness about, their projects. \nThis results in a hesitancy of Wall Street to invest in CDFIs, forcing \nthem to rely largely on commercial banks which usually only offer \nshort-term loans with high interest rates. Every dollar wasted on \ninterest payments is another dollar lost to communities, making these \nadditional costs a clear impediment to community development efforts.\n  This legislation would increase the length and decrease the cost of \ncapital available to CDFIs by providing them access to the enormous \nfinancial power of Wall Street. It would accomplish this by allowing \nthe Treasury Department to guarantee up to $1 billion per year in bonds \nissued by qualified CDFIs. These bonds would be sold on Wall Street \nwith the proceeds going to CDFIs to finance a myriad of community and \neconomic development projects such as job-training centers and health \ncare clinics. Unlike many legislative proposals that often result in \nwinners and losers, this legislation is a win-win for everyone \ninvolved. CDFIs will have access to much-needed, low-cost capital. \nCommunities will benefit from an infusion of investments in community \nand economic development projects. And investors will have an \nopportunity to make sound, long-term investments.\n  Perhaps the best part of this legislation is that it should not end \nup costing the American taxpayer a single dollar. Since these bonds \nwill be issued by CDFIs, they will be the ones responsible for honoring \nthe bonds when they reach maturity. Considering the fact that CDFIs \nhave very low loan default rates that are often below mainstream bank \naverages, the risk of insolvency is very low. To further mitigate this \nrisk, CDFIs will be required to create a loan loss reserve fund, \nsimilar in nature, but much smaller in scope, to the FDIC.\n  In addition to providing low-cost capital to underserved communities, \nthis legislation would require CDFIs to pay a portion of their savings \nto a subaccount of the Treasury Department's CDFI Fund. These funds \nwill be used to provide technical and financial assistance grants to \nnon-profits for community and economic development purposes. CDFIs can \napply for these grants through a competitive application process with \nthe requirement to match, dollar for dollar, Federal funds with private \ninvestment. According to the Treasury Department, for every Federal \ndollar of investment, CDFIs leverage $19 in non-federal funds. CDFIs \nuse the ``seed capital'' from the Federal Government to attract \nprivate-sector capital, ensuring continued community investment well \nbeyond the initial Federal funding.\n  A community isn't complete without places to shop and work, without \naffordable housing, without the prosperity that thriving businesses \nrepresent. My Full Faith & Credit in Our Communities Act will help \nCDFIs develop retail and commercial facilities, train and place \nneighborhood residents in jobs, and provide affordable housing across \nthe country. This bill is essential for our people and communities most \nin need.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Approximately 916,000 individuals were prohibited from \n     purchasing a firearm for failing a background check between \n     November 30, 1998, (the date the National Instant Criminal \n     Background Check System (NICS) began operating) and December \n     31, 2004.\n       (2) From November 30, 1998, through December 31, 2004, \n     nearly 49,000,000 Brady background checks were processed \n     through NICS.\n       (3) Although most Brady background checks are processed \n     through NICS in seconds, many background checks are delayed \n     if the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not have \n     automated access to complete information from the States \n     concerning persons prohibited from possessing or receiving a \n     firearm under Federal or State law.\n       (4) Nearly 21,000,000 criminal records are not accessible \n     by NICS and millions of criminal records are missing critical \n     data, such as arrest dispositions, due to data backlogs.\n       (5) The primary cause of delay in NICS background checks is \n     the lack of--\n       (A) updates and available State criminal disposition \n     records; and\n       (B) automated access to information concerning persons \n     prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm because of \n     mental illness, restraining orders, or misdemeanor \n     convictions for domestic violence.\n       (6) Automated access to this information can be improved \n     by--\n       (A) computerizing information relating to criminal history, \n     criminal dispositions, mental illness, restraining orders, \n     and misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence; or\n       (B) making such information available to NICS in a usable \n     format.\n       (7) Helping States to automate these records will reduce \n     delays for law-abiding gun purchasers.\n       (8) On March 12, 2002, the senseless shooting, which took \n     the lives of a priest and a parishioner at the Our Lady of \n     Peace Church in Lynbrook, New York, brought attention to the \n     need to improve information-sharing that would enable Federal \n     and State law enforcement agencies to conduct a complete \n     background check on a potential firearm purchaser. The man \n     who committed this double murder had a prior disqualifying \n     mental health commitment and a restraining order against him, \n     but passed a Brady\n\n[[Page S16025]]\n\n     background check because NICS did not have the necessary \n     information to determine that he was ineligible to purchase a \n     firearm under Federal or State law.\n       (9) On April 16, 2007, a student with a history of mental \n     illness at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State \n     University shot to death 32 students and faculty members, \n     wounded 17 more, and then took his own life. The shooting, \n     the deadliest campus shooting in United States history, \n     renewed the need to improve information-sharing that would \n     enable Federal and State law enforcement agencies to conduct \n     complete background checks on potential firearms purchasers. \n     In spite of a proven history of mental illness, the shooter \n     was able to purchase the two firearms used in the shooting. \n     Improved coordination between State and Federal authorities \n     could have ensured that the shooter's disqualifying mental \n     health information was available to NICS.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Court order.--The term ``court order'' includes a court \n     order (as described in section 922(g)(8) of title 18, United \n     States Code).\n       (2) Mental health terms.--The terms ``adjudicated as a \n     mental defective'' and ``committed to a mental institution'' \n     have the same meanings as in section 922(g)(4) of title 18, \n     United States Code.\n       (3) Misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.--The term \n     ``misdemeanor crime of domestic violence'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 921(a)(33) of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n\n                    TITLE I--TRANSMITTAL OF RECORDS\n\n     SEC. 101.

or\n       (ii) a person has been adjudicated as a mental defective or \n     committed to a mental institution.\n       (c) Standard for Adjudications and Commitments Related to \n     Mental Health.--\n       (1) In general.--No department or agency of the Federal \n     Government may provide to the Attorney General any record of \n     an adjudication related to the mental health of a person or \n     any commitment of a person to a mental institution if--\n       (A) the adjudication or commitment, respectively, has been \n     set aside or expunged, or the person has otherwise been fully \n     released or discharged from all mandatory treatment, \n     supervision, or monitoring;\n       (B) the person has been found by a court, board, \n     commission, or other lawful authority to no longer suffer \n     from the mental health condition that was the basis of the \n     adjudication or commitment, respectively, or has otherwise \n     been found to be rehabilitated through any procedure \n     available under law; or\n       (C) the adjudication or commitment, respectively, is based \n     solely on a medical finding of disability, without an \n     opportunity for a hearing by a court, board, commission, or \n     other lawful authority, and the person has not been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective consistent with section \n     922(g)(4) of title 18, United States Code, except that \n     nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall \n     prevent a Federal department or agency from providing to the \n     Attorney General any record demonstrating that a person was \n     adjudicated to be not guilty by reason of insanity, or based \n     on lack of mental responsibility, or found incompetent to \n     stand trial, in any criminal case or under the Uniform Code \n     of Military Justice.\n       (2) Treatment of certain adjudications and commitments.--\n       (A) Program for relief from disabilities.--\n       (i) In general.--Each department or agency of the United \n     States that makes any adjudication related to the mental \n     health of a person or imposes any commitment to a mental \n     institution, as described in subsection (d)(4) and (g)(4) of \n     section 922 of title 18, United States Code, shall establish, \n     not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, a program that permits such a person to apply for relief \n     from the disabilities imposed by such subsections.\n       (ii) Process.--Each application for relief submitted under \n     the program required by this subparagraph shall be processed \n     not later than 365 days after the receipt of the application. \n     If a Federal department or agency fails to resolve an \n     application for relief within 365 days for any reason, \n     including a lack of appropriated funds, the department or \n     agency shall be deemed for all purposes to have denied such \n     request for relief without cause.

Any Federal \n     agency that grants a person relief from disabilities under \n     this subparagraph shall notify such person that the person is \n     no longer prohibited under 922(d)(4) or 922(g)(4) of title \n     18, United States Code, on account of the relieved disability \n     for which relief was granted pursuant to a proceeding \n     conducted under this subparagraph, with respect to the \n     acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or \n     possession of firearms.\n       (3) Notice requirement.--Effective 30 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, any Federal department or agency \n     that conducts proceedings to adjudicate a person as a mental \n     defective under 922(d)(4) or 922(g)(4) of title 18, United \n     States Code, shall provide both oral and written notice to \n     the individual at the commencement of the adjudication \n     process including--\n       (A) notice that should the agency adjudicate the person as \n     a mental defective, or should the person be committed to a \n     mental institution, such adjudication, when final, or such \n     commitment, will prohibit the individual from purchasing, \n     possessing, receiving, shipping or transporting a firearm or \n     ammunition under section 922(d)(4) or section 922(g)(4) of \n     title 18, United States Code;\n\n[[Page S16026]]\n\n       (B) information about the penalties imposed for unlawful \n     possession, receipt, shipment or transportation of a firearm \n     under section 924(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code; and\n       (C) information about the availability of relief from the \n     disabilities imposed by Federal laws with respect to the \n     acquisition, receipt, transfer, shipment, transportation, or \n     possession of firearms.\n       (4) Effective date.--Except for paragraph (3), this \n     subsection shall apply to names and other information \n     provided before, on, or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.

Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. Biden (for himself and Mr. McConnell)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 3890, of 2003 to impose import \nsanctions on Burmese gemstones, expand the number of individuals \nagainst whom the visa ban is applicable, expand the blocking of assets \nand other prohibited activities, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burma Democracy Promotion \n     Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of \n     citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and \n     students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against \n     rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and \n     repressive policies of the State Peace and Development \n     Council, the ruling military regime in Burma--\n       (A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, \n     including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and\n       (B) to urge the SPDC to engage in meaningful dialogue to \n     pursue national reconciliation.\n       (2) The SPDC violently confronted unarmed demonstrators, \n     killing, injuring, and imprisoning citizens, including \n     several thousand Buddhist monks, and continues to forcefully \n     restrict peaceful forms of public expression.\n       (3) The Department of State's 2006 Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices found that the SPDC--\n       (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, \n     assembly, association, religion, and movement;\n       (B) traffics in persons;\n       (C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;\n       (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and\n       (E) commits other serious violations of human rights, \n     including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, \n     disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and \n     detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for \n     political motives.\n       (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or \n     held under house arrest for more than 12 years.\n       (5) On September 25, 2007, President Bush announced that \n     the United States would--\n       (A) tighten economic sanctions against Burma, and block \n     property and interests in property of--\n       (i) certain senior leaders of the SPDC;\n       (ii) individuals who provide financial backing for the \n     SPDC; and\n       (iii) individuals responsible for violations of human \n     rights and for impeding the transition to democracy in Burma; \n     and\n       (B) impose an expanded visa ban on individuals--\n       (i) responsible for violations of human rights; and\n       (ii) who aid, abet, or benefit from the efforts of the SPDC \n     to impede the efforts of the people of Burma to transition to \n     democracy and ensure respect for human dignity.\n       (6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their \n     ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies, \n     and military activities through financial transactions, \n     travel, and trade involving the United States, including the \n     sale of gemstones and hardwoods.\n       (7) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the \n     Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Millions of \n     dollars in gemstones that are exported from Burma ultimately \n     enter the United States, but the Burmese regime attempts to \n     conceal the origin of the gemstones in an effort to evade \n     sanctions. For example, over 90 percent of the world's ruby \n     supply originates in Burma but only 3 percent of the rubies \n     entering the United States are claimed to be of Burmese \n     origin. The value of Burmese gemstones is predominantly based \n     on their original quality and geological origin, rather than \n     the labor involved in cutting and polishing the gemstones.\n       (8) Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the \n     world's native teak reserves. More than \\1/4\\ of the world's \n     internationally traded teak originates from Burma, and \n     hardwood sales, mainly of teak, represent more than 11 \n     percent of Burma's official foreign exchange earnings.\n       (9) Burma officially exports tens of millions of dollars \n     worth of rubies, sapphires, pearls, jade, and other precious \n     stones each year and the SPDC owns a majority stake in all \n     mining operations within the borders of Burma.\n       (10) On October 11, 2007, the United Nations Security \n     Council, with the consent of the People's Republic of China, \n     issued a statement condemning the violence in Burma, urging \n     the release of all political prisoners, and calling on the \n     SPDC to enter into a United Nations-mediated dialogue with \n     its political opposition.\n       (11) The United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari \n     traveled to Burma from September 29, 2007, through October 2, \n     2007, holding meetings with SPDC leader General Than Shwe and \n     democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi in an effort to promote \n     dialogue between the SPDC and democracy advocates.\n       (12) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive \n     to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, \n     the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the People's \n     Republic of China if they come under targeted economic \n     pressure that denies them access to personal wealth and \n     sources of revenue.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House with respect to H.r. 3997.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the House agree to the amendments of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 3997) entitled ``An Act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide earnings assistance \n     and tax relief to members of the uniformed services, \n     volunteer firefighters, and Peace Corps volunteers, and for \n     other purposes'', with an amendment.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as the Christmas season approaches, it is \nimportant to pause and reflect on the sacrifices that our men and women \nin uniform make for us every day.\n  Fully 1.4 million American service men and women have served in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, or both. Nearly 30,000 troops have been wounded in action.\n  In September, I took a trip to Iraq. I was so impressed by what an \namazing job our troops are doing. I met many Montanans from small towns \nlike Roundup and Townsend. Despite all of the hardships that they \nface--all the danger--they keep at it every day. I saw firsthand what a \nheavy burden our troops bear for all of us.\n  Today, one small way to support them in their efforts is to make the \nTax Code a little more troop-friendly. We can extend the special tax \nrules that make sense for our military that expire in 2007 and 2008. \nAnd we can eliminate roadblocks in the current tax laws that present \ndifficulties to veterans and servicemembers.\n  For example, family members of fallen soldiers killed in the line of \nduty receive a death gratuity benefit of $100,000, but the Tax Code \nrestricts the survivors from contributing this benefit into a Roth IRA. \nToday we can make sure that the family members of fallen soldiers may \ntake advantage of tax-favored accounts.\n  Another hazard in the tax laws impeding our disabled veterans is the \nstatute of limitations for filing a tax refund. Most VA disability \nclaims filed by veterans are quickly resolved. But many disability \nawards are delayed due to lost paperwork or the appeals of rejected \nclaims. Once a disabled vet finally gets a favorable award, the good \nnews is that the disability award is tax-free. But the bad news is that \nmany of these disabled veterans get ambushed by a statute that bars \nthem from filing a tax refund claim. Today, we can give disabled \nveterans an extra year to claim their tax refunds.\n  Most troops doing the heavy lifting in combat situations are the \nlower ranking, lower income bracket soldiers. Their income needs to \ncount towards computing the earned income tax credit, or EITC. But the \nprovision that makes EITC work for combat troops expires at the end of \n2007. The EITC is a very beneficial tax provision available to working \nAmericans. And it makes no sense to deny it to our troops. Today we can \nmake combat duty income count for EITC purposes and make this change to \nthe Tax Code permanent.\n  I should mention that these tax provisions are fully paid for. A \nchange in the Tax Code makes sure that any individual relinquishing \ntheir U.S. citizenship is still on the hook to pay for their fair share \nof U.S. taxes.\n  A soldier's rucksack is heavy enough as it is without loading it down \nwith tax burdens. We owe the Americans fighting in our armed forces an \nenormous debt of gratitude.\n  That's why today I am asking for these important tax reforms. They \nare one small way that we can salute our men and women in uniform for \nall they do.\n  Also included in this package are a series of tax technical \ncorrections. These noncontroversial provisions contain corrections to \nvarious tax acts from 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n  These technical changes include clarifications on the contributions \nof fractional interests in tangible property, modification of the \nactive business definition under section 355, timing of claims for \nexcess alternative fuel, and the treatment of losses on positions in \nidentified straddles.\n  The technical corrections package also includes a number of clerical \nand conforming amendments, including amendments correcting \ntypographical errors.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 333, S. 1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1974) to make technical corrections related to \n     the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in connection with S. 1974, the Pension \nProtection Technical Corrections Act of 2007, the ranking Republican \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and I have prepared \na joint statement that contains an explanation of the bill. This \nexplanation expresses the Senate Finance Committee's understanding of \nthe provisions of the bill and serves as a reference in understanding \nthe legislative intent behind this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this joint statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Joint Statement of Senators Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley\n\n       The Pension Protection Act of 2006 arguably marks the most \n     sweeping changes to\n\n[[Page S16049]]\n\n     the pension laws since the enactment of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In general, the Act, \n     which was signed into law on August 17, 2006, changes the \n     funding rules for single-employer defined benefit pension \n     plans, expands the deduction limits for contributions to such \n     plans, modifies the rules for determining lump sum \n     distributions, and provides clarification and adds new rules \n     for cash balance pension plans. The Act also provides special \n     funding rules for plans maintained by airlines and airline \n     catering companies, provides new rules for multiemployer \n     pension plans, and requires increased disclosure of pension \n     plan information. In the defined contribution plan area, the \n     Pension Act adds rules relating to automatic enrollment \n     plans, eliminating legal impediments to such arrangements and \n     providing incentives for plan sponsors to adopt these \n     arrangements. There were modifications to prohibited \n     transactions and other fiduciary rules under ERISA, \n     particularly with regard to the provision of investment \n     advice. A welcome addition to the Act was the elimination of \n     the expiration date of the tax provisions added as part of \n     the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001, so that the increases in contribution limits to IRAs, \n     401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans, the catch-up contribution and \n     the Roth 401(k), will continue to apply and not sunset in \n     2010.\n       Like many complicated pieces of legislation, technical \n     corrections to the law must be made. Technical corrections to \n     the law are often time sensitive. That is, many of them must \n     be passed by both Houses of Congress before the effective \n     date of the statute. Like many of the rules under the Pension \n     Act, the funding rules for single-employer defined benefit \n     pension plans are effective January 1, 2008. If technical \n     corrections to the single-employer defined benefit plan \n     funding rules are not passed by year-end, the pension \n     community and the Department of Treasury--the agency tasked \n     with interpreting the statute and providing the necessary \n     details on how the new law works--will be placed in a very \n     tough spot. That is, the Department of Treasury will not have \n     the necessary corrections and clarifications of the original \n     intent of the Act to sufficiently issue the details necessary \n     to allow the pension community to achieve proper compliance. \n     This is not fair to the pension community or the Treasury \n     Department. Failing to pass a pension technical corrections \n     bill by December 31, 2007, would therefore be irresponsible.\n       It has come to the Senate's attention that the House of \n     Representatives does not share the Senate's sense of urgency \n     about these time-sensitive pension technical corrections. We \n     don't understand this position. Perhaps, the House majority \n     wants to re-negotiate the Pension Act, which could be \n     accomplished by delaying the effective date of the statute \n     for 1 year. We would like to remind everyone that the Senate \n     passed the Act by a 93 to 5 vote. It is clear that a \n     bipartisan majority of the Senate thinks the Pension Act is \n     good pension policy. It is also clear that the Senate does \n     not and would not support delaying effective date of the \n     statute. That is a non-starter.\n       So we urge the House to heed the warnings from the pension \n     community that pension plan participants could be adversely \n     affected without the necessary corrections and clarifications \n     of the Pension Act. We urge the House to pass S. 1974 before \n     Congress adjourns. Failure to pass a pension technical \n     corrections package would send the wrong message to plan \n     sponsors and pension plan participants.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read \na third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord; that upon passage, the bill remain at the desk until such time \nthe Senate receives a companion measure from the House; that the Senate \nthen proceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken, the text of S. 1974, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof, the bill advanced to third reading, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table without further intervening action or \ndebate, and that S. 1974 be returned to the calendar.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this year marks the 25th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Air Force Space Command. In 1982, the U.S. Air Force created \nthe U.S. Air Force Space Command to defend North America through its \nspace and intercontinental ballistic operations. Since its creation, \nAir Force Space Command has become a leader in defense capabilities. \nThey provide a significant portion of U.S. Strategic Command's \nwarfighting capabilities, including missile warning, strategic \ndeterrence, and space-based surveillance capabilities. They now monitor \nspace radars providing vital information on the location of satellites \nand space debris for the Nation and the world.\n  Today, nearly 25 years after the establishment of U.S. Air Force \nSpace Command, space plays an even more important role in national \nsecurity. The current war on terror requires extensive use of space-\nbased communications, GPS and meteorological data to effectively \nprosecute military operations. The United States relies on space for \nwarfighting capabilities, missile defense, and strategic deterrence. \nAir Force Space Command has been a leader in this area and remains a \ncritical component of national security.\n  I would also like to recognize the men and women of Air Force Space \nCommand. Their hard work and dedication provide vital support to our \nmilitary and the security of this Nation. They have been instrumental \nin disaster relief and homeland defense. I thank them for their service \nto the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I am proud ask that the Senate unanimously pass this \nresolution today recognizing the contributions and achievements of Air \nForce Space Command over the past 25 years.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 389) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 389\n\n       Whereas, on September 1, 1982, the United States Air Force \n     created the United States Air Force Space Command to defend \n     North America through its space and intercontinental \n     ballistic missile operations;\n       Whereas 2007 marks the 25th year of excellence and service \n     of Air Force Space Command to the United States of America;\n       Whereas the mission of Air Force Space Command is to \n     deliver trained and ready airmen with unrivaled space \n     capabilities to defend the United States;\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command organizes, trains, and \n     equips forces to supply combatant commanders with the space \n     and intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities to defend \n     the United States and its national interests;\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command's ground-based radar and \n     Defense Support Program satellites monitor ballistic missile \n     launches around the world to guard against a surprise missile \n     attack on North America;\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command provides a significant \n     portion of United States Strategic Command's war fighting \n     capabilities, including missile warning, strategic \n     deterrence, and space-based surveillance capabilities;\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command space radar provide vital \n     information on the location of satellites and space debris \n     for the Nation and the world;\n       Whereas the current war on terror requires extensive use of \n     space-based communications, global positioning systems, and \n     meteorological data to effectively prosecute military \n     operations;\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command provides war fighters with \n     ``high ground'' through satellite communications and \n     positioning and timing data for ground and air operations and \n     weapons delivery;\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command deployed helicopters to the \n     Gulf Coast region during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina \n     to deliver meals, water, and medical supplies and to conduct \n     search and rescue operations;\n       Whereas the work done by the men and women of Air Force \n     Space Command is vital to our military, making the Nation \n     more combat effective and helping save lives every day; and\n       Whereas Air Force Space Command advocates space \n     capabilities and systems for all unified commands and \n     military services, and collectively provides space \n     capabilities America needs today and in the future: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) recognizes the contributions made by Air Force Space \n     Command to the security of the United States; and\n         (2) commemorates Air Force Space Command's 25 years of \n     excellence and service to the Nation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4839.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4839) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to make technical corrections, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in connection with H.R. 4839, the Tax \nTechnical Corrections Act of 2007, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation is making available to the public a document that contains a \ntechnical explanation of the bill. This technical explanation expresses \nthe Senate Finance Committee's understanding of the tax and other \nprovisions of the bill and serves as a useful reference in \nunderstanding the legislative intent behind this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this technical explanation printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                I. Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2007\n\n       The bill includes technical corrections to recently enacted \n     tax legislation. Except as otherwise provided, the amendments \n     made by the technical corrections contained in the bill take \n     effect as if included in the original legislation to which \n     each amendment relates.\n     Amendment Related to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n         2006\n       Individuals with long-term unused credits under the \n     alternative minimum tax (Act sec. 402 of Division A).--Under \n     present law, an individual's minimum tax credit allowable for \n     any taxable year beginning after December 20, 2006, and \n     before January 1, 2013, is not less than the ``AMT refundable \n     credit amount.'' The AMT refundable credit amount is the \n     greater of (1) the lesser of $5,000 or the long-term unused \n     minimum tax credit, or (2) 20 percent of the long-term unused \n     minimum tax credit. The long-term unused minimum tax credit \n     for any taxable year means the portion of the minimum tax \n     credit attributable to the adjusted net minimum tax for \n     taxable years before the 3rd taxable year immediately \n     preceding the taxable year (assuming the credits are used on \n     a first-in, first-out basis). In the case of an individual \n     whose adjusted gross income for a taxable year exceeds the \n     threshold amount (within the meaning of section \n     151(d)(3)(C)), the AMT refundable credit amount is reduced by \n     the applicable percentage (within the meaning of section \n     151(d)(3)(B)). The additional credit allowable by reason of \n     this provision is refundable.\n       The provision amends the definition of the AMT refundable \n     credit amount. The provision provides that the AMT refundable \n     credit amount (before any reduction by reason of adjusted \n     gross income) is an amount (not in excess of the long-term \n     unused minimum tax\n\n[[Page S16057]]\n\n     credit) equal to the greater of (1) $5,000, (2) 20 percent of \n     the long-term unused minimum tax credit, or (3) the AMT \n     refundable credit amount (if any) for the prior taxable year \n     (before any reduction by reason of adjusted gross income).\n       The provision may be illustrated by the following example: \n     Assume an individual, whose adjusted gross income for all \n     taxable years is less than the threshold amount, has a long-\n     term unused minimum tax credit for 2007 of $100,000 and has \n     no other minimum tax credits. The individual's AMT refundable \n     credit amount under present law is $20,000 in 2007, $16,000 \n     in 2008, $10,240 in 2009, $8,192 in 2010, $6,554 in 2011, and \n     $5,243 in 2012. Under the provision, the individual's AMT \n     refundable credit amount is $20,000 for 2007 (as under \n     present law), and in each of the taxable years 2008 thru 2011 \n     the AMT refundable credit amount is also $20,000. The minimum \n     tax credit in 2012 is zero.\n     Amendments Related to Title XII of the Pension Protection Act \n         of 2006 (Provisions Relating to Exempt Organizations)\n       Tax-free distributions from individual retirement plans for \n     charitable purposes (Act sec. 1201).--Under the provision, \n     when determining the portion of a distribution that would \n     otherwise be includible in income, the otherwise includible \n     amount is determined as if all amounts were distributed from \n     all of the individual's IRAs.\n       Contributions of appreciated property by S corporations \n     (Act sec. 1203).--Under present law (sec. 1366(d)), the \n     amount of losses and deductions which a shareholder of an S \n     corporation may take into account in any taxable year is \n     limited to the shareholder's adjusted basis in his stock and \n     indebtedness of the corporation. The provision provides that \n     this basis limitation does not apply to a contribution of \n     appreciated property to the extent the shareholder's pro rata \n     share of the contribution exceeds the shareholder's pro rata \n     share of the adjusted basis of the property. Thus, the basis \n     limitation of section 1366(d) does not apply to the amount of \n     deductible appreciation in the contributed property. The \n     provision does not apply to contributions made in taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2007.\n       For example, assume that in taxable year 2007, an S \n     corporation with one shareholder makes a charitable \n     contribution of a capital asset held more than one year with \n     an adjusted basis of $200 and a fair market value of $500. \n     Assume the shareholder's adjusted basis of the stock (as \n     determined under section 1366(d)(1)(A)) is $300. For purposes \n     of applying the limitation under section 1366(d) to the \n     contribution, the limitation does not apply to the $300 of \n     appreciation and since the $300 adjusted basis of the stock \n     exceeds the $200 adjusted basis of the contributed property, \n     the limitation does not apply at all to the contribution. \n     Thus, the shareholder is treated as making a $500 charitable \n     contribution. The shareholder reduces the basis of the S \n     corporation stock by $200 to $100 (pursuant to section \n     1367(a)(2)).\n       Recapture of tax benefit for charitable contributions of \n     exempt use property not used for an exempt use (Act sec. \n     1215).--The Act permits a charitable deduction in the amount \n     of the fair market value (not the donor's basis) for tangible \n     personal property if an officer of the donee organization \n     certifies upon disposition of the donated property that the \n     use of the property was related to the purpose or function \n     constituting the basis of the donee's tax-exempt status. It \n     was not intended that the donee's use, though so related, not \n     also be substantial. The provision adds to the certification \n     requirement that the officer certify that use of the property \n     by the donee was substantial.\n       Contributions of fractional interests in tangible personal \n     property (Act sec. 1218).--The Act added an income tax \n     provision providing for treatment of contributions of \n     fractional interests in tangible personal property. A special \n     valuation rule is provided under this rule that creates \n     unintended consequences under the estate and gift tax. The \n     provision therefore strikes the special valuation rule for \n     estate and gift tax purposes.\n       Time for assessment of penalty relating to substantial and \n     gross valuation misstatements attributable to incorrect \n     appraisals (Act section 1219).--Section 1219 of the Act added \n     a penalty for substantial and gross valuation misstatements \n     attributable to incorrect appraisals (Code sec. 6695A). \n     First, the Act omitted to apply the penalty with respect to \n     substantial valuation misstatements for estate and gift tax \n     purposes, and the provision clarifies that the penalty \n     applies for such purposes. Second, in the cross references \n     for the penalty, the language of Code section 6696(d)(1), \n     relating to the time period for assessment of the penalty, \n     was not properly described. The provision adds a cross \n     reference to section 6695A in section 6696(d).\n       Expansion of the base of tax on private foundation net \n     investment income (Act sec. 1221).--The Act expands the base \n     of the tax on net investment income of private foundations.\n       The provision clarifies that capital gains from \n     appreciation are included in this tax base. This \n     clarification conforms the statutory language to the \n     technical explanation.\n       Public disclosure of information relating to unrelated \n     business income tax returns (Act sec. 1225).--The Act added a \n     provision requiring that section 501(c)(3) organizations make \n     publicly available their unrelated business income tax \n     returns. However, as drafted, the requirement that, with \n     respect to a Form 990, an organization make publicly \n     available only the last three years of returns (sec. \n     6104(d)(2)) does not apply to disclosure of Form 990-T, \n     because Form 990-T is required by section 6011, not by \n     section 6033. The provision clarifies that the 3-year \n     limitation on making returns publicly available applies to \n     Form 990-T. The provision clarifies that the IRS is required \n     to make Form 990-T publicly available, subject to redaction \n     procedures applicable to Form 990 under section 6104(b).\n       Donor advised funds (Act 1231).--The Act imposed excise \n     taxes in the event of certain taxable distributions (Code \n     sec. 4966) and on the provision of certain prohibited \n     benefits (sec. 4967), but does not cross refer to these \n     provisions in the section 4962 definition of qualified first \n     tier taxes for purposes of tax abatement (though a cross \n     reference to them is included in section 4963). The provision \n     adds a cross reference to them in Code section 4962 (relating \n     to abatement).\n       Excess benefit transactions involving supporting \n     organizations (Act sec. 1242).--New Code section 4958(c)(3) \n     provides that certain transactions involving supporting \n     organizations are treated as excess benefit transactions for \n     purposes of the intermediate sanctions rules. Under the Code, \n     certain organizations described in Code sections 501(c)(4), \n     (5) or (6) are treated as supported organizations, although \n     they are not public charities or safety organizations. The \n     provision provides that the excess benefit transaction rules \n     of the Act generally do not apply to transactions between a \n     supporting organization and its supported organization that \n     is described in section 501(c)(4), (5), or (6).\n     Amendments Related to the Tax Increase Prevention and \n         Reconciliation Act of 2005\n       Look-through treatment and regulatory authority (Act sec. \n     103(b)).--Under the Act, for taxable years beginning after \n     2005 and before 2009, dividends, interest (including \n     factoring income which is treated as equivalent to interest \n     under sec. 954(c)(1)(E)), rents, and royalties received by \n     one controlled foreign corporation (``CFC'') from a related \n     CFC are not treated as foreign personal holding company \n     income to the extent attributable or properly allocable to \n     non-subpart F income of the payor (the ``TIPRA look-through \n     rule'').\n       The provision clarifies the treatment of deficits in \n     earnings and profits. Under the provision, the TIPRA look-\n     through rule does not apply to any interest, rent, or royalty \n     to the extent that such interest, rent, or royalty creates \n     (or increases) a deficit which under section 952(c) may \n     reduce the subpart F income of the payor or another CFC. The \n     provision parallels the rule applicable to interest, rents, \n     or royalties that would otherwise qualify for exclusion from \n     foreign personal holding company income under the ``same \n     country'' exception (sec. 954(c)(3)(B)). Thus interest, \n     rents, and royalties will be treated as subpart F income, \n     notwithstanding the general TIPRA look-through rule, if the \n     payment creates or increases a deficit of the payor \n     corporation and that deficit is from an activity that could \n     reduce the payor's subpart F income under the accumulated \n     deficit rule (sec. 952(c)(1)(B)), or could reduce the \n     income of a qualified chain member under the chain deficit \n     rule (sec. 952(c)(1)(C)). For example, under the \n     provision, items that do not qualify for the ``same \n     country'' exception because they meet the terms of section \n     954(c)(3)(B) will also not qualify under the TIPRA look-\n     through rule.\n       Modification of active business definition under section \n     355 (Act sec. 202).--The provision revises Code sections \n     355(b)(2)(A) and 355(b)(3) to reflect that the provision \n     modifying the active business definition that was enacted by \n     section 202 of the Act was made permanent by section 410 of \n     the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. Conforming \n     amendments are made as a result of this change.\n       The provision clarifies that if a corporation became a \n     member of a separate affiliated group as a result of one or \n     more transactions in which gain or loss was recognized in \n     whole or in part, any trade or business conducted by such \n     corporation (at the time that such corporation became such a \n     member) is treated for purposes of section 355(b)(2) as \n     acquired in a transaction in which gain or loss was \n     recognized in whole or in part. Accordingly, such an \n     acquisition is subject to the provisions of section \n     355(b)(2)(C), and may qualify as an expansion of an existing \n     active trade or business conducted by the distributing \n     corporation or the controlled corporation, as the case may \n     be.\n       The provision clarifies that the Treasury Department shall \n     prescribe regulations that provide for the proper application \n     of sections 355(b)(2)(B), (C), and (D) in the case of any \n     corporation that is tested for active business under the \n     separate affiliated group rule, and that modify the \n     application of section 355(a)(3)(B) in the case of such a \n     corporation in a manner consistent with the purposes of the \n     provision.\n       The provision further clarifies that the rule regarding the \n     application of the new rules to determine the continued \n     qualification under section 355 of a distribution that \n     occurred before the effective date of the new rules, shall \n     apply only if such application results in continued \n     qualification and is not intended to require application of \n     the new rules in a manner that would disqualify any \n     distribution that satisfied the active business requirements \n     of section 355 under prior law that was applicable to the \n     distribution.\n\n[[Page S16058]]\n\n       Computation of tax for individuals with income excluded \n     under the foreign earned income exclusion (Act sec. 515).--\n     The provision clarifies that in computing the tentative \n     minimum tax on nonexcluded income, the computation of tax is \n     made before reduction for the alternative minimum tax foreign \n     tax credit. This conforms the computation of the tentative \n     minimum tax to the computation of the regular tax, so that \n     both computations are made before the application of the \n     foreign tax credit.\n       The provision also corrects an error in present law in the \n     case where a taxpayer has net capital gain in excess of \n     taxable income. Under the provision, if a taxpayer's net \n     capital gain (within the meaning of section 1(h)) exceeds \n     taxable income, in computing the tax on the taxable income as \n     increased by the excluded income, the amount of net capital \n     gain which otherwise be taken into account is reduced by the \n     amount of that excess. The excess first reduces the amount of \n     net capital gain without regard to qualified dividend income, \n     and then qualified dividend income. Also, in computing \n     adjusted net capital gain, unrecaptured section 1250 gain, \n     and 28-percent rate gain, the amount of the excess is \n     treated in the same manner as an increase in the long-term \n     capital loss carried to the taxable year.\n       Similar rules apply in computing the tentative minimum tax \n     where a taxpayer's net capital gain exceeds the taxable \n     excess.\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2006.\n       The following examples illustrate the provision:\n       Example 1.--For taxable year 2007, an unmarried individual \n     has $80,000 excluded from gross income under section 911(a), \n     $30,000 gain from the sale of a capital asset held more than \n     one year, and $20,000 deductions. The taxpayer's taxable \n     income is $10,000. Under the provision, the regular tax is \n     the excess of (i) the amount of tax computed under section \n     911(f)(1)(A)(i) on taxable income of $90,000 ($10,000 taxable \n     income plus $80,000 excluded income), over (ii) the amount of \n     tax computed under section 911(f)(1)(A)(ii) on taxable income \n     of $80,000 (excluded income). In applying section 1(h) to \n     determine the tax under section 911(f)(1)(A)(i), the net \n     capital gain and the adjusted net capital gain are each \n     $10,000. The regular tax is $1,500, which is equal to a tax \n     at the rate of 15 percent on $10,000 of adjusted net capital \n     gain.\n       Example 2.--For taxable year 2007, an unmarried individual \n     has $90,000 excluded from gross income under section 911(a), \n     $5,000 gain from the sale of a capital asset held more than \n     one year, $25,000 unrecaptured section 1250 gain, and $20,000 \n     deductions. The taxpayer's taxable income is $10,000. Under \n     the provision, the regular tax is the excess of (i) the \n     amount of tax computed under section 911(f)(1)(A)(i) on \n     taxable income of $100,000 ($10,000 taxable income plus \n     $90,000 excluded income), over (ii) the amount of tax \n     computed under section 911(f)(1)(A)(ii) on taxable income of \n     $90,000 (excluded income). In applying section 1(h) to \n     determine the tax under section 911(f)(1)(A)(i), the net \n     capital gain is $10,000. $5,000 is unrecaptured section 1250 \n     gain ($25,000 less $20,000) and $5,000 is adjusted net \n     capital gain. The regular tax is $2,000, which is equal to a \n     tax at the rate of 15 percent on $5,000 of adjusted net \n     capital gain and a tax at the rate of 25 percent on $5,000 of \n     unrecaptured section 1250 gain.\n     Amendments Related to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, \n         Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users\n       Timing of claims for excess alternative fuel (not in a \n     mixture) credit (Act sec. 11113).--Present law provides that \n     the alternative fuel (not in a mixture) credit is refundable. \n     Code section 6427(i)(3) permits claims to be filed on a \n     weekly basis with respect to alcohol, biodiesel, and \n     alternative fuel mixtures if certain requirements are met. \n     This rule, however, does not refer to the alternative fuel \n     credit (for alternative fuel not in a mixture). The provision \n     clarifies that the same rules for filing claims with respect \n     to fuel mixtures apply to the alternative fuel credit.\n       Definition of alternative fuel (Act sec. 11113).--Code \n     section 6426(d)(2) defines alternative fuel to include \n     ``liquid hydrocarbons from biomass'' for purposes of the \n     alternative fuel excise tax credit and payment provisions \n     under sections 6426 and 6427. The statute does not define \n     liquid hydrocarbons, which has led to questions as to \n     whether it is permissible for such a fuel to contain other \n     elements, such as oxygen, or whether the fuel must consist \n     exclusively of hydrogen and carbon. It was intended that \n     biomass fuels such as fish oil, which is not exclusively \n     made of hydrogen and carbon, qualify for the credit. The \n     provision changes the reference in section 6426 from \n     ``liquid hydrocarbons'' to ``liquid fuel'' for purposes of \n     the alternative fuel excise tax credit and payment \n     provisions.\n     Amendments Related to the Energy Policy Act of 2005\n       Credit for production from advanced nuclear power \n     facilities (Act sec. 1306).--The provision clarifies that the \n     national capacity limitation of 6,000 megawatts represents \n     the total number of megawatts that the Secretary has \n     authority to allocate under section 45J.\n       Clarify limitation on the credit of installing alternative \n     fuel refueling property (Act sec. 1342).--The present-law \n     credit for qualified alternative fuel vehicle refueling \n     property for a taxable year is limited to $30,000 per \n     property subject to depreciation, and $1,000 for other \n     property (sec. 30C(b)). The provision clarifies that the \n     $30,000 and $1,000 limitations apply to all alternative fuel \n     vehicle refueling property placed in service by the taxpayer \n     at a location. The provision is consistent with similar \n     deduction limitations imposed under section 179A(b)(2)(A) \n     (relating to the deduction for clean-fuel vehicles and \n     certain refueling property).\n       In addition, Code section 30C(c)(1) provides that qualified \n     alternative fuel vehicle refueling property has the meaning \n     given to the term by section 179A(d). However, section \n     179A(d) defines a different term. The provision modifies the \n     language of section 30C(c)(1) to refer to the correct term.\n       Clarify that research eligible for the energy research \n     credit is qualified research (Act sec. 1351).--The energy \n     research credit is available with respect to certain amounts \n     paid or incurred to an energy research consortium. The \n     provision clarifies that the credit is available with respect \n     to such amounts paid or incurred to an energy research \n     consortium provided they are used for energy research that is \n     qualified research.\n       Double taxation of rail and inland waterway fuel resulting \n     from the use of dyed fuel on which the Leaking Underground \n     Storage Tank Trust Fund tax has already been imposed; off-\n     highway business use (Act sec. 1362).--Section 4081(a)(2)(B) \n     of the Code imposes tax at the Leaking Underground Storage \n     Tank Trust Fund financing tax rate of 0.1 cent per gallon on \n     diesel fuel at the time it is removed from a terminal. \n     Section 4082(a) provides that none of the generally \n     applicable exemptions other than the exemption for export \n     apply to this removal even if the fuel is dyed. When dyed \n     fuel is used or sold for use in a diesel powered highway \n     vehicle or train (sec. 4041), or such fuel is subject to the \n     inland waterway tax (sec. 4042), the Code inadvertently \n     imposes the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund tax a \n     second time. Section 6430 prohibits the refund of taxes \n     imposed at the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund \n     financing rate, except in the case of fuel destined for \n     export. The provision eliminates the imposition of the 0.1 \n     cent tax a second time if the Leaking Underground Storage \n     Tank Trust Fund financing tax rate previously was imposed \n     under section 4081. The provision permits a refund in the \n     amount of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund \n     financing rate if such tax was imposed a second time under \n     4041 or 4042 from October 1, 2005 through the date of \n     enactment. The provision also clarifies that off-highway \n     business use is not exempt from the Leaking Underground \n     Storage Tank Trust Fund Financing rate. For administrative \n     reasons associated with collecting the tax, the off-\n     highway business use clarification is effective for fuel \n     sold for use or used after the date of enactment.\n       Exemption from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust \n     Fund financing rate for aircraft and vessels engaged in \n     foreign trade (Act sec. 1362).--Fuel supplied in the United \n     States for use in aircraft engaged in foreign trade is exempt \n     from U.S. customs duties and internal revenue taxes, so long \n     as, where the aircraft is registered in a foreign State, the \n     State of registry provides substantially reciprocal \n     privileges for U.S.-registered aircraft. However, the Energy \n     Policy Act of 2005 imposed, without exemption, the Leaking \n     Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate on all \n     taxable fuels, except in the case of export. As a result, \n     aviation fuel is no longer exempt from the Leaking \n     Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund financing rate. According \n     to the State Department, almost all of the United States' \n     bilateral air services agreements contain provisions \n     exempting from taxation all fuel supplied in the territory of \n     one party for use in the aircraft of the other party. The \n     United States has interpreted these provisions to prohibit \n     the taxation, in any form, of aviation fuel supplied in the \n     United States to the aircraft of airlines of the foreign \n     countries that are parties to these air services agreements. \n     The amendment provides that fuel for use in vessels \n     (including civil aircraft) employed in foreign trade or trade \n     between the United States and any of its possessions is \n     exempt from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund \n     financing rate.\n     Amendments Related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004\n       Interaction of rules relating to credit for low sulfur \n     diesel fuel (Act sec. 339).--Section 45H of the Code allows a \n     credit at the rate of 5 cents per gallon for low sulfur \n     diesel fuel produced at certain small business refineries. \n     The aggregate credit with respect to any refinery is limited \n     to 25 percent of the costs of the type deductible under \n     section 179B of the Code. Section 179B allows a deduction for \n     75 percent of certain costs paid or incurred with respect to \n     these refineries. The basis of the property is reduced by the \n     amount of any credit determined with respect to any \n     expenditure (sec. 45H(d)). Further, no deduction is allowed \n     for the expenses otherwise allowable as a deduction in an \n     amount equal to the amount of the credit under section 45H \n     (sec. 280C(d)). The interaction of these provisions is \n     unclear, and the basis reduction and deduction denial rules \n     may have an unintentionally duplicative effect. Under the \n     provision, deductions are denied in an amount equal to the \n     amount of the credit under section 45H, and the provisions of \n     present law reducing basis and denying a deduction are \n     repealed.\n\n[[Page S16059]]\n\n       Eliminate the open-loop biomass segregation requirement in \n     section 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) (Act sec. 710).--For purposes of the \n     credit for electricity produced from certain renewable \n     resources, section 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) defines open-loop biomass \n     to include any solid, nonhazardous, cellulosic waste material \n     or any lignin material that is segregated from other waste \n     materials, and that meets other requirements. The Act added \n     municipal solid waste to the category of qualified energy \n     resources giving rise to the credit. Thus, both open-loop \n     biomass and municipal solid waste can be treated as qualified \n     energy resources. The provision therefore strikes the \n     requirement that open-loop biomass be segregated from other \n     waste materials in order to be treated as qualified energy \n     resources.\n       Clarification of proportionate limitation applicable to \n     closed-loop biomass (Act sec. 710).--Section 45(d)(2)(B)(ii) \n     provides that when closed-loop biomass is co-fired with other \n     fuels, the credit is limited to the otherwise allowable \n     credit multiplied by the ratio of the thermal content of the \n     closed-loop biomass to the thermal content of all fuel used. \n     This limitation duplicates a similar limitation in section \n     45(a), which provides that the credit is equal to 1.5 cents \n     multiplied by the kilowatt hours of electricity produced by \n     the taxpayer from qualified energy resources (and meeting \n     other criteria). The present-law section 45(a) rule has the \n     effect of limiting the credit (or duration of the credit) to \n     the appropriate portion of the fuel that constitutes \n     qualified energy resources, in the situations in which \n     qualified energy resources are permitted to be co-fired with \n     each other, or are permitted to be co-fired with other fuels. \n     The provision clarifies that the limitation applies only \n     once, not twice, to closed-loop biomass co-fired with other \n     fuels, by striking the duplicate limitation in section \n     45(d)(2)(B)(ii).\n       Treatment of partnerships under the limitation on \n     deductions allocable to property used by governments or other \n     tax-exempt entities (Act sec. 848).--Code section 470 \n     generally applies loss deferral rules in the case of property \n     leased to tax-exempt entities. This rule applies with respect \n     to tax-exempt use property, which for this purpose generally \n     has the meaning given to the term by section 168(h) (with \n     exceptions specified in section 470(c)(2)). The manner of \n     application of section 470 in the case of property owned by a \n     partnership in which a tax-exempt entity is a partner is \n     unclear.\n       The provision provides that tax-exempt use property does \n     not include any property that would be tax-exempt use \n     property solely by reason of section 168(h)(6). The provision \n     refers to section 7701(e) for circumstances in which a \n     partnership is treated as a lease to which section 168(h) \n     applies. Thus, if a partnership is recharacterized as a lease \n     pursuant to section 7701(e), and a provision of section \n     168(h) (other than section 168(h)(6)) applies to cause the \n     property characterized as leased to be treated as tax-exempt \n     use property, then the loss deferral rules of section 470 \n     apply.\n       Under section 7701(e)(2), a partnership may be treated as a \n     lease, taking into account all relevant factors, including \n     factors similar to those set forth in section 7701(e)(1) \n     (relating to service contracts treated as leases). In the \n     case of property of a partnership in which a tax-exempt \n     entity is a partner, factors similar to those in section \n     7701(e)(1) (and in the legislative history of that section) \n     that are relevant in determining whether a partnership is \n     properly treated as a lease of property held by the \n     partnership include (1) a tax-exempt partner maintains \n     physical possession or control or holds the benefits and \n     burdens of ownership with respect to such property, (2) there \n     is insignificant equity investment by any taxable partner, \n     (3) the transfer of such property to the partnership does not \n     result in a change in use of such property, (4) such property \n     is necessary for the provision of government services, (5) a \n     disproportionately large portion of the deductions for \n     depreciation with respect to such property are allocated to \n     one or more taxable partners relative to such partner's risk \n     of loss with respect to such property or to such partner's \n     allocation of other partnership items, and (6) amounts \n     payable on behalf of the tax-exempt partner relating to the \n     property are defeased or funded by set-asides or expected \n     set-asides. It is intended that Treasury regulations or \n     guidance may provide additional factors that can be taken \n     into account in determining whether a partnership with \n     taxable and tax-exempt partners is an arrangement that \n     resembles a lease of property under which section 470 defers \n     the allowance of losses.\n       The provision is effective as if included in the provision \n     of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 to which it \n     relates. It is not intended that the provision supercede the \n     rules set forth by the Treasury Department in Notice 2005-29, \n     2005-13 I.R.B. 796, Notice 2006-2, 2006-2 I.R.B. 1, and \n     Notice 2007-4, 2007-1 I.R.B. 260, with respect to the \n     application of section 470 in the case of partnerships for \n     taxable years of partnerships beginning in 2004, 2005, and \n     2006. These notices state that the Internal Revenue Service \n     will not apply section 470 to disallow losses associated with \n     property that is treated as tax-exempt use property solely as \n     a result of the application of section 168(h)(6), and that \n     abusive transactions involving partnerships an other pass-\n     through entities remain subject to challenge by the Internal \n     Revenue Service under other provisions of the tax law. \n     Accordingly, for partnership taxable years beginning in 2004, \n     2005, and 2006, the Internal Revenue Service may apply \n     section 470 to a partnership that would be treated as a lease \n     under section 7701(e)(2).\n       Treatment of losses on positions in identified straddles \n     (Act sec. 888).--Under Code section 1092, the term \n     ``straddle'' means offsetting positions in actively traded \n     personal property. Generally, a loss on a position in a \n     straddle may be recognized only to the extent the amount of \n     the loss exceeds the unrecognized gain (if any) in offsetting \n     positions in the straddle (sec. 1092(a)(1)(A)). Special rules \n     for identified straddles provide a different treatment of \n     losses and also provide that any position that is not part of \n     an identified straddle is not treated as offsetting with \n     respect to any position that is part of the identified \n     straddle. A taxpayer is permitted to treat a straddle as an \n     identified straddle only if, among other requirements, the \n     straddle is not part of a larger straddle.\n       Before the enactment of the Act, the rules for treating a \n     straddle as an identified straddle required that all the \n     positions of the straddle were acquired on the same day and \n     either that all of the positions were disposed of on the same \n     day in a taxable year or that none of the positions were \n     disposed of as of the close of the taxable year. A loss on a \n     position in an identified straddle was not subject to the \n     loss deferral rule described above but instead was taken into \n     account when all the positions making up the straddle were \n     disposed of.\n       The Act changed the rules for identified straddles by \n     providing, among other things, that if there is a loss on a \n     position in an identified straddle, the loss is applied to \n     increase the basis of the offsetting positions in that \n     identified straddle. Under section 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii), the \n     basis of each offsetting position in an identified straddle \n     is increased by an amount that equals the product of the \n     amount of the loss multiplied by the ratio of the amount of \n     unrecognized straddle period gain in that offsetting position \n     to the aggregate amount of unrecognized straddle period gain \n     in all offsetting positions. The Act also provided that any \n     loss described in section 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii) is not otherwise \n     taken into account for Federal tax purposes.\n       The Act left unclear the treatment of a loss on a position \n     in an identified straddle in at least two circumstances: \n     first, when there are no offsetting positions in the \n     identified straddle with unrecognized straddle period gain, \n     and, second, when an offsetting position in the identified \n     straddle is or has been a liability to the taxpayer.\n       The provision addresses the treatment of losses in these \n     two circumstances. In general, the provision reaffirms that a \n     loss on a position in an identified straddle is not permitted \n     to be recognized currently and also is not permanently \n     disallowed.\n       The provision provides that if the application of section \n     1092(a)(2)(A)(ii) does not result in a basis increase in any \n     offsetting position in the identified straddle (because there \n     is no unrecognized straddle period gain in any offsetting \n     position), the basis of each offsetting position in the \n     identified straddle must be increased in a manner that (1) is \n     reasonable, is consistent with the purposes of the identified \n     straddle rules, and is consistently applied by the taxpayer, \n     and (2) allocates to offsetting positions the full amount of \n     the loss (but no more than the full amount of the loss). At \n     the time a taxpayer adopts an allocation method under this \n     rule, the taxpayer is expected to describe that method in its \n     books and records.\n       Under the provision, unless the Secretary of the Treasury \n     provides otherwise, similar rules apply for purposes of the \n     identified straddle rules when there is a loss on a position \n     in an identified straddle and an offsetting position in the \n     identified straddle is or has been a liability or an \n     obligation (including, for instance, a debt obligation issued \n     by the taxpayer, a written option, or a notional principal \n     contract entered into by the taxpayer). Under this rule, if a \n     taxpayer, for example, receives $1 to enter into a five-year \n     short forward contract and the next day $100 of loss is \n     allocated to that position, the resulting basis of the \n     contract is $99.\n       Under present law, a straddle is treated as an identified \n     straddle only if, among other requirements, it is clearly \n     identified on the taxpayer's records as an identified \n     straddle before the earlier of (1) the close of the day on \n     which the straddle is acquired, or (2) a time that the \n     Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulations. The \n     provision clarifies that for purposes of this identification \n     requirement, a straddle is clearly identified only if the \n     identification includes an identification of the positions in \n     the straddle that are offsetting with respect to other \n     positions in the straddle. Consequently, taxpayers are \n     required to identify not only the positions that make up an \n     identified straddle but also which positions in that \n     identified straddle are offsetting with respect to one \n     another. The offsetting positions identification requirement \n     added by the provision is effective for straddles acquired \n     after the date of enactment.\n       The provision provides that regulations or other guidance \n     prescribed by the Secretary for carrying out the purposes of \n     the identified straddle rules may include the rules for the \n     application of section 1092 to a position that is or has been \n     a liability or an obligation. Regulations or other guidance \n     also may include safe harbor basis allocation methods that \n     satisfy the requirements that an allocation other than under \n     section 1092(a)(2)(A)(ii) must be reasonable, consistent with \n     the purposes of the identified straddle rules, and \n     consistently applied by the taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S16060]]\n\n     Amendments Related to the Economic Growth Tax Relief \n         Reconciliation Act of 2001\n       Application of special elective deferral limit to \n     designated Roth contributions (Act sec. 617).--Code section \n     402(g)(7) provides a special rule allowing certain employees \n     to make additional elective deferrals to a tax-sheltered \n     annuity, subject to (1) an annual limit of $3,000, and (2) a \n     cumulative limit of $15,000 minus the amount of additional \n     elective deferrals made in previous years under the special \n     rule. Present law provides a rule to coordinate the \n     cumulative limit with the ability to make designated Roth \n     contributions, but inadvertently reduces the $15,000 amount \n     by all designated Roth contributions made in previous years. \n     The provision clarifies that the $15,000 amount is reduced \n     only by additional designated Roth contributions made under \n     the special rule.\n       Application of FICA taxes to designated Roth contributions \n     (Act sec. 617).--Under Code section 3121(v)(1)(A), elective \n     deferrals are included in wages for purposes of social \n     security and Medicare taxes.

The provision clarifies that facilities placed in \n     service prior to June 30, 1999, that sell electricity under \n     applicable pre-1987 contracts are not denied the section 45 \n     production tax credit solely by reason of a change in \n     ownership after June 30, 1999.\n       Treatment of income and services provided by taxable REIT \n     subsidiaries (Act sec. 542).--The provision clarifies that \n     the transient basis language in the definition of a lodging \n     facility applies only in determining whether an establishment \n     other than a hotel or motel qualifies as a lodging facility.\n     Amendment Related to the Internal Revenue Service \n         Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998\n       Redactions for background documents related to Chief \n     Counsel Advice documents (Act sec. 3509).--The Internal \n     Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 \n     established a structured process by which the IRS makes \n     certain work products, designated Chief Counsel advice \n     (``CCA''), open to public inspection. To afford additional \n     protection for certain governmental interests implicated by \n     CCAs, section 6110(i)(3) governs redactions that may be made \n     to CCAs, including the exemptions or exclusions available \n     under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c) \n     (except that the provision for redaction under a Federal \n     statute excludes Title 26), as well as the exemptions \n     pertaining to taxpayer identity information described in \n     section 6110(c)(1). Section 6110(i)(3) does not expressly \n     address redactions to the ``background file documents'' \n     related to a CCA.

Mr. President, as the first session of the 110th Congress \nconcludes, we should note that the Senate has worked hard on executive \nnominations. In addition to confirming 40 lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench, we confirmed 21 of this President's nominations for \nhigh-ranking executive branch positions, including the confirmations of \nnine U.S. attorneys, four U.S. marshals, and eight other important \npositions. We achieved these numbers in a year when our investigation \ninto the mass firing of U.S. attorneys, which triggered a host of \nresignations by senior White House and Justice Department officials, \nled the Judiciary Committee to devote significant time to rebuilding \nthe integrity and independence of the Justice Department.\n  We held hearings on nine executive nominations, including 2-day \nhearing on the nomination of Michael B. Mukasey to be Attorney General \nof the United States and another hearing on the nomination of Judge \nMark Filip to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States, the top \ntwo positions at the Justice Department. We also held hearings on the \nnominations of Michael J. Sullivan to be Director of the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; Ronald Jay Tenpas to be \nAssistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources Division, \nDepartment of Justice; Ondray T. Harris to be Director, Community \nRelations Service, Department of Justice; David W. Hagy, to be Director \nof the National Institute of Justice, Department of Justice; Scott M. \nBurns, to be Deputy Director of National Drug Control Policy, Executive \nOffice of the President; Cynthia Dyer, to be Director of the Violence \nAgainst Women Office, Department of Justice; and Nathan J. Hochman, to \nbe an Assistant Attorney General, Tax Division, Department of Justice.\n  We favorably reported 20 executive nominations, and the full Senate \nhas proceeded to confirm 21 executive nominations, including 4 \nadditional nominations discharged from the Judiciary Committee and \nconfirmed today, those of Joseph P. Russoniello to be U.S. attorney for \nthe Northern District of California, Cynthia Dyer to be Director of the \nViolence Against Women Office, Julie L. Myers to be Assistant Secretary \nof Homeland Security, and Nathan J. Hochman, to be Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of the Tax Division at the Justice Department.\n  I understand that Republican holds have prevented the confirmation of \nMichael J. Sullivan to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms, and Explosives.\n  I thank the members of the Judiciary Committee for their hard work \nall year in considering these important nominations. I especially thank \nthose Senators who have given generously of their time to chair \nconfirmation hearings throughout the year.\n  These nominations come at a critical time for the Nation. Over the \ncourse of this year, during which the Judiciary Committee investigated \nthe firing of U.S. attorneys, we faced the most serious threat to the \neffectiveness and professionalism of the Justice Department since \nWatergate and the Saturday Night Massacre. Under this President, the \nJustice Department suffered a severe crisis of leadership that allowed \nour justice system to be corrupted by political int1uence. The crisis \nof leadership that led to numerous resignations and has taken a heavy \ntoll on the tradition of independence that has long guided the \nDepartment and protected it from political influence. This crisis has \nalso taken a heavy toll on morale at the Department and in confidence \namong the American people.\n\n  Our work to restore the Justice Department also including reporting \nnine U.S. attorney nominations: James Russell Dedrick to be U.S. \nattorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee, Thomas P. O'Brien to be \nU.S. attorney for the Central District of California, Edward Meacham \nYarbrough to be U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, \nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez to be U.S. attorney for the District of \nPuerto Rico, Joe W. Stecher to be U.S. attorney for the District of \nNebraska, John Wood to be U.S. attorney for the Western District of \nMissouri, Diane J. Humetewa to be U.S. attorney for the District of \nArizona, Gregory A. Brower to be U.S. attorney for the District of \nNevada, and Edmund A. Booth, Jr. to be U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of Georgia. Some replace outstanding U.S. attorneys who were \nfired almost a year ago as part of the ill-advised, partisan plan to \nfire well-performing U.S. attorneys.\n  We also reported the nominations of four U.S. marshals: Michael David \nCredo for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Esteban Soto III for the \nDistrict of Puerto Rico, John Roberts Hackman for the Eastern District \nof Virginia, and Robert Gideon Howard, Jr., for the Eastern District of \nArkansas.\n  We also reported the nominations of Julie L. Myers to be Assistant \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Dabney Langhorne Friedrich to be a \nmember of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and Beryl A. Howell to be a \nmember of the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\n  Just this week, with only a few legislative days left to us before \nthe Christmas holidays and the end of this session, our committee held \ntwo hearings for executive nominations.\n  Our track record shows that the Judiciary Committee has been working \nhard to make progress. Of course, when the White House fails to timely \nsend us nominations to fill vacancies, it makes it that much harder.\n  The White House has made an abysmal effort to send nominees to the \nSenate to replace the fired U.S. attorneys and to fill vacancies in \nthose districts and many others. There are now 19 districts with acting \nor interim U.S. attorneys instead of Senate-confirmed\n\n[[Page S16068]]\n\nU.S. attorneys. That is nearly a quarter of all districts. Yet the \nWhite House has nominated only 3 people for these 19 spots. Of course, \nsome of these could have been filled a year ago had the White House \nworked with the Senate.\n  I have urged the President to fill the remaining executive vacancies \nwith nominees who will restore the independence of Federal law \nenforcement. Last month, the White House announced with great fanfare \nits intent to make nominations for key positions at the Department of \nJustice. It was only weeks later that several of these nominations were \nsent to the Senate. The delays in sending U.S. attorney nominees and \nothers to the Senate follow the many months of delay where the White \nHouse failed to send nominees to fill vacancies that have been open \nsince the summer, or before.\n\n  In the course of the committee's investigation into the unprecedented \nmass firing of U.S. attorneys by the President who appointed them, we \nuncovered an effort by officials at the White House and the Justice \nDepartment to exploit an obscure provision enacted during the PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization to do an end-run around the Senate's constitutional \nto confirm U.S. attorneys. The result was the firing of well-performing \nU.S. attorneys for not bending to the political will of political \noperatives at the White House.\n  I have repeatedly emphasized that when it comes to the Justice \nDepartment and to the U.S. attorneys in our home States, Senators have \na say and a stake in ensuring fairness and independence in order to \ninsulate Federal law enforcement function from untoward political \ninfluence. That is why the law and the practice has always been that \nthese appointments require Senate confirmation. The advice and consent \ncheck on the appointment power for U.S attorneys is a critical function \nof the Senate.\n  I had hoped when the Senate voted overwhelmingly to close the \nloophole created by the PATRIOT Act when we passed S.214, the \nPreserving United States Attorneys Independence Act of 2007, by a vote \nof 97 to 0, it would send a clear message to the administration to make \nnominations that could receive Senate support and begin to restore an \nimportant check on the partisan influence in law enforcement. Yet, even \nas we closed one loophole, the administration has been exploiting \nothers to continue to avoid coming to the Senate. Under the guidance of \nan erroneous opinion of the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel, the administration has been, employing the Vacancies Act \nauthority to use acting U.S. attorneys and the power to appoint interim \nU.S. attorneys sequentially. They have used this misguided approach to \nput somebody in place for 330 days without the advice and consent of \nthe Senate. This approach runs afoul of congressional intent and the \nlaw.\n  By not providing us with the nominations to the highest ranking \nvacancies within the Justice Department and not providing the basic \nbackground materials needed to review such nominations before the \nThanksgiving recess, the administration has once again foreclosed the \nopportunity to have these nominees considered by the Senate and in \nplace this year. Those nominations will now necessarily carryover into \nthe next session. That is unfortunate and was unnecessary.\n  We will continue to make progress when we can, and I will urge the \nWhite House to work with the Senate to fill these vacancies.\n\n\n             Nomination of Jon Wellinghoff and Joe Kelliher\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will support the Senate moving forward \non the confirmation of Jon Wellinghoff and Joe Kelliher to be members \nof the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. While I am pleased that \nFERC has been using its expanded authority granted by Congress in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 to pursue manipulation in the electricity and \nnatural gas markets, I think it is critically important to remind FERC \nof its statutory duty to oversee the energy markets and protect \nconsumers.\n  In light of evidence of market manipulation in the Western \nelectricity crisis in 2001, I fought hard to ban market manipulation in \nelectricity and natural gas markets. My amendment, adopted by Congress \nas part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, provided FERC new authority \nunder the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act to investigate and \npunish market manipulation in electricity and natural gas markets.\n  I am pleased to see that FERC has used this expanded authority to \nconduct 64 investigations. According to FERC, 13 of these \ninvestigations have resulted in settlements involving the payment of \ncivil penalties or other monetary remedies totaling over $40 million. \nTwo investigations have resulted in FERC bringing enforcement actions \nfor alleged market manipulation against Amaranth Advisors LLC for $291 \nmillion in civil penalties and Energy Trading Partners for $167 million \nin civil penalties. Amaranth's shenanigans cost consumers upwards of $9 \nbillion dollars during the summer of 2006.\n  However, I want to remind FERC of its responsibilities relating to \nprotecting consumers under the Federal Power Act's statutory ``just and \nreasonable'' standard. In section 1290 of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005, which I authored, Congress directed FERC to exercise its Federal \nPower Act authority to enforce ``just and reasonable'' rates when it \nreviewed the validity of termination payment claims made by Enron \nduring the Western energy crisis of 2000-2001.\n  After entering into power contracts in a market that Enron \nmanipulated, several utilities, including the Snohomish Public Utility \nDistrict in my State, the Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power \nCompany in Nevada, terminated their contracts with Enron or watched as \nEnron terminated them when the company's web of fraudulent accounting \nwas revealed in late 2001. As a result, Enron tried to squeeze hundreds \nof millions of dollars of termination fee payments from the electricity \nconsumers of these utilities. In my opinion, these payments demanded by \nEnron were certainly neither just nor reasonable.\n  After enactment of the Cantwell amendment, the Snohomish Public \nUtility District in my State and several other entities including the \nNevada Power Company, asked FERC to exercise its Federal Power Act \nauthority, which includes enforcing ``just and reasonable'' rates, and \ndeny Enron the ability to charge the fraudulent termination payments.\n  Using the force of the Cantwell amendment, these Washington State and \nNevada utilities were able to avoid protracted litigation and settle \nEnron's absurd termination fee claims, saving these utilities from \npaying hundreds of millions in unjust payments on contracts that Enron \nfraudulently induced. This has helped save electricity consumers of \nWashington and Nevada hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  This spring, the U.S. Supreme Court will review a decision of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which declared that FERC \nfailed to use its authority under the Federal Power Act to enforce \n``just and reasonable'' rates. In a brief to the Supreme Court in this \nmatter, FERC recently took the position that it was free to approve \nlong-term contracts arising out of the 2000-2001 Western power crisis \nnotwithstanding evidence that, in the words of Stanford University \nenergy economist Dr. Frank Wolak, suppliers to the Western markets \nduring this period were ``able to exercise market power at \nunprecedented levels'' resulting in ``prices vastly in excess of \ncompetitive levels.''\n  As the Ninth Circuit's opinion makes clear, if FERC adopts market-\nbased rates, it has an obligation to ensure that the markets operate \nproperly and it cannot simply assume that a contract is just and \nreasonable even if the contract is the product of a manipulated market, \nsuch as the experienced in the West during 2000-2001.\n  It is troublesome that FERC continues to argue that it is free to \nignore evidence of market manipulation and market power abuse when \nreviewing contracts affected by that abuse. Moreover, this position is \ninconsistent with its recent emphasis on enforcement of market \nstandards. FERC's position in the Supreme Court essentially could allow \nmarket abusers to protect their ill-gotten gains by locking them up in \ncontracts, undermining any incentive they might otherwise have to obey \nmarket rules and report abuses by other market participants.\n  While I am pleased that Commissioner Wellinghoff's response to my\n\n[[Page S16069]]\n\nquestions indicates that he does not agree with FERC's brief in this \nmatter, I will continue to watch FERC very closely as this case moves \nforward. FERC is the sole forum to bring complaints of market power \nabuse and manipulation in electricity and natural gas, markets, and I \nfully expect FERC to not abrogate its Federal Power Act \nresponsibilities to protect consumers and enforce ``just and \nreasonable'' rates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/19/senate-section/article/S16069-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
