Mr. President, a remarkable scene is playing out in \nthe country of Burma. For yet another day, tens of thousands of \npeaceful protesters demonstrated throughout Burma against the policies \nof that country's military junta, the State Peace and Development \nCouncil. These protests were carried out in defiance of Government \nthreats. They were led again by barefoot monks, dressed in saffron \nrobes, who just a few days ago in a simple but powerful gesture \nunleashed a dramatic series of events. That gesture was the turning \nupside down of their alms bowls, a symbol of the monks' refusal to \naccept charity from the regime, an act that has the potential to awaken \nthe world to the brutality of this iniquitous regime. Imagine the \ncourage of their actions. Their nonviolent response is subject to \nimprisonment and torture from a regime that has done far more to \ncitizens who have done far less.\n  Earlier today, President Bush spoke at the United Nations General \nAssembly; in fact, he is probably speaking as I speak. He indicated \nadditional U.S. sanctions would be applied to the military junta. He \nalso called for increased international pressure on this regime. The \nPresident should be applauded for his leadership in promoting democracy \nand reconciliation in Burma.\n  The struggle for freedom in Burma is not new, nor are we in Congress \nnew to it. I am hopeful other countries will follow the lead of \nPresident Bush and the Congress on this issue.\n  Two nations are pivotal to this effort: India and China. Both have a \nmajor stake in a prosperous and democratic Burma emerging from this \nunrest. Failure to act in a constructive manner would be a poor \nreflection on India, the world's largest democracy. Failure to act in a \nmeaningful manner would also be a poor reflection on China, as that \nnation begins efforts to showcase itself for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n  The United Nations Secretary General himself needs to directly engage \nthe SPDC on this matter and call for\n\n[[Page S12014]]\n\nreal progress toward the democratization of Burma; the release of all \npolitical prisoners, most especially including Aung San Suu Kyi; and \nthe inclusion of ethnic minorities in a peaceful reconciliation \nprocess.\n  Pressure is mounting on the SPDC, both from within the country and \nfrom without. Yet there is a path forward for the regime, and that is \nthe path of genuine reconciliation. The SPDC needs to follow the \npragmatic model of apartheid South Africa in the early 1990s: Recognize \nthe need to enter into good faith negotiations with the legitimate \nleaders of the people.\n  I wish to convey a few messages to those inside Burma: To the \npeaceful protesters, know that the friends of democracy are with you \nand we are awed by your courage and your determination; to the regime: \nKnow that the eyes of the world are upon you and recall that the \ncrackdown in 1988 was followed by sanctions your Government still \nlabors under. Know too that as the Government of Burma, you are \nresponsible for the safety and well-being of the demonstrators and also \nof Aung San Suu Kyi. Know that the path forward is through genuine \nreconciliation, not repression.\n  In closing, I note that the SPDC is much like any other despotic \nregime that holds onto power through terror, through force, and, \nfrankly, through corruption as well. The SPDC will not give way easily \nto peaceful protests and resistance. We must let those in Burma who \nseek peaceful change know they do not stand alone.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12014-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize our Nation's \nfirst responders. I, along with Senators McCain and Casey, introduced \nS. Res. 215 recognizing today, September 25, 2007, as National First \nResponders Appreciation Day. The Senate acted quickly and passed this \nresolution by unanimous consent with a total of 33 cosponsors.\n  The contributions that our Nation's 1.1 million firefighters, 670,000 \npolice officers, and over 890,000 emergency medical professionals make \nin our communities are familiar to all of us. We see the results of \ntheir efforts every night on our TV screens and read about them every \nday in the paper.\n  From recent tornadoes in the Southeast and wildfires in the West in \n2007, and the Christmas blizzard in Colorado in 2006, to the tragic \nevents of Virginia Tech, Columbine High School, Platte Canyon High \nSchool, and the wrath of Hurricane Katrina, our first responders \nregularly risk their lives to protect property, uphold the law, and \nsave the lives of others.\n  Nationwide, many of our first responders take the call on a daily \nbasis and are exposed to life-threatening situations. While performing \ntheir jobs, many first responders have made the ultimate sacrifice. \nAccording to Craig Floyd, Chairman of the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial Fund, a total of 1,649 law enforcement officers died \nin the line of duty during the past 10 years; an average of 1 death \nevery 53 hours, or 165 per year, and 145 law enforcement officers were \nkilled in 2006.\n  In addition, according to the United States Fire Administration, from \n1996 through 2005, over 1,500 firefighters were killed in the line of \nduty, and tens of thousands were injured.\n  It is also important to note that four in five medics are injured on \nthe job. More than one in two, about 50 percent, have been assaulted by \npatients, and one in two, 50 percent, have been exposed to an \ninfectious disease, and emergency medical service personnel in the U.S. \nhave an estimated fatality rate of 12.7 per 100,000 workers, more than \ntwice the national average, and most emergency medical service \npersonnel deaths in the line of duty occur in ambulance accidents.\n  Yet to recognize our first responders only for their sacrifices would \nbe to ignore the everyday contributions they make in communities \nthroughout America. In addition to battling fires, firefighters perform \nimportant fire prevention and public education duties such as teaching \nour children how to be fire safe.\n  Police officers do not simply arrest criminals; they actively prevent \ncrime and make our neighborhoods safer and more livable. And if we or \nour loved ones experience a medical emergency, EMTs are there at a \nmoment's notice to provide lifesaving care.\n  Last Saturday, I hosted a first responder appreciation day in \nnorthern Colorado and was overwhelmed by the support shown to our first \nresponders by the public. Farmers, ranchers, small business owners and \nmembers of the community alike thanked their firefighters, paramedics, \nsheriffs, deputies, and police officers for being there at a moment's \nnotice to lend a hand while putting their own safety at risk.\n  As a practicing veterinarian and a former health officer in Loveland, \nColorado, I can attest to the numerous times I called on first \nresponders to help me get through a situation. In many ways our first \nresponders embody the very best of the American spirit. With charity \nand compassion, those brave men and women regularly put the well-being \nof others before their own, oftentimes at great personal risk. Through \ntheir actions they have become heroes to many. Through their example \nthey are role models to all of us.\n  To all of our first responders, thank you for your service. I ask my \ncolleagues to please join me today in recognizing September 25 as \nNational First Responder Appreciation Day as we honor first responders \nfor their contributions, sacrifices, and dedication to public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12014-4", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12014-S12016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak to two items that are before \nus as we are considering the Defense authorization bill this morning. \nThe first has to do with an amendment that has been offered by Senator \nLieberman and myself and others to declare the Islamic Revolutionary \nGuard Corps a terrorist organization, which would, if we do that, \npermit us to engage in economic sanction activity against the financing \noperations of the IRGC.\n  That is important, because according to all of the evidence we have, \nit is the IRGC that has been primarily responsible for the infusion \ninto Iraq of the very dangerous equipment that has been causing great \nharm to our troops there, especially the new superpenetrator devices \nthat are blowing up not just humvees but also even Abrams tanks.\n  It is the IRGC that is responsible for the training of Iraqis to be \nfighting our troops in Iraq and generally bringing the Iranian \nGovernment's anti-American activities from Iran into Iraq.\n\n  It is because of the IRGC's activities as a terrorist organization \nthat our troops are dying in portions of Iraq today and, therefore, \ntotally fitting for us to express our sense to the administration that \nit should designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization, thus, \npermitting us to invoke these economic sanctions against it.\n  The IRGC, interestingly enough, engages in a great deal of financial \nactivity around the world, which makes these particular sanctions \nespecially appropriate and potentially very effective. I am pleased it \nappears there will be an agreement on some slight modifications of \nlanguage of the amendment which will permit us to, presumably, have a \nnear unanimous vote when this amendment is considered, perhaps later \nthis morning but certainly today.\n  I am looking forward to a colloquy with Senator Levin and Senator\n\n[[Page S12015]]\n\nLieberman so we can discuss our joint understanding of precisely what \nthis joint resolution means and be able to act upon it so we can send a \nvery clear message to the Iranian Government that its involvement \nagainst U.S. troops in Iraq will not be countenanced.\n  That is especially poignant today after the appearance by the Iranian \nPresident at a major U.S. university and his appearance today at the \nUnited Nations, in which it is pretty clear he will say just about \nanything to advance what he believes is the cause animating Iran's \nactivities in the world today, whether it is truthful or not.\n  It seems to me, until there is a firm push back against this man and \nagainst the regime which he runs and the terrorist arm of that regime, \nthe IRGC, they are going to continue to do what they do. And that is \nwhy it is especially poignant today, as I said, that the Senate act on \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution to designate the IRGC as a \nterrorist organization.\n  The other matter I wish to briefly talk about is another amendment \nthat is pending before us offered by the Senator from Delaware. This is \nan amendment that contains several preamble statements about the \nsituation in Iraq, and then calls upon the Iraqi Government to convene \na council which will result in the creation of federal regions within \nIraq.\n  This is something the Iraqi Constitution and a special law that was \npassed permit but does not mandate. It seems to me it would be a very \nbig mistake on the part of the U.S. Government to be seen as demanding \nthat the Iraqi Government take this step, which some would see as a \nbreaking apart of the nation of Iraq, a partitioning of the country of \nIraq into different pieces.\n  The people of Iraq have the authority to do that under this special \nlaw and under their Constitution. They fully have intended to have some \nkind of a conference to consider whether to do it. But I think it would \nbe a big mistake for us to be seen as dictating to the Iraqi people how \nthey want their Government ultimately to be governed, to exist, and to \noperate.\n  The creation of federal regions may be an appropriate way for them to \ndo this; it may not. But that decision should be left to them. I think \nthere has been an assumption that at least one federal region in the \nKurdish north would be recognized, but there are questions about \nwhether other federal regions would be.\n  I recognize there are some in the United States, and even in this \nbody, who believe it would be best for Iraq if it were divided into \nfederal regions. Maybe they are right; maybe they are not right. But it \nis clearly up to the Iraqi people to make this decision.\n  So were we to express ourselves on this, I think it would also be \nimportant for us to confirm our understanding and belief and commitment \nto the sovereignty of the people of Iraq to make this decision, and to \nmake it clear nothing in this particular resolution in any way is \nintended to undercut the sovereignty of the Iraqi people to make this \ndecision for themselves. Otherwise, I fear the resolution could be read \nas the United States dictating to the Iraqis what their country is \ngoing to look like in the future and especially because it relates to \nthe partitioning of the country. It seems to me this would be a very \narrogant step on our part and something that obviously we do not want \nto be seen as doing.\n  I also would make the point that some of the recitations at the \nbeginning of this resolution are misleading, if not outright wrong. It \ntalks about the sectarian violence in the country. There is sectarian \nviolence, but it totally ignores the activities of al-Qaida. Since al-\nQaida has spawned much of the sectarian violence, it seems to me this \nis an incredibly important omission, especially because there are some \nin this body who talk about a change in mission, eventually having our \nmission in Iraq evolve to simply a counterterrorism mission, \nrecognizing that al-Qaida is a significant force in the country, and we \nneed to deal with al-Qaida.\n  We have al-Qaida on the run in the country, but al-Qaida is not gone \nby any means. In addition to that, al-Qaida spawns some of the \nsectarian violence as, for example, it did when it blew up the Golden \nMosque in Samarra, thus inciting Shiites to attack Sunnis and starting \na cycle of violence which continues to this day.\n  To simply refer to sectarian violence without any reference to the \nterrorism that is occurring because of al-Qaida would, I think, be a \nglaring omission and would raise significant questions. Especially if \nthere are those who suggest we should eliminate a message of \ncounterinsurgency, this is also totally contradictory because if you \nrefer to all of the violence in the country as sectarian violence, but \nthere is no counterinsurgency mission for the United States, then \nbasically what you are saying is we simply leave that country to the \ntender mercies of all those groups engaged in this sectarian violence. \nThat, we know, is antithetical to any kind of peaceful resolution to \nthe disagreements that exist in that country and the eventual \nreconciliation of the people of that country.\n  So it seems to me a resolution of this type can do more harm than \ngood in creating confusion about what the understanding of the United \nStates of the situation in the country is, No. 1; No. 2, failing to \nrecognize the prominent role that al-Qaida is playing and the \nimportance of our mission in dealing with al-Qaida; and, third, \nsuggesting it is the position of the United States to dictate to the \nIraqi people that they need to partition their country when, in fact, \nthat is a decision that needs to be left to them, which they could make \nif they wanted to under their Constitution, but certainly are not \nrequired to, and nothing we do should suggest we would require them to \ndo so. We have to recognize the sovereignty of that country.\n\n  The final point I wish to make is simply this: We have been on the \nDefense authorization bill now for 2 weeks--14 days. We were on it for \nmany days a couple months ago, until the bill was pulled. There has \nbeen a lot of criticism, especially by my colleague, the ranking member \non the Armed Services Committee, who has made the point that the time \nis long past that we should have passed this Defense authorization \nbill, which contains so many important elements for our troops--the pay \nraise for the troops, the wounded warrior legislation, and other \nimportant elements that are critical for our Armed Services.\n  For us to continue to simply use this bill as a vehicle to deal with \nendless resolutions dealing with Iraq--I gather there are a couple more \nthat are on the way--is a misuse of the legislative process and of this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  So I hope my colleagues would conclude one of these days that we have \nto pass the Defense authorization bill for the good of the troops and \nstop this endless debate about trying to change our policy or missions \nin Iraq. We have had that debate over and over and over again. We are \ngoing to have it again in the future. But let's not let it dominate \neverything we do in this body. I hope we can get on to the final \npassage on the Defense authorization bill soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 5 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to what \nSenator Kyl has echoed. There are two votes today--I hope sometime \ntoday--and one is about whether we should adopt a resolution \ndesignating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist \norganization. I think that would be a pretty easy vote for most of us, \ngiven the evidence out there about their involvement in international \nterrorism, particularly the Quds Force, which is sort of a subsidiary, \nregarding our troop presence in Iraq.\n  The question, I guess, we need to ask ourselves is: Why would the \nIranian Government, through the Quds Force and other organizations, be \nsponsoring militia groups that are trying to kill Americans in Iraq?\n  There is a purpose for everything. I know why we are there. From my \npoint of view, we are there to try to stabilize a country in a post-\nSaddam Hussein era that would allow the three groups to live tolerantly \ntogether and be an ally in the war on terror, be a place to check Iran, \nand deny al-Qaida a safe haven, and it could be a model for future \nMideast expansion of representative government and the democratic \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S12016]]\n\n  What would Iran be up to? My belief is the reason the Iranian regime \nis so hellbent on making sure the Iraqi experiment in tolerance fails \nin representative government--from a theocracy point of view, from the \nIranian Government's point of view, the biggest nightmare for them \nwould be a representative government in Iraq on their border. So they \nare not going to give that to the Iraqi people without a fight. They \ncertainly are not going to give it to us without a fight.\n  We need to realize we are in a proxy war with Iran over the outcome \nof Iraq. For those who have determined this is a civil war only in \nIraq, that the outcome is about who runs Iraq, I think you \nmisunderstand the role Iran is playing. Iran is trying to shape Iraq in \na way not to be a threat to the theocracy in Iran. They are trying to \nshape Iraq in a way that would be detrimental to our long-term national \nsecurity interests. They are trying to be able to say to the world they \nstood up to America and drove us out. They are trying to expand their \ninfluence by defeating us in Iraq and in trying to destabilize their \nrepresentative form of government, which would, again, be a nightmare.\n  So this resolution designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a \nterrorist organization is well founded based on the evidence that is \nbeing gathered against this organization. There is more to come. I have \nhad a chance to be over in Iraq a couple times now looking at some \ncases involving Iranian involvement with the killing and kidnapping of \nAmerican soldiers. So there is more evidence to come about Iran's \ninvolvement in trying to kill Americans and destabilize this \nrepresentative government in Iraq.\n  Now, the second resolution is: What role should we play in dictating \nthe outcome of this representative experiment in government in Iraq? I \nhave great respect for Senator Biden. I think it is ill advised for us \nin the Senate to be adopting a resolution basically dictating or trying \nto give our sense of what should happen in Iraq because that destroys \nthe whole underpinning of what we are trying to do.\n  The idea that the three groups can live separate and apart from each \nother without regional consequences is unfounded. The Shias, who wish a \ntheocracy for Iraq, could never achieve that goal without pushback from \ntheir Sunni Arab neighbors. The Kurds, who wish to have an independent \nKurdish state in the north, are going to run right into the teeth of \nTurkey. The Sunnis, who wish for the good old days of Saddam where they \nran the country--that is never going to happen. The region is not going \nto allow that to happen.\n  So at the end of the day, I believe the effort to reconcile Iraq in \ncentral Baghdad will be successful not by a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution but by a desire and sense of the people of Iraq. The one \nthing I have learned from my last visit is that local reconciliation in \nIraq is proliferating because people are very much tired of the \nkilling. They are war weary. There is a suicide bomber wave going on \nright now against reconciliation efforts in Diyala Province, where 21 \npeople were killed who were meeting to reconcile that province.\n  So al-Qaida is alive and well in Iraq. They are greatly diminished, \nbut they show up where reconciliation is being discussed. The reason \nthey show up where reconciliation is being discussed is because their \nbig nightmare is to have Iraq come together and a woman to have a say \nabout her children and Sunnis and Shias and Kurds living in peace and \nrejecting their extremist view of the Koran.\n  So the players in Iran and al-Qaida are very much pushing back hard. \nThe question for this country is, Will we stand up to them and push \nback equally hard and stand by the moderate forces in Iraq, imperfect \nas they may be?\n  So I hope one amendment is adopted, designating the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization. I hope the other \namendment, trying to give our sense of what to do in Iraq from the \nSenate's point of view, fails and we allow the Iraqi people to work out \ntheir problems with our help but insist they get on with it.\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to proceed in morning business for 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise as an alumni of Columbia College to \nask a question which I suspect is on the mind of a lot of the alumni of \nColumbia College and probably a lot of average Americans wandering \naround the country, which is, why did they create a forum for the \nPresident of Iran in a way that basically almost made him look like a \nsympathetic figure because of the actions of the President of the \ncollege? Open dialog on our campuses is important. We all recognize \nthat. In fact, it is the essence of a good education. Columbia has a \nstrong history, ironically, of having an extraordinary curriculum \ncalled a core curriculum which requires you to study all sorts of \nsubjects whether you want to study them or not so that you gain \nknowledge in a variety of different areas and are exposed to a variety \nof different areas.\n\n  I have always believed that core curriculum was one of the great \nstrengths of the college and was certainly one of the things I most \nenjoyed while I was there. So open discussion and having people on the \ncampus who have an opinion which is antithetical to the values of our \nsociety is, I suppose, reasonable. But you have to put it in the \ncontext of what other discussion is allowed on our allegedly elite \nuniversity campuses or even some campuses which are maybe Ivy League; \nthat is, if you have a view which is conservative and you happen to \nwant to express that opinion, you are quite often limited as to your \nability to speak on those campuses. I, for example, suspect it would be \nvery hard to get a date for Donald Rumsfeld to speak at Columbia. I \nsuspect it would be probably even more difficult to get a date for the \nPresident of the United States to speak at Columbia. I am absolutely \nsure the Vice President of the United States would never be invited to \nspeak at Columbia.\n  So one has to ask the question, Why did they decide to give a forum \nto an individual who is running a government of a country, the purpose \nof which is to develop a nuclear weapon, which nuclear weapon and \nweapons will be used to threaten world stability and clearly threaten \ntheir neighbors in the Middle East? Ahmadi-Nejad has said he intends to \neliminate Israel. In his speech yesterday, he affirmed his view that \nthe Holocaust was a theoretical event, maybe never happened--an absurd \nstatement. Yesterday, he went so far as to even describe his whole \nsociety as having nobody of a homosexual persuasion. He is leading a \nterrorist nation, or a terrorist government--the nation itself isn't \nterrorist, I suspect--but a terrorist government which is in the \nprocess of arming people in Iraq who are killing American soldiers. Yet \nColumbia invites him and gives him a forum in which to spread his \nvalues, to the extent you can call them values, or his views. It seems \nironic and inconsistent and highly inappropriate in the context of what \nColumbia would not allow in the area of open discussion, which would be \nto have, for example, the Vice President of the United States speak, I \nsuspect.\n  Then, to compound this error--the President of Iran is going to have \nhis forum today at the U.N. Columbia did not have to give him an \nadditional forum--but to compound that error, the president of the \nuniversity was so egregious in the way he handled the situation, in my \nopinion, that he actually almost made the President of Iran look \nsomewhat sympathetic, which is almost impossible to do. The attitude of \narrogance and officiousness and the posturing of positions and \nquestions by the president of Columbia in a way that basically gave \nAhmadi-Nejad the opportunity to basically respond as if he were being \ncoherent--because the questions and the attacks were so aggressive in a \nway that was arrogant and inappropriate, even in dealing with\n\n[[Page S12017]]\n\nsomebody like Ahmadi-Nejad--was a startling failure of leadership at \nthe university by the president of the university.\n  As an alumni, I was embarrassed, to put it quite simply. I was \nembarrassed by the fact that they would choose to give this individual \nsuch a forum, this individual who will probably, for my children, my \nchildren's children, and maybe even our generation, be the most \nsignificant threat to world peace that we have as soon as he develops \nhis nuclear weapon, which he is on course to do, and then to compound \nthat by setting up the forum in a way where the president of the \nuniversity basically went way beyond what would be considered to be a \ncoherent and thoughtful and balanced approach to addressing this \nindividual. It would have been much more effective had the president of \nthe university simply allowed the President of Iran to make his \nstatement and, by his own statement, indict himself because that is \nexactly what he would have done, and he did. But, unfortunately, rather \nthan the President of Iran becoming the issue, which he should be, the \npresident of the university made himself part of the story and the \nissue.\n  It was not a good day for Columbia or for alumni of Columbia, in my \nhumble opinion, and it speaks volumes about the level to which the \nuniversities in our country, especially those which proclaim themselves \nelite, have sunk in the area of setting up open and free dialog \nbecause, as I said, as has been seen in various universities across \nthis country, conservative thought would not have been given the type \nof forum this militaristic individual, whose purpose it is to \nessentially destabilize the world through the use of nuclear weapons, \nwas given. Others would not be given such a forum.\n  So it is with regret that I rise today to ask why--again, why--why \ndid Columbia pursue this course and why did the president of the \nuniversity pursue the course he pursued in responding to the attendance \nof the President of Iran on his campus?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very \nimportant and very positive issue we are going to be addressing and \nsending to the President this week; that is, the reauthorization of the \nchildren's health care program. This is really a historic, bipartisan \neffort that has been put together, and it is something we have done \ntogether for all of our families and children across America.\n  We urgently need to pass this bill in its final form and send it to \nthe President of the United States. I know the House of Representatives \nis doing that today, and it will then come to us. There is no question \nthat it is one of the most important things we will do this year, not \nonly guaranteeing that some 6 million children who currently receive \nthis children's health care program will be able to continue to get \nhealth care, but we will be expanding upwards of another 4 million \nchildren who will be able to have the health care they need and \ndeserve.\n  I wish to particularly thank leaders on the Finance Committee, \nincluding Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller, and \nSenator Hatch, for working together in such a wonderful way that has \ngiven us the opportunity in the Senate to come together, with the \noriginal vote on the bill being 68 Members of the Senate--68 Members of \nthe Senate. In addition to that, we are so thrilled to have Senator \nJohnson back with us so that his vote will be added as well to this \nvery important program.\n  I also thank our leader, Senator Harry Reid, for making this a top \npriority and for personally engaging in the negotiations that took \nplace to be able to get us to the point where we have something on \nwhich we can move forward in the House and the Senate in a bipartisan \nway.\n  This really builds on the bipartisan spirit that created the whole \nprogram in 1997. I was in the U.S. House of Representatives \nrepresenting mid-Michigan at the time and felt that as we put this \nprogram together then, it was an incredibly important statement of our \nvalues and our priorities. We are talking about working families, moms \nand dads who go to work every day to maybe one, two, or three jobs who \nare trying to hold things together and desperately want to make sure \ntheir children have the health care they need. That is what this \nlegislation is all about. That is what this program is all about.\n  Among many good things that have been placed into this bipartisan \nlegislation, I am very proud to say that it makes important \nimprovements in dental care and in mental health care for children. It \nlooks at quality issues and health information technology. I am very \npleased that language which I authored concerning creating an \nelectronic medical record for children, a pediatric electronic medical \nrecord, is in this legislation so that we can bring children's \ninformation together around immunizations and other kinds of health \ncare needs in one place so we can more effectively have them treated \nand have doctors and hospitals knowing what, in fact, a child's medical \nrecord is. I am also very pleased about another piece of the \nlegislation I worked on in relation to school-based health centers and \nthe importance of recognizing them as part of a continuum of care for \nchildren.\n  This bill really does represent a very successful public sector and \nprivate sector partnership that helps our families and makes sure more \nchildren, children of working families, are able to get health care in \nthis country. In my State of Michigan, a private insurer runs what we \ncall the MIChild Program. Last year, nearly one-third of the children \nin Michigan relied on either Healthy Kids through Medicaid for low-\nincome children or MIChild, which represents working families, for \nhealth care coverage. About three-quarters of the children have at \nleast one working parent. I must say that oftentimes that is mom--mom \ntrying to, again, work one job or two jobs or three jobs, desperately \nconcerned about her children, needing to put food on the table, needing \nto buy them school clothes, needing to get them what they need to be \nable to survive and function every day, and knowing that when they \ndesperately need to go to the dentist, they are able to get a dental \ncheckup, or to be able to get basic kinds of health care.\n  I know too many people who tell me they go to bed at night saying: \nPlease, God, don't let the kids get sick. This program in Michigan, \nMIChild, and this program which we are now coming together on a \nbipartisan basis to expand says to those parents: Somebody is hearing \nyou; that we as a country and as a Congress care about the children of \nthis country and making sure they have their health care needs met.\n  It is so important to stress that this is not a program for wealthy \nfamilies, for rich kids. We have heard so much misinformation about \nwhat this program is all about. In Michigan, a family of four cannot \nmake over $40,000 to qualify for MIChild. This is, again, a family of \nfour. If there are two working parents, working just barely above \npoverty level, this allows them to be able to get the health insurance \nthey need for their children.\n  The Saginaw-based Center for Civil Justice shared a story with me \nabout a young mother named Christie whose husband was laid off and the \nfamily income dropped to less than $2,000 a month for a family of \nfive--less than $24,000 a year for a family of five. Nearly half of \nthat goes to rent and utilities, like most families. The children's \nhealth care program in Michigan, MIChild, has helped their three \nchildren, who are 4 years old, 3 years old, and 8 months. Thankfully, \nthey have been able to--in Michigan, we have had a dental benefit, \nwhich is something we are going to provide through this bill. Without \nthat, Christie's children would not have what they need.\n\n[[Page S12018]]\n\n  Recently, one of the children needed to have their tonsils removed. I \nremember those days with my children. It would not have been able to be \ndone--it could have turned into a much more serious situation for that \nchild--if it was not for the children's health care program. It makes a \ndifference in children's lives every day.\n  Another mom, Pam, is a full-time preschool teacher and mother. Her \nmonthly premiums of $384 per month, or over $4,500 per year, would have \ntaken up a fifth of her pay if she was trying to pay through a private \nindividual plan.\n  But through MICild, she was able to get the specialized care she \nneeded for her daughter, who suffers from a rare seizure disorder. She \nwould not have been able to care for her daughter if it were not for \nthe children's health care program.\n  Like Pam, most working families simply cannot afford traditional \nhealth insurance and make ends meet--to be able to pay rent, utilities, \na mortgage payment, or purchase food and school clothes, and, on top of \nthat, find an individual policy that is affordable in the private \nmarket. According to the Commonwealth Fund, nearly three-quarters of \npeople living below 200 percent of the poverty line found it very \ndifficult or impossible to find affordable coverage in the individual \nmarket. Premiums for individual market coverage for families with \nincomes between 100 percent of poverty and 199 percent of poverty--\nwhich is what we are talking about and what we have in Michigan--on \naverage, one-quarter of the family's total income--25 percent--would be \npremiums for health care in the private market. Faced with these costs, \nmany families just don't have the coverage because they cannot afford \nto do it and at the same time put food on the table. The situation is \neven worse for families with chronic conditions, such as asthma or \njuvenile diabetes. If they were able to purchase coverage in the \nindividual market, costs would be much higher.\n  The children's health program, it is important to note, is not just \nfor kids in cities, it is not just an urban program. This program helps \nall children regardless of where they live. In fact, according to the \nCarsey Institute, they found that there were more children in rural \nareas who were benefiting from the Children's Health Insurance Program \nthan in urban areas--32 percent of rural children versus 26 percent of \nurban children. So this really is something that touches every single \npart of the country, every single part of our States, and families all \nthroughout America who are working hard every day and counting on us to \nhelp them to be able to get the children's health care they need.\n  We are taking a huge step forward for our Nation's uninsured \nchildren, the vast majority of whom--78 percent--live in working \nfamilies. Seventy-eight percent live in a home where mom and/or dad is \nworking, but they are not making enough to be able to afford private \npremiums in the private individual market. Because the importance of \nthe children's health care program is so critical for so many families, \nI urge my colleagues not to listen to inaccurate statements or negative \nattacks but to join together, as we have done, in a wonderful \nbipartisan effort in the Senate to send a very strong message to this \nPresident that we come together on behalf of the children and the \nworking families of America to put our values and priorities in the \nright place. That is what we are talking about here. This is about \nchoices, about values, about priorities.\n  This bill is totally in line with what President Bush proposed at the \n2004 Republican Convention. He said at that time:\n\n       In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for Government health insurance programs. We will not allow a \n     lack of attention, or information, to stand between these \n     children and the health care they need.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, this bipartisan compromise, this bipartisan \nvictory which has been put together in the Congress is an aggressive \neffort to enroll millions of poor children into a successful public-\nprivate partnership. This bill before us is a chance to make a real \ndifference in the lives of millions of children--millions of children \nwho, without us and the children's health care program, will not have \nthat chance.\n  We need to do the right thing. Every day, as we wait, children are \ngrowing; they don't wait for us. They keep on growing whether we are \ndebating, whether we are in committee meetings. Regardless of what we \nare doing, the children of America keep on growing. They keep on having \nneeds--dental or broad health care needs or mental health needs. It is \ntime to do the right thing. We have it within our grasp. A tremendous \namount of hard work has gone into this. Let's remember the bipartisan \nspirit that created this great program in 1997. Let's remember that the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is truly a great American success \nstory for which we can all take credit. We can join together in taking \ncredit for it.\n  Let's pass this bill and, most importantly, let's together urge the \nPresident of the United States to do the right thing on behalf of the \nchildren of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow, my friend from \nMichigan, for the comments about children's health. She is right-on \nabout that. Look at the choice. We are going to spend $2.5 billion a \nweek in Iraq. Yet we are unwilling per year to spend $7 billion to \ninsure 4 million additional children--some 75,000 in my State and \n50,000 or 60,000 in the State of Michigan next door. We are spending \n$2.5 billion a week in Iraq. Yet the President says he is going to say \nno and veto this bill on children's health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12018-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12018-S12019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our Nation's haphazard trade policy has \ndone plenty of damage to Ohio's economy, to our workers, to our \nmanufacturers, and to our small businesses. Recent news reports of \ntainted foods and toxic toys reveal another hazard of ill-conceived and \nunenforced trade rules. They subject American families and children to \nproducts that can harm them, that in some cases have even killed them.\n  From pet food to toothpaste, from tires to toys, news stories almost \nevery day highlight the consequences of our Nation's failed trade \npolicy. Countries such as China lack basic protections we have come to \ntake for granted. Given the well-known dangers of lead, particularly \nfor young children, our Government banned it from products such as \ngasoline and paint in the 1970s. Yet our trade policy is turning back \nthe clock on the hard-fought safety standards that keep our families \nand our children safe.\n  What happens should come as no surprise. When we trade the way we do, \nwhen we bought $288 billion of products from the People's Republic of \nChina last year and $288 billion this year--it will probably exceed \n$300 billion--and we are trading with a country that doesn't have close \nto the same safety standards for its own workers or safe air or \ndrinking water standards for its own water, why would we expect them to \nsell safe products to our country?\n  It is compounded by the fact that companies, such as Mattel say to \nthe Chinese contractors: We want you to cut costs. Lead paint? Use it; \nit is cheaper. Cut corners so we can save money.\n  It is no surprise because American corporations have pushed the \nChinese to cut costs, and at the same time China doesn't have fair \nlabor standards, clean air, and safe drinking water standards for their \nown people. Of course they are going to sell products back to our \ncountry such as contaminated toothpaste and pet food and dangerous toys \nwith lead-based paint on those products.\n\n  Our trade policy should prevent these problems, not invite them. \nDespite the real and present danger from Chinese imports, we must not \nfocus solely on consumer threats from China. The real threat is our \nfailed trade policy that allows recall after recall. The real threat is \nour failure to change course and craft a new, very different trade \npolicy. The real threat is this administration's insistence on more of \nthe same--more trade pacts that send U.S. jobs overseas, more trade \npacts that allow companies and countries to ignore the rules of fair \ntrade, more trade\n\n[[Page S12019]]\n\npacts that will mean more tainted products in our homes, more dangerous \ntoys for our children, and more recalls for our businesses.\n  The administration and its free-trade supporters in Congress are \ngearing up for another trade fight. They want to force on our Nation--a \nnation that in November, in Montana, Ohio, and across the country, \ndemanded change--more job-killing trade agreements with unreliable \nstandards. Free-trade agreements with Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South \nKorea currently being debated in Congress are based on the same failed \ntrade model.\n  This week, the Peru trade agreement is at the forefront of the debate \nbetween fundamentally flawed trade models--more of the same--and the \nfight for fair trade. We want more trade, plenty of trade; we just want \nfair trade, different rules.\n  The Peru free-trade agreement, like NAFTA, while it has some \nimprovements over that, puts limits on the safety standards we can \nrequire for imports. FDA inspectors have rejected seafood imports from \nPeru and Panama--major seafood suppliers to the United States. Yet the \ncurrent trade agreement, as proposed--the Bush administration's Peru \nand Panama agreements--limits food safety standards and border \ninspections. What has happened already is where, frankly, we have \nbought too many contaminated products, contaminated seafood imports, \nand whatever problems we have, this trade agreement will make it worse \nbecause this agreement will limit our own food safety standards and \nborder inspections. Adding insult to injury, the agreements would force \nthe United States to rely on foreign inspectors to ensure our safety. \nWe have seen how well that worked with China.\n  It is time for a new direction in trade policy. It is time for a \ntrade policy that ensures the safety of food on our kitchen tables and \ntoys in our children's bedrooms. It is time for a trade policy that \ncreates new businesses and good-paying jobs at home instead of a trade \npolicy that encourages companies to outsource and move overseas. It is \ntime for a trade policy that puts an end to the global exploitation of \ncheap labor.\n  The voters in November shouted from the ballot box, demanding a new \ntrade policy. Their resounding call for a new trade policy put Members \nof Congress on notice that their trade votes in Washington matter to \nvoters back home.\n  With Peru, Panama, Colombia, and South Korea, voters in my State of \nOhio and across the Nation are watching these trade debates. Everyone \nagrees on one thing: We want more trade with countries around the \nworld, but first we must protect the safety and the health of our \nfamilies and our children.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk on two issues with my \ncolleagues. One is about Iran. The President of Iran is now in the \nUnited States. Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad is in the United States enjoying \nliberties here that are not enjoyed in his home country by his fellow \ncitizens. I want to make a point of that. I want to talk about what he \nhas said and what he has done. I think there is a substantial \ndifference. I want to point out that we should pass the Lieberman-Kyl \namendment regarding the designation of terrorist organization by--that \nthe IRGC be designated as a terrorist organization. Finally, I will \nwrap up with a discussion about the Biden-Brownback amendment on \nfederalism in Iraq, which I think would be very important.\n  President Ahmadi-Nejad took advantage of the freedoms we enjoy to \nspread lies in the United States. I believe his appearance was \ndisgraceful. I think the things he is saying are outright lies--what he \nis saying versus what he has done. He looked his audience in the eye \nand he lied. He knew he was telling lies, and the audience knew it.\n  Let's talk about the real truth inside Iran. I want to speak about \nwhat is taking place there.\n  I have chaired the Middle East subcommittee in the past. I have \nworked on issues regarding Iran. We have worked to secure and have \nsecured funding for civil society development inside Iran. I worked \nwith a number of Iranian dissidents who have been forced out of that \ncountry. We have seen it taking place on the news.\n  President Ahmadi-Nejad is enjoying liberties now in this country that \nare not available to his people. It would be easier to spend time in \nhis own country developing these same civil liberties for individuals \nand renouncing terrorism rather than trying to go to the World Trade \nCenter site where terrorists killed so many of our citizens.\n  President Ahmadi-Nejad and Ayatollah Khamenei are not trustworthy \nleaders. The Iranian people do not enjoy freedom of speech. Their \npeople do not have a free press. The Iranian Government represses women \nand minorities. They do not tolerate religions other than their own \nextreme version of Shia Islam.\n  For example, consider the Baha'is of Iran. Since 1979, the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran has blocked the Baha'is' access to higher education, \nrefused them entry into universities and expelled them when they are \ndiscovered to be Baha'is.\n  Recently, a 70-year-old man was sentenced to 70 lashes and a year in \nprison for ``propagating and spreading Bahaism and the defamation of \nthe pure Imams''--a 70-year-old man, 70 lashes, a year in prison.\n  We must stand with the teachers who are getting purged from academic \ninstitutions in Iran for speaking their minds, with the Iranian-\nAmerican scholars who are being arrested on trumped-up charges, and \nwith newspaper editors who refuse to censor according to Government \ndemands.\n  Isn't it amazing that President Ahmadi-Nejad would see that taking \nplace in his country and yet come here to enjoy our civil liberties of \nfreedom of the press, freedom of assembly, to speak his mind when he \ncannot do it in his country? We should be reaching out to the students, \nthe labor activists, and the brave leaders of Iran's fledgling civil \nsociety and offer our support for their views and for an open society \nin Iran. It is not only a moral imperative, but I believe it is also in \nthe strategic interest of the United States and of people of civil \nsocieties in the West and throughout the world.\n  This context is important as we consider the amendment offered by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Kyl. Yesterday Ahmadi-Nejad claimed that \nIran is a free country, where women are respected and life is good for \nthe Iranian people. We know this is not true.\n  Yesterday, we also heard from Ahmadi-Nejad that Iran does not want to \nattack Israel, that it is not meddling in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it \ndoes not want a nuclear weapon. We know this is not true. They are \nmeddling in Iraq, attacking our troops with weapons developed in Iran. \nThey have held conferences stating a world without Israel, a world \nwithout the United States.\n  Iran's leaders would say the IRGC is not a threat, but we have no \nreason to believe them. In fact, we know the IRGC is killing our \nsoldiers in Iraq. It is working with Hezbollah in Lebanon and it is \npresent in other countries around the world advancing the agenda of the \nSupreme Leader in Iran.\n  The IRGC is the very definition of a terrorist organization, and Iran \nas a nation is the lead sponsor of terrorism around the world. The IRGC \nshould be designated formally as a terrorist organization so that the \nfull power of the American Government can be applied to combating its \nactivities. The IRGC is not a normal military arm of a sovereign \ngovernment. It is the operational division of the world's most \ndangerous state sponsor of terrorism. If we think of terrorism as a \nthreat, we must designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.\n  I hope the President of Iran will renounce terrorism and the support \nfor terrorism today, although I know he will not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12019-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12019-S12021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        POLITICAL SURGE IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on another matter on which we are going \nto be voting shortly, the Biden-Brownback amendment, I wish to show \nthis map of Iraq. I note to my colleagues in the time I have, when \nPresident Bush saw the military situation was devolving on the ground \nand was moving toward civil war, he called for a military surge. He \nsaid: It is not working; we are not getting control; we\n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\nneed more troops. I had difficulty with that decision. I questioned \nwhether it would work. But I think one has to say this has worked, that \nit has calmed down much of the situation. We don't know for what period \nof time. It certainly has produced a lot of results in Anbar Province.\n  I was at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas yesterday meeting with a number \nof key leaders in the military who have been in and out of Iraq several \ntimes. They were quite pleased with the number of positive events \nmoving forward in Iraq with the military situation.\n  If we look at the GAO report of what is taking place on the political \nsituation in Iraq where there has been a military surge, when the \nmilitary surge has produced results, what I am contending now is we \nneed a political surge. The military situation is more stable. It is \ncertainly not completely stable in Iraq, but it has produced an \nenvironment where we need a political surge, and the current political \nsetup is not producing that situation.\n  When the military situation was not producing results, we made \nchanges. The political situation is not producing results, and I \nsuggest we have to have changes in this situation as well. We did not \nhesitate to move forward with a U.S. strategy on keeping a civil war \nfrom going full blown in Iraq. We should work now with a political \nsurge in Iraq because this current situation is not working. Two weeks \nago, when General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testified, the focus \nwas on General Petraeus when I think the focus should have been on \nAmbassador Crocker.\n  As we see in the GAO assessment, the Iraqi Government has met 3 \nbenchmarks politically, partially met 4 benchmarks, and did not meet 11 \nof the political benchmarks that we in Congress had set and that the \nadministration had gone along with and said, yes, those are realistic. \nOut of 18 total, 11 have not been met at all, 4 partially met, and 3 \nmet. That is not working politically.\n  I am showing a map of Iraq under the Ottoman Empire. It is broken \ninto three categories, referred to as Mesopotamia at that point in \ntime--Shia south, Sunni middle, and Kurdish north, with Baghdad as a \nfederal city. They had it broken into three states. My point in saying \nthis is--and the Chair will recognize this as he was raised in farm \ncountry, raised on a farm--you can work with nature or you can fight \nit. My experience is you are a lot more successful when you work with \nit than try to fight.\n  There is a natural setup in Iraq. There are divisions which people \nhave lived with and in for a long period of time. We can try to force \nthe whole country together and hold it together with a strong military \nforce, or we can recognize these difficulties and say we are going to \nwork with this situation. And we have in the north, in the Kurdish \nportion of the country. We said the Kurds run the Kurdish portion.\n  I was up there in January. It is stable, growing, with investments \ntaking place, people moving into the area, the exact situation we want \nto see taking place across all Iraq. Wouldn't it be wise at this point \nin time to allow a Sunni state to develop, still one country, but \ndevolving the power and authority more down to a state level of \ngovernment and have the Sunnis have a police force and a military in \ntheir region, and the Shia doing the same in their region so they trust \nthe structure, so they are willing to work with us?\n\n  This is a political structure that can meet some benchmarks we set \nand others set. Why would we be hesitant putting in a political surge \nand pushing? We were not hesitant about pushing a military surge and \npushing that piece of it. I don't see why we wouldn't do a political \nsurge.\n  This is a map of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was before the Dayton \naccords and then after the Dayton accords. This is a very diverse map \nof what was taking place. This is the former Yugoslavia. We can see the \ndifferent ethnic groups. We can see them spread around.\n  I now wish to show a map of what took place after the ethnic \nsectarian buttons were pushed and you had people sorting out, you had \npeople moving to various parts to feel more comfortable and more \nsecure, and this sorted out.\n  Then we saw the Bosnia-Herzegovina lines under the Dayton peace \nagreement that the United States pushed. It was a political agreement \nbecause the people on the ground could not agree to this themselves. \nThis is something they could not deal with on their own because their \nown people would say we don't trust these guys or we don't trust those \nguys, we can't deal with them. We had to go in with a very aggressive \nmilitary force that is still sitting there to enforce an agreement that \nwas uncomfortable on the ground. We came in with a political surge to \nsay: OK, this is something that should take place. We forced the \nparties to come to an agreement, and they have been at relative peace. \nThere have been different breakouts. There is tension in the region. We \nstill have troops in the area, as many others do, 15 years later, but \nthis has maintained a relative peace.\n  I wish to show a map of Baghdad now. My point in saying that is, at \ntimes in these types of situations, I believe we have to have a U.S. \npush for a political surge. I am suggesting that we have a well-known, \nwell-regarded policy person--maybe a Jim Baker, maybe it is Condoleezza \nRice, maybe it is Colin Powell--who goes over and knocks out the \nagreement between particularly the Sunni and Shia who have not been \nable to get along. The Sunnis have run the country for a century, but \nthey are in the minority. They think they still ought to run the \ncountry, but that is not going to happen. The Shia who are in the \nmajority are not confident at all that the Sunnis are not coming back \nto run the place again, and they don't trust them.\n  We see ethnic splitting. This is a map of Baghdad. The Tigris River \nruns through the middle. This is purifying more Sunni and more Shia. \nThe hash lines to the left are Shia purifying, and Sunni purifying on \nthe other side, and a lot of people moving out of this region.\n  This makes all the sense in the world. Instead of trying to fight \nagainst this situation and trying to force Sunni and Shia together into \none government that has a strong centralized government, we are only \ngoing to get a weak Shia government because the Kurds and the Sunnis \nare not going to agree with a strong Shia government, and we devolve \nthe power and authority mostly out to the states and let them run it. \nWe would have the Sunnis running their region and the Shia running \ntheir region in Baghdad. That is a way we can work with the natural \nsetup of the situation. That is what we are calling for in the Biden-\nBrownback amendment. It has a number of cosponsors from both sides. It \nis a political surge that recognizes the realities on the ground and \nsays this is something that can produce results in keeping with what we \nare doing militarily in trying to give the political environment a \nsetting in which it can work.\n  This current political setup is not going to work. It has not \nproduced results. It has not produced results to date. It is unlikely \nto produce results in the future. I think it has failed as a political \nstructure. We have seen a portion of this already work in the northern \nregion, in the Kurdish region where the Kurds run their area and it is \nstabilized and moving forward. That is why I urge my colleagues to look \nat this amendment. This is a positive step on our part. It is a \npositive step for the Iraqis.\n  Some of my colleagues believe it is the U.S. dictating to them what \nthey ought to do. I contend in the Dayton peace agreements we pushed \nawfully hard. They still had to make the decision, as the Iraqis will. \nI also believe because of these ethnic sectarian divisions that have \nexisted for some period of time, that unless an outside force comes in \nand pushes aggressively, these things are unlikely to happen because \nthe leaders are not going to be able to lead their people voluntarily; \nit is going to have to be something with some push.\n  We are going to have to work with the nations in the region as well \nto make sure the people we worked with a lot--the Saudis and \nJordanians, in particular, and others within the region as well--are \nsupportive of this plan. We have to assure them that Iraq will remain \none country. One of the points they have all been adamant about is that \nIraq remain one country. It would remain one country, as Bosnia-\nHerzegovina has remained one country, although it is split into two \nstates.\n\n[[Page S12021]]\n\n  We can do this. It is a positive step. It is a bipartisan step on a \ntopic that certainly could use a little bipartisanship. We haven't had \nmuch on Iraq. That is the way we overall lose in a situation, when we \nsplit here. If we will stand together here, we will not lose over \nthere. We need to start pulling people together around some sort of \ncommon idea and not say: Well, because it is a Democratic idea, I guess \nwe can't do it, or because it wasn't proposed by certain individuals, \nwe aren't going to do it.\n  Let's pull together. This is something that can and will work, and it \nis something we need to do because if we can get this situation to \nstabilize, we can start pulling our troop levels back. I do not believe \nwe will pull our troop levels completely out of Iraq for some period of \ntime, just as we are still in the Bosnia region for some period of \ntime. We can pull our troop levels back, certainly pull them back to \nthe Kurdish, Sunni, and Baghdad to keep as a stabilizing force for some \nyears to come, but not losing troops on a daily basis and we will be \nable to get those troop levels down.\n  This is something we can work on in a bipartisan way and get us \npulling together and get us into a stable political environment. It is \nnot a perfect solution. There isn't a perfect solution that exists. I \nthink it is a far better one and far more likely to produce political \nresults on a benchmark basis of stability that we can work with and \nthat we can then move forward in facing other more difficult \nsituations, other equally difficult situations in the region, as I \nstarted off talking about--Iran, the lead sponsor of state-sponsored \nterrorism, which is one we have to address with what they are doing in \nthe region.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today marks an important anniversary in \nAmerica's continuing efforts to create a truly just and more perfect \nUnion. It was 50 years ago today--50 years--that nine courageous high \nschool students in Little Rock, AR, stood up to a jeering, threatening \ncrowd, the Arkansas National Guard, and their own Governor to claim \ntheir fundamental right for equal educational opportunity.\n  I can still recall as a child, seeing that scene on black-and-white \ntelevision, a scene that has been replayed so many times, watching \nthose students as they walked through that gauntlet of hate into a high \nschool. High school, for most of us, was a joyous experience, a happy \nexperience. For many of these students, their high school career began \nwith fear.\n  These young people, not chosen by any scientific method but almost by \nchance, came to be known as the Little Rock Nine. Thankfully, it is \nhard for many Americans to understand what courage it took for them to \nwalk into Little Rock Central High School in 1957. You know what it \ntook? For those kids to walk into that high school, it took an order \nfrom President Dwight David Eisenhower, the protection of the U.S. \nArmy, the extraordinary legal talents of future Supreme Court Justice \nThurgood Marshall, and daily guidance from caring adults such as Daisy \nand L.C. Bates. Above all, it took the daily faith and courage of those \nnine young kids and their families.\n  The crowds who surrounded Little Rock Central that day may have \ndisappeared after a few tense days, but the taunts and threats to those \nnine students continued for the entire school year. In the end, those \nnine young students became America's teachers. They showed us and they \nshowed America how we could live closer to our ideals.\n  Although their names will always be linked first and foremost with \nArkansas, the people of my State are proud that four of the Little Rock \nNine went on to college in Illinois. Gloria Ray Karlmark earned a \nmathematics degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology in \nChicago. Three of the Little Rock Nine earned degrees at Southern \nIllinois University, a great university in my State, which prides \nitself on having opened its doors and cast away any racial prejudice \nvery early. It became well known throughout the African-American \ncommunity as a place where higher education was available for those \nAfrican-American students who were striving to better themselves.\n  Minnijean Brown Trickey graduated from Southern Illinois University \nand went on to a distinguished career in education, social work, and \npublic service that included serving in the Clinton administration as a \nDeputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n  Dr. Terrance Roberts earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in \npsychology from SIU. Today, he is a professor and practicing \npsychologist in California.\n  Thelma Mothershed Wair earned a B.S. and a master's degree in \nguidance counseling from SIU, married a fellow SIU student from my \nhometown of East St. Louis, and served as an educator and an \ninspiration in the East St. Louis school system for 28 years before she \nretired.\n  A lot has changed in America over the last 50 years. Little Rock \nCentral High School remains one of the best, most challenging high \nschools in Arkansas. Today, it has an African-American student body \npresident. Other communities that were once deeply divided by race--and \nnot all of them in the South, I might add--have changed as well.\n  In my home State, my Land of Lincoln, a few weeks ago I visited a \ntown I have come to know over many decades--Cairo, IL. Forty-five years \nago, Cairo was a hotbed of Ku Klux Klan activism. In the land of \nLincoln, in 1960, there was a white citizens council that was doing its \nbest to keep Cairo a segregated town, many years after Brown v. Board \nof Education. The head of the white citizens council was the white \nstates attorney for Alexander County. Similar to many southern towns, \nCairo closed its municipal swimming pool rather than allow black and \nwhite children to swim together. Today, I am proud to tell you that the \nmayor, the city treasurer, and the police chief of Cairo are all \nAfrican-American.\n  But the struggle for equal justice is not over. Last week, thousands \nof people from communities across America traveled by plane, car, and \nbus to Jena, LA, with a population of less than 3,000, to protest what \nappears to be separate and unequal justice. The facts in what has come \nto be known as the Jena 6 case sound disturbingly similar to so many \ncases from an era so many of us thought was long gone.\n\n  One year ago, some African-American students at Jena's public high \nschool asked the school administrators if they could sit under a shade \ntree outside the school, and they were told they could. For years, that \ntree outside their school had been known as the ``white tree.'' By \ncustom, its shade was for white students only. Days after African-\nAmerican students dared to sit under that tree, nooses were hung from \nits branches--nooses. Local authorities dismissed that unmistakable \nreference to the terrorism of lynching as another youthful prank.\n  Over the next 2 months, tensions rose at the high school. A series of \nfights between black and white students escalated. Each time, black \nstudents were punished more severely than the white students who took \npart in the same fights. Finally, last December, six young men, all \nAfrican-American, were arrested and charged with attempted murder and \nother serious felonies that could send them to prison for a collective \n100 years.\n  The problem of unequal justice is not confined to the South, and it \nis not limited to race. It is easy to condemn yesterday's wrongdoing, \nbut the Little Rock Nine had the courage to oppose injustice in their \nown time. In our time, few people still condemn the overt racism of Jim \nCrow and ``whites only'' drinking fountains, but many still excuse and \njustify discrimination and unequal justice based on such distinctions \nas national origin and sexual orientation.\n  I believe one day in the not-too-distant future, we will look back on \nthese attitudes and wonder how we could have tolerated such \ndiscrimination and division.\n  It is good to reflect on times past, the heroes and heroines of those \neras,\n\n[[Page S12022]]\n\nbut also to reflect on what America was like, how people reacted to \nthat scene in Little Rock, AR, and how they reacted to Dr. Martin \nLuther King. It is easy now, some 50 years later, to suggest everybody \nknew it was the right thing to do in Little Rock and that everyone \nunderstood Dr. Martin Luther King's message was consistent with our \nvalues as Americans. But we know better. We know America was divided--\nsome cheering those students and some cheering the crowds.\n  We learn from experience. I believe in redemption, personal and \npolitical. I think as each of us makes mistakes in our lives, we are \noftentimes given a chance to correct those mistakes. I think when our \nNation has made a mistake, whether it is slavery or racism, we are \ngiven a chance to correct that mistake. Today, as we celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the Little Rock Nine, let us reflect on how far we have \ncome.\n  Melba Patillo Beals, a member of the Little Rock Nine, went on to a \ndistinguished career as a journalist and author. In a book about her \nrole in history, she wrote:\n\n       If my Central High experience taught me one lesson, it is \n     that we are not separate. The effort to separate ourselves--\n     whether by race, creed, color, religion or status--is as \n     costly to the separator as to those who would be separated. \n     The task that remains is to see ourselves reflected in every \n     other human being and to respect and honor our differences.\n\n  The best way we can honor the courage of the Little Rock Nine is to \nfollow their example--to have the vision and the courage to confront \nthe injustices of our time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to express my concern about \namendment No. 3017, the Kyl-Lieberman amendment, which among other \nthings--and most troubling--would designate the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n  I think we all have a great deal of concern about the activities of \nIran. We as a nation have stood strongly and will continue to speak \nstrongly about those activities. We have taken no options off the \ntable. I fully support all of those precepts.\n  At the same time, I do not believe that any serious student of \nAmerican foreign policy could support this amendment as it now exists. \nWe know there are problems in Iraq. We are trying to decipher the \nextent of those problems as they relate to Iranian weapons systems and \nthe allegations of covert involvement. We also know that in Iraq other \nnations are playing covertly. The Saudis, for instance, are said to \nhave the plurality of the foreign insurgents operating in Iraq and the \nmajority of the suicide bombers in Iraq. We also know there is \npotential for volatility in the Kurdish area of Iraq with respect to \nthe relations with Turkey.\n  We are addressing these problems. In fact, the ``whereas'' clauses in \nthis amendment speak clearly as to how our troops on the ground are \naddressing these problems.\n  I fought in Vietnam. We had similar problems throughout the Vietnam \nwar because of the location of Vietnam, the propinquity of China. I \nthink it can fairly be said that in virtually every engagement in which \nI was involved in Vietnam, we were being shot at with weapons made \neither in China or in Eastern Europe. There is a reality to these kinds \nof wars, and we are addressing those realities. But they need to be \naddressed in a proper way.\n  Probably the best historical parallel comes from the situation with \nChina during the Vietnam war. China was a rogue state, had nuclear \nweapons, would spout a lot of rhetoric about the United States, and had \nan American war on its border. We created the conditions in which we \nengaged China aggressively, through diplomatic and economic and other \nmeans. And we have arguably succeeded, along with the rest of the world \ncommunity, in bringing China into a proper place in that world \ncommunity.\n  That is not what this amendment is about. The first concern I have, \nwhen we are talking about making the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a \nterrorist organization, is, who actually defines a terrorist \norganization? The Congress, to my knowledge, has never defined a \nterrorist organization. The State Department defines terrorist \norganizations. At last count, from the information that I have \nreceived, there are 42 such organizations that have been identified by \nthe State Department in accordance with the laws the Congress passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Current List of Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations\n\n     1. Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)\n     2. Abu Sayyaf Group\n     3. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade\n     4. Ansar al-Islam\n     5. Armed Islamic Group (GIA)\n     6. Asbat al-Ansar\n     7.

United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC)\n\n  Mr. WEBB. The second concern I have is that we as a government have \nnever identified an organization that is a part of a nation state as a \nterrorist organization. From the statement of the Senator from \nConnecticut yesterday, there are potentially 180,000 people in the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard who are part of a military force of an \nexisting state. Categorizing this organization as a terrorist \norganization is not our present policy of keeping the military option \non the table. It is for all practical purposes mandating the military \noption. It could be read as tantamount to a declaration of war.\n  What do we do with terrorist organizations? If they are involved \nagainst us, we attack them. What is a terrorist organization? \nTraditionally, we have defined a terrorist organization as a \nnongovernmental entity that operates along the creases of international \nlaw and does harm to internationally protected people.\n  By the way, it is kind of interesting to note that last week the \nIraqi Government claimed that Blackwater is a terrorist organization \nfor the way it operates inside Iraq. I am not making that allegation. I \nam giving an example of how people categorize these groups.\n\n[[Page S12023]]\n\n  The Revolutionary Guard is part of the Iranian Government. If they \nare attacking us, they are not a terrorist organization. They are an \nattacking army. But are they? I am not sure about that. If they were, \nwe would be hearing some pretty strong expressions of support.\n  Last weekend we had Admiral Fallon, who is General Petraeus's \noperational commander, responsible for all of the nations in that \nregion, not simply Iraq, saying:\n\n       I expect there will be no war and that is what we ought to \n     be working for.\n\n  We should find ways through which we can bring countries to work \ntogether for the benefit of all.\n\n       This constant drumbeat of conflict is what strikes me--\n\n  Says Admiral Fallon--\n\n       which is not helpful and not useful . . . I expect there \n     will be no war. . . .\n\n  We have General Petraeus, whose comments are widely quoted in the \n``whereas'' clauses.\n  When he was testifying in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee in \nhis official testimony, he did mention that Iran was using the Quds \nForce to turn Shiite militias into a Hezbollah-like force to fight a \nproxy war, et cetera. But then when he was asked a question about it, \nGeneral Petraeus said: The Quds Force itself, we believe, by and large, \nthose individuals have been pulled out of the country as have been the \nLebanese Hezbollah trainers who were being used to augment that \nactivity.\n  We have the statement of Prime Minister Maliki in today's Washington \nPost. He said: Iran's role in fomenting violence diverges from the \nadministration's. His opinion. His government has begun a dialogue with \nIran and Syria, according to him, and has explained to them that their \nactivities are unhelpful. Our relations with these countries have \nimproved, he said, to the point they are not interfering in our \ninternational affairs.\n  Asked about the Revolutionary Guard forces, which the U.S. military \ncharges are arming, training, and directing Shiite militias in Iraq, \nMaliki said:\n\n       There used to be support through borders for these \n     militias. But it has ceased to exist.\n\n  Now, I am not saying all of this is factually 100 percent right. I am \nnot saying the other side is right. Here is what I am saying: We \nhaven't had one hearing on this. I am on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I am on the Armed Services Committee. We are about to vote \non something that may fundamentally change the way the United States \nviews the Iranian military, and we have not had one hearing. This is \nnot the way to make foreign policy. It is not the way to declare war, \nalthough this clearly worded sense of the Congress could be interpreted \nthis way. These who regret their vote 5 years ago to authorize military \naction in Iraq should think hard before supporting this approach, \nbecause, in my view, it has the same potential to do harm where many \nare seeking to do good.\n  The constant turmoil that these sorts of proposals and acts are \nbringing to the region is counterproductive. They are a regrettable \nsubstitute for a failure of diplomacy by this administration. This kind \nof rhetoric will only encourage the Iranian people to rally around bad \nleadership because of the fear of foreign invasion. Fear of the outside \nis the main glue that authoritarian regimes historically use when they \nface trouble on the inside.\n  Admiral Fallon agrees with this view. The Baker-Hamilton report was \nadamant about the need to engage these nations. The facts of our \neconomy say so. Going back to the beginning of the Iraq war, in the \nfall of 2002, 5 years ago, oil was $25 dollars a barrel; it is $82 a \nbarrel today. The price of gold was below $300, yesterday it was $740.\n  The value of our currency is at an all-time low against the Euro, at \nparity for the first time in 30 years with the Canadian dollar. This \nproposal is Dick Cheney's fondest pipe dream. It is not a prescription \nfor success. At best it is a deliberate attempt to divert attention \nfrom a failed diplomatic policy. At worst it could be read as a \nbackdoor method of gaining congressional validation for military action \nwithout one hearing and without serious debate.\n  I believe this amendment should be withdrawn so we can hold sensible \nhearings and fulfill our duty to truly examine these far-reaching \nissues. If it is not withdrawn, I regrettably intend to vote against \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, sometimes the American people demand that \nCongress and the administration enact initiatives to address \nfundamental national needs. During the Depression, we enacted Social \nSecurity to see that seniors lived their later years with dignity. In \nthe 1940s, we opened the doors to education for returning veterans \nthrough the GI bill. In the 1960s, we took action to see that seniors \nhad quality health care, and the result was Medicare. In the 1990s, \nDemocrats and Republicans, Congress and the administration, States and \nthe Federal Government all worked together to help alleviate the crisis \nin children's health by enacting CHIP.\n  The success of each of these programs has echoed through the decades \nin the lives of millions of Americans. Today, we stand at a crossroads, \nfaced with a choice with a path that will continue and strengthen the \npromise of good health and a strong start in life that CHIP brings to \nmillions of children or whether we will turn away from that promise and \ncurtail the help and the hope CHIP brings.\n  Many of the best ideas in public policy are the simplest. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is based on one simple and powerful \nidea: that all children--all children--deserve a healthy start in life \nand that no parents should have to worry about whether they can afford \nto take their children to the doctor when they are sick.\n  CHIP can make the difference between a child starting life burdened \nwith disease or a child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow. \nThat is why CHIP has always enjoyed bipartisan support. This support \ngoes back\n\n[[Page S12025]]\n\nto 1996 when Massachusetts enacted a State program that became one of \nthe models of CHIP. The Massachusetts Legislature passed a bill to \nexpand coverage for children and paid for it by increasing the tobacco \ntax in the State. When that program was vetoed by Governor Bill Weld, a \nmajority of the Republicans in the State senate stood with the \nDemocrats to override the veto.\n\n  I was proud to work closely with Senator Hatch to create the national \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, and when CHIP went into effect \nacross the country, among its greatest champions were Republican \nGovernors who understood the importance of expanding health insurance \nfor children in their States. Governor Leavitt in Utah and Governor \nCellucci in Massachusetts were both champions of CHIP when they were \nGovernors.\n  The question for President Bush today is why he would even consider \nrejecting a program that has long brought Republicans and Democrats \ntogether to help children.\n  CHIP allows parents to choose insurance for their son or daughter \nfrom a private insurance company. That is one of the reasons \nRepublicans have long supported the CHIP program. Indeed, CHIP used the \nsame private insurance model President Bush supported in creating the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  If Members of Congress and the administration really feel strongly \nthat it is wrong for the Federal Government to support health care \ncoverage, maybe they should start by giving up their own taxpayer-\nsubsidized health care through the Federal employees program. If \nMembers can take their children to the Attending Physician of the \nSenate, with all the benefits that affords, shouldn't all American \nchildren have access to quality health care too?\n  President Bush has argued that CHIP costs too much, but I will tell \nyou what costs more: treating children in emergency rooms after their \nconditions have become severe. CHIP saves money and untold suffering by \ngetting health care to our Nation's children before they are seriously \nill.\n  CHIP is paid for by an increased tax on cigarettes, not by raiding \nthe Treasury. That tax will itself save us countless dollars and lives \nby discouraging smoking. We have had extensive hearings in our human \nresources committee, the HELP Committee, about what happens when the \ncost of cigarettes escalates, and when the cost of cigarettes \nescalates, as included in this CHIP program, it has a dramatic impact \non lessening the demand among teenagers and smoking. What has happened \nfor years is that the industry itself has increased its advertising in \norder to try to hook these children back in. But this has a dramatic \npositive impact from a preventive point of view in helping children not \nbecome addicted to nicotine and cigarette smoking, so it is a win-win \nsituation. It is using the private insurance companies' own model that \nwas initially suggested by the President of the United States in the \nMedicare prescription drug program, and it is being paid not by the \ntaxpayers but by the cigarette users. That will discourage smoking and \nwill have a positive impact on children.\n  The case for CHIP is stronger than ever. Today, 6 million children \nare enrolled in the program, children who otherwise would be without \nhealth care. But there are another 9 million children in America who \nstill have no health insurance at all. Once again, Democrats and \nRepublicans in Congress have come together for the common good.\n  CHIP's success is impressive. Since CHIP began, the percentage of \nuninsured children has gone down even as more and more adults are \nlosing their own insurance coverage because employers reduce it or drop \nit entirely. This chart reflects where it is in terms of the adults and \nthe uninsured, now 47 million Americans who are uninsured. Look at what \nhas happened to children. It has gradually been going down. There is no \nreason not to expect, with this legislation, that it will again go down \nsomewhat. If we had accepted the more extensive House bill, it would \nhave gone down even further. But this is a very significant achievement \nin reducing the number of children who do not have health care \ncoverage.\n  In the past decade, the percentage of uninsured children has dropped \nfrom 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent in 2005. That reduction is \nsignificant, but it is obviously far from enough. This chart indicates \nthe same. If you look at 1997, 22 percent of all children were \nuninsured. Now we are down to 13 percent and going down further. This \nis for children. Yet this President wants to veto this legislation.\n  Recently, the Census Bureau reported in the past year that 600,000 \nmore children have become uninsured. The struggling economy is causing \nemployers to drop family coverage, and even the robust and successful \nCHIP program hasn't been able to stave off decreasing coverage for \nchildren.\n  CHIP helps to improve children's school performance. When children \nare receiving the health care they need, they do better academically, \nemotionally, physically, and socially. Look at this chart. We have \ndemonstrated that when children are healthier, it increases their \nability to learn their lessons. Learning in school is increased \nsignificantly. Look at the before and after in this chart. Before, 34 \npercent paid attention in class; after, 57 percent. Keeping up with \nschool activities: before, 36 percent; after, 61 percent. It is very \nsimple: If a child can't see the blackboard, can't hear the teacher, \ncan't understand what is happening in the classroom, they will lose \nattention and lose their ability to learn. If they have been able to \nhave the kind of preventive health care included in the CHIP program, \nthey are going to be healthier, more interested in learning, and their \nlearning will be enhanced.\n  We just passed education legislation where we went over the \ndisparities that are out there. I will come to that in the next chart, \nbut this is a very clear indication. If you are interested in children \nlearning, CHIP is a program you have to support.\n  Also, CHIP all but eliminates the distressing racial and ethnic \nhealth disparities for minority children who are disproportionately \ndependent upon it for their coverage. Look at this: White, Black, and \nHispanic. This is before CHIP. Look at the numbers--27, 38, and 29. \nWith CHIP, it is 20, 19, and 19. When we have outreach, we see a \nreduction in the disparities. We ought to have this as a goal, our \nnational goal. We want all children to have health care coverage. This \nchart, which is from the Kaiser Family Foundation, indicates that we \nreduce the disparity for children with this CHIP program, which is \nenormously important. They are going to learn more and be healthier.\n  When we put all of that together over a long period of time, it will \nsave the country money because this is going to be a healthier \npopulation. It will cost less over a longer period of time. And we are \npaying for it by an increase in the cigarette tax, not by the taxpayer. \nSo this is enormously important. That is why organizations representing \nchildren and health care professionals who serve them agree that \npreserving and strengthening CHIP is essential to children's health.\n  The Bible tells us to ``open your hand wide to the poor and the needy \nin your land.'' Congregations across the country act on that command \nevery day by providing needed help to those with medical needs in their \ncommunities. They are turning faith into works, but they know they \ncan't do the job alone. That is why religious leaders from all faiths \nhave called upon Congress and the administration to assist in this \nmission by renewing and improving CHIP.\n  Today, we renew our bipartisan commitment to the job begun by \nCongress 10 years ago and to make sure the lifeline of CHIP is \nstrengthened and extended to many more children. Only the Bush \nadministration seems content with the inadequate status quo.\n  First, the President proposed a plan for CHIP that doesn't provide \nwhat is needed to cover the children who are eligible but unenrolled. \nIn fact, the President's proposal is $8 billion less than what is \nneeded simply to keep the children now enrolled in CHIP from losing \ntheir current coverage--$8 billion short. Then, as Congress was \nnegotiating the CHIP bill, the administration issued new guidance that \nwould make it virtually impossible for States to extend coverage for \nchildren in their States with household incomes above 250 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. This would cause 18 States and the District \nof Columbia to drop children from coverage. It doesn't indicate\n\n[[Page S12026]]\n\nthat if the States permit those--that 250 percent of the poverty \nlevel--to be able to participate in the program, they can adjust \npremiums, the copays, and the deductibles in order to make it fair. \nJust a blanket ``no.'' Just a blanket ``no.'' What is most baffling is \nthat the President has consistently threatened this veto.\n  This chart shows what the costs are. This is really an issue of \npriorities. A 5-year CHIP reauthorization, $35 billion; 1 year of \nBush's tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent, $72 billion; and this is 1 \nyear in Iraq, $120 billion. So $35 billion for 5 years for children; 1 \nyear in Iraq, $120 billion.\n  Here is another way of putting it. Around here, we express our views \non priorities, and these are the priorities we have a chance to effect. \nA matter of priorities: the cost of Iraq, $333 million a day; the cost \nof CHIP, $19 million--$19 million to $333 million. We believe this is a \nbargain and something which is absolutely essential if we are going to \nlook down the road at a younger generation that is going to be healthy \nand prosperous and learning. That is going to be key to the United \nStates in terms of our ability to compete worldwide in this knowledge \neconomy. We have to have young people who are gifted, talented, smart, \nand able, with a knowledge of the economy. It is essential if we are to \npreserve our national security and it is essential if we are going to \npreserve the institutions our Founding Fathers bequeathed to us, that \nour young people are able to function and work in order to guarantee \nthe real rights and liberties which we cherish. All of this starts with \nhaving healthy children--healthy children built on the program which \nthe President himself endorsed.\n  I was there at the time the President strongly supported the way we \nwere going to have the Medicare prescription drug program, and he \nfought for that. He was able to successfully gain it. Now he says it is \nunacceptable. Now he says it is unacceptable. He complains about the \ncost. But this doesn't cost the taxpayer a nickel; it will cost in \nterms of an increase in the cost of cigarettes.\n  Finally, these children will be healthier, and therefore the savings \nover the period of years is going to be important and significant.\n  The children of America should not become the latest casualties of \nthis administration. The CHIP bill before us is a genuine bipartisan \nagreement that will help children in communities across the Nation and \nprovide coverage to about 4 million children who would otherwise be \nuninsured. The bill moves us forward together, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  The support this legislation has from Republican Governors as well as \nRepublican members here--particularly my colleague and friend, Senator \nHatch from Utah, Senator Grassley, and others--is commendable. They \nunderstand exactly the reasons and the justification for this \nlegislation. Quality health care for children isn't just an interesting \noption or a nice idea. It is not just something we wish we could do. It \nis an obligation. It is something we have to do, and it is something we \ncan do today. So I will urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.\n  This legislation will be before the House of Representatives this \nafternoon. Hopefully, we will have a strong vote over there and we will \nget that legislation at the earliest possible time.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12026-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12026-S12027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I would like to speak for a moment \nregarding the Hate Crimes Amendment. At a time when our ideals are \nunder attack by terrorists in other lands, it is more important than \never to demonstrate that we practice what we preach, and that we are \ndoing all we can to root out the bigotry and prejudice in our own \ncountry that leads to violence here at home. Now more than ever, we \nneed to act against hate crimes and send a strong message here at home \nand around the world that we will not tolerate crimes fueled by hate.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, we have seen a shameful increase in \nthe number of hate crimes committed against Muslims, Sikhs, and \nAmericans of Middle Eastern descent. Congress has done much to respond \nto the vicious attacks of September 11. We are doing all that we can to \nstrengthen our defenses against hate that comes from abroad. We have \nspent billions of dollars in the war on terrorism to ensure that \ninternational terrorist organizations such as al-Qaida are not able to \ncarry out attacks within the United States. There is no reason why \nCongress should not act to strengthen our defenses against hate that \noccurs here at home.\n  In Iraq and Afghanistan, our soldiers are fighting for freedom and \nliberty--they are on the front line fighting against evil and hate. We \nowe it to our troops to uphold those same principles here at home.\n  Hate crimes are a form of domestic terrorism. They send the poisonous \nmessage that some Americans deserve to be victimized solely because of \nwho they are. Like other acts of terrorism, hate crimes have an impact \nfar greater than the impact on the individual victims. They are crimes \nagainst entire communities, against the whole nation, and against the \nfundamental ideals on which America was founded. They are a violation \nof all our country stands for.\n  We are united in our effort to root out the cells of hatred around \nthe world. We should not turn a blind eye to acts of hatred and \nterrorism here at home. We should not shrink now from our role as the \nbeacon of liberty to the rest of the world. The national interest in \ncondemning bias-motivated violence in the United States is strong, and \nso is our interest in condemning bias-motivated violence occurring \nworld-wide. When the Senate approves this amendment, we will send a \nmessage about freedom and equality that will resonate around the world.\n  Hate crimes violate everything our country stands for. These are \ncrimes committed against entire communities, against the Nation as a \nwhole and the very ideals on which our country was founded.\n  The time has come to stand up for the victims of these senseless acts \nof violence--victims like Matthew Shepard, for whom this bill is named, \nand who died a horrible death in 1998 at the hands of two men who \nsingled him out because of his sexual orientation. Nine years after \nMatthew's death--9 years--we still haven't gotten it done. How long are \nwe going to wait?\n  Senator Smith and I urge your support of this bipartisan bill. The \nHouse has come through on their side and passed the bill. Now it is \ntime for the Senate to do the same. This year, we can get it done. We \ncame close twice before. In 2000 and 2002, a majority of Senators voted \nto pass this legislation. In 2004, we had 65 votes for the bill and it \nwas adopted as part of the Defense authorization bill. But--that time--\nit was stripped out in conference.\n  The President has threatened to veto this legislation, but we can't \nlet that threat stop us from doing the right thing. Let's display the \nsame kind of courage that came from David Ritcheson, a victim of a \nbrutal hate crime that scarred him both physically and emotionally. \nThis spring, David testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He \ncourageously described the horrific attack against him the year \nbefore--after what had been an enjoyable evening with other high school \nstudents near his home in Spring, TX.\n  Later in the evening however, two persons attacked him and one \nattempted to carve a swastika into his chest. He was viciously beaten \nand burned with cigarettes, while his attackers screamed terrible \nepithets at him. He lay unconscious on the ground for 9 hours and \nremained in a coma for several weeks. After a very difficult recovery, \nDavid became a courageous and determined advocate. Tragically, though, \nthis life-changing experience exacted its toll on David and recently he \ntook his own life. He had tried so hard to look forward, but he was \nstill haunted by this brutal experience.\n  My deepest sympathy and condolences go out to David's family and\n\n[[Page S12027]]\n\nfriends coping with this tragic loss. David's death shows us that these \ncrimes have a profound psychological impact. We must do all we can to \nlet victims know they are not to blame for this brutality, that their \nlives are equally valued. We can't wait any longer to act.\n  Our amendment is supported by a broad coalition of 210 law \nenforcement, civic, disability, religious and civil rights groups, \nincluding the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Anti-\nDefamation League, the Interfaith Alliance, the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, the Human Rights Campaign, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. All these \ndiverse groups have come together to say now is the time for us to take \naction to protect our fellow citizens from the brutality of hate-\nmotivated violence. They support this legislation, because they know it \nis a balanced and sensible approach that will bring greater protection \nto our citizens along with much needed resources to improve local and \nState law enforcement.\n  Our bill corrects two major deficiencies in current law. Excessive \nrestrictions require proof that victims were attacked because they were \nengaged in certain ``federally protected activities.'' And the scope of \nthe law is limited, covering hate crimes based on race, religion, or \nethnic background alone.\n  The federally protected activity requirement is outdated, unwise and \nunnecessary, particularly when we consider the unjust outcomes of this \nrequirement. Hate crimes now occur in a variety of circumstances, and \ncitizens are often targeted during routine activities that should be \nprotected. All victims should be protected--and it is simply wrong that \na hate crime--like the one against David Ritcheson--can't be prosecuted \nfederally because it happened in a private home.\n  The bill also recognizes that some hate crimes are committed against \npeople because of their sexual orientation, their gender, their gender \nidentity, or their disability. Passing this bill will send a loud and \nclear message. All hate crimes will face Federal prosecution. Action is \nlong overdue. There are too many stories and too many victims.\n  We must do all we can to end these senseless crimes, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support cloture on this amendment and to support its \npassage as an amendment to the DOD authorization bill.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, King David sang:\n\n       How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in \n     unity!\n\n  When it comes to work here in Congress, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program has been as close to that ideal as a major piece of \nlegislation can be. It began 10 years ago, with Senators working \ntogether across the political spectrum: Senators Orrin Hatch and Ted \nKennedy; Senators John Chafee and Jay Rockefeller. I was proud to have \nbeen part of that.\n  It passed overwhelmingly 10 years ago, and the President signed it \ninto law. It worked.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program brought people together \nacross political divides because CHIP was, and always has been, about \nhelping kids. CHIP has been about helping young Americans who, through \nno fault of their own, live in working families who cannot afford \nexpensive private health insurance. It is about kids. It is about \nhealth. It is about low-income kids.\n  CHIP is about kids going to the doctor. It is about kids having \ncheckups. It is about kids getting vaccinations. It is about kids \nseeing the dentist.\n  Healthy children are more likely to go to school. They are more \nlikely to do well in school. They are more likely to get a good job \nafter school. They are less likely to end up on welfare. They are more \nlikely to become a productive member of the workforce.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program has been a success. Since \n1997, the share of all American children without health insurance \ndropped by a fifth, while the number of uninsured adult Americans \nincreased. For our country's poorest children, the uninsured rate has \ndropped by a third.\n  Governors from both parties support the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Two Presidents of different parties have supported and \nexpanded CHIP.\n  This year, we worked together to improve and extend the program. \nSenators Orrin Hatch and Jay Rockefeller, Chuck Grassley and I worked \nvery closely together, with many meetings, working as hard as we could, \nfocusing on kids. We cooperated in the finest tradition. I thank my \ncolleagues for the hundreds of hours they put into that effort.\n  Some told me: Put CHIP in reconciliation. That is the fast-track \nprocess we use sometimes around here. Some said: Use the fast-track \nbudget process to pass CHIP, so you do not have to get big majorities \nto get things done. You do not have to worry about 60 votes. But I \nsaid: No. CHIP has always been a consensus bill. We would make CHIP a \nconsensus bill again this year. It has in the past. It should always \nbe.\n  That is what we did. The Finance Committee reported the CHIP bill out \nby a vote of 17 to 4, strongly bipartisan. The Senate passed it by a \nvote of 68 to 31. This evening, the House of Representatives will pass \nessentially the same CHIP bill we passed in the Senate.\n  Now it is time for us to pass this bill and send it to the President. \nWhen we do, it will be time for the President to show he is also a \nuniter, he is not a divider but a uniter. It will be a time for the \nPresident to act in the best traditions of compassionate conservatism. \nIt will be a time for the President to sign this bill.\n  Let us show how good and pleasant it can be for Washington to work \ntogether in unity. That is what our people want. That is what the \npeople who sent us here want. They want us working together. They do \nnot like big fights, so long as we are doing what they regard is \nbasically, essentially the right thing. This is that, clearly. So let \nus help get health care to kids who need it, and let us enact this CHIP \nbill into law.\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are amendments to the motion to commit \nwith instructions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Other than those amendments that filled up the tree, there \nare no pending amendments; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are also amendments to the substitute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2997\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are trying to work out a unanimous \nconsent agreement so we can vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nDelaware, hopefully, at 5:30. We are attempting to work out a unanimous \nconsent agreement. We do not have it yet.\n  I will suggest, if the Senator from Delaware is willing, because \nthere is a reasonable chance we are going to get there, that he now \ndescribe his amendment and offer his amendment, and then--he cannot \ntechnically offer it, but he can describe his amendment--and, \nhopefully, we can get a unanimous consent agreement. If we do, he could \nthen technically offer it.\n  So I would suggest that without offering his amendment, the Senator \nfrom Delaware describe his amendment, debate his amendment, in the \nhopes we can get a unanimous consent agreement to vote on that \namendment at 5:30. We do not have it yet, but we are working on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to do that. I see the former \ndistinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee is on the \nfloor. Let me say at the outset how much I appreciate both him and the \nchairman of the committee for making some very constructive suggestions \nas to how to amend my amendment.\n  At the appropriate time, I will call up the amendment and move for \nits modification. But I want to, at the outset, tell the Senator from \nVirginia how much I appreciate his leadership. The truth is, he and I \nhad a fairly extensive colloquy on the floor last week on this \namendment. True to his word, the Senator said he was going to take a \nlook at this amendment, he was seriously interested in it, and he \nwanted to look at it. As is always the case with the Senator from \nVirginia, he kept his word. He not only kept his word, but he improved \nwhat Senator Brownback and I and Senator Boxer and others had come \nforward with. Again, at the appropriate time, I will move to amend \nBiden-Brownback along those lines.\n  But, as I understood it, there was the possibility that if we had \ngotten the unanimous consent agreement, there would be 15 minutes on a \nside. I know a number of people want to speak. I had an opportunity to \nspeak on this amendment at length last week.\n  My distinguished colleague from California, who I must say--and I am \nsure my colleagues will fully appreciate this--we would not have gotten \nto this point were it not for the Senator from California. Her embrace \nof this approach well over a year ago, quite frankly, legitimized this \nin a way on my side of the aisle that no one else, quite frankly, could \nhave done.\n  The fact that it has such, at this point--and, God willing, as my \ngrandfather would say, and the ``crick'' not rising--hopefully, when we \nvote, it will bear out what I am about to say. This has genuine \nbipartisan support but not merely bipartisan support. This has genuine \nsupport that crosses ideological divides as narrow or as wide as they \nare in this body. I think that is a very hopeful sign for the emergence \nof a policy in Iraq that would give us some real opportunity.\n\n  With the Chair's permission and my colleagues' permission, I would \nlike to yield the floor to my colleague from California, if she would \nlike to speak to this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, are we awaiting, hopefully, an agreement \nat this point? We are speaking on the bill in general? Is that where we \nare?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will indulge me for \nabout 5 or 6 minutes while I speak about the Biden-Brownback-Boxer-\nSpecter, and many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \namendment. I wish to say to my colleague from Delaware how much I \nappreciate what he has done. In the face of so much opposition, he has \nkept to this idea that we need to respect the Iraqis enough to \nunderstand the reality of their situation.\n  I remember before we had the vote on whether to go to war, or give \nthe President the authority to go to war, a friend of mine, former \nCongressman John Burton, called me and said: Barbara, I want you to \nread one book before you cast your vote, one book that I think explains \nwhat Iraq is about. That book is entitled ``The Reckoning,'' and it was \nwritten by someone named Sandra Mackey, a historian, in 2002. So I read \nthe book before we voted on whether to give the President authority to \ngo into Iraq. The book detailed how Saddam Hussein egregiously used his \npower as a brutal dictator and a strongman to hold that country \ntogether. She explains the history of Iraq and why the only way to hold \nit together, in her view, was by such a strongman and what a terrible \nreality she came to. She said that after World War I, Iraq was a young, \nfragile country, patched together by the victorious European powers.\n  She wrote:\n\n       Within its artificial boundaries, the Iraqis have lived for \n     eight decades as a collection of competing families, tribes, \n     regions, tongues, and faiths. This complex, multilayered \n     mosaic of Arabs and nonArabs, Muslims, and Christians, is \n     trisected by Iraq's three major population groups, each in \n     possession of a distinct identity; each group dominates a \n     region of Iraq--the Sunnis the center, the Shia the south, \n     the Kurds the north.\n\n  She goes on to conclude:\n\n       Iraq is a state, not a nation. Over the 80 years of their \n     common history, the Iraqis have engaged in the conflicted, \n     and at times convoluted search for a common identity. But \n     Iraqis as a whole have never reached consensus.\n\n  What Senator Biden has understood for several years now, and why I \nwas so interested in supporting him from the very start as a proud \nmember of his Foreign Relations Committee, is we have to deal with the \nIraq we have, not the Iraq we wish we had. If that sounds similar to \nsomeone--I understand that is a similar sentence. But we don't have an \nIraq that we romantically wish we had. After all, as Senator Biden has \nsaid many times, for Iraq to survive and thrive, they have to want \ndemocracy as much as we want it for them. I think that quote by Senator \nBiden has been in my mind since the very start of this war that I did \nnot vote for.\n  So I see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel--a darkness that is \nimpacting our Nation. It is impacting the Senate in a way where we are \nparalyzed. We can't get from A to B; we can't see this light. We can't \ngrab it. We argue over military tactics such as a surge. Our military \nhas done everything we have asked them to do. But every single military \nleader and political leader has told us there is only one solution, and \nit is a diplomatic one. In this very important amendment, what Senator \nBiden and the rest of us are doing is saying, there is a light at the \nend of the tunnel. Look at the Kurds. Look at the Kurdish area. Do my \ncolleagues know, and thank God, we haven't lost one soldier in that \narea. Of the approximately 165,000 soldiers we have there, only 100 \nsoldiers are there.\n  The Kurds are running their own lives. They even fly the Kurdish \nflag. They make their own decisions. I think worth repeating is this \nsolution we are putting before the Senate today--we hope it is today--\nrecognizes the Iraqis will decide this for themselves, that this idea \nis consistent with the Constitution, not outside their Constitution. Of \ncourse, they will be the ones who have to embrace this.\n  But what this amendment does is it says to the world we are ready to \nmove past a military solution. We understand we are not going to have \nlasting\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\npeace when all you have on the table is a gun and bullets. We have to \nput a diplomatic solution on the table.\n  So I am very delighted to have this time now. I don't know if I will \nhave any time later to speak, but I have said what I need to say. I \nthink this is a golden moment for us. I think we could move this debate \nin a better direction, in a direction all of us want to move it, \nwhether we are Republicans or Democrats, whether we voted for the war \nor not. We want to craft some type of political solution. We want a \nroadmap. The Senator from Delaware has given it to us. I am proud to be \na part of this bipartisan group that has cosponsored this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3017\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues, the Senator \nfrom California and the Senator from Delaware. They are making a \nsincere effort to find a way out of this terrible morass we are in, in \nIraq. I can recall 5 years ago when we were called on to vote to give \nan authorization for the use of force to President Bush. It was in \nOctober, before an election a few weeks away, and there were some who \nargued the President would never use that force. There were some who \nargued he would use it immediately. Unfortunately, history has proven \nhe used it in a few months. We now find ourselves enmeshed in a war we \nnever bargained for.\n  That authorization for the use of force said it was for the purpose \nof deposing a dictator and destroying weapons of mass destruction that \nthreatened the United States. The dictator is gone, the weapons of mass \ndestruction never existed. Yet we are still there and 3,800 American \nsoldiers have been killed so far, 30,000 injured, and 10,000 grievously \ninjured. The numbers rise by the day. At one hundred a month, American \nsoldiers die. There is violence on the streets. Attempts to have \nmeetings for cooperation and compromise are cut short by bombs and \nbullets. It is a situation which we never bargained for, and this \nPresident has no concept of how to extricate America from that morass.\n  I call to the attention of the Senate, though, not the Biden-\nBrownback amendment, which I will speak to at a later time but, rather, \nan amendment offered by Senators Lieberman and Kyl. It is an amendment \nwhich relates to a country next to Iraq--Iran. Iran is a dangerous \ncountry. Yesterday, there was a lot of controversy about whether its \nPresident should be allowed to speak at a major university in the \nUnited States. Many argued he should not have. Whatever your opinion on \nwhether he should have been allowed to speak, when it was all said and \ndone, when he had finished his speaking, there was no doubt in my mind \nthat it was pretty clear how radical and unreliable he is. Some of the \nthings he said were preposterous, outrageous, and didn't reflect the \ntruth as we know it, either in the United States, the world, or in his \ncountry of Iran. I can't imagine that President Ahmadi-Nejad won any \nconverts yesterday, but he is the head of a dangerous nation, a nation \nwhich in many respects is moving in directions which the United States \nhas to view very warily.\n  I have joined with Senator Gordon Smith in a bipartisan resolution \napplying economic pressure and diplomacy to change the Iranian policies \nthat might lead to nuclear armaments. I believe that is our first order \nof business and a high priority for the United States. That is why I \njoined him in that resolution. In fact, in the past, I voted for \nresolutions by Senator Lieberman and others acknowledging the potential \nthreat of Iran. I think we should be forewarned that this is a \ndangerous country, until they change their ways and perhaps change \ntheir leadership.\n  I wish to commend to every Senator before the vote on the Lieberman-\nKyl amendment that they take a few moments and read it. There is a \nparagraph in this amendment which I find troubling, if not frightening. \nI wish to read it into the Record. I will concede this is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment and doesn't have the force of law, but I want my \ncolleagues to understand what they are voting for if they decide that a \nvote for the Lieberman-Kyl amendment is a vote against Iran. I will \nread it as follows:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate--\n\n  And now I read from paragraph 4 in the Lieberman-Kyl amendment, and I \nquote verbatim from the latest version I have--\n\n     to support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments \n     of United States national power in Iraq, including \n     diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military instruments, \n     in support of the policy described in paragraph (3) with \n     respect to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and \n     its proxies.\n\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut is on the floor. If this language \nhas been deleted or changed, I hope he will bring to it my attention, \nbecause as written and as read, the language that I have been given is \ntroubling. Conceding this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we are, \nin fact, saying we support the use of military instruments in Iran. \nWhat does that mean? Does that mean we are supporting the invasion of \nIran, that we are supporting military tactics against Iran? Shouldn't \nwe be extra careful in the language of these amendments when we find \nthat the authorization of force for Iraq has dragged us into a war now \nin its fifth year, a war longer than World War II, with bloody and \ndeadly consequences for the United States and innocent Iraqis?\n  I can't vote for this language as read. If it has been changed or \nwill be changed, I am ready to talk, because I certainly have no \ndefense of Iran and its intrigue, its activities, and its plans that we \nunderstand to be the development of nuclear weapons.\n  As I have said, I have joined with Senator Smith encouraging economic \nand diplomatic sanctions against Iran, but this amendment goes beyond \nthat. I repeat:\n\n       (4) to support the prudent and calibrated use of all \n     instruments of United States national power in Iraq, \n     including diplomatic, economic, intelligence, and military \n     instruments, in support of the policy described in paragraph \n     (3) with respect to the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran and its proxies.\n\n  I think this is entirely too expansive. It is dangerous language. \nThose who vote for it are going on the Record for the use of military \npower in a way that I don't think they fully comprehend. Again, if this \nis being changed, if it is going to be changed before the vote, then I \nwill concede that many items before the Senate are works in progress. \nBut as written and as read, I cannot accept this language. I think it \nis a dangerous effort to put us on the record for the use of military \nforce in Iran. Even if we are militarily capable of doing that today--\nand some question whether we are--the simple fact is there is a process \nto call for congressional approval under our Constitution before we \ndeclare war on any Nation. This, unfortunately, takes us down that road \ntoward that goal in a way that I think is unacceptable, and for that \nreason I will oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Biden \namendment, and I hope we are going to proceed with a vote on this \namendment. I am an original cosponsor. I appreciate what Senator Biden \nhas brought forward. He has talked about the semiautonomous region in \nIraq for a long time--for over a year. Mr. President, so have I. I, \ntoo, have written an op-ed piece that says let's look at a long-term \nsolution. I think we saw from General Petraeus in the last couple of \nweeks that we should be so proud of our military and what we have done \nto give security to the Iraqi people. It is not perfect, and it is not \nfinished, but it is so much better than it has been before. Violence is \ndown.\n\n  Mr. President, everybody who has been to Iraq, including myself and \nmost Members of the Senate, can see clearly that American forces \nsecuring Iraq is not a long-term solution. We must have an Iraq that \nhas an economic and a political solution. I don't think you can have a \npolitical solution if you don't have an economy, if people don't have \njobs, if they cannot start small businesses, if they cannot take their \nchildren to school. You are not going to be able to have a long-term \nsolution without the building of an economy and a political base. That \nis why I support this amendment, why I am an\n\n[[Page S12030]]\n\noriginal cosponsor with so many Republicans and Democrats coming \ntogether.\n  When I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ntalking about their view of the war, I differ with them about what we \nshould do militarily. But I do think all of us are coming together to \nsay we should have a long-term solution with fewer American troops in a \nsupport role, not a frontline role. The way to do that is to have an \neconomy and political stability.\n  That is what I think the Biden amendment would suggest. We are not \ntelling the Iraqi people what to do. They passed their own law to \nimplement it. They have a much longer history there than we do. I think \nwe should continue to promote this as a solution. I think we need to do \na few other things in conjunction with this. I think we should work \nmore closely with Iraq's neighbors. I think the Bush administration is \ndoing that now. I think the Secretary of State is doing a great job of \nbringing the neighbors in and saying: You have a stake here, and \ncertainly it is in everyone's interest in the region to have a stable \nIraq that is not a terrorist breeding ground.\n  That should be pursued with the idea that they could also be helpful \nin regions that would work in a semiautonomous way. It is federalism \nwith states that have their own self-governance.\n  Dr. Henry Kissinger, in an appearance before the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations, said:\n\n       I am sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional \n     autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely that this will \n     emerge out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.\n\n  Secretary Kissenger went on to say, in a Washington Post op-ed last \nweek:\n\n       It is possible that the present structure in Baghdad is \n     incapable of national reconciliation because its elected \n     constituents were elected on a sectarian basis. A wiser \n     course would be to concentrate on the three principal regions \n     and promote technocratic, efficient and humane administration \n     in each. . . . More efficient regional government leading to \n     substantial decrease in the level of violence, to progress \n     towards the rule of law and to functioning markets could \n     then, over a period of time, give the Iraqi people an \n     opportunity for national reconciliation.\n\n  Mr. President, our efforts in the Balkans are instructive here. A \nlittle over 10 years ago, from 1992 to 1995, the war in the Balkans \nleft 250,000 people dead and millions homeless. The Dayton Peace \nAccords ended that conflict. The agreement retained Bosnia and \nHerzegovina's international boundaries and created a joint multiethnic \nand democratic government charged with a very narrow power--to conduct \nforeign, diplomatic, and fiscal policy. That is the overarching \nnational government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  There is a second tier of government there now, comprised of two \nentities that are roughly equal in size. The Bosniak/Croat Federation \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republica Srpska. \nThe Federation and the Srpska governments oversee most government \nfunctions. Since the Dayton Peace Accords was signed, the guns of \nBosnia have been silent. More than a million people have returned to \ntheir prewar homes. The success in Bosnia has enabled the number of \nU.S. troops in the region to decline substantially.\n  At the end of 1995, there were 20,000 U.S. combat troops in the \nBosnia region. I visited those troops seven times. The first time I \nwent into Bosnia it was undercover. We had on flack jackets and helmets \nbecause the Serbs were shooting from the hills. In 2006, there were 600 \nAmerican troops in Bosnia. Today, there are no combat troops in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I think this should be a model for Iraq. I think we \ncould have a national government that divides the oil royalties, that \nhas the diplomatic function that represents Iraq internationally, and \nthe national government could be a mixture, as it is today. But then \nyou would have semiautonomous regions. We talked about it. You have \nKurdistan in the north, the Shia area in the south, and the middle \ndoesn't have to be one region. I have heard the disagreements about the \nability to put that middle into one region because there are Shia and \nSunnis in neighborhood to neighborhood. It will be more difficult, but \nit is also the best opportunity for a long-term solution.\n  So why not have smaller units across the middle of Baghdad? Why not \nhave some smaller government with an educational system, with the \nreligious sect that is the majority in that sector?\n  Mr. President, it is so important that we produce more options. Many \nof the best scholars in this country, the best writers in newspapers in \nour country, and many of the best diplomats in our country have said \nthis is a potential solution. Some people in this category have said \nthis isn't our first choice. Our first choice is to be a national \ngovernment that is mixed--that works. That is all of our first choice. \nBut that isn't the choice we have.\n  We have to recognize that we could not mold a country so quickly \nafter thousands of years of strife along ethnic grounds. So we have to \nstep back, in my opinion, and ask what could work to stabilize this \ncountry so that an economic and a political solution will work. With \nall of the people who are now saying this is an option that should be \non the table, I hear people saying, in the end, that is probably the \nway it is going to be. That is where I come in and say: In the end? \nWait a minute. We have a chance to push for leadership now. We have a \nchance to bring the others in the region together now, so that the \nAmerican troops who have done such a wonderful job will have two \nvictories. One is that their mission will be accomplished in the right \nway; two, all of the sacrifices they have made will not be for naught. \nWe cannot walk away from Iraq. We cannot say it is too tough, we are \ngoing to surrender. That would make all of the sacrifices that have \nbeen made irrelevant. We cannot do it that way. But we do have a \npotential solution that can save American lives in the future by \ncutting down the violence right now, by saying if we can step back into \na support role because Iraq is emerging as an economic, political, and \nstable country, then we will have done right by our American troops. We \nwill have done the right thing for future generations of Americans \nbecause we will have stood our ground against terrorists taking over \nIraq, and we will do it expeditiously.\n  We don't need to talk about this anymore. The Iraqis have adopted it \nin their constitution. They have adopted the implementation of the \nlegislation. With some leadership among all of its neighbors in the \nregion, along with the United States and our allies who have given so \nmuch in this cause, we can protect future generations of Americans from \nattacks. We will have built a stable country, which is what we said we \nwanted to do when we went in to take out Saddam Hussein, who was \nabusing his people.\n  Mr. President, some may call for surrender, but that is not the \nanswer. The answer is to promote a real solution that is a long-term \nsolution; that is, allowing the Iraqis to draw their own regions, where \nthey can grow an economy and a government that works along the Bosnian \nmodel, and we will be able to stay strong and do the right thing and \nlisten to what people are saying. But that doesn't mean we have to wait \nand say, oh, that is what is going to happen in the end. Well, how many \nAmerican lives are going to be lost between now and the end? Let's \nallow our American troops to take the support role instead of the \nfrontline role, as General Petraeus has started so ably. Let's do what \nis right for the Iraqi people and the Middle East region as well \nbecause a terrorist haven is not in anyone's interest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment of which I am a \ncosponsor, along with a solid Republican and Democratic list of Members \nwho are willing to stand up and say we want this war to end honorably, \nwe want to complete the mission honorably, and we can do it in the \nright way. And that is to allow them to create their government, which \nwould have a national overlay. The time is now, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand there is no time agreement; is \nthat right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to speak with respect to the Biden \namendment. I listened carefully to the Senator from Texas, and I must \nsay I\n\n[[Page S12031]]\n\nagreed with a lot of what she said. One thing I violently disagreed \nwith was the notion at the end where she said some may call for \nsurrender. I have not heard any U.S. Senator call for surrender. I \nthink that is part of the sloganeering and talk, unfortunately, that \nhas characterized some of the divisions as people try to find a \nsensible way of finding success.\n  There are different views about how you find success here. The notion \nof setting a date and requiring leverage out of the Iraqi Government to \ndo what it is not doing today is an alternative way of getting them to \nmake those decisions and be successful in this endeavor. It is also, in \nthe view of many people in the Senate, a more effective way of \nsupporting the troops, of honoring their sacrifice with a policy that \nwe believe can actually achieve what their sacrifice is being made for.\n\n  I caution colleagues about falling into the easy terminology about \n``choosing to lose,'' ``surrender,'' ``walking away,'' and so forth. \nWhen we leave the President of the United States discretion, as the \nLevin-Reed and other Senators', myself included, amendment did, you are \nleaving the President the discretion to continue to fight al-Qaida, you \nare leaving the President the discretion to finish standing up the \nIraqi troops with training that is necessary to do that, and you are \nleaving the President full discretion to protect American forces and \nfacilities and interests. What other purpose could there be to be in \nIraq 5\\1/2\\ years after the start of war, which is when the date would, \nin fact, have cut in to leverage their change?\n  That is not what we are here; in some ways, that is what we are here \nto debate. Specifically, that is not what we are debating about now \nbecause this is a Biden amendment which is a different amendment. I \nwish to speak to it for a moment.\n  I have resisted what has previously been put forward as a partition \nplan because I don't think the United States of America can just walk \nin and ``partition.'' I think that would, in fact, smack of precisely \npart of the ingredients that have created the problem we inherited. \nThat is what Winston Churchill and the British did shortly after the \nturn of the last century. The result was that they drew a lot of \nartificial lines between different people and created a state that \nnever existed before, and we are inheriting some of the long-term \nimpact and realities of those decisions. So we cannot come in and just \npartition it, which is why for over 3 years or more I have been pushing \nfor a standing conference, a summit, a peace conference which brings \nthe permanent five and the neighbors and the Iraqi factions that are \nstruggling all to the table simultaneously to work through diplomacy in \norder to arrive at an understanding of how they can go forward.\n  Diplomacy has always been the key to trying to find a political \nsettlement in Iraq. It has been absent. One of the reasons I am now a \ncosponsor of this different amendment by Senator Biden and others is \nthat it does not specifically seek to partition. Not for the long term, \ncertainly, and not even in the short term does it seek to partition. \nWhat it seeks to do is honor what is already in the Iraqi Constitution \nas well as recognize the realities that have developed on the ground.\n  Some 2 million-plus people have been displaced out of the country, \nsome 1.1 million people are displaced within the country, and there has \nbeen an ethnic cleansing taking place over the course of the last few \nyears that has resulted, for instance, in the city of Baghdad \ntransitioning from a city that at the beginning of the war was 65 \npercent Sunni to now it is 75 percent Shia, and the south is almost \nexclusively Shia, and the Sunni triangle is the Sunni triangle, with \nsome exceptions, obviously. We know there are intermarriages. There are \nsome pockets of places where there are still larger populations of \neither Sunni or Shia living in a larger either Sunni or Shia surrounded \narea.\n  But the bottom line is this: There has been a huge shifting of \npopulations according to ethnic lines that has taken place. There also \nis an awareness that there is fundamentally a failed government, almost \nfailed state. Everyone, from President Bush to Prime Minister Maliki to \nGeneral Petraeus, everybody involved with this at a decisionmaking \nlevel has acknowledged that there is no military solution, there is \nonly a political solution. So if there is no military solution and \nthere is only a political solution, what is the political solution? \nClearly, the political solution--because we have seen over the last \n4\\1/2\\ years it is not going to be immediately, maybe down the road but \nnot immediately--to have a strong central functioning government that \nsomehow has the ability to work through the differences of Shia and \nSunni divisions with a police that is dysfunctional and an army that is \nlargely Shia.\n  One of the reasons the Sunni in Anbar have decided to fight al-Qaida \nand to join forces now is because they are being armed and trained and, \nin effect, are being put in a position to be able to defend their own \ninterests within that region. They made a political decision before \nthere was any military decision. The political decision they made was \nthat they were tired of al-Qaida literally killing their children and \nabusing their villages. They made the political decision that they \nwould be better off creating this power base of their own within the \nregion, being trained, getting weapons, creating a Sunni capacity to \nrespond and defend themselves. So the violence has, indeed, gone down, \nand al-Qaida has been diminished in its efforts in that region.\n  We have to look at what happened. It was a political decision that \npreceded the presence of surge troops, escalated--whatever you want to \ncall it--and that political decision has resulted in a transition. But \nthere is nothing on the table that indicates the willingness or \ncapacity of the central Government in Baghdad to make a similar kind of \npolitical decision for the Sunni with respect to the differences \nbetween Sunni and Shia.\n  Similarly, you cannot make the difference with respect to the Kurds, \nwho are essentially sitting up there in the north, independent of the \nrest of what is happening between Sunni and Shia, dealing with their \nown issue with Turkey and their own issue with some of the dislocation \nthat took place in Kirkuk and elsewhere.\n  What the Biden amendment does is honor, respect, and build on this \nreality which has developed on the ground. It takes the reality of an \nelection, which was built on fundamental mistakes by our Government, by \nthe Provisional Authority in the beginning that has created a \nfundamentally sectarian electoral base from which the decisionmaking is \nnow being made which does not adequately and fully represent the \ninterests that have to be reconciled in the end.\n  So the way you get from here to there, which is the big question--how \ndo you get from here to there--is through the diplomatic focus that is \nin this amendment. It calls on the international community to come \ntogether in the standing conference that many of us have talked about \nfor several years, and it calls on that conference to recognize these \nrealities and begin to build the local capacity. The Iraqis will decide \nin what structure, how many regions, or what those regions are.\n  There is a complete respect for the sovereignty of Iraqis to make \nthese decisions. What it does is encourage the effort of Americans to \npush in that direction and to create the awareness that may well be the \nbest, most effective, most realistic, fastest way of pulling parties \ntogether to represent the interests that are not currently adequately \nrepresented within the governing process of Iraq, which is why they \ncannot reach a resolution.\n\n  It is not that Iraqi politicians are not, frankly, tough enough to \nmake that decision; it is that their constituencies do not want them to \nmake that decision. That is the fundamental problem. The Shias are \nfundamentally committed to a Shia Islamic state, and they are not going \nto give up that notion when they do not have to, and they do not have \nto because they have been told that 130,000 American troops are going \nto be there well into next summer, and we will be right where we were \nlast year when the country almost fell apart after all of this effort.\n  If you have that kind of guarantee on the table, what leverage is \nthere to make you change in a negotiation? What leverage is there if \nyour real goal is to have a Shia Islamic state if 60 percent of the \npopulation has now been given at this unfair ballot box a power\n\n[[Page S12032]]\n\nthey could never achieve in 1,300 years of history in their \nrelationship with Sunni and Shia? If they have suddenly been given \nthat, what is going to make that 60 percent just give it up? They are \nnot about to. And the 20 percent Sunni, many of whom are in the state \nof this insurgency, are sitting there saying: We understand that; \ntherefore, we are not going to be adequately represented, and because \nwe are not going to be adequately represented, we are going to continue \nto fight. There is no ingredient that changes that equation unless you \nget this kind of diplomacy and this kind of recognition of some of \nthese realities on the ground.\n  One wise observer of the region said to me the other day--a former \nAmbassador who has written much about Iraq and thought about it a lot--\nthey may just have to live apart before they can live together now in \nsome of these places.\n  That is not our goal for the long run. This doesn't destroy the idea \nof a national identity of Iraq. It doesn't undo that. It honors their \nown Constitution, which respects the notion of federalism. It allows \nfor those entities to be defined by the Iraqis as to how they share the \ninterests within those particular regions on which they decide. It \nalso, obviously, calls on an oil law to ultimately be the linchpin of \nthese kinds of political opinions because if they don't divide the \nrevenues, there is no way, ultimately, you will be able to resolve \nthese huge sectarian differences.\n  I believe this amendment offers us a way forward. I have said since \nday one, back in 2004 when I was running nationally, I said then that \nthis could be one of the solutions, the idea of division and federalism \nif the Iraqis decide on it. The only way to get to that point is to \nhave the adequacy of diplomacy.\n  For months, we have talked--the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, \nSenator Lugar, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Hagel, and others--we have all talked about the need to get \nthis adequate diplomacy going, and that is a central component of this \nsense-of-the-Congress amendment which Senator Biden is offering. We all \nknow we cannot impose a solution on the Iraqis, and this amendment does \nnot do that. We all know we cannot just walk in and divide up the \ncountry. This amendment does not do that. This respects the sovereignty \nof the Iraqis, and it respects the notion that Iraq is right now a \nfailing state with a barely functioning central government that has not \nto date proven its capacity to be able to reconcile the fundamental \ndifferences over which the civil war is being fought. In fact, Iraq was \nrecently ranked as the second weakest state in the world, second only \nto the Sudan. Nothing the Government in Baghdad does in the foreseeable \nfuture is going to change that reality.\n  I believe this approach has the best opportunity to try to provide \nsome of that stability, to help, to work, to buy time, to bring in the \ninternational community, to get the Perm Five and the neighbors and \nothers working toward the longer term solution which this resolution \nalso recognizes is important.\n  We need to change the mission, yes, and I have voted to do that and \nworked hard with the Senator from Michigan and others to do it. I still \nbelieve we need a firm deadline because without it, I don't believe we \nhave leverage. And in the absence of leverage, we certainly are not \ngoing to get these kinds of reconciliations and compromises that are \nnecessary.\n  Senator Biden's amendment recognizes that these are not mutually \nexclusive at all. We can push for those other things and still push for \nthis sense-of-the-Congress amendment because accepting federalism, in \nfact, makes it easier to change the mission and makes it easier to \nallow the vast majority of our troops to leave a reasonably stable Iraq \nwhen they do finally leave.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I support this amendment, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same. I congratulate the Senator from \nDelaware for his efforts on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to make it clear that I am inclined \nto support this amendment also.\n  Momentarily, the distinguished Senator from Delaware is going to move \nto amend the pending amendment at the desk, to reflect some corrections \nand alleviate some concerns I and other colleagues have. But I wish to \nmake it eminently clear this is not a mission amendment. This is along \nthe lines of the need for greater diplomatic involvement.\n  As a matter of fact, I can look back a year or so when my colleague \nwas standing at that very desk and we had an amendment at that time on \nthe previous authorization bill that he felt very strongly about. As a \nmatter of fact, we gave it consideration at that time. It did not \neventually become the law. Or in some respects it did.\n  Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend from Virginia we actually passed my \namendment that did require the international effort we are talking \nabout. Regrettably, we are a year later, and that international \nleverage has still not come to fruition, so I am delighted now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, I wanted to reflect that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was on this very point some time back, and now I \nthink the realization is that, momentarily, we will have the \nopportunity to vote on this. I would not predict the outcome, but I \nthank him very much for his contributions.\n  I wonder if I could invite our colleague from Delaware, given there \nis some likelihood that we can get the UC to have a vote, if he might \nwant to amend his amendment at this time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before I do that, I would like to ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have now been informed there is some \nobjection to any amendments at this point in time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I don't believe there is an \nobjection to the amendment. I think it is not in order at this moment \nto offer the modification.\n  Mr. WARNER. In any event, at this point we will not seek to do the \namendments, for whatever technical reason there may be, but I would \nlike to do it when we can get to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not bring up the amendment or amend \nit now, but because time is of the essence for a lot of our colleagues, \nI wish to speak to what the changes are that were recommended by \nSenator Warner and others.\n  But before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves the floor, I wish to \nsay to him--and I hope it will not in any way cause him any \ndifficulty--he and I have been close friends for over 30 years, and I \nwant him to know, and I want my colleagues to know, that much of what \nthis amendment we are hopefully going to vote on is about is what the \nSenator and I have talked about for the last 4 years and that he has \nled on, including the international piece.\n  As a matter of fact, he led on it from a different perspective, as a \ncandidate, as well. So I wish to tell him how grateful I am for his \njoining in this amendment. Quite frankly, it is a big deal that he is, \nand it adds not only credibility to the amendment in terms of our \ncolleagues, but it adds, quite frankly, an international credibility to \nit because an awful lot of people around the world look to my colleague \nfor his insights into what we do about the most critical issue facing \nAmerican foreign policy today.\n  The truth is, in order for us to regain the kind of leadership in the \nworld that I would argue we are lacking, we have to settle Iraq, and we \ncannot do it on our own. There is a need for the international \ncommunity. Even if this answer is the perfect answer, it cannot be made \nin America any longer.\n  So I wish to thank my colleague and acknowledge that I have learned \nfrom him, and I wish to thank him for--and I know we use the phrase \nvery blithely around here--his leadership. But I mean that. I wish to \nthank him for his leadership. He has been absolutely totally consistent \non this point from before the time we actually used force in Iraq until \ntoday. So I want the record to reflect that.\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting to determine whether we are going \nto be able to proceed on the amendment, I think the concerns raised by \nseveral of my friends have been incorporated in\n\n[[Page S12033]]\n\nthe changes that have been made. I am not moving to amend it now, but I \nam going to tell my colleagues what the Biden-Brownback amendment will \nbe.\n  In the findings clauses, finding No. (3) has been added, and it is to \nreflect the concern raised by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl--and I suspect others, but Senator Kyl is the one who \nraised this with us, in that he wanted to make it clear--\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. I brought it to your attention at \nthe request of Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We incorporated the exact language I was originally given, \nwith the advice of my colleague from Virginia, and it says:\n\n       A central focus of al-Qaida in Iraq has been to turn \n     sectarian division in Iraq into sectarian violence through a \n     concentrated series of attacks, the most significant being \n     the destruction of the Golden Dome.\n\n  So that is one change, one addition we made. A second change we made \nwas at the request, I believe, and I would stand corrected, of both the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, which \nwas deleting a word. It says:\n\n       Iraq must reach a comprehensive and sustainable political \n     settlement in order--\n\n  No, that is not true. I am getting the wrong section. I will ask my \nstaff what the second change is, and I will go to the third change. The \nreason I can't find the change is because we took out the word, and I \nam trying to recall where we took the word out.\n  The third thing we changed is the provision in the original \nresolution to incorporate the strongly held view of the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee that we not be forcing upon Iraq anything that \nis inconsistent with their wishes. The paragraph originally read:\n\n       The United States should actively support a political \n     settlement in Iraq based upon the final provisions of the \n     Constitution of Iraq that create a federal system of \n     government and allow for certain federal regions consistent \n     with the wishes of the Iraqi people and their elected \n     leaders.\n\n  And then, I believe at the request or suggestion of the distinguished \nranking member from Virginia, the actual last paragraph of the \nresolution, paragraph 5, says:\n\n       Nothing in this act should be construed in any way to \ninfringe on the sovereign rights of the Nation of Iraq.\n\n  Again, both my colleagues can explain their motivation better than I, \nbut the central point that is attempted to be achieved is to make it \nclear that neither Senator Brownback nor I, nor any of the cosponsors, \nbelieve we should be imposing a political solution on the Iraqi people. \nIt is sort of self-evident to me that you cannot impose a political \nsolution. A political solution has to be arrived at by the competing \nparties. I would argue, as I think my colleagues in the Armed Services \nCommittee would agree now, that what we are doing is consistent with \nIraq's Constitution and consistent with the ability of the Iraqis to \nfurther amend their Constitution to come to a different conclusion.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield for the purpose of my \ncommenting on this.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be delighted to yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Paragraph 5 is the language recommended by the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Incidentally, Senator McCain is the ranking member. I had that job \noff and on for 18 years.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am sorry. I am so used to the Senator being chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wished to reflect that my colleague, Senator McCain, is \nthe distinguished ranking member.\n  But I put in paragraph 5, because this is a very challenging \namendment, and I wanted to make certain that in no way did we overstep \non the question of sovereignty. The word ``sovereignty'' is well \ndescribed in international law and in other means as an accepted term, \nand it is well understood, so I am delighted the Senator agreed to put \nthat in.\n  Lastly, when we look at the enormity of the sacrifices of our country \nover these many years now--most notably the tragic loss of some 3,000, \nalmost 3,800 individuals and many more wounded, and expenditures of so \nmuch of the taxpayers' funds--the contributions of all of that has \ngotten us to where we are today. The keystone of those achievements is \nthe sovereignty that has been given to the Iraqi people. That is the \nmajor contribution of the enormity of our sacrifice through these \nyears. So in no way did we want to backstep from all of this hard-\nfought ground to achieve sovereignty for the Iraqi people.\n  So I am delighted the Senator accepted that. Then, if we can look at \none other paragraph, Senator, and that was on page 2, paragraph (4), \nthe Senator was going to consider deleting the word ``increasing'' \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BIDEN. As I understand, the distinguished ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar, suggested that instead of \n`` . . . Iraqis to reach such a settlement is a primary cause of \nincreasing violence in Iraq,'' he wished the word ``increasing'' be \nstruck from the language. It now reads: `` . . . settlement is the \nprimary cause of violence in Iraq.''\n  So we have struck that. To the best of my knowledge, I say to my \nfriend from Virginia, I think we have accommodated all the changes that \nwere suggested.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first going to paragraph (4), deleting \n``increasing'' and the concern of the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Lugar, it was also a concern to the Department of State. So \nthat has been done.\n  All the concerns that have been brought to this Senator's attention, \nthe Senator from Virginia, I think have been met by the Senator from \nDelaware, and it is for that reason I am pleased, if and when we get to \nthe vote, to cast a vote in favor of this because I think it is an \nimportant amendment.\n  Also, if I may say, it reflects a goal that I and many others have \nhad for a long time; namely, to have a showing of some bipartisanship. \nI am hopeful this will draw votes from not only your side of the aisle \nbut this side of the aisle, and it can be viewed as a truly bipartisan \namendment. Certainly, you have distinguished cosponsors on it, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Hutchison, Senator Specter, and others, so I believe \nit will be viewed as a bipartisan amendment. And that in and of itself \nis an important contribution to this debate all around.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I see the chairman has risen. Does he wish \nto speak?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to briefly thank and commend the \nSenator from Delaware for his ongoing leadership in a very critical \narea, and that is the area of federalism in Iraq. He has made it clear \nin his amendment, he has made it clear in his remarks that the \nfederalism he is referring to is the federalism which the Iraqis have \nplaced in their Constitution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is no effort here to impose our view of federalism \nor an outside view of federalism on the Iraqis. It is their view of \nfederalism, reflected in their own Constitution, that the Senator has \nviewed as a real potential solution to the violence in the provinces in \nIraq.\n  So I wish to thank the Senator from Delaware, and perhaps at this \npoint, if I could get the attention of the Senator from Delaware, in \norder to save time later, he and I have entered into a colloquy which \ndoesn't need to be made part of the Record at this time, it could be \nput in the Record after the amendment is modified.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that after the amendment is modified to \nhave printed in the Record a colloquy between myself and the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the colloquy which we will offer then at a \nlater time refers to two changes that have been made, or will be \noffered to the amendment by the Senator from Delaware, modifying his \nown amendment, which he has a right to do.\n  The first suggestion I made, which he has readily accepted, is to \nmake it clear the federalism that is being referred to in his language \nis the federalism in the Iraqi Constitution as it now reads or as it \nmay be amended. In\n\n[[Page S12034]]\n\nthe event that the Iraqis' constitutional commission makes \nrecommendations on that subject, and if those recommendations are \naccepted by the people, it is their view of federalism, in the current \nConstitution or in an amended Constitution, the word he added being \n``final,'' that he is referring to. I thank him for that.\n\n  Also, I thank him for accepting language which makes it clear that \nthe federalism he is referring to is a system of government that allows \nfor the creation of Federal regions. The words that are now added, or \nwould be added when it is modified are ``consistent with the wishes of \nthe Iraqi people and their elected leaders.''\n  The reason I propose that is we have to be very clear that what the \nSenator from Delaware is focusing on is a Federal system which the \nIraqi people either have adopted or will adopt. This is something \nconsistent with their wishes, not ours. What we wish them to do is get \non with their solutions, their political solutions. What the Senator \nfrom Delaware is so properly focusing on, and I think this Nation \nshould be in his debt for it, is the potential of a Federal system as \nthey designed it for addressing their problems.\n  We have seen the value of federalism here, but it is not our version \nof it that the Senator is talking about. It is the idea of federalism \nand how you are able to adjust powers between the central government \nand regions which has such potential for finally ending the violence in \nIraq. He recommends it. We all, I hope, will support that as being a \npotential solution--not imposed on them but one which they have \nfashioned in their own Constitution, have adopted in their own \nConstitution, can amend in their own Constitution. That, it seems to \nme, is a very valuable contribution for which I commend the Senator.\n  He can offer, on our behalf, a colloquy at the appropriate time \nrelative to the modification when it is offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I wanted to clarify one thing. Through no fault of the \nSenator from Delaware--he was under the impression that certain \nlanguage he agreed to, to change his resolution, had come from me, and \nhe had reason to believe that. It did not come from me, but that is not \nhis mistake. But I did want to clarify the record that the language \nthat he had agreed to had not been language that came from me. For \nreasons I will not go into at this point, I still have concerns about \nthe resolution as a result. But it is not the fault of the Senator from \nDelaware that he was under the impression that it was language from me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand. The Senator is correct; I was \nunder a misimpression.\n  As I understand it, for our colleagues here--and I say to my \ncolleague from Michigan, the chairman, I understand it would \naccommodate other Senators if we were to set a time certain to vote \ntomorrow morning on this amendment and, I guess, I don't know, the \nLieberman amendment--Lieberman/Kyl. I don't know that. But if it is at \nall possible, I know it should not be a consideration of the Senate and \nobviously whatever the Senate's will I would abide by it, but it would \nbe very helpful to me as a practical matter--there are these pesky \nlittle Presidential debates that intervene and there is one tomorrow in \nNew Hampshire. If it accommodates the body I would be delighted to do \nit this evening, but if we could consider doing it at 10 o'clock in the \nmorning, it would be very much appreciated by the Senator from \nDelaware--if that is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the situation the Senator has stated is \nunder consideration by the leadership at this very moment and I am \nhopeful the body can be informed shortly with respect to the leaders' \nwishes with respect to time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2952, as Modified; 2870, 2917, 2973, 2095, 2975, 2951, \n2978, 2956, 2932, 2979, 2943, 2982, 2981, 2158, 2977, 2962, 2950, 2969, \n3021, 2920, 2929, 2197, 2290, 2936, 3007, 2995, 3029, 2980, 3023, 3024, \n     2963, 3030, as Modified; 3044, to amendment No. 2011, en bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send a series of 34 amendments to the \ndesk, which have been cleared by myself and the ranking member. \nTherefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider those \namendments en bloc, the amendments be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid on the table, and I ask that any statements relating \nto any of these individual amendments be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2952, as Modified\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 827.

No, I do not. I would say to the leader, that is good for \nour Members to know. We have Members who have been inquiring whether \nthey will be able to vote.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say this: One thing I have done is, anytime I know \nthere is going to be no votes, Senator McConnell is the first to know. \nIf there is a Monday we are not going to have votes, I let everybody \nknow; nighttime vote. I think that has worked pretty well. There are no \nsurprises.\n  Now, sometimes things just do not work out. But anytime we decide, on \nthis side, the majority, there are not going to be votes, Senator \nMcConnell knows. That is an arrangement I made with him.

Mr. President, for the last several months I have been \ncoming to the floor with some frequency to speak about the tragic \nevents in Darfur. That ongoing humanitarian crisis is a constant \nreminder of how many in this world still live under tragic \ncircumstances and brutal governments.\n  Yet the human spirit continues to fight for change, even under these \ndifficult conditions, something that has been so movingly evident in \nthe recent days in the country of Burma. During the last week, the \nworld has watched as thousands of Burmese have peacefully called for \npolitical change in one of the world's most repressive countries. \nReuters reported today that 10,000 Buddhist monks continue to march \nthrough the largest city, Rangoon, chanting ``democracy, democracy.''\n  The streets are lined with between 50,000 to 100,000 clapping, \ncheering supporters. I speak today to lend my support to these peaceful \nprotests and call on the Burmese military to immediately begin working \nwith Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and U.N. Envoy Ibrahim Gambari \nto bring about a peaceful transition to real democracy in Burma. It \nshould also unconditionally release all political prisoners.\n  I also call on the Government of China to use its special \nrelationship with the Burmese Government to constructively foster these \nlong overdue changes. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security \nCouncil, China has a particular responsibility to take action and to do \nit rapidly.\n  Sadly, this tragedy has been going on for way too long. Following \ndecades of totalitarian rule, the Burmese people,\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\nin 1998, began widespread protests for greater democracy, 9 years ago.\n  The military responded by seizing power and brutally suppressing the \npopular movement. Two years later, the military government allowed \nrelatively free elections. Aung San Suu Kyi, despite being under house \narrest, led her National League for Democracy Party to an overwhelming \nvictory that captured more than 80 percent of the seats in Parliament. \nYet to this date, 16 years later, the military has refused to recognize \nthe sweeping democratic mandate by the Burmese people. Sixteen years \nafter a landslide victory, they still wait for the results of the \nelection to be followed.\n  Can any one of my colleagues in the Senate even imagine being so \nbrazenly denied representation. Following the vote, those elected from \nher party attempted to take office. The military responded by detaining \nhundreds of members of the Parliament-elect and other democracy \nactivists. Many remain under arrest even today, with estimates of well \nover 1,000 political prisoners. Conditions for these prisoners are \nhorrible. Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for the majority \nof the last 16 years.\n  During the last two decades, the Burmese military has created an \nOrwellian state, one where simply owning a fax machine can lead to a \nharsh prison sentence. Government thugs beat a Nobel laureate for \nsimply speaking in public. Forced labor and resettlement are \nwidespread. Government-sanctioned violence against ethnic minorities, \nrape and torture are rampant.\n  The military suddenly moved the capital 300 miles into the remote \ninterior out of fear of its own people, and the state watches over all \naspects of daily life in a way we thought was almost forgotten in \ntoday's world.\n  Under military rule the country has plunged into tragic poverty and \ngrowing isolation. The educational and economic systems have all but \ncollapsed. The military is hidden under the facade of a prolonged \nconstitutional drafting process that is a sham.\n  The junta has no intention of ever allowing a representative \ngovernment. All the while, it displays its naked fear of its own people \nas it keeps Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. It is understandable \nthat the Burmese people are demanding change. Even after Suu Kyi's \nhusband Michael Aris was diagnosed with cancer in London in 1997, the \nmilitary would not allow him to visit his wife. The junta would allow \nher to leave Burma to visit him but, undoubtedly, would never let her \nreturn.\n  She refused to leave because of her dedication to the Burmese people. \nSadly, her husband, Michael Aris, died in 1999 without having seen his \nwife for more than 3 years. Leaders from around the world have spoken \nin support of her and about the need for change in Burma. Presidents \nGeorge Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as Senators Feinstein and McCain, \nhave all voiced repeated concerns. Earlier today, my colleague, Senator \nMcConnell, shared similar concerns on the floor of the Senate.\n  In 1995, then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright became \nthe first Cabinet level official to visit Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma \nsince the original Democratic upheavals. Later, as Secretary of State, \nshe continued to advocate for change in Burma, at one point saying its \ngovernment was ``among the most repressive and intrusive on earth.''\n\n  The sweeping calls for change are truly global. South African \narchbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu and former Czech President \nVaclav Havel have called on the U.N. to take action in Burma.\n  In December 2000, all living Nobel Peace laureates gathered in Oslo \nto honor fellow laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. In May of this year, the \nNorwegian Prime Minister released a letter he organized with 59 former \nheads of state from five continents calling for her release and the \nrelease of all Burmese political prisoners. Now thousands of \nextraordinarily brave Burmese monks and everyday citizens are filling \nthe streets of Burma. They are saying it is time for peaceful change. \nIn recent days, the monks even reached Suu Kyi's heavily guarded home \nwhere witnesses said she greeted them at her gate in tears.\n  One need only look at the dramatic images being shown on television \nand on the front pages of newspapers around the world to see the \nbravery and dignity of these peaceful protesters.\n  This is a Reuters photograph. It is so touching to look at this \ndemonstration in Burma, monks and supporters literally risking their \nlives fighting for democracy, fighting for the release of Aung San Suu \nKyi and the Burmese prisoners. We are hoping this force in the streets, \na force for peace, a force for change, will prevail. We salute their \ncourage, and let the Burmese military know they can't get by with this \nforever. I want the Burmese people to know the world knows what is \nhappening in their country. There is strong support in the Senate among \nRepublicans and Democrats for peaceful change and democratic \ngovernment. To those in Burma fighting for peaceful democratic change, \nour message is simple--we are with you. I call on the Burmese military \nto immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and all Burmese political \nprisoners, to respect peaceful protests of its own citizens, and begin \na timely transition to democratic rule. The eyes of the world are \nwatching.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12043-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12043-S12044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this is now day 14 of debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill. It is day 14 of the current debate. We have all \nbeen on this bill for a good number of days previously earlier this \nyear. During the same time that we have been debating this for the past \n14 days and over the course of the several months that have languished \nin between our last debate on Defense authorization, we have commanders \nand troops in the field who have been fighting bravely our terrorist \nenemies and fulfilling their mission with courage and professionalism.\n  By contrast, we in the Senate are redebating old arguments and \nrevoting on amendments that have previously been rejected. In fact, \nlast week most of the amendments offered by our colleagues on the \nDemocratic side had previously been voted on, and the result this time \naround was essentially the same as the result when we voted on these \namendments previously. In fact, we voted now for the second and third \ntime on arbitrary withdrawal dates, on cutting off funding for our war \nefforts, on changing the mission from that recommended by our \ncommanders, and on other attempts to micromanage our war efforts from \nthe floor of the Senate. Now we may be forced to vote on hate crimes \nlegislation which has no relevance to or place in the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Congress should not and Congress cannot legislate our war strategy, \nnor do we have the expertise or constitutional authority to micromanage \nthe war. American generals in Iraq, not politicians in Washington, \nshould decide how to fight this war.\n  I don't condemn my colleagues for a minute for their legitimate Iraq \npolicy positions. As Senators, we have the right to offer amendments. \nBut again, this is not the time to abandon our military efforts in Iraq \nor to attempt to micromanage our military strategy from thousands of \nmiles away. The current Iraq policy debate taking place on the Defense \nauthorization bill has already dangerously delayed this critical \nlegislation. We all support our troops. This bill contains critical \nprovisions that directly support our men and women in uniform.\n  Specifically, while we have been redebating and revoting on \namendments for the second and third time, the Defense authorization \nbill waits for final action. What does it do? This bill directly \nsupports our men and women in uniform. It increases the size of the \nArmy and the Marine Corps. It provides increased authorization to \npurchase more Mine Resistant Ambush Protected armored vehicles, \notherwise known as MRAPs, which will save more lives. It provides a \nmuch needed 3.5-percent pay raise for our troops. It further empowers \nthe Army and Air\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\nForce National Guard as they continue their critical role in our \nwarfighting efforts. And it includes the badly needed Wounded Warrior \nlegislation that will address the broader issues of patient care which \nwe saw manifested at Walter Reed.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am committed to seeing \nthis bill pass the floor of the Senate. It would be a complete failure \nof leadership on our part if we failed to pass this vital measure while \nour men and women are engaged in conflict. Unfortunately, this bill has \nbeen bogged down by politically motivated Iraq votes the Senate has \ntaken many times before. Again, I understand the legitimate differences \nof opinion others may have on our strategy in Iraq, but it demonstrates \na lack of seriousness about the enemy we face and the needs of our men \nand women in uniform to be here after 14 days of debate and not to have \npassed this critical legislation, particularly as we come up against \nthe end of the fiscal year on September 30.\n\n  It is time to put the politics aside. It is time to put aside the \nnondefense related amendments. Every day, our men and women in uniform \nare out there making us proud with their courage and dedication to \ntheir mission. We should be here doing our job making sure we are \nsupporting them by passing this critical legislation.\n  There are some legitimate amendments related to the underlying bill \nthat we have debated at length, but there are also a lot of amendments \nthat are unrelated to the underlying bill. Switching gears and moving \nto hate crimes legislation or to restart the immigration debate on the \nDefense authorization bill, in my view, would be a mistake. It would \ndemonstrate a lack of leadership and a lack of good judgment on our \npart when we have men and women in the field who are fighting every \nsingle day. We need to make sure we get them a Defense authorization \nbill that gives them the pay raise they deserve, that addresses the \nequipment needs they have, that deals with the Wounded Warrior \nlegislation, and that cares for our veterans when they come back from \nthat conflict. There are so many important things in this underlying \nbill that we need to deal with, and we need to deal with them in a \ntimely way.\n  I would hope that as the debate gets underway again tomorrow, we will \nbe able to come to some final conclusion about this bill and get it \npassed into law without having to get bogged down in what are ancillary \nand unrelated issues, many of which are now, at this late juncture, \nbeing brought forward.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides to do what is in the national \ninterest, the right thing for our men and women in uniform; that is, to \npass a Defense authorization bill that addresses their fundamental \nneeds to make sure they have the funding and support, training and \nequipment they need to do their jobs and complete their mission.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue we have \ndebated for many months on the floor of the Senate. It has been debated \nin the other body, and it has been debated a lot of places across the \ncountry. The issue is children's health insurance.\n  We have a vehicle in place to make sure that not only do the 6.5 \nmillion children who are covered already under the program maintain \ntheir coverage all across the country, but in particular with this \nlegislation, this bipartisan legislation, the Senate bill, which a \ncouple of weeks ago we saw got 68 votes--the Presiding Officer and \nothers in this body know it is hard to get 68 votes on anything, \nespecially something as significant as children's health insurance. But \nthat was a resounding vote in favor of a policy which will make sure we \ncover those 6.5 million children but add substantially to that to the \npoint where this legislation would allow us to make sure 10 million \nAmerican children have health insurance. We have a vehicle. We have a \nprogram that works. We have bipartisan consensus from across the board, \neven beyond parties. We have people who don't agree on much in \nlegislation over the course of a year or two agreeing on this. There is \nstrong support across America for it, certainly in my State of \nPennsylvania, certainly in the State of New Jersey. But all across \nAmerica we see support from virtually every corner.\n  There is only one problem. Despite the bipartisan consensus which \nexists here and in the other body, the President has threatened and \nseems determined to veto this legislation. For the life of me, I can't \nunderstand that. I can't understand why the President would say that he \nsupports reauthorizing the program, that he thinks the program is good \nand it works, but he will not support a bipartisan consensus. This \nmakes no sense, especially since States across America have had this \nkind of insurance in place for many years. In Pennsylvania, we have \nabout 160,000 children covered right now, maybe a little more. We could \nincrease that substantially over the next 5 years to add another \n140,000 or more. So instead of having 160,000 kids covered, we get \n300,000 children in Pennsylvania covered.\n  We know this doesn't end the discussion. We know there will still be \nchildren who won't be covered. Even if we get to that 10 million \nnumber, we know there will be millions of children, maybe as many as 5 \nmillion, who are not covered. So we can't rest just on the foundation \nof this legislation.\n  I plead with the President, don't veto legislation that will provide \n10 million American children with the health care they should have, the \nhealth care their parents and their communities have a right to expect \nbut also the health care for children in the dawn of their lives which, \nbeyond what it does for that child, which is obvious, I think there is \na strong moral argument, but even beyond that argument, what this will \ndo for the American economy years into the future.\n  These children, if they get the kind of health care and early \nlearning we all support, will do better in school. They will achieve \nmore. They will learn more. And if they learn more, they can earn more. \nWe know there are CEOs across the country who understand this \ninvestment in our children is an investment in our economic future.\n  I join a lot of people in this Chamber in both parties who worked \nvery hard to get 68 votes for this legislation. There was a lot of \ntough negotiating in the Senate Finance Committee, where the vote, I \nthink, was 17 to 4 way back in the summer. There is the work that has \nbeen done in the House and the work that has been done between both \nbodies to get this right.\n  I ask anyone who has an interest in this legislation across the \ncountry--or anywhere someone is following this issue--to urge the \nPresident not to veto children's health insurance that will cover 10 \nmillion American children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Bond, Bob \n           Bennett, Michael B. Enzi.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment that I \nhave filed to H.R. 1545, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2008. My amendment expresses the sense of Congress that an \nappropriate site be established within the Arlington National Cemetery \nfor a small memorial to the memory of the 40 members of the U.S. Armed \nForces who perished in an airplane crash at Bakers Creek, Australia, on \nJune 14, 1943. A similar provision is already included in the House \nversion of the fiscal year 2008 DOD authorization bill, and so it is \nimportant for the Senate to declare its support for this worthy cause.\n  On June 14, 1943, a B-17C Flying Fortress aircraft was transporting a \ngroup of U.S. servicemen from the city of Mackay in Queensland, \nAustralia. The 35 servicemen, accompanied by six crew members, were \nreturning to the jungle battlefields of New Guinea to continue their \nbrave fight against the enemy Japanese forces. They had spent \napproximately 10 days in Mackay enjoying a much needed break at \nAmerican Red Cross rest and recreation facilities, whose location in \nAustralia was not widely known at the time. The aircraft lifted off \ninto a fog and, 5 minutes after takeoff, crashed 5 miles south at \nBakers Creek, killing everyone on board except for a sole survivor.\n  To this day, the cause of the crash remains a mystery. History books, \nto a certain extent, have obscured this event even though it remains \nthe deadliest plane crash in Australian history. There is a reason for \nthat. The press was not allowed to report the crash when it occurred--\nowing to wartime censorship laws. The relatives of those who perished \nreceived telegrams from the U.S. War Department only stating that their \nloved ones had been killed somewhere in the South West Pacific. Secrecy \nshrouded this plane crash because the U.S. military was not eager to \neither tip off nearby Japanese forces on the presence of U.S. troops in \nAustralia or feed enemy propaganda. For that reason, this plane crash \nthat has proved to be the worst single airplane crash in the South West \nPacific theater during World War II--remained an official secret for 15 \nyears after the end of the war.\n  The amendment before the Senate today would seek to provide a lasting \ntribute to the bravery and dedication of these young American men. It \nwould establish the sense of the Congress that a permanent memorial, \nmodest in size and nature, should be located at an appropriate place in \nArlington National Cemetery. For too long, the truth on how these young \nmen died in the service of their Nation has been hidden away--albeit \nfor understandable reasons. Next June 14, 2008 will mark the 65th \nanniversary of the forgotten tragedy. Now is the time to mark their \nsacrifices with the proper level of respect and reverence.\n  The memorial to honor the lives and sacrifice of these 40 American \nheroes has already been constructed, yet it lies on foreign soil. The \nmemorial, built by Codori Memorials of Gettysburg, PA, today stands on \nthe grounds of the Australian Embassy here in our Nation's Capital. It \nis a very small memorial--5 feet 2 inches high and 4 feet wide at the \nbase, occupying only 5\\1/2\\ square feet of land. We thank Ambassador \nDennis Richardson and the Government of Australia for so graciously \nhosting this memorial; we are reminded of the long-standing alliance \nbetween our two great nations. Yet it is time for the official memorial \nto\n\n[[Page S12046]]\n\nthese American heroes to come home, to be welcomed at Arlington \nNational Cemetery where it can take its rightful place among our fallen \nheroes.\n  Each of the 40 Americans who perished in this crash is a true hero \nwho gave their lives to the cause of our Nation. To date, the Bakers \nCreek Memorial Association has located the families of 38 of the 40 \ncasualties. They continue to search for relatives of the remaining two \nsoldiers to notify them of the specifics surrounding their loved one's \ndeaths.\n  I wish to claim prerogative on behalf of my home State to take note \nof the six Pennsylvanians killed in this tragic crash. Each of their \nfamilies still resides in Pennsylvania. Their names and hometowns are \nas follows: PFC James E. Finney, Erie, PA; TSGT Alfred H. Frezza, \nAltoona, PA; SGT Donald B. Kyper, Hesston, PA; PFC Frank S. Penksa, \nMoscow, PA; PFC Anthony Rudnick, Haddon Heights, PA; CPL Raymond H. \nSmith, Oil City, PA\n  I am joined in this effort by Senator Specter. It is time to do right \nby these forgotten American heroes and give them and their families a \nmemorial at Arlington National Cemetery that is worthy of their valor, \nworthy of their honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12046-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 14th \nannual National Public Lands Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday, \nSeptember 29. I am pleased to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers \naround the Nation who will come together to improve and restore one of \nAmerica's most valuable assets, our public lands.\n  National Public Lands Day has fostered communities of volunteers \naround the Nation. When it started in 1994, there were 700 volunteers \nworking in only a few areas. This year nearly 110,000 volunteers will \nwork at more than 1,300 locations to protect public land for the \nenjoyment of future generations. The spirit that guided the Civilian \nConservation Corps in the early 1930s continues today in National \nPublic Lands Day, our latest commitment to care for our country's \nnatural resources.\n  Our Nation has a grand tradition of conservation. When Yellowstone \nNational Park was established in 1872, it was the world's first \nnational park. The idea of a national park was an American invention of \nhistoric proportions that led the way for global conservation efforts. \nOne of the earliest and most energetic conservationists was President \nTeddy Roosevelt. He dedicated 194 million acres of national parks and \nnational preserves, which set a lofty standard for all who follow.\n  Over one-third of America is public land. They are places of \ncontinuous discovery, where we go to find ourselves, to uncover our \nhistory, and to explore for new resources. We are not the only ones to \nvisit our public lands: millions of tourists, many from overseas, enjoy \nour national parks every year.\n  Our public lands are part of who we are and their diversity reflects \nour identity. In many areas, they provide timber, ore, and forage that \nare the economic bedrock of rural America. In other areas, Congress has \ndesignated them as wilderness, places ``untram-\nmeled by man, where man is a visitor who does not remain.''\n  I want to recognize the thousands of Federal employees who manage \nthese lands year-round. The Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, \nFish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and other Federal \nland management agencies ensure that public lands in Nevada meet the \nchanging needs of our communities. They provide a vital, though rarely \nreported, service to our Nation, managing our public lands for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  National Public Lands Day encourages volunteers to join in that \nservice. Across Nevada, at places like the Black Rock Desert, Lake \nMead, Boundary Peak, Sloan Canyon and the Truckee River, volunteers \nwill work to improve our public lands. This year's focus is the defense \nof native species from invasive weeds. Noxious weeds are a serious \nproblem that has plagued the West for years. Exotic weeds push out \nnative plants and provide plenty of fuel for wildfires. In Nevada, we \nknow about this threat all too well. National Public Lands Day \nvolunteers in Elko, NV, will help to repair the damage from last year's \nrecord-setting fire season.\n  The preservation of our public lands is a priority for me. Our public \nlands are part of what makes the United States a great Nation. I voice \nmy gratitude to all who will participate in National Public Lands Day \nthis year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12046-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CORRECTION FOR THE RECORD\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly. Today, as President Bush prepares to speak before the \nUnited Nations General Assembly, we are reminded both of the great \npotential of American leadership to enhance global security and \nprosperity and, tragically, of how much ground we have lost in recent \nyears in fulfilling that potential. That ground can only be regained \nwith new, bold, and visionary American leadership that acknowledges \npast mistakes, embodies and embraces change, and unifies our country to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  America has surmounted far greater hurdles before, renewing itself \nand leading the world towards shared security and common progress. That \nis the story of the founding of the United Nations. Its original \narchitect, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, died weeks before the \nU.N.'s inaugural meeting in San Francisco. Roosevelt never had the \nopportunity to address the U.N. General Assembly, but his legacy speaks \nvolumes. As American power reached new heights and Allied forces swept \nacross Europe and the Pacific islands to free the world from tyranny, \nRoosevelt laid the foundations for a new era of collective security by \ncreating a new institution that aimed to guarantee the peace and \nprotect the basic rights of all human beings.\n  Stalin's obstruction created stalemate in the United Nations, but the \nUnited States was not deterred. American presidents created new \ninstitutions, like NATO, and encouraged others, including the European \nEconomic Community, to advance the principles and mandate of the U.N. \nCharter. In the decades that followed, the United States led and \nlistened, gained by being generous, and ultimately prevailed in the \nstruggle with totalitarianism.\n  Today, it is fashionable in some circles to bash the United Nations. \nThis is all too easy to do, but it is also short-sighted and self-\ndefeating. The United Nations is, we should recall, an American \ncreation. It is also a commonsense vehicle to share global burdens and \ncosts. Despite its evident flaws and failings, the U.N. remains \nessential to advancing U.S. interests, enhancing global security, \nspurring development, and providing food, medicine, and life-saving \nassistance to the world's most needy every day.\n  The U.N.'s work in development addresses the dire needs of 1 billion \npeople living in extreme poverty. It is the U.N., funded in part by the \ngenerosity of America's taxpayers, that prepares and monitors elections \nin more than 30 countries and assists fragile new democracies. It is \nthe U.N., funded in\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\npart by the generosity of America's taxpayers, that feeds the famished \nand shelters 20 million refugees fleeing conflict and natural disaster. \nIt is the U.N., funded in part by the generosity of America's \ntaxpayers, that has convened the world's leaders on the urgent issue of \nclimate change. It is the U.N., funded in part by the generosity of \nAmerica's taxpayers, that strengthens global health and has helped \nreduce child mortality to its lowest level in history.\n  Today, the U.N. has more peacekeepers than ever--over 100,000--\ndeployed in 18 missions around the world. Only a small handful are \nAmericans. Since September 11, 2001, more than 700 men and women have \nlost their lives serving on U.N. peace operations to protect fragile \npost-conflict transitions in the Great Lakes region of Africa, \nAfghanistan, Lebanon, Haiti, Sudan, and elsewhere. We should not forget \nthat one of the first terrorist attacks in Iraq targeted the U.N. \ncompound in August of 2003 and resulted in the murder of 22 people, \nincluding U.N. Envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello.\n  No country has a greater stake in a strong United Nations than the \nUnited States. That is why it is particularly painful when the U.N. \nfalls short not only of its potential but also of the principles \nexpressed in the U.N. Charter. All too often, member states use U.N. \nprocesses as a means to avoid action rather than a means to solve \nproblems. In recent years, U.N. member states have failed to act \nswiftly or decisively to end the genocide in Darfur.\n  The Human Rights Council has passed nine resolutions condemning \nIsrael, a democracy with higher standards of human rights than its \naccusers, but none condemning any other country. The Council has \ndropped investigations into Belarus and Cuba for political reasons, and \nits method of reporting on human rights allows the Council's members to \nshield themselves from scrutiny. The oil-for-food scandal revealed the \nextent of corruption in the institution and the extent of member \nstates' willingness to tolerate it. Although U.N. operations are often \ngreeted as legitimate, their inefficiencies or misdeeds can turn local \npeople against them.\n  Progress and renewal will come from reform, not neglect. In the \n1940s, the international community with American leadership created the \nUnited Nations to meet the needs of their times, but its leaders well \nunderstood that time would not stand still. Today, we face a world that \nis dramatically different than that of 1945. Decisionmaking procedures \ndesigned for a world of some 50 nations must now accommodate almost \n200. Some of the old rules are harmless. The General Assembly meets \nwhen it does because this was when the steamships used to arrive in New \nYork harbors. But some of the procurement and hiring rules have slowed \nand encumbered multifaceted peace operations that depend on nimbleness \nand efficiency for success.\n  Most of the gravest threats faced by the United States are \ntransnational threats: the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, terrorism, climate change, and global pandemics like HIV/\nAIDS. These threats are bred in places marked by other transnational \nchallenges: mass atrocities and genocide, weak and failed states, and \npersistent poverty. By definition, these are challenges that no single \ncountry can manage. America's national security depends as never before \nupon the will and capacity of other states to deal with their own \nproblems and to take responsibility for tackling global problems. A \nstrong and competent United Nations is more vital than ever to building \nglobal peace, security, and prosperity.\n  The United States must champion reform so the United Nations can help \nus meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  The United Nations must step up to the challenge posed by countries \ndeveloping illicit nuclear programs. The largest test of our resolve on \nthis grave matter is in Iran, where leaders appear resolved to ignore \ntheir responsibilities to the international community. The United \nNations must send a clear message to Tehran that if Iran verifiably \nends its nuclear program and support for terrorism, it can join the \ncommunity of nations. If it does not, it will face tougher sanctions \nand deeper isolation. To this end, all U.N. sanctions against Iran must \nbe fully enforced in order to ensure their effectiveness in pressuring \nIran to halt its illicit nuclear program, which has all the hallmarks \nof an attempt to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  Governments willing to brutalize their own people on a massive scale \ncannot escape sanction by the international community. The U.N., joined \nby the United States, has endorsed the responsibility to protect--the \nright and responsibility of the international community to act if \nstates do not protect their own people from genocide, war crimes, \nethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. But, there is a huge gap \nbetween words and deeds. Governments must replace their willingness to \ntalk about the abstract ``responsibility to protect'' with an actual \nwillingness to exercise that responsibility. And they should start in \nDarfur.\n  The United States should seek to reform the U.N. Human Rights Council \nand help set it right. If the Council is to be made effective and \ncredible, governments must make it such. We need our voice to be heard \nloud and clear, and we need to shine a light on the world's most \nrepressive regimes, end the Council's unfair obsession with Israel, and \nimprove human rights policies around the globe.\n  We need ambassadors to the U.N. who will represent all of America, \nnot an ideological fringe, who will forge coalitions with others, not \nisolate America, and who will work tirelessly to strengthen the U.N.'s \ncapacity, not revel in weakening it.\n  The U.S. needs to lead the effort to reform and streamline the U.N.'s \nbureaucracy, increase efficiency and root out corruption. Managing \nurgent and high-stakes transnational challenges will be difficult under \nthe best of circumstances. Just as we must demand professionalism, \nrigor, and accountability from officials in our own government, we must \nnot ask less of those who serve the global good.\n  Congress needs to support the U.N. with the resources it deserves and \nabide by the commitments we have made. The Bush administration's record \non the payment of dues is uneven, which has depleted the U.N.'s \ncapabilities and sent a signal that this administration does not \nrespect its purpose or its promise. We must guarantee full and prompt \npayment of our U.N. dues. At the same time, the U.N. and its member \nstates have to uphold their end of the bargain. Too often, we have seen \nresources wasted or spent to protect parochial interests. It is time to \nensure that the U.N.'s money is well spent.\n  We should not merely react to crises once they occur. By working \nthrough the U.N., as well as other multilateral agencies and private \norganizations, the United States can do more to prevent mass violence \nfrom occurring in the first place. Combining effective diplomacy and \neconomic assistance or, when necessary, sanctions can help forestall \ncrises that undermine regional and international security.\n  The U.N. is ultimately an instrument of its member states. Its future \nis in our hands. Let us provide bold and effective leadership to \nreinvigorate it so it finally achieves the potential that Roosevelt \nenvisioned and on which our common security and common humanity \ndepend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12047-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12047-S12048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEDICATION OF THE ARNOLD UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President. I would like to draw the Senate's attention \nto a dedication ceremony occurring on September 28, 2007, in Little \nRock, AR. The Richard Sheppard Arnold U.S. Courthouse, located at 500 \nWest Capitol Avenue, is named after one of Arkansas's rarest of men. \nJudge Arnold intertwined great skill in law with unmatched integrity \nand character.\n  The late Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., once \ndescribed his former law clerk as ``one of the most gifted members of \nthe federal judiciary.'' Other colleagues point to Judge Arnold as a \nlifetime teacher, master of the written word, and a model of humility. \nIn his obituary, which he wrote, Judge Arnold said that he thought if \nhe left a mark on the world at all, it would be in his written \nopinions. However, he concluded that his administrative assignments \nwere his most significant achievements. His legal career began at Yale \nCollege, where he earned a bachelor's degree summa cum laude in 1957 \nfollowed by graduation magna\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\ncum laude from Harvard Law School in 1960.\n  Immediately out of law school, he served as a law clerk to Justice \nBrennan before joining the Washington, DC, office of Covington & \nBurling, also serving as a part-time instructor at the University of \nVirginia Law School. In 1964, he returned to Texarkana, AR, as a \npartner at Arnold & Arnold. During this time, he also began working as \na legislative secretary to Governor Dale Bumpers and later moved to \nWashington, DC, when Bumpers was elected U.S. Senator.\n  Judge Arnold's reputation for judicial brilliance and impeccable \ncivility advanced while he served as the U.S. District Judge for the \nEastern and Western Districts of Arkansas. He was confirmed again in \n1980 when President Carter nominated him to a new seat on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Judge Arnold served as chief \njudge from 1992 to 1998.\n  In addition to his work on the bench, Judge Arnold's service and \nleadership extended into countless civic, political, and educational \nprojects. He was the recipient of numerous awards, most notably the \n1996 Environmental Law Institute Award, Award for Service to Women in \nthe Law from the St. Louis Women Lawyers Association in 1998, the \nEdward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award in 1999, and \nthe Meador-Rosenberg Award for the Standing Committee on Federal \nJudicial Improvements of the American Bar Association in 1999. He also \nreceived honorary doctor of law degrees from the University of \nArkansas, the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, and the University \nof Richmond. He is also the author of many legal articles in many of \nthe Nation's most respected law reviews and journals.\n  The American Law Institute cites Judge Arnold's accomplishments as \n``remarkable by any measure'' and then adds ``they neither capture nor \ndefine the quality and spirit of the man who achieved them.'' The same \nis true for this courthouse. It cannot fully honor Judge Arnold for his \ncontributions to society, but it does serve as a standing and strong \nreminder of an extraordinary Judge and the justice he pursued in and \nout of the courtroom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12048-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DESEGREGATION OF LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Nation celebrates the 50th \nanniversary of the court order requiring desegregation of Little Rock \nCentral High School. It was a case that shocked the Nation with its \ngraphic illustration of the horrors of Jim Crow and the very real \nlimits it placed on the educational opportunities of millions of \nAmerican children. On September 25, 1957, the Little Rock Nine were \nfinally allowed to enter their classrooms, but only with the aid of \nFederal troops.\n  Although the students were enrolled that day, the actual process of \ndesegregating Little Rock High School took far longer. These courageous \nyoung students had to endure taunts and abuse from their White \nclassmates, and late night phone calls threatening violence against \ntheir families. They realized they carried the weight of their \ncommunities' futures on their young shoulders.\n  The effort to fully integrate the Nation's schools continued long \nafter these first African-American students graduated, and it was not \nuntil this year that a court declared the school district fully \nintegrated. This process of racially integrating America's public \nschools was repeated, if in less dramatic ways, throughout the Nation \nin the 1960s and 1970s.\n  The 50th anniversary is a reminder that the Nation has sacrificed a \ngreat deal to achieve integration, and with great success. Since the \nhistoric decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the march of \nprogress has brought the Nation closer to its high ideals of liberty \nand justice for all. The struggle for equal educational opportunity has \nbeen at the heart of that march of progress, because education is the \nkey to achieving true opportunity in all areas of American society. \nEducation is a powerful force for increasing economic opportunity, \ncombating residential segregation, exercising the right to vote, and \nfully integrating all our people into the fabric of American life.\n  When Robert Kennedy served as Attorney General, the effort to \ndesegregate schools was one of his most important priorities, because \nhe understood so well that in the context of segregation, justice \ndelayed is justice denied.\n  In the past half century, we have come far, but hardly far enough. \nCivil rights is still the unfinished business of America. In many \nschools, formal integration has not brought full equality in the \nclassroom. The troubling reports of racial violence and discriminatory \ndiscipline in Jena, LA, are an appalling current example, in which \nWhite students hung nooses in a schoolyard tree set off months of \nracial tension. But integration has been incomplete in less dramatic \nways as well. Too often, for example, the tracking of students into \nadvanced courses has tended to reflect racial stereotypes and preserve \nracial divisions.\n  From the 1980s to the present, we have also seen a new movement that \nhas sought to undermine civil rights progress. Some have adopted the \nrhetoric of the civil rights movement to undermine its progress, often \nusing the same strategies developed by civil rights leaders in the \nbattle against Jim Crow. We see that result in efforts to have the \ncourts undo landmark civil rights decisions.\n  Fortunately, the Supreme Court has declined recent invitations to \nturn back the clock on educational diversity and integration. Although \nthe Court has found fault with some school integration plans such as in \nSeattle and Jefferson County, KY, its decision made clear that schools \ncan continue to strive for racially inclusive classrooms, and that the \ndoor is still open for continued progress.\n  As a practical matter, it is up to individual educators, parents, \nschool districts to make the promise of equal educational opportunity a \nreality. Achieving genuine integration and full equality in education \ntakes more than a court decision. It takes good will, vision, \ncreativity, common sense, and a firm commitment to the goal of \neducating all children, regardless of race. Above all, it takes a \nrealistic assessment in each local community to determine what will \nwork to bring students together.\n  That challenge is difficult to meet, but the benefits are enormous. \nDiversity in education benefits all students, and the Nation too. In \nour diverse society, it is vitally important for children to develop \ninteractions and understanding across racial and cultural lines. Our \neconomic future depends on our ability to educate all children to \nbecome productive members of society. That view is widely shared. \nLeaders of the military community and the business community have made \nclear that a diverse and highly educated workforce is important to \ntheir success, too.\n  The court order to integrate Little Rock High School helped lay the \nfoundation for subsequent civil rights decisions and gave an immense \nboost to the civil rights movement. We have come a long way since that \nhistoric decision. But the struggle to fulfill Brown's promise \ncontinues today. This anniversary is an important reminder of the work \nstill to be done to achieve true equality in education for the Nation's \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12048-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12048-S12050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from \nCalifornia, Ms. Boxer, for her leadership and hard work in passing the \nWater Resources Development Act (WRDA) conference report yesterday. Had \nI been in Washington, DC, yesterday, I would have enthusiastically \nvoted for the conference report on final passage.\n  Typically these critical water infrastructure authorizations are \nenacted by Congress every two years. For almost eight years, however, \nthese priorities have languished under the watch of the previous Senate \nleadership. At the beginning of the 110th Congress in January, when the \nSenator from California became Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, she pledged that the Water Resources Development Act \nwould be completed by the Senate in a timely fashion. She kept that \npledge, and I applaud her commitment.\n  By comparison, during the 109th Congress, those of us who supported \nswift\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\nenactment of this bill encountered considerable obstacles. As a member \nof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I was the only \nDemocrat on the Committee to be an original cosponsor of the bill; when \nthe bill passed out of committee in March 2005, I called upon then-\nMajority Leader Frist to schedule floor time for the bill that summer. \nIt did not occur.\n  In September of 2005, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, and I \nworked together on a bipartisan letter, signed by 40 of our colleagues, \ncalling upon Senate Republican leadership to schedule floor time for \nthis bill. We were informed that the support of 40 Senators was \ninsufficient, that 60 signatures would be necessary. So we gathered 80 \nsignatures. It was not until September 2006 that the Senate finally \nscheduled debate on WRDA, too late for the bill to be conferenced \nbefore the end of the 109th Congress.\n  I will ask that the text of those letters be printed in the Record.\n  Now it is September 2007, and at long last, the conference report has \nbeen completed. This bill authorizes almost $2 billion for upgrades to \nlocks and dams along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Illinois is \nthe largest shipper of corn and soybeans on these rivers, and the 70 \nyear old system of locks and dams needs these upgrades to ensure \nswifter access to export markets--something, by the way, that \ncompetitors like Brazil are doing right now. A significant part of the \nfarm economy is about reducing transportation costs, so if we are to \nstrengthen our agriculture markets, we need to strengthen waterway \ntransportation, and that means upgrading these locks and dams.\n  The bill also authorizes funding for a number of noteworthy Illinois \nprojects, including the Keith Creek dam to prevent flooding in \nRockford, Illinois, a third-party review of the disagreement in \nreconstructing Promontory Point in Chicago, and dredging at the \nBeardstown, Illinois harbor.\n  Remarkably, the President has proposed a veto of this bill, which \nincludes approval for nationwide funding of critical flood control, \nnavigation, environmental restoration, and storm damage reduction \ninitiatives; the importance of such funding was tragically highlighted \nby Hurricane Katrina. I urge the President to drop that veto threat and \nsupport these long-delayed upgrades to our national infrastructure that \nwere approved overwhelmingly by the House and Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimously to have the letters to which I \nreferred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2006.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid: Wise investment in our \n     water resources remains an urgent need in our country. \n     America's communities continue to face the threats posed by \n     flooding and other natural disasters. The devastation along \n     the Gulf Coast last year underscores the importance of \n     shoring up our defenses against catastrophic floods in all \n     areas of the nation. With these points in mind, we urge you \n     to schedule floor time for the Water Resources Development \n     Act (S. 728) at the start of this session of Congress.\n       As you know, this bill authorizes critical flood control, \n     shore protection, dam safety, storm damage reduction, and \n     environmental restoration projects across the country. These \n     projects, subject to appropriations, will help protect \n     America's communities from the destruction caused by severe \n     weather and flooding, as well as enhancing natural means of \n     protection by restoring our fragile ecosystems. Furthermore, \n     these projects save taxpayers money by decreasing the \n     recovery costs associated with disasters.\n       In addition, this legislation is needed to support our \n     nation's vital waterways and ports--key components of our \n     national transportation system and the backbone of a healthy \n     economy.\n       Recent hurricanes and severe storms have taught the nation \n     a tragic lesson: maintain and improve our aging flood control \n     and water resources infrastructure or risk the ruin and \n     destruction of our communities. This bill moves us in the \n     right direction toward addressing and preventing these grave \n     threats to public safety.\n       It has been five years since the last WRDA was enacted into \n     law. In contrast, three WRDA bills were enacted from 1995 to \n     2000 with an accumulated authorized cost level that surpasses \n     the current bill. Local and state non-Federal cost-sharing \n     partners cannot afford any further delay. We urge you to act \n     expeditiously to bring this important bill to the full Senate \n     for immediate consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sen. James Inhofe, Sen. Thad Cochran, Sen.

Those revisions were made for legislation reauthorizing the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP.\n  The Senate passed H.R. 976 on August 2. To preserve the adjustment \nfor SCHIP legislation, I am further revising the 2008 budget resolution \nand reversing the adjustments previously made pursuant to section 301 \nto the aggregates and the allocation provided to the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Assuming it meets the conditions of the deficit-neutral \nreserve fund specified in section 301, I will again adjust the \naggregates and the Senate Finance Committee's allocation for final \nSCHIP legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S. Con. \nRes. 21 printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--S.

Mr. President, last week the Senate passed H.R. 3580, \nthe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, and sent it on \nto the President for his signature. This is the biggest drug safety \nreform in a decade, and I was proud to support it. Among other things, \nthis legislation will help the FDA do a better job approving and \nmonitoring prescription drugs and medical devices, encourage the \nresearch and development of medical treatments for children, and \nprovide needed resources to the FDA.\n  I am very pleased that the incentive which encourages more studies of \nmedicines in children was preserved in the final version of this bill. \nOver the last 10 years, this program has helped provide worried parents \nand concerned physicians with information they need to make better \ndecisions in prescribing treatment for young children. By extending \ndrug patents in exchange for additional research on how these drugs \naffect children, this program has prompted studies on 144 products and \nled to 122 label changes on some of the most frequently prescribed \nmedicines for children. Clearly the system works and should be \ncontinued, especially since to date only a third of drugs prescribed to \nchildren have been studied and labeled for children.\n  I also am pleased that this legislation reinforces FDA's broad \nauthority over prescription drug labels. Under current law, States are \npreempted from substituting their judgment for the FDA's scientific \ndecisions based on exhaustive reviews of clinical data. If this weren't \nthe case, medicine labels would become so overwhelmed with warnings \ndesigned to avert lawsuits that most Americans will simply stop paying \nattention to them.\n  Additionally, Congress has decided to give FDA the authority to make \nexpedited labeling changes, so that when prescription drug safety \nproblems are identified the FDA and drug manufacturers can work \ntogether to quickly update product labels to ensure that the American \npeople have the latest safety information. If a drug manufacturer comes \nto the FDA in good faith to discuss the possible need for an expedited \nlabeling change--and if the FDA does not respond in a timely manner or \ndecides that the science does not require a labeling change--then that \ndrug manufacturer should not be subject to frivolous lawsuits.\n  I am pleased that Congress came together in a bipartisan manner to \napprove this legislation. It can serve as a model for how the parties \ncan come together to pass other meaningful bills during the remainder \nof the 110th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12050-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12050-S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. EDWARD M. GRAMLICH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to honor the life of \nDr. Edward M. Gramlich, who recently passed away at the age of 68. Dr. \nGramlich was an outstanding and dedicated public servant whose \nexpertise, knowledge, and counsel were highly sought after among the \nleaders of Michigan's economic and academic communities.\n  Dr. Gramlich will be best remembered as a pragmatic economist who \nchampioned the cause of consumer protection and sought to tighten \nmortgage lending practices. Appointed to the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System in 1997 by President Clinton, Dr. Gramlich \nbrought a balanced view to the Reserve Board that included a deep \nrespect for consumer-protection issues. For years he warned of the \nlooming crisis in the mortgage industry, citing excessive fees and high \ncost mortgages offered to those who could not afford them. In June of \nthis year, while undergoing medical treatment, Dr. Gramlich published a \ntimely critique of these practices entitled ``Sub-prime Mortgages: \nAmerica's Latest Boom and Bust,'' which both assessed the issue and \noffered timely solutions to the problem.\n  In 2005, Dr. Gramlich resigned from the Fed to return as interim \nprovost to the University of Michigan, where he enjoyed a decades-long \naffiliation. He held a number of distinguished positions there \nthroughout his career, including as a professor of economics and public \npolicy, chair of the Economics Department, and Dean of the Ford School \nof Public Policy. Other important positions included Dr. Gramlich's \nservice as chair of the Air Transportation Stabilization Board after \nthe attacks of September 11, 2001; deputy director and acting director \nof the Congressional Budget Office; senior fellow at the Brookings \nInstitute; and director of the Policy Research Division at the Office \nof Economic Opportunity.\n  Prior to his work with the Reserve Board, Dr. Gramlich served as \nchairman of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. In that capacity \nDr. Gramlich worked to urge legislators to clamp down on predatory \nlending practices and to toughen regulations on\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\nbanks and mortgage lenders. During his tenure at the Fed, his strong \ncalls for regulation were often met with resistance from a system that \nfavors industry self-regulation. Given today's mortgage and credit \ncrises, we cannot help but wonder ``what if'' with respect to many of \nthose decisions. In any event, as Congress and the States seek ways to \ngrapple with the current situation, Dr. Gramlich's work on consumer \nprotection issues and his insightful analyses will undoubtedly have \nsignificant influence.\n  Dr. Gramlich is mourned by many in Michigan and across the country, \nincluding his wife Ruth; his children, Sarah Howard and Robert; his \nparents, J. Edward and Harriet; as well as many other family members, \nfriends, and colleagues. Dr. Gramlich made an extraordinary impact \nthroughout his life, and I hope that those mourning this loss find \ncomfort in the significant legacy he leaves behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12051-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12051-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12051-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1199.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas urging Congress to restore full funding \n     to the Community Oriented Policing Services program; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 125\n\n       Whereas, in 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act created the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services (COPS) program and for more than a decade the COPS \n     initiative has awarded more than $11 billion to over 13,000 \n     agencies across the country; in the last six years, however, \n     the COPS program has suffered numerous cuts in funding, \n     threatening to reverse the improvements in law enforcement \n     credited to the program at a time when national security is a \n     concern at all levels of government; and\n       Whereas, the recently filed Prosperous and Secure Neighbor \n     Alliance Act of 2007 would allocate $170 million to the \n     United Mexican States to professionalize the Mexican police \n     force for patrols along the U.S.-Mexico border, sending a \n     significant portion of the limited federal aid available to \n     Mexico, further jeopardizing the efforts of state and local \n     law enforcement agencies that depend on continued funding \n     through the COPS program; and\n       Whereas, among the initiatives established under the COPS \n     program is the universal hiring program that resulted in the \n     hiring or redeployment of more than 118,000 law enforcement \n     officers in over 12,000 enforcement agencies nationwide and \n     training initiatives\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\n     that have helped deliver to more than 340,000 officers \n     classes on topics ranging from ethics to terrorism; in \n     offering grants to implement innovative programs such as \n     these, COPS has played a significant role in reducing the \n     crime rate in many areas of the country; but recent cuts to \n     the program have negatively impacted recipient agencies \n     across the country and specifically along the Texas-Mexico \n     border where Texas law officers are consistently \n     understaffed, underpaid, and overworked; and\n       Whereas, while the United States must rely on neighboring \n     nations to do their part to maintain border security, it is \n     equally crucial that programs such as COPS continue to \n     receive the funding necessary to provide adequate resources \n     to safeguard our borders and achieve a level of security \n     expected by the American people; unfortunately, sending funds \n     to Mexico and at the same time reducing federal assistance \n     locally substantially imperils this worthy goal: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 80th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     restore full funding to the Community Oriented Policing \n     Services program to assist Texas law enforcement in \n     patrolling the border before authorizing funding for the \n     police force of the United Mexican States; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-232. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to take such \n     actions as are necessary to research and promote Virtual \n     Command Technology to improve police, emergency medical \n     services, and fire protection; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 41\n\n       Whereas, Virtual Command Technology, the remote viewing of \n     a developing emergency which gives firefighters, EMS \n     professionals, and police officers a virtual presence at the \n     scene, will be of enormous significance to the future \n     security of people and property by giving fire, EMS, and \n     police departments unprecedented knowledge of any developing \n     emergency within seconds of its beginning; and\n       Whereas, in an emergency, time of response and information \n     about the emergency are crucial for successful mitigation in \n     a fire, health, or security incident; and\n       Whereas, the use of Virtual Command Technology enables \n     fire, EMS, and police responders to reach the emergency with \n     their critical incident planning and preparation in progress \n     as they gain complete situational awareness of the incident \n     and are able to put mitigation plans in place, then take \n     action immediately upon arrival at the scene; and\n       Whereas, the advantage of Virtual Command Technology is \n     that first responders can understand a developing emergency \n     and react to it within seconds of the alert, as opposed to \n     conventional technology, which only allows for response upon \n     arrival at the scene; and\n       Whereas, Virtual Command Technology integrates video with a \n     unique graphic display of alarm activity utilizing a database \n     of building floor plans overlaid with icons representing \n     sensors, detectors, and critical emergency building \n     information; and\n       Whereas, in a fire emergency, smoke detector and \n     temperature sensor conditions are updated every second, with \n     the change in color showing the observer the nature of the \n     developing emergency and the actual temperature; and\n       Whereas, in a security emergency, sensor conditions are \n     updated every second, with icons changing color to allow \n     monitoring personnel to locate perpetrators and track \n     movement throughout the facility; and\n       Whereas, Virtual Command Technology provides crucial \n     information to commanders enabling them to understand the \n     emergency situation, conduct incident planning, and issue \n     instructions while they are en route to a location so that \n     upon arrival, all responders have their assignments and can \n     begin incident mitigation immediately; and\n       Whereas, commercial, government, public, and private \n     entities are encouraged to consider Virtual Command \n     Technology for their security and fire protection; and\n       Whereas, in this consideration, the three key elements of \n     Virtual Command Technology should be understood: (1) the \n     protected facility is networked to police, EMS, and fire \n     dispatch centers for immediate notification and visual \n     validation of an emergency; (2) the protected facility is \n     networked to a tactical monitoring station for situational \n     awareness of a developing security incident; and (3) \n     responding units can view the incident remotely utilizing a \n     mobile computer networked to the facility by a broadband \n     wireless connection; and\n       Whereas, in October 2006 the effectiveness of Virtual \n     Command Technology was demonstrated in a series of \n     comparative tactical exercises that culminated with a joint \n     police and fire department demonstration by the Baton Rouge \n     police and fire departments; and\n       Whereas, Baton Rouge Fire Chief Ed Smith and Baton Rouge \n     Police Chief Jeff LeDuff endorsed the technology for its \n     safety aspect for their officers and firefighters and its \n     ability to provide real-time information about an emergency \n     for successful mitigation; and\n       Whereas, using Virtual Command Technology, Baton Rouge \n     police and fire departments experienced a significant \n     performance increase over current response procedures and \n     practices: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to research and promote Virtual Command \n     Technology to improve police, EMS, and fire protection. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-233. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas expressing its gratitude for the \n     sacrifices made by veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, military veterans who have served their country \n     honorably and who were promised and have earned health care \n     and benefits from the federal government through the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs are now in need of these \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, federal discretionary funding is controlled by the \n     executive branch and the United States Congress through the \n     budget and appropriations process; and\n       Whereas, direct funding provides the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs with a reliable, predictable, and consistent source \n     of funding to provide timely, efficient, and high-quality \n     health care for our veterans; and\n       Whereas, currently almost 90 percent of federal health care \n     spending is direct rather than discretionary, and only the \n     funding for health care for active duty military, Native \n     Americans, and veterans is subject to the discretion of the \n     United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, discretionary funding for health care lags behind \n     both medical inflation and the increased demand for services; \n     for example, the enrollment for veterans' health care \n     increased 134 percent between fiscal years 1996 and 2004 yet \n     funding increased only 34 percent during the same period when \n     adjusted to 1996 dollars; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest \n     integrated health care system in the United States and has \n     four critical health care missions: to provide health care to \n     veterans, to educate and train health care personnel, to \n     conduct medical research, and to serve as a backup to the \n     United States Department of Defense and support \n     communities in times of crisis; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates 157 \n     hospitals, with at least one in each of the contiguous \n     states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates more \n     than 850 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient \n     clinics, 132 nursing homes, 42 residential rehabilitation \n     treatment programs, and 88 home care programs; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Veterans Affairs provides a wide \n     range of specialized services to meet the unique needs of \n     veterans, including spinal cord injury and dysfunction care \n     and rehabilitation, blind rehabilitation, traumatic brain \n     injury care, post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, \n     amputee care and prosthetics programs, mental health and \n     substance abuse programs, and long-term care programs; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Veterans Affairs health care \n     system is severely underfunded, and had funding for the \n     department's medical programs been allowed to grow \n     proportionately as the system sought to admit newly eligible \n     veterans following the eligibility reform legislation in \n     1996, the current veterans' health care budget would be \n     approximately $10 billion more; and\n       Whereas, in a spirit of bipartisan accommodation, members \n     of the United States Congress should collectively resolve the \n     problem of discretionary funding and jointly fashion an \n     acceptable formula for funding the medical programs of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 80th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby express its profound gratitude for the sacrifices made \n     by veterans, including those suffering from various medical \n     issues resulting from injuries that occurred while serving in \n     the United States Armed Forces at home or abroad; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the legislature hereby respectfully urge the \n     Congress of the United States to support legislation for \n     veterans' health care budget reform to allow assured funding; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the secretary of \n     veterans affairs, to the president of the United States, to \n     the speaker of the house of representatives and the president \n     of the senate of the United States Congress, and to all the \n     members of the Texas delegation to the Congress with the \n     request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-234.

Connally Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center was a fundamental part of the City of \n     Marlin, Texas, for more than 50 years, and its recent closure \n     dealt a significant blow to the community and surrounding \n     area; and\n       Whereas, the beginning in 1943, the citizens of Marlin \n     organized a campaign to secure their city as the location for \n     a proposed naval medical facility; initially, 31 individual \n     contributors donated $2,025 to finance their preliminary \n     effort, and two years later, the city raised an additional \n     $25,000 in small contributions from the local citizenry to \n     purchase 150 acres of land for a new naval hospital; and\n       Whereas, although Marlin's selection as the site for the \n     hospital had been announced in 1944, and the order approving \n     construction of the new 500-bed facility was signed by \n     President Harry S. Truman on July 1, 1945, congressional \n     funding for the project was omitted from appropriations \n     legislation later that year; and\n       Whereas, undeterred, the residents focused on attracting a \n     200-bed Veterans Administration general and surgical hospital \n     and collected additional funds for the purchase of eight \n     acres to donate for the facility; the city's efforts came to \n     fruition when the Marlin Veterans Administration Hospital \n     opened on November 1, 1950, with a staff of 14 physicians, 42 \n     nurses, and two dentists; during its 50 years of operation, \n     the hospital provided hundreds of jobs to area residents, \n     continuing to reward the community's early faith and \n     determination; and\n       Whereas, in 1992, the facility was renamed the Thomas T. \n     Connally Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center after \n     United States Senator Connally, who championed the city's \n     efforts to have the hospital located in Marlin; regrettably, \n     the medical center has since been closed by the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, and there currently are no \n     plans for its reuse despite a recent extensive remodeling; \n     and\n       Whereas, although the center's closure was a major economic \n     loss to the residents of Marlin, the city's spirit and \n     goodwill have yet to waver; in the aftermath of Hurricanes \n     Rita and Katrina, Marlin opened the Connally Veterans \n     Administration Medical Center to house medically fragile \n     evacuees from the affected areas, but, with that notable \n     exception, the complex has sat empty and will likely be razed \n     if a permanent use for the center cannot be found; and\n       Whereas, fortunately, the Connally Veterans Administration \n     Medical Center facilities can be easily converted for a \n     number of uses by the state, presenting a practical and \n     beneficial use for the idle buildings; precedent for the \n     adaptation of a Veterans Administration facility to state use \n     was established in 2001 when the United States Congress \n     authorized the conveyance, without consideration, of all real \n     property and improvements associated with the Fort Lyon \n     Veterans Administration Medical Center in Las Animas, \n     Colorado, to the state of Colorado; and\n       Whereas, elected officials from Falls County and the City \n     of Marlin, as well as many civic leaders, have expressed \n     their support for the reuse of the Connally Veterans \n     Administration Medical Center, and given the City of Marlin's \n     long history with the site and the fact that it would cost \n     more to destroy the center than to convey the facility to the \n     State of Texas, it is only fitting that the state take \n     advantage of this available resource: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the 80th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully request the Congress of the United States \n     to authorize the secretary of the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs to convey the Thomas T. Connally Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Medical Center located in Marlin, Texas, \n     to the State of Texas; and, be it further\n       Resolved, that the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the president of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     Congress, and to the Secretary of the United States \n     Department of Veterans Affairs with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12054-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n       S. 2087.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Durbin, Ms. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 2088. A bill to place reasonable limitations on the use of \nNational Security Letters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am pleased today to introduce the National Security \nReform Act of 2007, a bipartisan effort that has the support of \nSenators who I respect a great deal, and with whom I have worked over \nthe years on the Patriot Act and other issues. It also has the support \nof organizations and activists across the political spectrum.\n  This past spring, the Inspector General of the Justice Department \nissued the results of a congressionally mandated audit, an audit that \nexamined the FBI's implementation of its dramatically expanded \nauthority under the USA PATRIOT Act to issue National Security Letters, \nor NSLs. The Inspector General found, as he put it: ``widespread and \nserious misuse of the FBI's national security letter authorities. In \nmany instances, the FBI's misuse of national security letters violated \nNSL statutes, Attorney General Guidelines, or the FBI's own internal \npolicies.'' A subsequent internal audit conducted by the FBI itself \nconfirmed the IG's findings.\n  After the IG report came out, the Judiciary Committee heard from the \nInspector General himself, who described his conclusions in detail, and \nfrom the FBI Director, who talked about some steps the FBI is taking in \nresponse to the report.\n  I appreciate that the FBI agrees with the IG's conclusions and \nrecognizes that it needs to change the way it does business when it \ncomes to NSLs. But in my view, leaving it to the FBI to fix this \nproblem is not enough.\n  Unfortunately, Congress shares some responsibility for the FBI's \ntroubling implementation of these broad authorities. The FBI's \napparently lax attitude and in some cases grave misuse of these \npotentially very intrusive authorities is attributable in no small part \nto the USA PATRIOT Act. That flawed legislation greatly expanded the \nNSL authorities, essentially granting the FBI a blank check to obtain \nsome very sensitive records about Americans, including people not under \nany suspicion of wrong-doing, without judicial approval. Congress gave \nthe FBI very few rules to follow and failed to adequately remedy those \nshortcomings when it considered the NSL statutes as part of the Patriot \nAct reauthorization process.\n  This Inspector General report proves that ``trust us'' doesn't cut it \nwhen it comes to the Government's power to obtain Americans' sensitive \nbusiness records--without a court order and without any suspicion that \nthey are tied to terrorism or espionage. It was a significant mistake \nfor Congress to grant the Government broad authorities and just keep \nits fingers crossed that they wouldn't be misused.\n  Congress has the responsibility to put appropriate limits on \ngovernment authorities--limits that allow agents to actively pursue \ncriminals, terrorists and spies, but that also protect the privacy of \ninnocent Americans.\n  In addition, a Federal district court recently struck down one of the \nnew NSL statutes, as modified by the Patriot Act reauthorization \nlegislation enacted in 2006. The court found that a statutory provision \npermitting the FBI to impose a permanent, blanket nondisclosure order \non recipients of NSLs violated the First Amendment.\n  Congress also has not provided sufficient privacy protections to \ngovern the related authority in Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which \npermits the Government to obtain court orders for Americans' business \nrecords under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Often referred \nto as the ``library'' provision, although it covers all types of \nbusiness records, Section 215 was one of\n\n[[Page S12057]]\n\nthe most controversial provisions in the Patriot Act. Unfortunately, \nCongress did not go nearly far enough in the reauthorization process in \naddressing the very legitimate privacy and civil liberties concerns \nthat have been raised about this power, including with respect to the \nlow standard the Government has to meet to obtain a Section 215 order, \nthe entirely insufficient judicial review provisions, and the lack of \nother procedural protections.\n  All of this is why a bipartisan group of Senators, three Democrats \nand three Republicans, are introducing the National Security Letter \nReform Act of 2007.\n  The bill places new safeguards on the use of National Security \nLetters and related Patriot Act authorities to protect against abuse. \nIt restricts the types of records that can be obtained without a court \norder to those that are the least sensitive and private, and it ensures \nthat the FBI can only use NSLs to obtain information about individuals \nwith some nexus to a suspected terrorist or spy. It makes sure that the \nFBI can no longer obtain the sensitive records of individuals three or \nfour times removed from a suspect, most of whom would be entirely \ninnocent.\n  It prevents the use of so-called ``exigent letters,'' which the IG \nfound the FBI was using in violation of the NSL statutes. It requires \nadditional congressional reporting on NSLs, and it requires the FBI to \nestablish a compliance program and tracking database for NSLs. It \nrequires the Attorney General to issue minimization and destruction \nprocedures for information obtained through NSLs, so that information \nobtained about Americans is subject to enhanced protections and the FBI \ndoes not retain information obtained in error.\n  On Section 215, the legislation establishes a standard of \nindividualized suspicion for obtaining a FISA business records order, \nrequiring that the government have reason to believe the records sought \nrelate to a suspected terrorist or spy or someone directly linked to a \nsuspected terrorist or spy, and it creates procedural protections to \nprevent abuses. The bill also ensures robust, meaningful and \nconstitutionally sound judicial review of both National Security \nLetters and Section 215 business records orders, and the gag orders \nthat accompany them.\n  This legislation is a measured, reasonable response to a serious \nproblem. The NSL authorities operate in secret. The Justice \nDepartment's classified reports to Congress on the use of NSLs were \nadmittedly inaccurate. And when, during the reauthorization process, \nCongress asked questions about how these authorities were being used, \nwe got empty assurances and platitudes that we now know were mistaken.\n  Oversight alone is not enough. Congress also must take corrective \naction. The Inspector General report has shown both that the executive \nbranch cannot be trusted to exercise those powers without oversight and \nthat current statutory safeguards are inadequate. This National \nSecurity Letter Reform Act is the answer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2088\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to improve \nprotections for employees and retirees in business bankruptcies; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support this Nations' \nworkers, who deserve better treatment than they currently experience \nwhen their employers fail them.\n  We all remember what happened with Enron. Thousands of workers toiled \nover decades to slowly build up good, solid companies of which they \ncould be proud. Then, in just a few short years, these companies were \nbought up by a conglomerate and run into the ground.\n  Enron went bankrupt and, just like that, the workers and retirees who \nspent their lives building something lost their jobs, their benefits, \nand most of their pensions. Our bankruptcy system helped facilitate \nthat loss.\n  It is not just Enron. Workers and retirees are always near the back \nof the line when their companies go into bankruptcy. Some firms have \ngone into bankruptcy at least in part because companies can walk away \nforever from some of their obligations to their employees.\n  Today I am introducing the Protecting Employees and Retirees in \nBusiness Bankruptcies Act, along with Senators Kennedy and Feingold. I \nam pleased that Chairman Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee will \nbe introducing the House companion.\n  The Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act \nwill increase the value of worker claims in bankruptcy. The bill \ndoubles the maximum value of wage claims for each worker to $20,000; \nallows a second claim of up to $20,000 for benefits earned; eliminates \nthe requirement that employees earn wage and benefit claims within 180 \ndays of the bankruptcy filing; creates a new priority claim for the \nloss in value of workers' pensions; and establishes a new priority \nadministrative expense for workers' collective severance pay.\n  The bill also will reduce the loss of wages and benefits. It protects \nthe value of collective bargaining agreements by limiting the \nsituations in which they can be rejected and by tightening the criteria \nby which they can be amended. It also protects retiree benefits and \nensures that bidders for assets of the bankrupt company that promise to \nhonor back wages, vacation time, and other benefits are considered \nfavorably.\n  Finally, the bill will increase the parity of worker and executive \nclaims. For example, the bill prohibits deferred executive compensation \nin situations where employee compensation plans have been terminated in \nbankruptcy.\n  No longer will executives and insiders be able to pay themselves huge \nbonuses in the midst of slashing payroll and benefit costs.\n  No longer will consultants receive huge fees while retirees are \nlosing most of their pensions.\n  No longer will companies be able to sell off all of the assets that \nmake the company worthwhile, and yet refuse to use those proceeds to \nsupport the workers who have lost their livelihoods.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senators Kennedy and \nFeingold, and I thank the AFL-CIO and all of its workers for their \nwholehearted support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2092\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Employees and \n     Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Recent corporate restructurings have exacted a \n     devastating toll on workers through deep cuts in wages and \n     benefits, termination of defined benefit pension plans, and \n     the transfer of productive assets to\n\n[[Page S12064]]\n\n     lower wage economies outside the United States. Retirees have \n     suffered deep cutbacks in benefits when companies in \n     bankruptcy renege on their retiree health obligations and \n     terminate pension plans.\n       (2) Congress enacted chapter 11 of title 11, United States \n     Code, to protect jobs and enhance enterprise value for all \n     stakeholders and not to be used as a strategic weapon to \n     eliminate good paying jobs, strip employees and their \n     families of a lifetime's worth of earned benefits and hinder \n     their ability to participate in a prosperous and sustainable \n     economy. Specific laws designed to treat workers and retirees \n     fairly and keep companies operating are instead causing the \n     burdens of bankruptcy to fall disproportionately and \n     overwhelmingly on employees and retirees, those least able to \n     absorb the losses.\n       (3) At the same time that working families and retirees are \n     forced to make substantial economic sacrifices, executive pay \n     enhancements continue to flourish in business bankruptcies, \n     despite recent congressional enactments designed to curb \n     lavish pay packages for those in charge of failing \n     enterprises. Bankruptcy should not be a haven for the \n     excesses of executive pay.\n       (4) Employees and retirees, unlike other creditors, have no \n     way to diversify the risk of their employer's bankruptcy.\n       (5) Comprehensive reform is essential in order to remedy \n     these fundamental inequities in the bankruptcy process and to \n     recognize the unique firm-specific investment by employees \n     and retirees in their employers' business through their \n     labor.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASED WAGE PRIORITY.\n\n       Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$20,000'';\n       (B) by striking ``within 180 days''; and\n       (C) by striking ``or the date of the cessation of the \n     debtor's business, whichever occurs first,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5)(A), by striking--\n       (A) ``within 180 days''; and\n       (B) ``or the date of the cessation of the debtor's \n     business, whichever occurs first''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (5), by striking subparagraph (B) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(B) for each such plan, to the extent of the number of \n     employees covered by each such plan, multiplied by \n     $20,000.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 330\n\n       Whereas the Dead Sea and the Jordan River are bodies of \n     water of exceptional historic, religious, cultural, economic, \n     and environmental importance for the Middle East and the \n     world;\n       Whereas the world's 3 great monotheistic faiths--\n     Christianity, Islam, and Judaism--consider the Jordan River a \n     holy place;\n       Whereas local governments have diverted more than 90 \n     percent of the Jordan's traditional 1,300,000,000 cubic \n     meters of annual water flow in order to satisfy a growing \n     demand for water in the arid region;\n       Whereas the Jordan River is the primary tributary of the \n     Dead Sea and the dramatically reduced flow of the Jordan \n     River has been the primary cause of a 20 meter fall in the \n     Dead Sea's water level and a \\1/3\\ decline in the Dead Sea's \n     surface area in less than 50 years;\n       Whereas the Dead Sea's water level continues to fall about \n     a meter a year;\n       Whereas the decline in water level of the Dead Sea has \n     resulted in significant environmental damage, including loss \n     of freshwater springs, river bed erosion, and over 1,000 \n     sinkholes;\n       Whereas mismanagement has resulted in the dumping of \n     sewage, fish pond runoff, and salt water into the Jordan \n     River and has led to the pollution of the Jordan River with \n     agricultural and industrial effluents;\n       Whereas the World Monuments Fund has listed the Jordan \n     River as one of the world's 100 most endangered sites;\n       Whereas widespread consensus exists regarding the need to \n     restore the quantity and quality of the Jordan River water \n     flow and to restore the water level of the Dead Sea;\n       Whereas the Governments of Jordan and Israel, as well as \n     the Palestinian Authority (the ``Beneficiary Parties''), \n     working together in an unusual and welcome spirit of \n     cooperation, have attempted to address the Dead Sea water \n     level crisis by articulating a shared vision of the Red Sea-\n     Dead Sea Water Conveyance Concept;\n       Whereas Binyamin Ben Eliezar, the Minister of National \n     Infrastructure of Israel, has said, ``The Study is an \n     excellent example for cooperation, peace, and conflict \n     reduction. Hopefully it will become the first of many such \n     cooperative endeavors'';\n       Whereas Mohammed Mustafa, the Economic Advisor for the \n     Palestinian Authority, has said, ``This cooperation will \n     bring wellbeing for the peoples of the region, particularly \n     Palestine, Jordan, and Israel . . . We pray that this type of \n     cooperation will be a positive experience to deepen the \n     notion of dialogue to reach solutions on all other tracks'';\n       Whereas Zafer al-Alem, the former Water Minister of Jordan, \n     has said, ``This project is a unique chance to deepen the \n     meaning of peace in the region and work for the benefit of \n     our peoples'';\n       Whereas the Red Sea-Dead Sea Water Conveyance Concept \n     envisions a 110-mile pipeline from the Red Sea to the Dead \n     Sea that would descend approximately 1,300 feet creating an \n     opportunity for hydroelectric power generation and the \n     desalination and restoration of the Dead Sea;\n       Whereas some have raised legitimate questions regarding the \n     feasibility and environmental impact of the Red Sea-Dead Sea \n     Water Conveyance Concept;\n       Whereas the Beneficiary Parties have asked the World Bank \n     to oversee a feasibility study and an environmental and \n     social assessment whose purpose is to conclusively answer \n     these questions;\n       Whereas the Red Sea-Dead Sea Water Conveyance Concept would \n     not address the degradation of the Jordan River;\n       Whereas the Beneficiary Parties could address the \n     degradation of the Jordan River by designing a comprehensive \n     strategy that includes tangible steps related to water \n     conservation, desalination, and the management of sewage and \n     agricultural and industrial effluents; and\n       Whereas Israel and the Palestinian Authority are expected \n     to hold high-level meetings in Washington in November 2007 to \n     seek an enduring solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls the world's attention to the serious and \n     potentially irreversible degradation of the Jordan River and \n     the Dead Sea;\n       (2) applauds the cooperative manner with which the \n     Governments of Israel and Jordan, as well as the Palestinian \n     Authority (the ``Beneficiary Parties''), have worked to \n     address the declining water level and quality of the Dead Sea \n     and other water-related challenges in the region;\n       (3) supports the Beneficiary Parties' efforts to assess the \n     environmental, social, health, and economic impacts, costs, \n     and feasibility of a possible pipeline from the Red Sea to \n     the Dead Sea in comparison to alternative proposals;\n       (4) encourages the Governments of Israel and Jordan, as \n     well as the Palestinian Authority, to continue to work in a \n     spirit of cooperation as they address the region's serious \n     water challenges;\n       (5) urges Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to \n     develop a comprehensive strategy to rectify the degradation \n     of the Jordan River; and\n       (6) hopes the spirit of cooperation manifested by the \n     Beneficiary Parties in their search for a solution to the \n     Dead Sea water crisis might serve as a model for addressing \n     the degradation of the Jordan River, as well as a model of \n     peace and cooperation for the upcoming meetings in Washington \n     between Israel and the Palestinian Authority as they seek to \n     resolve long-standing disagreements and to develop a durable \n     solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Senate regarding the degradation of the Jordan River \nand the Dead Sea and welcoming cooperation between the peoples of \nIsrael, Jordan and Palestine.\n  The Jordan River and the Dead Sea are bodies of water of exceptional \nhistoric, religious, cultural, economic and environmental importance \nfor the Middle East and the world. However, both the Jordan River and \nthe Dead Sea face serious problems. The governments of Israel and \nJordan, as well as the Palestinian Authority, have worked together in \nan unusual and welcome spirit of cooperation to address many of the \nwater challenges confronting the region. The Senate applauds this \ncooperation and urges Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority to \ncontinue to work in a spirit of cooperation as it addresses the \ndegradation of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, and hopes this \ncooperation might serve as a model for Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority as they prepare to meet in Washington this fall to seek a \ndurable solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12067-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12067-S12068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 331--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT TURKEY \n     SHOULD END ITS MILITARY OCCUPATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS, \n    PARTICULARLY BECAUSE TURKEY'S PRETEXT HAS BEEN REFUTED BY OVER \n   13,000,000 CROSSINGS OF THE DIVIDE BY TURKISH-CYPRIOTS AND GREEK \n        CYPRIOTS INTO EACH OTHER'S COMMUNITIES WITHOUT INCIDENT\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 331\n\n       Whereas it is in the best interests of the United States, \n     Turkey, Cyprus, the European Union, and NATO for Turkey to \n     adhere to United Nations resolutions and United States and \n     European Union policy and end its military occupation of the \n     Republic of Cyprus;\n       Whereas 13,000,000 crossings of the divide by Turkish-\n     Cypriots and Greek-Cypriots into each other's communities \n     without incident qualifies Cyprus' ethnic community relations \n     to be among the world's safest, regardless of circumstances;\n       Whereas, unlike age-old ethnic frictions in the region, \n     Cyprus has historically been an oasis of generally peaceful \n     relations among ethnic communities, as is reflected in many\n\n[[Page S12068]]\n\n     Turkish-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot emigrants seeking each \n     other as neighbors in places like Great Britain;\n       Whereas United States interests, regional stability, and \n     relations between United States allies Greece and Turkey will \n     improve with an end to the occupation of Cyprus;\n       Whereas Turkey's European Union accession prospects, which \n     require approval by each European Union nation, will improve \n     if Turkey ends its hostile occupation of Cyprus, a European \n     Union nation;\n       Whereas Turkey's image for religious tolerance will improve \n     by removing troops that have allowed, as German Chancellor \n     and European Union President Angela Merkel recently said, \n     ``destruction of churches or other religious sites'' under \n     their control; and\n       Whereas overlooking Turkey's occupation of Cyprus injures \n     the moral standing of the United States internationally and \n     doesn't help the image of the United States in Turkey, which \n     recently ranked last in a 47-nation Pew survey for favorable \n     views of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the United States Government to initiate a new \n     effort to help Turkey understand the benefits that will \n     accrue to it as a result of ending its military occupation of \n     Cyprus;\n       (2) urges the Government of Turkey to immediately begin the \n     withdrawal of its military occupation forces from the \n     Republic of Cyprus; and\n       (3) urges the Government of Turkey to complete the \n     withdrawal of its occupation forces in the near future so \n     that Turkey, Cyprus, the region, and the United States can \n     begin realizing the benefits of the end of that occupation.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am here to offer a resolution which \ncalls on Turkey to immediately begin the withdrawal of its troops from \nCyprus and end its military occupation. Turkish troops have now been in \nCyprus for over 33 years. The number of these troops has increased over \nthe last three decades so that there are now more than 43,000, making \nthis area one of the most militarized in the world.\n  Let me be clear. There is no legitimate justification for the 43,000 \nTurkish troops to be in Cyprus. Cyprus is a peaceful country. Millions \nof people have been crossing the buffer zone without incident for \nyears. There are no military attacks and there is no need for military \nprotection of Turkish Cypriots. In the end, these troops only serve to \ncreate military tension. Again, there is absolutely no legitimate \njustification for this military occupation.\n  In fact, Cyprus has historically been an oasis of generally peaceful \nrelations. When Turkish-Cypriots and Greek-Cypriots emigrate to Great \nBritain from Cyprus, they often seek to live next to each other as \nneighbors.\n  This resolution highlights these examples and uses them as evidence \nto urge Turkey to immediately begin the withdrawal of its military \noccupation. And it notes the importance of Turkey fulfilling this as \nsoon as possible so that Turkey, Cyprus, the region and the United \nStates can work more closely on other strategic issues.\n  This resolution, in addition, calls on the U.S. Government to \ninitiate a new effort to help Turkey understand the benefits of ending \nits military occupation of Cyprus. Such benefits include: Improving \nTurkey's European Union accession prospects; improving regional \nstability; improving relations with Greece; improving relations with \nthe United States and; improving Turkey's image on religious tolerance.\n  It is also in the best interest of the U.S., the European Union, and \nNATO for Turkey to end its military occupation of the Republic of \nCyprus. Sadly, Turkey ranked last in a recent 47-nation Pew survey for \nfavorable views of the U.S. Ending their occupation will offer more \nopportunities for U.S.-Turkey cooperation which will only improve our \nimage in this key U.S. ally.\n  For the U.S. to remain silent during this unjust occupation injures \nour moral standing internationally. Because silence is complicity, we \nmust speak out.\n  That is why I am proud to be the lead on this resolution with Senator \nSnowe which calls on Turkey to end its unjust military occupation in \nCyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/25/senate-section/article/S12068-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3033.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Kennedy (for himself and Mr. Smith)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1585, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1070. HATE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \n     Prevention Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim poses a serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated \n     by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and \n     the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages \n     the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be \n     selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including the following:\n       (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, \n     and members of such groups are forced to move across State \n     lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.\n       (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (E) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, \n     and Indian tribes.\n       (c) Definition of Hate Crime.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 16, title 18, United States Code;\n       (2) the term ``hate crime'' has the meaning given such term \n     in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note);
