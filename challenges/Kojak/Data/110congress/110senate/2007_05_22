Following \nmorning business, we will resume consideration of the immigration \nlegislation. Senator Sessions, under a previous order entered, is to be \nrecognized for 2 hours. He will speak until 12:30 p.m. Today, the \nregular party conferences will be held beginning at 12:30 p.m., so \nSenator Sessions will complete his remarks after 2:15 p.m.\n  It is my understanding that the first amendment that has been agreed \nto be laid down will be by Senator Dorgan. I don't know if there is a \nconsent agreement to that effect. Is there one, Madam President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is not.\n  Mr. REID. I think this has been cleared on both sides. I ask \nunanimous consent that the first amendment be offered by Senator \nDorgan, after the remarks of Senator Sessions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if there is any problem with this \nprocedure, the two managers can ask unanimous consent, and we will all \nagree to change it. But I think that is the agreement which has been \nmade. If it has not, we can start over. That is the general agreement. \nWhat we plan to do during consideration of the legislation is to \nalternate back and forth--Democrat and Republican, Democrat and \nRepublican. That is what we did the last time.\n  The only thing I will announce--I told both managers and I think \nSenator McConnell agrees with this, and if not, it is something we need \nto do for an orderly process here--is that we do an amendment at a \ntime. The last time on this bill, we wound up with 30, 40 amendments \npending. I am saying we are not going to do that this time. We are \ngoing to do one amendment at a time, unless there is something \nextraordinary to come along to change that procedure.\n  We have a long amendment list. The substitute amendment was laid down \nlast night. It is now available to all Members.\n  Tonight, I should announce, as has been announced in the past, there \nis going to be a dinner in the Botanic Garden to honor the spouses of \nthe Senate. I hope all Members will attend this event.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time? The Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, if there is one thing I hear over and \nover again when I talk to my constituents about where we are in this \nCongress, it is the request that we get together and work together and \nthat we get something done. There is always some particular issue \nsomeone will raise that will have to do with immigration, that will \nhave to do with taxes, that will have to do with Social Security, but \nunderlying all these issues is the refrain: Why can't you people work \ntogether? Why can't you get something done? As one constituent put it, \nalmost plaintively: Senator, is there any hope, or are you just going \nto bicker back and forth between the parties, as you have always done?\n  Well, this month, there has been a sign of hope that I think we ought \nto make mention of that demonstrates that, in fact, maybe it is \npossible for us to work together on some of the more contentious \nissues. This sign of hope did not necessarily come from the Congress, \nit was an action that involved Members of Congress and members of the \nBush administration, and it has to do with trade.\n  There are many issues that divide the two parties, but one that has \ndivided us as much as any has been the issue of trade, with the \nDemocrats saying under no circumstances will we approve any more free-\ntrade agreements until we get the kinds of provisions with respect to \nlabor standards that we insist on; and the Republicans have said and \nRepublican administrations have said, those kinds of agreements are \ndeal breakers; if we put those in the trade agreements, we make the \ntrade agreement impossible to enforce. The two sides have yelled at \neach other over this issue now for years.\n  Well, this month we have had a breakthrough, and I will quote from \nthe newspaper articles with respect to this, first, from the New York \nTimes and then from the Wall Street Journal. With a May 11 headline \n``Bush and Democrats in Accord on Labor Rights in Trade Deals,'' the \nNew York Times said the following:\n\n       The Bush administration and House Speaker Pelosi, breaking \n     a partisan impasse that had dragged on for months, reached an \n     agreement this evening on the rights of workers overseas to \n     join labor unions. Both sides predicted the agreement would \n     clear the way for congressional approval of several pending \n     trade agreements.\n\n  This came as happy news to me. I was with the majority leader and a \ngroup of Senators when we went to South America, and we heard from the \nPresident of Peru that the most significant thing we could do in the \nUnited States to maintain good relations with Peru was to approve the \nPeru Free Trade Agreement. After this conversation, some of the \nDemocratic Senators who were on that trip said to me: Bob, that is \ngoing to be very hard. It is going to be very difficult. We are not \ngetting the kind of cooperation we feel we need out of the Bush \nadministration. Well, now they have. It has been worked out.\n  Again, back to The New York Times:\n\n       Negotiations to complete the trade deals have been led by \n     Susan Schwab, United States Trade Representative on the \n     administration side, and by Representative Charles Rangel, \n     the New York Democrat who is Chairman of the Ways and Means \n     Committee on the House side.\n\n  Good news. Both sides giving a little and getting something done. \nThen this paragraph from the New York Times:\n\n       Despite the endorsement of Mr. Rangel and Speaker Pelosi, \n     many Democrats say that half or more of the Democrats in \n     Congress may vote against the deal, but the agreement is \n     expected to pass with strong backing among Republicans, whose \n     leaders will urge them to vote with President Bush.\n\n  This reminds me of a meeting I had in the White House when Bill \nClinton was the President. We were talking about how to deal with \ntrade, and President Clinton said to the Members of Congress who were \nthere: What do we need? The former Senator from New York, Pat Moynihan, \nsitting next to the President, spoke up and said: Sir, we need more \nDemocrats. The Republicans are fine on this issue, it is the Democrats \nwho are the problem.\n  Well, we have had that breakthrough on trade. It is encouraging. The \nWall Street Journal had this to say about it.\n\n       The agreement announced last night by House Speaker Pelosi, \n     Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and other top officials and \n     lawmakers clears the hurdle to passage of some small \n     bilateral trade deals, and it could ultimately smooth the way \n     for broader trade measures such as renewing President Bush's \n     soon to expire authority to negotiate trade deals without the \n     threat of congressional amendments as well as a new global \n     trade agreement now being negotiated in the Doha round of \n     world trade talks.\n\n  I raise this as a ray of hope and then as the background for a \nsuggestion. I hope the sense of urgency that brought the two sides \ntogether on trade can apply to the question of the tax cuts and whether \nthey will be made permanent. I was in New York yesterday with a group \nof representatives from Wall Street, from the venture capital community \nand those economists who deal with the question of growth and keeping \nthe economy strong, and was interested to be told the one thing that \nwould be the most important for them to keep the economy strong and \ngrowing was to keep the tax cuts that were enacted in 2003 in the law \npermanent.\n\n  We asked some of those representatives what would happen if the tax \ncuts were to expire? The reaction we got was: Well, we assume that \nCongress will, of course, not let them expire because they have worked \nso well. They have made significant differences with respect to \ncorporate governance and economic growth that, of course, they are \ngoing to be extended. Then I pointed out to them that if we stay on the \ntrack that was established in the budget bill that was passed, the \nbudget bill that the Senator from New Hampshire talked about, those tax \ncuts will expire in 2010.\n  The folks in New York were stunned. How could Congress do this? How \ncould they allow that to expire in the face of the evidence that these \ntax cuts have been so beneficial? We said: Well, that is the path we \nare on. That is the glidepath that was set in this budget bill. The \nbudget bill can be trumped by future budgets later on, but if nothing \nis done and we stay exactly as we are, these tax cuts are certain to \nexpire.\n  What will be the consequences? Well, we have turned to some experts \nwho will make these kinds of projections and asked that question. We \nwould like to talk about this. I am sure no one can see the detail on \nthe chart, but I will do my best to highlight the visual impact. I will \nsay, in all fairness, as I always say, these are projections, and every \nprojection is wrong. I don't know whether it is wrong on the high side \nor wrong on the low side, but every projection we ever have about the \nfuture, that is specific, is wrong. Nonetheless, I think the basic \ntrend that is shown in these charts is a legitimate trend.\n  This first one talks about the number of jobs that will be created \nState by State if the tax cuts are made permanent. Now, don't pay \nattention to the numbers because you can't see them, look at the bars \nand let me identify the States that will see significant job growth if \nthe tax cuts are made permanent.\n  The biggest line is California, followed by Florida, Illinois, New \nYork, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. It might be interesting to go back \nto those States and look at how those Senators from those States voted \non the budget bill that would have the tax cuts expire. Jobs in \nCalifornia, Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.\n  Some of those States are complaining about their current economies. \nThey are saying their unemployment rate is too high. Make the tax cuts \npermanent and you make a significant contribution to creating jobs in \nthose States.\n  What about economic growth in those States? Let's look at that chart. \nBasically, they are the same States, but there are some slight changes. \nOnce again, this is the income growth\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\nper State if the tax cuts are made permanent. And the winner, again, \nclearly, is California, followed by New York and Texas. But Michigan \nbegins to show up, New Jersey begins to show up, along with Florida, \nIllinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These are States, again, where they \nare saying: Our economic growth has been anemic, our job growth has \nbeen anemic. What can we do?\n  The answer to what can we do? We can make the tax cuts permanent. \nWell, no, politically, we don't want to do that. Politically, it makes \ngood rhetoric for us to attack the rich.\n  One of the things we have to remember as we have these economic \ndebates is the best thing you can do for someone who is poor is to find \nhim a job. The best thing you can do for people who are at the bottom \nis to have strong economic growth. Who gets hurt the most in a \nrecession? It is the poor. Who loses his job when unemployment goes up? \nIt is the person with the least skills, who can least afford to lose \nhis job.\n  I remember a hearing in the Joint Economic Committee, when one of my \ncolleagues, in the midst of the boom of the late 1990s, asked Chairman \nGreenspan: Who has benefitted the most from this boom, expecting the \nanswer to be: Well, it is the people at the top; the people at the top \nhave gotten all the money; the people at the top have benefitted from \nthe boom, and we have to do something about that. Chairman Greenspan \nsaid, very emphatically and very firmly, the people who have benefitted \nthe most from this booming economy are the people at the bottom. The \nbottom quintile have seen their life change, their lifestyle, their \navailability to income improve better than anybody else.\n  We always single out Bill Gates as the richest person in the United \nStates. Did Bill Gates get hurt with the recession? No. His lifestyle \ndidn't change. He didn't lose his house. He wasn't in danger of being \nlate on his mortgage payments because he didn't have any mortgage \npayments. The growth in the economy did not make that big an impact on \nhis situation. But the people at the bottom, who were unable to get the \njobs in the recession that began in 2000; the people at the bottom, who \nwere unable to meet their bills with the recession of 2000; the people \nat the bottom, whose skills were such that they were the first laid \noff, they are the ones who have benefitted the most by the expansion \nthat began with the passage of the tax cuts in 2003.\n  They are the ones who were benefited the most when the unemployment \nrate fell below 5 percent. It is currently 4.4 percent.\n  In my home State of Utah, the unemployment rate is 2.3 percent. Who \nis benefiting the most? It is the people who would otherwise be \nunemployed if the unemployment rate went back up to 6 percent.\n  When we look at income growth per State, don't say that only benefits \nthe fat cats; that only benefits the people at the top. Recognize that \nthe best welfare you can do for anyone is to find them a job. The best \nlife-changing experience you can create for someone is to have a strong \neconomy where that person can work and grow their own savings and get \nslightly ahead.\n  Chairman Greenspan was very firm about that, with respect to who \nbenefited the most from the income growth of the 1990s. It is still \ntrue today. Who will get hurt if the tax cuts are not made permanent \nand the jobs represented on these charts do not materialize? It will be \nthe people who lose their jobs.\n  We, the Congress and the administration, demonstrated that we could \nget together on the trade deals. It was announced with great gladness \nthat the Democrats who had said ``never'' and the Republicans who had \nsaid ``never'' were able, finally, to get together and make this thing \nwork. Can't we do that with respect to tax policy? Can't we understand \nnow that the tax policy has worked?\n  Since the tax cuts were enacted, 8.5 million new jobs have grown up \nin the United States. More Americans are working today than ever in our \nhistory, both in total numbers and as a percentage of the workforce. \nCan't we celebrate that achievement and say let's keep in place the \npolicies that caused it? Or will we continue to say, no, we can't let \nanything happen because, for some political reason we want to scare \npeople, we want to use class warfare rhetoric; we want to say, no, this \nisn't really working, it is an illusion. Ignore the statistics. Ignore \nthe facts.\n  I think we can work together. I think we should work together. I \nthink the facts are clear. We should endorse them and move ahead in \nthat spirit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington State \nis recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \n10 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am coming to the floor this morning \nto talk about energy policy. I know the Presiding Officer very much \nunderstands the importance of energy policy and has represented a State \nin a region of the country that has been a key component to the U.S. \nenergy strategy. My own State, Washington State, with our long history, \nwith our hydro system, is starting to become a leader in alternative \nenergy and certainly in renewable energy.\n  But I rise today to talk about the beginning of the U.S.-China \nStrategic Economic Dialogue that is an ongoing bilateral forum between \nthe United States and China. I think it will help lay the foundation \nfor important, productive, and mutually beneficial ties between our two \ncountries.\n  I appreciate that Treasury Secretary Paulson and Vice Premier Wu are \nstarting that discussion today. I hope energy will be among the issues \nthey talk about.\n  I am under no illusion that we have big challenges in working with \nChina and particularly in embracing a concept I believe is very \nstrategic to how the United States operates in a global economy, that \nis ``coopetition''--you look at those with whom you are competing and \nalso look for ways in which you can cooperate and have strategic \nbenefits by working together. I think that ``coopetition'' is exactly \nthe policy we ought to embrace with China as it relates to energy, and \nit is very important we use this Strategic Economic Dialogue to move \nforward on that issue.\n  I know they are going to talk about lots of different issues. It is \nnot as if Washington State agrees with China on all issues. I know the \ncurrency issue will be part of the discussion. I know there are \nintellectual property rights and agricultural issues, there are \nrestrictions on Washington products, and many things that will be \ndiscussed as part of a larger economic dialogue. But I think it is \nimportant to understand the Washington State experience. If you \njuxtapose our experience to that of the United States, and the U.S. \ntrade imbalance with China, I venture to say Washington State almost \nhas a trade surplus with China. That is, if you look at various aspects \nof our economic numbers, Washington State and China have been good \ntrading partners.\n  Back last year, China was the largest export market for Washington \nState. We sent $6.8 billion in exports to China. Approximately two-\nthirds of Washington State's agricultural exports went to Asia and 17 \npercent to China: apples, potatoes, cherries, and a variety of other \nproducts. And Washington State companies have been aggressive at \npursuing opportunities in China for a long time. I don't know if it is \nthe proximity of our State to China and the fact that we both look to \nthe Pacific, I don't know if it is the large Chinese-American \npopulation that resides in the State, or just the long cultural history \non which we continue to build. But Washington State companies have been \naggressively pursuing opportunities in China for years.\n  In fact, Boeing signed its first contract with the Chinese Government \nfor 10 707 jetliners in 1972, shortly after President Nixon made his \nfirst visit there. It is amazing that today 60 percent of China's \ncommercial aircraft are Boeing planes.\n  That relationship has grown over a long period of time, and we have \nbenefited. In fact, in 2006 China purchased $7.7 billion dollars' worth \nof Boeing planes. That represents about 112 orders from different \nChinese airlines.\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nToday China is one of the largest opportunities for Boeing. Some have \nestimated the commercial aircraft market could be as large as $280 \nbillion.\n  When we look at these issues, we look at the cooperation and the \neconomic opportunity that has existed for our State. Microsoft is \nanother example. It first opened an office in Beijing in 1992. It is no \nsurprise, when President Hu was visiting the United States, he actually \ncame to Everett and Seattle and Redmond and had an opportunity to be \nhosted by Bill Gates. Microsoft is benefiting greatly from the sales of \ncomputers and legally licensed software in China.\n  More recently, Starbucks has launched hundreds of stores in China. \nWho would have thought that a coffee company would go into a tea-\ndrinking country and have so much success. But China represents roughly \n20 percent of the new international store growth for Starbucks. It has \nbecome Starbucks' most important foreign market.\n  My point in saying this is that I hope, as we have a debate about \ncurrency--and I think it is important that we have a debate about \ncurrency--that we also realize that China is a market. It is a market \nfor U.S. products. No export sector could be of greater interest, I \nbelieve, than the opportunity in the energy and environmental areas.\n  Today, China accounts for about 40 percent of the increase in world \noil demand. The number of passenger vehicles on China's roads has \ntripled since 2001 and may equal the United States by 2030. The Chinese \nface this mass internal transformation from growth and modernization. \nWe have the opportunity to help them with that transition. They are \ntrying to keep pace. In fact, China is adding one huge 1,000-megawatt, \ncoal-fired plant to its grid each week. That is like adding enough \ncapacity every year to serve the entire country of Spain. But even with \nthis new capacity, their country is without predictable electricity.\n  In 2004, China had power shortages in 24 of its 31 provinces and \nautonomous regions, so they are dealing with a challenge to deliver \nenergy to various parts of their country.\n  What is the opportunity? The International Energy Agency estimated \nthat China will spend $2.3 trillion over the next 25 years just to meet \nits growing energy demands, and that modernizing its electricity grid \nwill require about $35 billion annually for the foreseeable future. \nThat is where American technology can come in; that is where we can \nseek new opportunities for U.S. companies. In fact, the same \nInternational Energy Agency has talked about the fact that, if we \ninstitute demand-side management programs where we can leverage \nmodernizing the electricity grid, we can show that investments of $700 \nbillion in the demand side could avoid almost $1.5 trillion in \nadditional generation, transmission, and distribution costs in China \nbetween now and 2030.\n  That is an interesting number. By the United States partnering with \nChina, we would have an opportunity to help them save on their energy \ncosts. What does that mean for us as far as the great opportunity? It \nmeans increasing exports of U.S. goods and services. It means U.S. \nopportunities to grow in the areas that I have mentioned. Good \nopportunities already exist in aerospace and software and coffee but \nthey also can emerge in the energy and environmental sectors.\n  It is interesting to think that China realizes that they have a \nchallenge and that they are trying to diversify into an array of more \nclean energy sources, including wind, solar, biofuels, and clean coal. \nThey are trying to increase productivity and cost savings associated \nwith modernizing the electricity grid.\n  I happened to visit Beijing last November with a group of Washington \nState business leaders that were there to promote long-term \nopportunities for us to work together. It was then that I realized how \nmuch the Chinese Government had embraced and was committed to its goal \nof cutting energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 percent by 2010. \nFor that very short period of time they have tremendous energy goals \nthat we, the United States, can help them meet.\n  Modernizing the domestic energy infrastructure will require an \nestimated $35 billion a year. Again, that is an opportunity for the \nUnited States, exporting existing U.S. products and services, that \ncould help us turn around the trade imbalance.\n  In a speech last month, Premier Wen acknowledged that China must \nfocus on energy conservation and emission reduction in order to both \ndevelop the economy and protect the environment. I think this is an \nopportunity that is before us now as we are part of the Strategic \nEconomic Dialogue with China. Increased U.S.-China cooperation on \nenergy and environment would have tremendous economic, environmental, \nand security benefits for both our nations. It would help make U.S. \ncompanies better positioned for economic opportunities both inside and \noutside China as we develop standards associated with our energy \npolicy.\n  I recently sent a bipartisan letter to the President asking for a \ncomprehensive U.S.-China energy policy and bilateral energy summit. I \nam proud to say that the bipartisan letter, signed by several of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--Senator Smith, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Voinovich--also was signed by the four chairs of \nimportant committees--the Energy Committee, Finance Committee, Foreign \nRelations, and Homeland Security Committee--because I believe that they \nagree that this is an important opportunity for the U.S. and China to \nwork together. In fact, we said, in sending the letter to the \nPresident:\n\n       The way we approach global energy issues will affect the \n     international economy and the world's environment for decades \n     to come. A bilateral U.S.-China energy policy and a summit \n     between our nations to focus on ways to cooperate on energy \n     issues would have tremendous economic benefits for both our \n     nations.\n\n  I hope as the Strategic Economic Dialogue goes forward this week that \na great deal of focus will be placed on energy. When one of my \npredecessors, Warren Magnuson, went to China, he said, ``pretending 700 \nmillion people in the world do not exist is the wrong approach.'' Today \nit is 1.3 billion people. It is time to understand China's internal \ntransformation, our own global energy needs, and our nations' evolving \nrelationship. It is time to see the great promise in our common \ninterests and time to work together on shared challenges and \nopportunities involving energy and the environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes in morning business and that the Senate recess at 12:40 p.m. \ntoday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his courtesy in \nallowing me this time.\n  Madam President, I rise today to focus the attention of the Congress, \nand the attention of the country, upon an issue that is at the heart of \nwhy I asked the people of Pennsylvania to allow me to serve in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  That issue is the well-being of our children and their future.\n  When we greet one another in this country we typically say ``Hello'' \nand ``How are you?'' But the standard greeting of the East African \nMasai people is not, ``How are you?'' but, rather, ``How are the \nchildren?'' This culture embodies the wisdom that the health of any \ncivilization is always a reflection of the well-being of its most \nvulnerable citizens--its children.\n  I am distressed and alarmed that in response to the question, ``How \nare the children,'' the answer today, here in the richest country on \nEarth, is this: The children, and particularly children from low income \nand working families, are not well. Our children are not\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\nfaring well because 6 years of this administration's budget cuts have \ndecimated vital services for children and working families--cuts to \nchildcare assistance, Head Start and other early childhood programs \nthat help children get off to a good start.\n  I am determined to reverse the course this administration has taken \nin slashing funding for critical children's programs and I know that a \ngreat many of my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--are equally \ndetermined. Some of the Presidential candidates have begun talking \nabout the importance of early education and I am heartened by the \nincreased public attention this will garner. If we don't invest money \nto give children--and particularly the most disadvantaged and at risk \nchildren--the services and programs they need in early childhood, they \nwill be at much greater risk of academic failure, drug abuse and even \ncriminal activity when they are older. We can spend upwards of $40,000 \non incarceration, thousands of dollars on drug treatment and special \neducation, or we can spend a small fraction of that now on high quality \npreschool and give children the good start they deserve. We can pay now \nor we can pay later. The choice is ours.\n  On Friday, May 11, I introduced a bill, the Prepare All Kids Act of \n2007.'' The primary goal of my bill is to help States provide high \nquality prekindergarten programs that will prepare children, and \nparticularly disadvantaged children, for a successful transition to \nkindergarten and elementary school. My bill reflects the wisdom that an \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  Most States have either begun or are on the way to developing \nprekindergarten programs. In my own State, the new Pennsylvania Pre-K \nCounts initiative will provide approximately 11,000 3- and 4-year-olds \nwith voluntary, high-quality prekindergarten that is targeted to reach \nchildren most at risk of academic failure. But States need our \nfinancial assistance. My Prepare All Kids Act provides this \nassistance--with conditions and matching commitments from States. \nGrounded in research and best practices, my bill provides a blend of \nState flexibility and high quality standards that will serve children \nwell.\n  Here is a quick summary of the main components of my bill and why \nthey are important for children and families:\n  The Prepare All Kids Act will assist States in providing at least 1 \nyear of high quality prekindergarten to children. Studies show high \nquality prekindergarten programs provide enormous benefits that \ncontinue into adulthood.\n  Prekindergarten will be free for low-income children who need it the \nmost. The cost of prekindergarten can be financially draining and even \nprohibitive for low-income and working families.\n\n  Prekindergarten programs will utilize a research-based curriculum \nthat supports children's cognitive, social, emotional and physical \ndevelopment and individual learning styles. Experts tell us that at the \npreschool stage, social and emotional learning can be as important, \nperhaps even more important, than cognitive learning. This is where \nearly socialization takes place--learning to share, pay attention, work \nindependently, express feelings--all these are critical to successful \nchildhood development.\n  Classrooms will have a maximum of 20 children and children-to-teacher \nratios will be no more than 10 to 1. Children need individualized and \nquality attention to thrive and these requirements provide that.\n  Prekindergarten programs will consist of a 6-hour day. This \nrequirement supports both children and working parents who need high \nquality programs for their children while they work.\n  Prekindergarten teachers will be required to have a bachelor's degree \nat the time they are employed, or obtain one within 6 years. Funding \nunder my bill may also be used for professional development purposes by \nteachers.\n  States will not be able to divert designated funding for other early \nchildhood programs into prekindergarten. We want prekindergarten to \nbuild upon and support other early childhood programs like Head Start \nand child care. We do not want prekindergarten to replace these \nprograms in any way. All these programs are necessary and serve \ndifferent purposes.\n  Prekindergarten programs will be accountable to a State monitoring \nplan that will appropriately measure individual program effectiveness.\n  Infant and toddler programs will receive a portion of the funding. \nThese programs typically receive the lowest dollars of all early \nchildhood programs, making it difficult for working parents, many of \nthem single mothers, to find quality child care for the youngest of \nchildren.\n  A portion of funding will be used to create extended day and extended \nyear programs. Working families struggle to afford high quality care \nfor their children during after-school hours and the summer months--\nthis provision will increase the availability of good options.\n  Finally, my bill supports the important role of parents in the \neducation of their young children by encouraging parental involvement \nin programs and assisting families in getting the supportive services \nthey may need. Children come in families and to truly help children, we \nhave to involve and support their parents.\n  There is one additional component of my bill that I'd like to \nhighlight. My bill ensures that prekindergarten providers will \ncollaborate and coordinate with other early childhood providers so that \nprekindergarten programs can support and build upon existing programs \nand services for children. This is a very high priority for me. For \nexample, Head Start has provided effective and comprehensive early \neducation to the most economically disadvantaged children for the past \n40 years. And community-based childcare providers are absolutely vital \nto the well being of our children. In crafting my bill and establishing \na new Federal funding source for State prekindergarten programs, I have \nzealously protected the importance of Federal support and funding for \nHead Start and childcare programs. All these programs are necessary for \na system of early childhood education that truly serves children and \nfamilies by providing families with multiple options, avoiding \nduplication of services, and giving children access to the services and \nsupport they need to get the best possible start in life.\n\n  I believe that investing in our children is our moral responsibility. \nBut for anyone who needs additional reasons, decades of research on the \nlife outcomes of children who have attended early education programs \nprove the wisdom of this investment.\n  A landmark study of the Perry Preschool Program in Michigan began in \n1962. Children were randomly assigned to attend the preschool or not, \nand then tracked over many years to measure the long-term impact of \nhigh quality preschool. By age 27, the children excluded from the \nprogram were five times more likely to have been chronic law-breakers \nthan those who attended the program. By age 40, those who did not \nattend the Perry Preschool program were more than twice as likely to be \narrested for violent crimes. Those who did not attend the Perry \nPreschool Program were also more likely to abuse illegal drugs.\n  The research also confirms that high quality prekindergarten programs \nnot only keep children out of trouble, they help children succeed \nacademically. Children in the Perry Preschool Program were 31 percent \nmore likely to graduate from high school than children who did not \nattend the program. Children who were not enrolled in the Perry \nPreschool Program were also twice as likely to be placed in special \neducation classes.\n  Another long-term study comparing 989 children in the Chicago Child-\nParent Center to 550 similar children who were not in the program \nshowed that children who did not participate in the program were 70 \npercent more likely to be arrested for a violent crime by age 18. \nChildren who attended the program were 23 percent more likely to \ngraduate from high school.\n  So we know that high-quality early education is invaluable for \nchildren. They do better in school, they're less likely to repeat a \ngrade or be held back, less likely to need remedial help or special \neducation. And they are less likely to engage in delinquency, drug use \nand other dangerous behaviors. But the research shows much more.\n  It turns out that these investments in young children save us quite a \nbit of money. Specifically, for every dollar invested, high quality \nearly education\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nprograms save more than $17 in other costs. That is what I call a smart \ninvestment. Many leading economists agree that funding high-quality \nprekindergarten is among the best investments government can make. An \nanalysis by Arthur Rolnick, senior vice president and director of \nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, showed that the \nreturn on the investment of the Perry Preschool Program was 16 percent \nafter adjusting for inflation. Seventy-five percent of that return went \nto the public in the form of decreased special education expenditures, \ncrime costs, and welfare payments.\n  To put this in perspective, the long-term average return on U.S. \nstocks is 7 percent after adjusting for inflation. Thus, while an \ninitial investment of $1,000 in the stock market is likely to return \nless than $4,000 in 20 years, the same investment in a program like the \nPerry Preschool is likely to return more than $19,000 in the same time \nperiod. William Gale and Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution \nobserve that investing in early childhood education provides government \nand society ``with estimated rates of return that would make a venture \ncapitalist envious.''\n  With research as clear and compelling as this, I defy anyone to give \nme one good reason why we are not investing more--much more--in sound \nearly education for our children.\n  I guess we shouldn't be surprised, though, that despite the evidence, \nthis administration has gone in the opposite direction. Under this \nadministration, cuts to early childhood programs have hurt hundreds of \nthousands of children and the numbers are only growing. Head Start has \nbeen cut 11 percent since 2002. The National Head Start Association \ncalculates that by 2008 our country will have 30,399 fewer children in \nHead Start than in 2007--that figure includes nearly 1,100 children \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The President has also called for a freeze in funding for child care \nassistance--for the sixth year in a row. Currently, only 1 in 7 \neligible children receives Federal childcare subsidies. Years of flat \nfunding have already resulted in the loss of child care assistance for \n150,000 children. By 2010, 300,000 more children are slated to lose \nout. In my own State, the current trajectory will mean the loss of $14 \nmillion in childcare assistance by 2012.\n  This is, very simply, unacceptable. And it is profoundly wrong. And \nit is fiscally irresponsible.\n  I began my remarks this morning with the question, ``How are the \nChildren?'' The current answer to that question is not acceptable\n  It is my deep conviction that as elected public servants, we have a \nsacred responsibility to ensure that all children in this country have \nthe opportunity to grow to responsible adulthood, the opportunity to \nrealize their fullest potential, to live the lives they were born to \nlive. The Protect All Kids Act is a big step in that direction, and I \nask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Everything we do \nin Congress has some impact--in one way or another and for good or for \nbad--upon the well being of our children. Our children are our future. \nWith everything we do we must ask ourselves, ``How are the children?'' \nWe cannot rest until the answer to this most fundamental of questions \nis: The children--all the children--are well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6422-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1348, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1348) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Kennedy/Specter) amendment No. 1150, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, is recognized for up to 2 hours.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair for recognition and \nwant to continue the discussion on the very important piece of \nlegislation that is now before the Senate.\n  I do believe the immigration system is comprehensively broken. I have \nsaid for some time we need a comprehensive solution to it, to \ncomprehensively reform it, but to reform it in a way that will actually \nwork, that will do it with principles we can adhere to in the future, \nthat will move us from a lawless system of immigration.\n  Most people may not know but 1.1 million people are arrested each \nyear entering our country illegally. Think about the cost and personnel \ninvolved in processing that many people. It is a system that is not \nworking. We know many people are getting by the border and not being \napprehended.\n  It rightly causes the American people to question how serious we are \nin Congress when we say we want to do something about it. They believe \nwe should do something about it. We say we want to do something about \nit, but eventually, as time goes along, for one reason or another, \nlittle ever seems to occur that actually works.\n  I have stated more than once we can pass a lot of legislation in this \nSenate dealing with immigration, but if you offer something that will \nactually work, to actually fix the problem, to actually be effective, \nwe always have much wailing and crying and gnashing of teeth, and \nusually those things do not become law.\n  Last year, I was very critical of the bill that was offered. I said \nit was fatally flawed. I said it should be withdrawn and urged my \ncolleagues that if we drafted a bill for this session of Congress it \nshould not be based on last year's fatally flawed bill but that we \nshould start over and create a system that would create a genuine \ntemporary worker program, not the flawed program that was there last \nyear, that would move us toward a Canadian-based system where people \nall over the world could apply to our country, and they would be \nselected based on their merits and the skills and abilities they bring \nthat would be valuable to our country.\n  I noted that we needed, of course, effective border enforcement as \nwell as workplace enforcement, and we ought not to create a system that \ngives someone who enters our country illegally every single benefit we \ngive to those who come to the country legally. The legal people do \ndeserve to be treated in a different way than those who come illegally.\n  Now, I know as a matter of compassion and practicality we have to \nwrestle with the 12 million people here. I never doubted that. Nobody \ndoubts that. How we deal with it, though, is a matter that will \ndetermine what policies we, as a nation, adhere to. It will send a \nsignal to people all over the world that we are actually going to \ninsist that we have a legal system of immigration and we intend to \nenforce it.\n  It is one thing to have a law, but if you are not prepared to enforce \nit and go through the process that is oftentimes painful to catch \nsomeone who violated the law and then have them deported--oftentimes \nthat is a painful process--you either are going to do that or we might \nas well admit here we have no intention of enforcing any laws.\n  I do not think that is what we do. Almost every Senator has stated \nthey want a lawful system of immigration, Republicans and Democrats. I \ndo not think we have a problem. I would say yesterday and last week I \nhad a very great concern that a plan was afoot to get cloture on the \nbill yesterday. The old bill, which I steadfastly believe is not an \neffective piece of legislation, would then be substituted by a new \npiece of legislation. That happened last night. It is approximately 300 \npages of fine print and maybe 1,000 pages of the kind of legislative \nbill language we normally use here. It is one of the largest pieces of \nlegislation to be introduced since I have been in the Senate. I think \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Landrieu, might remember some of the \nomnibus bills may have been that big, but I cannot remember a single \npiece of legislation since I have been in the Senate that would be 800 \nto 1,000 pages.\n  So the scheme or the plan was to try to move that through this week. \nI am\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\nglad Senator Harry Reid, a man whom I enjoy working with, did agree \nlast night he would not try to move this bill through this week, that \nwe would be able to talk about it this week, that we would be in recess \nfor Memorial Day, and the next week after that we would have another \nfull week of discussions. I think we need more than that.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague Senator Inhofe is in the Chamber. \nI say to the Senator, I know he has a tight schedule, and when he is \nready to make his remarks, I would be pleased to yield to him.\n  We are on the track now to have a full week of discussion. But it \nwould be unfortunate, indeed, if my colleagues in the Senate, if the \nAmerican people, were not to utilize that time to ask seriously what it \nis we are about in this ``grand compromise'' that has been proposed for \nus.\n  I think there is a possibility that good legislation could yet come \nout of this that would be worthy of passing. I am aware, as so many of \nus are, of the language from the supporters of this compromise that, \nwell, they say: Nothing is perfect. The perfect is the enemy of the \ngood. There are a lot of things in the bill I don't like. I think there \nare things that could be better, and that sort of thing, but I am for \nit.\n  I would ask why it is we do not take out those things that are not \ngood? Why it is we do not create a bill we can be proud of and that \neliminates weaknesses and problems? Because like jumping across a 10-\nfoot ravine, jumping 9 feet is not good enough. If you jump 9 feet, you \nstill fall to your doom. So let's create a system that will work. Many \nof the defects are of such a nature that could actually undermine the \nvery principles that have been stated as the basis for this compromise. \nIf we cannot accomplish those principles, why do it?\n  There are some good things in the bill and some things I am very \ntroubled with. We will talk about them more as we go along.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Oklahoma. We serve together \non the Armed Services Committee and I admire him greatly. He cares \nabout our soldiers and has spent more time in Iraq than any Member of \nthe House or the Senate, I suppose, meeting with our soldiers and \ntrying to figure out the best way to handle our efforts there. I admire \nhim greatly, Senator Jim Inhofe.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I thank the Senator very much for the \ntime.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Madam President, before getting into this bill, I want to comment \nthat last week when I was there--it was my 14th time to be in the AOR \nof the Middle East and where the conflict is--the progress that is \nbeing made there is incredible. I sat here and I heard a couple \nSenators talk about how bad things were there and that we are losing \nand all this.\n  This is the first time--I remember a year ago in Ramadi they actually \ndeclared Ramadi was going to be the al-Qaida capital of the Middle East \nor the terrorist capital of the Middle East. Right now, it is \ncompletely changed. IEDs are down 81 percent. Attacks are down 74 \npercent. Then, next door at Fallujah, they are now totally under the \nsecurity of the Iraqi security forces.\n  So all these good things are happening there. I wish Members of this \nSenate would go over there and see for themselves instead of trying to \nuse it politically to advance their careers. You are doing a great \ndisservice to our troops over there.\n  But that is not why I am here in the Chamber.\n  I appreciate the comments that have been made by the Senator from \nAlabama. I agree with everything he has said. My concern is at 2 a.m. \non Saturday morning is when all this came up. We did not have any way \nof knowing exactly what was in it. Yet I am concerned about all sorts \nof things, such as how do you make a Z visa work.\n  But the reason I want to have a little time right now is because I do \nhave an amendment. It is my understanding I will be able to call up \nthis amendment for consideration after the Senator from North Dakota \nhas his up, and that will be later this afternoon.\n  My amendment is the English amendment. Those Members on the floor can \nremember a year ago I got an amendment adopted that made English the \nnational language for the United States of America. It passed by a vote \nof 62 to 35. There are some extremist groups that opposed it and, quite \nfrankly, some of the liberal Members of the Senate were afraid to vote \nfor it without having a backup where they could negate it. This is what \nhappened. They voted for my amendment.\n  The amendment is very simple. It says there is not an entitlement for \nlanguage, other than the English language, to be given to people who \nwant Government services. Very simple. That is the same way over 50 \nother countries, including Ghana in West Africa, have it.\n  The Presiding Officer knows I have spent a lot of time in Africa on \nsome of the same programs she has been involved with, and most of the \ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa--the ones that speak English--all have \nEnglish as their national language. Thirty states have it as their \nnational language, but not we in the United States of America.\n  There is going to be an effort on my part to get this in the bill, \nand I am going to use the same text I had last time.\n  It is interesting when you hear different Presidents talk about this \nissue. In 1999, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton \nsaid:\n\n       Our new immigrants must be part of our one America . . . \n     that means learning English.\n\n  Everyone said ``hooray,'' and then he came along with an executive \norder right after that which did away with that statement completely.\n  President Bush said:\n\n       The key to unlocking the full promise of America is the \n     ability to speak English.\n\n  We know how many States have adopted this. The polling is incredible. \nA 2006 Zogby poll reported 84 percent of Americans--I have polls \nshowing up to 91 percent--said English should be the national language. \nAnd 77 percent of Hispanics polled by that Zogby poll said the same \nthing. This poll was in 2006, only a year ago, demonstrating how many \nAmericans believe English should be our national language. Establishing \nEnglish as a national language should not be viewed as a partisan \nissue. It is widely supported throughout the country.\n  In this Congress, in this immigration debate, I am again offering my \namendment to make English the national language. My amendment would \naccomplish three things. No. 1, it would establish English as the \nnational language of the United States of America. No. 2, it would \nestablish that the official business of the Federal Government should \nbe conducted in English, and eliminates all of the entitlements people \nwould have for language other than English. Now, it does respect \ncurrent law. For example, we have the Court Interpreters Act. The Court \nInterpreters Act is necessary to support the sixth amendment, the right \nto counsel, and we are making sure this doesn't affect that in a \nnegative way.\n\n  So we create no restriction of providing materials of other languages \nand allow certain exceptions where it is specifically mandated by \nstatute. We made that very clear.\n  My amendment does not prohibit the use of other languages. However, \nmy amendment states:\n\n       There is no entitlement to individuals that Federal \n     agencies must act, communicate, perform, or provide services \n     or materials in any language other than English.\n\n  So it is hypocritical that the immigration legislation we are \nconsidering now contains a section generally recognizing the importance \nof English. However, this section 702 of this immigration legislation \ndoes not establish English as a national language.\n  Now, we had this debate. We were on the Senate floor and debating \nthis about a year ago right now, and people were hesitant to vote \nagainst it. We had every kind of excuse in the world. They came \ntrotting in here with State flags that had foreign languages on them \nsaying: We would have to do away with all of these State flags.\n  It has nothing to do with that. We are talking about entitlements.\n  We had one Member come in and say: You are going to be responsible \nfor the deaths of Hispanics.\n  I said: Explain that.\n  This Member on the Senate floor, right down here, said: Well, you \nknow, they have some bad currents down in\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\nthe Potomac, and we have ``no swimming'' signs that are written in \nSpanish. If you don't have those, then people are going to drown.\n  This has nothing to do with that. You can put up any kind of sign you \nwant that is in the best public interest.\n  We had one Member come down and say: You would never be able to speak \nin Spanish on the floor of the Senate.\n  Well, that has nothing to do with it. I have made a few speeches in \nSpanish, and there is a reason for it which I will not go into now. But \nthese are things that people say are problems and things that just \ndon't hold up.\n  Now, I think it should be pointed out--because a very good friend of \nmine was on a television station this morning, and I know this \nindividual would not have said what he said if he were aware of the \ntruth, but let me just bring this out. A year ago, when I had my \namendment, which would do essentially what the amendment will do if it \nis passed today, Senator Salazar from Colorado came up with an \namendment right afterwards. In fact, we voted on it in a matter of \nminutes after we voted on mine, 62 to 35, and his passed also. All his \ndid was offer language that is totally different from mine.\n  For example, I am going to read his. It didn't say English is the \nnational language, it says it is a common language.\n\n       Preserving and Enhancing the Role of the English Language: \n     The Government of the United States shall preserve and \n     enhance the role of English as the language of the United \n     States.\n\n  But listen to this:\n\n       Nothing herein shall diminish or expand any existing rights \n     under the laws of the United States relevant to services or \n     materials provided by the Government of the United States in \n     any language other than English.\n\n  There it is, folks: ``Nothing herein shall diminish or expand . . .'' \nIn other words, it is going to continue to be the same.\n  Now, there are a lot of people out there who are going to be looking \nat this amendment. Americans are clamoring to have this done. They \ndon't understand why we don't do this. I don't understand it either. \nBut this language is found in the current immigration bill.\n  Down here under ``definition'' in section 702, which was in the \nlanguage that was put in 2 minutes after my vote took place a year ago, \nit says:\n\n       For the purposes of this section, law is defined as \n     including provisions of the United States Constitution, the \n     United States Code, controlling judicial decisions, \n     regulations, and Presidential Executive Orders.\n\n  Now, this is a very significant one because what you hear about quite \noften is President Clinton's Executive Order No. 13166 entitlement, \nwhich offers entitlement to translation in any language of your choice, \nanyone who receives any Federal funds. Well, that completely opens the \ndoor for every possible language. A lot of people think we are only \ntalking about Spanish. That is not correct. That Executive order refers \nto any language at all. This bill we are considering that I will oppose \nhas language in there that would codify that Executive Order No. 13166, \nand I think it is one that people have to understand.\n  The Senator from Alabama is not back, so I will take a little bit \nmore time. I am going to read the language now that is actually in the \namendment which says English shall be the national language of the \nGovernment of the United States: The Government of the United States \nshall preserve and enhance the role of English as the national language \nof the United States of America, unless specifically provided by \nstatute.\n\n  Now, I use as an example the court interpreters law, existing law \nright now. It says, unless specifically provided by statute, no person \nhas a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the United \nStates or any of its officials or representatives act, communicate, \nperform, or provide services or provide materials in any language other \nthan English. If an exception is made with respect to the use of a \nlanguage other than English, the exception does not create a legal \nentitlement to additional services in that language or in any language \nother than English.\n  Forms--it says:\n\n       If any form is issued by the Federal Government in any \n     language other than English, or such form is completed in a \n     language other than English, the English language version of \n     the form is the sole authority for all legal purposes.\n\n  Again, there is one sentence in there that says:\n\n       Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of language \n     other than English if it is codified into law.\n\n  That is what we use the Court Interpreters Act for, and a few others, \nwhere there is a constitutional reason--in this case it is the sixth \namendment to the Constitution--for having that language in there.\n  So what I will do until the Senator from Alabama returns is mention a \nfew other things I think are significant. This is not a new issue. This \nis an old issue, and the old issue goes back to many years ago, to \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt in the 1900s:\n\n       Let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn \n     English, but that he has got to learn it. He has got to \n     consider the interests of the United States or he should not \n     stay here. He must be made to see that his opportunities in \n     this country depend on his knowing English and observing \n     American standards. The employer cannot be permitted to \n     regard him only as an industrial asset.\n\n  Now, that was President Theodore Roosevelt in 1916. I could go \nthrough--we have them all the way up, including Ronald Reagan and other \nPresidents. Later on, I will go over the polling data. Later on, if we \nhave a chance to present this and debate this amendment, I am going to \ngo over all the polling data. You cannot find any polling data that \nsays less than 84 percent of the American people want to have English \nas the national language.\n  So even LaRaza, an extremist, leftwing group, says they found in a \n2004 poll that LaRaza did, 97 percent strongly--86 percent--97 percent \nthat is strongly or somewhat agreed that the ability to speak English \nis important to succeed in this country. That is the extremist group. \nIn other words, if you want to be an attorney or a doctor instead of a \nbusboy, you need to learn the language.\n  Now, I see the Senator from Alabama is back, but let me just repeat \nthe one thing that I think is very important because so many of our own \nMembers--Republicans and Democrats--believe somehow this bill \npositively addresses the problem or it makes English the national \nlanguage. I am going to go ahead and tell you that when they put \nsection 702 in instead of my language, section 701, all they said is \nEnglish is a common language in the United States. Big deal. But it \nsays in here:\n\n       Nothing herein shall diminish or expand any existing rights \n     under the laws of the United States relative to services or \n     materials provided by the Government of the United States in \n     any language other than English.\n\n  Well, there it is, I say to my friend from Alabama. Nothing in here \nwould diminish or expand. In other words, it is going to stay like it \nis today. But then it goes on to say--and this is the critical thing--\nall the criticism of President Clinton when he passed Executive Order \nNo. 13166, which was an entitlement for a translator in any language \nyou want other than English, or the language of your choice if you are \na recipient of Federal funds. So that definition, if we pass this \nbill--which I don't think we are going to, and which I don't want to \nfor many other reasons--but if we pass it, we would say for the \npurposes of this section of law, the law is defined as including \nprovisions of the U.S. Constitution, the United States Code, \ncontrolling judicial decisions, regulation, and Presidential Executive \norders. In other words, we are codifying this very Executive Order that \nso many people in America find so offensive.\n  So I think this is an opportunity to put this in. Quite frankly, I \nthink unless the bill would be dramatically changed, I still wouldn't \nsupport the bill, but we need to have every opportunity we can, when we \nare addressing problems with immigrants or legislation of this nature, \nto make English the national language. Ninety percent of the American \npeople are for it, 77 percent of the Hispanics are for it, and I am for \nit.\n  I thank my colleague very much for his time, I say to the Senator \nfrom Alabama, who has done a great job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe for sharing this \nwith us. I think he understands, and all of us need to understand, as \nwe continue the flow of immigration at a level we have not sustained \nbefore in our history. Once or twice we have peaked at immigration \nlevels close to what we have today. Most of those immigrants, in fact, \nor many of them, spoke English. Regardless of that, we are sustaining a \nlevel of immigration that is unprecedented in American history.\n  People are coming from all over the world, and English is being \ntaught all over the world. What we need to understand is that it is \neven more important now that we officially and systematically and \neffectively emphasize that English is the unifying language because, as \nyou have greater and greater numbers of people who don't speak English \nas a native language, encouraging, requiring, incentivizing English as \nthe national language is the glue that can hold us together and can \navoid cultural divisions that we might otherwise have.\n  I think the American people understand that, as the polling data of \nSenator Inhofe showed. Hispanic voters, when they are told about this, \nrecognize it is critical for their children who are going--for them to \nreceive the greatest benefits of the American dream, to flourish in our \nculture and our economy, that they be able to speak English. For some \nreason, we went through a period--and hopefully we are coming out of \nit--where we felt it necessary to try to communicate in foreign \nlanguages to other people, therefore diminishing their incentive to \nlearn English and weakening our commitment as a nation that English \nshould be the unifying language.\n  I thank the Senator for raising this subject, and I believe it is \nimportant.\n  I will just say one more thing. A lot of nations do have trouble \ngetting along. Oftentimes, it goes down language lines. We have even \nseen our neighbors in Canada almost divide over French and English \nportions of the country. They wanted to separate from one another, and \nwe see that around the world. So if we are to remain a nation of \nimmigrants, and we are going to do that, I think it may be even more \nimportant today that we emphasize the unifying language of English than \nwe ever have before.\n  I think most people when they came here wanted their children to \nlearn English, and they did so. But we have a situation today that \ncould get away from us in terms of transmitting to them the benefits of \ncitizenship, the benefits of our economy because, if they can't \ncommunicate, it won't be effective.\n  The bipartisan negotiations that were carried out in an attempt to \nreach a good bill set forth some principles. Those principles seem to \nbe the ones that were leaked as part of a PowerPoint presentation that \nthe White House worked on. That presentation was made to me. I thought \nit was pretty good. I thought it was a much better framework for \nimmigration than last year's bill. I said repeatedly in recent weeks \nthat we had a framework superior to last year's bill that could \nactually lead us to something important.\n\n  Unfortunately, the four main principles that were so often talked \nabout--the trigger, a temporary worker program, the elimination of \nchain migration, and the creation of a merit system and no amnesty for \nthe illegal alien population--are insufficiently effectuated by this \nlegislation. They have the appearance of doing those things and maybe \nin a few areas improve over current law or last year's bill, but they \ndon't effectively carry it out. So I am worried about that situation.\n  I am worried that, yes, our supporters say: We have problems with the \nbill, but overall it is good. If we have problems with the bill, let's \nlook at those problems, let's see if they can be fixed, and let's make \na better bill. Let's not pass a bill that we tell the American people \nis going to fix the immigration problem in America when it has \nloopholes and weaknesses that will not work and will not accomplish \nwhat we are promising--what some are promising--will occur if it is \npassed. I worry when people say they disagree with large portions of \nthe bill, yet they are for it.\n  Let's talk about some of the principles that were asserted.\n  Last year, when this bill was jammed through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am a member, I came up with the idea--actually, \nit came to me in an interesting way. I realized, why, when I offer \namendments on enforcement and to spend more money on this or that item, \npeople would accept them in committee. If you offered an amendment that \nwould change policy--empower State and local law enforcement officers, \nfor example, to participate--you got a push back from other policy \nmatters, but they would just accept any amendment that would spend more \nmoney on enforcement. You ask yourself: Why is that so? That is so \nbecause they were not spending any money. We are the Judiciary \nCommittee, an authorization committee. We cannot appropriate a dime. So \nwe can authorize money for border patrol, we can authorize fencing, we \ncan authorize prison systems, we can authorize an entry-exit visa \nsystem, but if nobody comes up with the money to pay for it, it never \nbecomes law. Do you see?\n  So I suggested on the question of amnesty that no amnesty be allowed \nuntil we have a certification by the Secretary of Homeland Security \nthat the border was secure and that this would be a trigger. The \ntrigger for amnesty would be a certification that the border laws were \nenforced. That was the philosophy behind the trigger amendment on which \nSenator Isakson worked so hard on the floor. It was not adopted in \ncommittee last year, and when we had a full debate on it, the people \nwho were supporting last year's fatally flawed bill said: Oh, this goes \nto the core of the bill. We can't support this. It might be OK, but the \ncoalition that put this bill together won't support it. It will cause \nit to fall apart. So they voted it down by a fairly close margin, but \nvoted it down.\n  So now we are told: OK, we need a trigger. So one of the principles \nof this bill is to have a trigger in it. Let me show why I think there \nare some weaknesses in that trigger and it is not as effective as it \nneeds to be. As a matter of fact, it is not very powerful at all. It \napplies only to the new guest worker program, but all other amnesty \nprograms will begin immediately. In other words, the legalization \nprocess, the Z visas that allow people to stay here, will be issued \nbefore any of these steps are actually taken. See, we want to be sure \nthat steps are not just promised but are actually taken, paid for, and \nimplemented, because in 1986 what happened was amnesty was given--and \nthey did not deny calling it amnesty in 1986--amnesty was given on a \npromise of enforcement, and they never funded the enforcement. They \njust never did it. We had 3 million illegal people here in 1986, and we \nhave 12 million today. So Congresses and the Presidents since 1986 and \nbefore 1986 have never taken these matters seriously and given them the \npriority needed to be successful.\n  We have that weakness in the trigger which I mentioned. The \nlegalization process will occur before any of these items are required \nto be funded and executed.\n  Secondly, the trigger only requires enforcement benchmarks already in \nthe works, almost accomplished. So it does not require anything new. It \ndoes not require one critical thing, I believe, which is a U.S. visit \nexit system. You come into the country and show your identification. \nThe new system we should have and proponents suggest is in this bill \nwould say you come in with your identification, you show it at the \nborder, you work. When your time is up, you are supposed to exit the \ncountry. But there is no system to record whether anybody exits. This \nwas required to have been implemented by 2005. It has been put off and \nput off. Why? Because it creates a system, I suggest, that would \nactually work. It is a key component of an honest, effective border \ncontrol system. If a spouse comes to visit a temporary worker for 30 \ndays, how do we know they will ever leave? Who is going to keep up with \nthis? Do people think agents are going out knocking on people's doors \nto see if their visiting spouses are still here? That is not the way \nthe system is going to work. So an exit system is not part of a trigger \nrequirement.\n  The language we wanted and was in the Secure Fence Act that we passed \nlast year requires the Department of\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nHomeland Security to attain operational control of the border. That is \nthe fundamental principle of the trigger from the beginning. None \nof that language is in this bill. It does not require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to certify operational control of the border. So we \ndon't have a very great trigger.\n\n  Also, it requires under the trigger 18,000 Border Patrol agents to be \nemployed--not that we hire new ones whom we plan to hire even above \nthat but only the 18,000 who mostly are already there now.\n  Last year, right before the election, we passed legislation that \nrequires the construction of 700 miles of fencing. Will that fence ever \nget built? I suggest that my colleagues read the fine print. We see \nalready the fence is being undermined. There is no trigger requirement \nthat occurs. Only 370 miles of fencing and 200 miles of vehicle \nbarriers are part of the trigger. These have been in the works and some \nfencing already exists, and that should be there. But that leaves about \n300 miles not part of the contingency, and we don't know if the money \nwill ever be there for this 300 miles which we authorized just last \nfall. Do my colleagues follow me? Just because we authorized fencing \nlast fall does not mean it will ever be built. If you want to say that \nis a shell game, I have to agree. It is done all the time around here. \nIt is particularly done on immigration matters.\n  Bed space: We currently have 27,500 detention beds. What does a \ntrigger require before the amnesty process can go forward? It requires \n27,500, what we already have. But the bill, in a separate section of \nthis legislation, would require 20,000 additional beds to be built \nbecause we need them. It is an essential part of gaining control of the \nborder. Mr. President, 20,000 is not that large a number in the scheme \nof things, but it can get us to a tipping point where the border can be \nbrought under control. But that is not part of the trigger. There are \nother matters in the trigger that are not available.\n  I will note this: If you want to be dubious about the intent of the \ndrafters of this legislation to follow through on some of the things \nthey promise, let me tell you how the bill words it. It is filled with \nphrases such as ``subject to the availability of appropriations'' and \n``authorized to be appropriated.'' Those words are used in the \nlegislation 38 times--``authorized to be appropriated.'' You can \nauthorize a fence in this legislation, but this is not an \nappropriations bill. Unless the Congress comes along and funds it, it \nwill never be built. Worse than that, it has ``subject to the \navailability of appropriations.'' That is a real suggestion by \nsomebody, I would argue, who never intends to see that section funded \nappropriately. That was one of the principles.\n  I am disappointed in the trigger. We were told we would have a real \ntemporary worker program this year, one that would fit the needs of \nbusinesses, and they do have needs, and the agriculture community, and \nthey do have needs, and we would create one that would actually work. \nBut I am afraid this one is set to fail. It is better than last year's \nbill in a number of ways. Let me tell you how it is better, and that is \nthe good news.\n  Last year, the temporary worker program allowed an individual to come \nto this country as a temporary worker for 3 years, and they could bring \ntheir spouses and children with them. Then they could extend that 3 \nyears another 3 years, another 3 years, another 3 years--I think \nindefinitely. Mr. President, 3 years, 3 years, 3 years, as long as you \nlive, and your spouses and children can be here, and any children born \nhere would be American citizens at birth. The first year the person was \nhere, they could apply through their employer for a green card, \npermanent legal residence, which would put them on the pathway to \ncitizenship within 5 years. That was a temporary guest worker program.\n  I say that to my colleagues because we need to be alert to the fact \nthat just because it says we have a trigger, just because we have a \ntemporary worker program, when you read the fine print, it may not be \nwhat it appears to be. So that was a disaster. That wasn't a temporary \nworker program at all. After a family has been here for 8, 10, 12 \nyears, their children are in junior high school. Who is going to come \nand get them and send them home? That is a program which had no chance \nwhatsoever. But the sponsors went around for months saying we have \ncreated a temporary guest worker program. That was not so, and I am \nglad eventually that came to be exposed for what it was.\n  This year's bill says, as part of the principles, that we would have \na temporary worker program where the temporary workers did not bring \nfamilies. That changes the dynamics dramatically because if they don't \nbring families, they have an incentive to go home. If they bring their \nfamilies, their incentive is to put roots down and stay. It is not a \ntemporary worker program, in my view.\n  So how did it come out in real fine print? In fine print, what we \nunderstand is it is not a 3-year program but a 2-year program; that 20 \npercent of the temporary workers can bring their families, and of the \nremaining 80 percent, their families can visit up to 30 days. Well, \nlet's say that your spouse is pregnant and you are working here \ntemporarily. You could ask that spouse to come to America for a visit \nand have good health care and have a child born who would have dual \ncitizenship, or maybe they would stay in the United States and the \nchild can be a citizen because of birthright citizenship. There are \nsome problems with this.\n\n  I am troubled by the 2-year situation and the way it works. You come \nfor 2 years, you would go home for 1 year; you come back for another 2 \nyears, you would go home for a year; come back a third time for 2 \nyears, and then you could never come back again.\n  What we have in the agriculture community is circularity, where \npeople come for 8, 10, 11 months a year, maybe, without their families, \nand they work for a season, maybe 8 months, and go home. They are based \nand their home is among their family and their kin in the town or city \nor village they grew up in. They go to their church in their \nneighborhood.\n  So that is the way that worked, and I was hoping, or thought we would \nmove in that direction. But, no, it looks like it is a 2-year deal, \nwhere you can bring your spouse to visit for 30 days, and 20 percent \nwould be able to have their spouses with them the entire stay. They \nhave to post a small bond. But that is not a defining event, I think.\n  What about the numbers? When I first asked, as they moved the \nPowerPoint presentation around, how many guest workers, temporary \nworkers was contemplated in this program, I was told about 200,000 by \nan official in the Bush administration. Well, what do we have now? We \nhave 400,000 to 600,000 workers a year who come up for 2 years at a \ntime and go home for 1 year in between. But if you have 400,000 in this \nyear and they stay for 2 years, and next year you have another 400,000 \nto go next year, then in years 2 and 3 you are at 800,000, except there \nis an escalating clause in there that will probably take it well above \n900,000--follow me?--instead of 200,000 or 400,000, the real mechanism \ninvolved in the temporary guest worker program is to create numbers \nthat amount to almost a million guest workers.\n  Now, these guest workers are different from the 12 million who will \nbe given legal status here. It is different from the 1 million to 2 \nmillion flow of people who will be coming into the country on the \ncitizenship track. This would be 1 million here as guest workers. So \nyou see, we have to get these numbers straight. How many people are \nbeing let in by this bill? We are having a hard time getting it out.\n  Remember, the bill was only introduced last night. A staff offered \ndraft copy of it was produced Saturday morning. So who knows for sure? \nWho can say for certain what this actually means? I tell you, we intend \nto look at it, and we intend to make sure the Members of the Senate and \nthe American people understand how big an impact this is.\n  What we do know, from last year's bill, even after Senator Bingaman \noffered two amendments that passed, and I offered one to reduce the \noverall numbers, it dropped from 80 million to 200 million over 20 \nyears. Let me go back and repeat that. Last year's bill, as introduced \non the floor, the McCain-Kennedy bill, would have allowed into our \ncountry 78 million to 200 million people in 20 years. Now, we only have \n300 million in America at this time. Do\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nyou understand the significance of that?\n  I don't know if they knew those numbers or somebody was trying to \npull a fast one, but it was breathtaking. We came up with those \nnumbers. The Heritage Foundation was doing an independent analysis, and \nthey came up with very similar numbers. So Senator Bingaman offered two \namendments and I offered one that passed and it reduced the number to \n53 million. Real progress; right? Not so fast.\n  The current rate of immigration over 20 years in our country is 18.9 \nmillion, maybe closer to 20 million. So it was at 53 million, which is \n2\\1/2\\ times the current rate of immigration. So I don't think the \nAmerican people who thought we were reforming immigration ever \nunderstood that the real plan was to increase legal immigration by 2\\1/\n2\\ times.\n  So I am worried about the numbers in this year's bill, is all I am \nsaying. We are going to look at it. I haven't been able to figure it \nout yet, but my super staff is getting close, and we are going to keep \nworking on it. But that needs to be acknowledged. I think there is \ngoing to be push-back on this huge number of temporary workers, which \nappears to me to be three times what the administration suggested to \nme, this year, would be an appropriate number. Of course, the President \nis bent on having workers for everybody who needs one.\n  The 2 years, the 2 years, and the 2 years, let us say a person came \nas a temporary worker and they worked 2 years and went home; worked 2 \nyears and went home; worked 2 years and went home. There are bad things \nthat occur from that program as a practical matter. Is the employer \ngoing to depend on this person every 2 years, when that worker has to \ngo home? That is not practical to me. Then they are finished. They, \nperhaps, had no desire to live in America permanently or become a \ncitizen of America but wanted to be a temporary worker. Yet now they \nare put in a position where they have to apply for a green card and \ncitizenship and try to compete on this permanent citizenship track so \nthey can keep working. For people who may have no desire to apply for a \ngreen card, they would have to, under this system. So I think it \ncreates a magnet for dual citizenship in a way that is not necessary.\n  I think it would complicate the life of a business to have this break \nin their employment. I would like to see a system, myself, in which a \nperson could come 10 months a year in America, or less--they may want \nto work less--and they would have a good ID so they could go back and \nforth to visit their family or their home as many times as they chose. \nThey would go home each year for several months and could come back the \nnext year, if they chose and if the employer wanted and if they were \ncertified to come back and hadn't been convicted of a crime or done \nanything else that would disqualify them. That, to me, makes more \nsense. Maybe the drafters have a better idea than I do on it--I don't \nthink so at this point.\n\n  Now, one of the issues we talked about in last year's debate, and I \nemphasize it because nobody had even considered it, is why shouldn't we \ngo to a merit-based system--a system that is skill based--where we \nwould have people come into this country based on their opportunity for \nsuccess here, based on their ability to flourish in our economy? What \nwe learned was that Canada does that. Canada spent several years of \nnational discussion, and then their Parliament got together and decided \nthe question. They passed a law that said to the immigration department \nin Canada, you work with our economics department and you set up an \nimmigration system for our country that says 60 percent of the people \nwho would enter our country would enter based on skills and merit and \neducation that we think are important for Canada because we believe our \nimmigration policies should serve the national Canadian interest. It \nshould make Canada better. We believe this is the right policy.\n  That was done and is being executed today. I met, in my office last \nyear, with the gentleman who was the director of that program, and he \nexplained to me that it was very popular. They like it in Canada. We \nhad never even discussed it last year. I tried to get a hearing in the \nJudiciary Committee on it. No, they didn't have time. Senator Mike \nEnzi, who was chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, agreed to have a hearing on it, and we did that. We had \nexperts testify on that and very little negative was said about it. The \nwitnesses at various hearings we had all said an immigration policy, in \ntheir opinion, should serve the national interest, and a skill-based \nprogram serves the national interest. That is why they did it.\n  Australia does the same thing. Australia has 60 percent enter on \nmerit; New Zealand has a similar program; the United Kingdom is looking \nat it; and I believe the Netherlands and other countries are \nconsidering more movement in that area. The developed world is moving \nin that area, except the United States. Only 20 percent of the people \nwho enter our country with green cards get those permanent resident \ngreen cards based on skills--only 20 percent. Sixty percent, almost, \nget their permanent residence based on family.\n  Now, no one disputes, and this bill certainly doesn't, and neither do \nI, that if we give permanent residence to anyone, to a man, to come to \nAmerica, he should be able to bring his wife and his minor children. \nBut if you choose to come to America--you tell me, I say to my church \nfriends--tell me why, if you choose to leave your extended family and \ncome to America and establish a new life, what right do you have to \ndemand that your aging parents should come with you? What right do you \nhave, what moral right do you have to demand that?\n  That is what we are doing today. Parents are allowed to come, as well \nas adult children, as well as brothers and sisters--the siblings. So \nunder the current system of chain migration, a person comes to America \nand they get a green card, or become a citizen, and they are able then \nto bring their aging parents or bring their brothers and sisters, who \nare then able to bring their wives and their children. That is how we \nget nearly 60 percent of immigration in America not based on skills.\n  That is the policy question I thought had been established when we \nadopted the new framework that became the basis for the new bill that \nwas introduced late last night. Does the new bill get us there? It does \nadopt a point system. I have to say I was excited about that because I \nbelieve so strongly that was the right direction for us to go. I was \nexcited about that. But as I read the bill, I was very dispirited.\n  For example, what happens in the years 2008 to 2012 if this bill \nbecomes law? Skill-based immigration will remain capped at the current \nlevel of 140,000 for the first 5 years until 2012. Even out of this \n140,000, 10,000 will be carved out for temporary, low-skilled workers. \nI am not talking about temporary workers now but people on a track to \ncitizenship--green card, permanent residence, and then citizenship. The \n140,000 green cards we have set aside for that track, they have taken \n10,000 of that for the temporary workers who come without a merit-based \nsystem.\n  So there is a step taken in the bill to reduce chain migration, and \nit reduces it, it appeared, immediately and even back I think 2 years. \nBut it says that if you were an applicant to come into our country for \na permanent residence, as part of a chain migration application, you \nare considered to be a backlogged applicant. As a backlogged applicant, \nthis bill says we are going to give you the opportunity to come and to \nget permanent residence in America, even though people who applied \nafter a certain date would not get to have that provision applied to \nthem. This will free up some numbers that will not be coming in on \nchain migration, but the theory was the green card numbers would be \nshifted to a skill-based, point-based system like Canada's. That is how \nyou get there, and this bill does attempt to do that. Unfortunately, it \ntakes a lot of time to get there.\n\n  Under this bill, they will take 8 years of those saved green card \nnumbers and apply them to the backlog. There are about 3 million \nbacklogged chain migration petitions, and each one amounts to about 2.2 \npersons because they could bring a wife or a child with them, sometimes \n3 or 4 children. If you are in the backlog as a brother of a citizen \nand you have been in the backlog for several years, then you get to \ncome with your family--not just yourself as\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\na brother, but you get to bring your family--in the next 8 years. So we \nthink it will total up to 6 to 8 million people who are in the backlog. \nWe are not moving to a merit-based system any time soon. Actually, it \nis going to be 8 years out before it really kicks in. I don't know what \nwill happen in 8 years. I have grown, in my 10 years in this Senate, to \nbe somewhat worried about what we are likely to do when that happens.\n  I salute my colleagues for making a decision that appears to shift us \nto a more healthy view of immigration that will be more likely to serve \nour national interest. But I am disappointed that it is not going to \nreally take effect for 8 years. That is so long, I am not sure I can \nbuy that as a legitimate compromise.\n  My colleagues say: We did the best we can do. Jeff, there are things \nin the bill I don't like. I would like to have it take place right now.\n  Why don't we make it happen right now? Why wait 8 years? We don't \nhave a right to offer amendments and fix that? We need to think about \nit.\n  Another thing is, in Canada they have, as I said, 60 percent based on \nskills. We think the numbers in the United States--from 20 to 22 \npercent based on skills--will not exceed 40 percent. In fact, Senator \nKennedy, who really opposed this part of the provision, estimates it \nwould only be 30 percent. That is not enough. We need to look at these \nnumbers. If we don't have a proposal which would carry us 50 percent or \nabove, I don't think we have made the kind of real progress in that \narea that we could.\n  Also, the system is going to skew, again, to the temporary workers. \nIf you are here as a temporary worker, you get 6 to 8 points for adult \nsons and daughters who might apply under the point system, 4 points for \nbrothers and sisters of citizens and permanent residents, and 2 extra \npoints if you apply for a chain migration category between May 1, 2005, \nand now. So a significant number of points are given based on family, I \nam concerned about that.\n  Points are going to be given not just for higher skills but for high-\ndemand occupations. That is what the temporary program is for, the \nhigh-demand occupations. I think the permanent track to citizenship \nshould clearly shift to a more skill-based system. But we are going to \ngive a lot of this skill-based system personnel--they will get 16 \npoints on the point scale if they are in a high-demand occupation. \nThese could be fairly low-skilled jobs. You could be in the service \nindustry or things of that nature, low-skill personnel and things of \nthat nature, or food processing. That is an undermining of the \nprinciple of moving to a merit-based, skill-based system. That worries \nme, that we are not getting there sufficiently on the point system. It \nis just frustrating to see that.\n  Why is that point-based system important in the long run? Just \nbecause Canada has gone through this process and has reached that \nconclusion? No.\n  Mr. Robert Rector is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a \npremier think tank, a conservative think tank but one of the most \nrespected in America. Mr. Rector has for well over 20 years, I suppose, \nbeen recognized as one of the most knowledgeable persons in America on \nwelfare and social policy. He is widely recognized as the architect of \nthe highly successful major welfare reform that was done a number of \nyears ago. Eventually, after 2 vetoes, President Clinton signed it, and \nit became a very popular program that reduced child poverty and created \na system where lots of people went out and found work. The welfare \noffice became an employment office where people can be counseled on how \nto get work, and people are now out being very proud to be \nbreadwinners, bringing home money--more than they ever thought possible \nsometimes--just because they got out of the welfare trap and into \nworkplace. That is what Mr. Rector was part of.\n  At a press conference yesterday, he was very strong in his view that \nwe have a big problem with low-skilled immigrants. He talked about some \nthings you don't like to talk about so much, but it is just a fact, and \nall these other countries have had to deal with it. When you are low \nskilled, have low education, you tend to collect more from the \ngovernment than you put in. That is a big problem. What he concluded \nwas that the necessary fiscal deficit for a house which is headed by a \nperson without a high school degree is $19,000 a year. He put his \npencil on it. He calculated it out. I don't know whether that figure is \ncorrect, I didn't calculate the numbers myself but that is what he said \nyesterday. This is Mr. Rector. He noted that $19,000 per year in \nbenefits could buy each one of those families a new automobile every \nyear.\n  He calculated that, over a lifetime, the numbers are worse, that we \nshould calculate the numbers not in the first 10 years where they would \nbe artificially low but calculate them over a lifetime. He calculated \nthat if we pass this bill, the immigrant households headed by non-high \nschool graduates would take out of the U.S. Treasury $2.3 trillion more \nthan they pay in over their lifetime. That is the group which would be \nin the 12 million who would be legalized.\n  There are reasons for that. People with education, with language \nskills, who have skills and talents America needs, who apply in a \npoint-based merit system, who have any college at all when they come, \ntend to do very well in America. In fact, the numbers show that if you \njust had 2 years of college, you tend to do very well and pay much more \nin taxes than you would ever take out in taxes. We have to be careful \nthat our business friends understand that somebody is picking up the \ntab if they have low-skilled, low-wage workers. It may not be the \nemployer, but somebody is paying. It is the Social Security system, it \nis the Medicare system, it is the American taxpayers who pay.\n  I see my good friend from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am pleased to yield such time as the Senator wishes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. The Senator is very kind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I wanted to point out that last year my colleague \nrightly pointed to a serious problem with last year's bill dealing with \nchain migration. I recall the Senator coming to the floor and \nexplaining what had not been well understood until then, which is the \nfact that, as people were acquiring legal permanent resident status, \nthen they would also have the opportunity to bring family members. That \nwould result in a huge problem. We have 12 million illegals. If those \n12 million are somehow legalized and then they can also chain migrate \ntheir families, we would end up with a problem manyfold what it would \nbe otherwise.\n  In this bill, we tried mightily to end chain migration, and I think \nwe have for the most part. I want to say to the Senator from Alabama, \nit is because of his good work last year in pointing out that flaw in \nthe bill that I think now we have corrected and reversed course in what \nI think is, by some, a real problem in terms of family reunification. \nBut at the end of the day, I think it is the right thing for America.\n  If we allow those who are here, after a probationary period, after \npayment of fines, and ultimately after returning to their home country, \nto legally apply for readmittance, that then chain migration would not \nbe permitted, I think that is a fair tradeoff and is at the heart of \nwhat is called by some the ``grand bargain,'' a massive coming together \nwe had. I want to give the Senator very much due credit for having a \nreal hand in what it is that is at the heart of this new agreement.\n  I realize the Senator may have many other issues of concern. I hope, \nas we go forward and talk about them, we will alleviate some of those \nconcerns. I think one of the things that has happened is it is a \nmassive bill. Here we have it now still not in printed form as we go \nthrough it. I compliment the majority leader for giving us the extra \ntime so we all have a chance to get into what is in the details of the \nbill.\n  There has been a lot of emotion and a lot of conversation and a lot \nof it not very well based on what is in the bill. The trigger is in the \nbill, and I know Senator Isakson from Georgia will be speaking to that \nthis afternoon. It is fundamental. Nothing happens until the border is \nsecure.\n  I wish to give the Senator credit where credit is due for a good step \nalong the way.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I say to Senator Martinez that I thank him for that,\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\nbut he was one of the people who stood firm on this issue of a more \nmerit-based, competitive system of immigration, like Canada. Without \nhis leadership, I know it would not have happened. In fact, his \npersonnel leadership was pivotal in a number of areas in this \nlegislation that made it better than it would otherwise have been. I \nappreciate that.\n  My concern on the bill is that by saying the backlog gets approved, \nwe delay about 8 years moving to the full implementation of a merit \nsystem. I know, when you are in a meeting and you have to negotiate \nwith people--I know Senator Kennedy didn't want to do this at all.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You had to reach a compromise. But the compromise of \nwaiting 8 years is troubling to me. I like the move. I thank the \nSenator for his leadership, and that is the point I have tried to make \nthis morning.\n  I thank Senator Martinez. The Senator himself is an immigrant from \nCuba and has risen to serve as a member of the Cabinet of the President \nof the United States and now an outstanding Member of this Senate. I am \nproud to know him. I am also proud his wife is from my hometown of \nMobile, AL. She is wonderful also.\n  As I understand the chain migration matter, in fact, it does end \nchain migration mostly, but it does allow 40,000 parents to come each \nyear. There are some restrictions on it, but 40,000 parents. So those \n40,000 more elderly parents--by the way, Canada gives points for youth. \nThey believe Canada benefits from a younger rather than an older \nimmigrant.\n  But those parents who come--we have to be honest with ourselves are \nnot going to be net gain like a young skilled person. But that was the \ncompromise they pounded away at. Some said family reunification, we \nhave to have family reunification. So instead of eliminating aging \nparents, they agreed to cap them at about half the number we currently \nhave of parents who get to come each year.\n  But what I want to ask you to think about is, here is a young man in \nHonduras who went to high school, graduated, maybe was valedictorian of \nhis class, taken English, utilizes television and radio to improve his \nEnglish, has 2 years of college. He applies to get in the United \nStates.\n  He wants to come here very badly. Maybe he has a distant cousin here \nor maybe he has read about America. Maybe he wants to come here and \nwork and go to college and earn a degree and be a doctor. I don't know \nwhat is in that young man's mind. It is a zero-sum game.\n  If you let the parent in, you deny someone such as that the ability \nto come in on a more meritorious basis. That is why this is not an easy \ncall and why we need to be clear about this. Every time we allow a \nchain migrant or an aging parent to take an immigration slot, we are \ndenying someone who deeply wants to come, who could be selected on \nmerit from the large number out there who want to come to America, that \nwould be more successful and flourish here. That is all I am saying.\n  We hear stories about familial reunification. I know that is nice to \ntalk about. That could be important to an immigrant who becomes a \ncitizen and wants to also bring their extended family. It might be \nimportant to them personally. But the real question is, what we have to \nask is: Is this important to the national interest? What is in the best \nnational interest? The best national interest, I believe, and other \nnations of the developed world have concluded, requires a movement \nwhere you can bring your wife and children, but you don't get to bring \nextended family in.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes prior to the recess.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. I will use that and then reserve the \nremainder of the time.\n  Another principle of the PowerPoint presentation was the question of \ngiving legal status to persons currently illegally in the country \nthrough a new visa. But it was stated as one of the principles that \nthere would be no special path to citizenship. That was a direct quote. \n``No special path to citizenship.''\n  However, the bill clearly creates a system whereby current people \nhere illegally are treated differently, better, than those who tried to \ncome to the country lawfully.\n  That is a principle I think we have all said we don't want to breach. \nIn fact, the PowerPoint principle about any new immigration bill stated \nthat would be one of the principles. This bill is not jackpot amnesty, \nas some would say; but I think it is a form of amnesty, however you \nwant to define it.\n  I have not tried to use that word too much because I am not sure what \nit means to anybody. If I use the word amnesty, it tends to mean that \nyou allowed somebody who came here illegally to stay permanently. That \nis a form of amnesty. I mean, normally they would be apprehended and \nremoved. That is what the law would require.\n  But whatever amnesty is, I have concluded that the principle we \nshould adhere to is, that if someone did come to our country illegally, \nand we have now not enforced the law as we would expect the law to be \nenforced but are going to allow them to stay here in our country, come \nout of the shadows to have a legal status, that we can do that, but we \nshould not provide to that illegal entrant every single benefit we \nprovide the persons who wait in line and come lawfully.\n  I see no reason to do that. That is what we did in 1986. The speeches \nwere crystal clear: Never again. This is the last amnesty. Because \nthose people in 1986 understood that if amnesty became the rule, we \nwould totally undermine respect for our legal system. So here we are, \n20 years later, granting another amnesty. I think we need to maintain \nsome clarity so there is a difference in status of those who come \nillegally.\n  Now, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, gave a definition. He \nmade a statement that is valuable. ``One thing is for sure, if this \nbill gives them any preferential treatment towards citizenship over \npeople who came into the country in the proper way, that is a non-\nstarter.''\n  I would go further. I think we can give some kind of legal status and \ncertain benefits to people who come illegally, but I believe they \nshould not be given benefits that lead to citizenship--that powerful, \nwonderful thing, citizenship in the United States--based on an illegal \nact. I do not think we should. I think we should say forever--in 1986, \nwe said the truth then--you come illegally, you are not going to \nbenefit. We are not going to do this again. We should do that.\n  Now, if they have children born here, the children can become \ncitizens. But there will be detriments to having come illegally that \nwould be permanent, that are not going to be wiped out. That is my \npersonal view. We will see how it goes.\n  I would say, with regard to the question of moving to citizenship, \nthere are at least five preferential treatments toward citizenship \ngiven to the illegal alien population by this bill. Preferential \ntreatment.\n  First, illegal aliens who rushed across the border between January 7, \n2004--the date contained in last year's bill--and January 1, 2007, this \nJanuary, will be eligible for amnesty. This includes illegal aliens who \nhave been here for a mere 5 months. They would be eligible for the \namnesty, be eligible to be put on track for citizenship, even if they \ncame into our country last December 31. Remember, we called out the \nNational Guard, the President did, after the American people put the \nheat on, called out the National Guard. We are building fences now, not \nenough, but we are building barriers. We are increasing agents and we \nare saying: The border is closed. But we turn around and have a bill \nthat says that somebody who got past the National Guard, got past the \nBorder Patrol, got around the fence, is now going to be put on a path, \nguaranteed path to citizenship.\n  Now, I don't think that is good public policy. That does not breed \nrespect for the law. I was a Federal prosecutor for nearly 15 years. I \nam telling you, if you don't enforce a law, it is undermined and \nundermines respect for the Government in general, frankly.\n  I will not go any further. I think our time is about finished. I \nwould thank my colleagues for their attention to this bill. I hope they \nwill be reading it. I hope the research we do might be helpful to some \nof you as you work on\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nit and try to decide how you should handle this very important piece of \nlegislation. We need to do something. We need to do something that is \ngood. We need to pass a bill. I guess no bill will be perfect, but we \ndo not need to pass bills with serious flaws in them, those that \nundermine the principles that any effective immigration system should \nbe founded on.\n  I will have extra time. We will talk about that later and talk about \nsome other things I have.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6430-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand under the order, Senator \nSessions is to be recognized to speak for a period of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have consulted with Senator Sessions. I asked if it was \nOK if I proceeded for 5 minutes preceding his remarks. Accordingly, I \nask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Pay Raise for Soldiers\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of our troops. There are \nfew things as important as the gift of one's labor, one's love, one's \nlife. Our soldiers are asked to make generous sacrifices of these \nprecious commodities every day. Our finest young soldiers work 19 hours \na day in hot, dry, dangerous places such as Fallujah and Kabul. They do \nso because they have a deep love of country. Many of our soldiers make \nthe ultimate sacrifice with their lives. Increasingly, we are asking \nmore and more of our soldiers. In April, Secretary Gates announced he \nis extending the tours of duty for active-duty soldiers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan from 12 to 15 months. Our troops have already accomplished \nso much: deposed Saddam Hussein, toppled the Taliban, responded to the \nthreats posed by vicious terrorists around the world. They have done \neverything we have asked of them. I was, therefore, disappointed when I \ncame across a newspaper article this weekend noting that the \nadministration opposes a modest pay raise for American soldiers.\n  The House Defense authorization bill includes a one-half of 1 percent \nincrease in military pay above the President's request. For the average \nnew enlistee, this will amount to roughly $75 per year in extra pay--\nclearly, not enough to cover additional costs: school clothes for kids, \na family trip to the ballpark, a few tanks of gas at the prices we are \nstuck paying.\n  The increase is aimed at reducing the gap in pay between comparable \nmilitary and civilian jobs that stands at about 4 percent today. Even \nafter the proposed increase, that gap will remain at least 1.4 percent, \nclearly not keeping up with civilian pay increases.\n  Of the billions of dollars we spend on the wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq, it would seem absurd to oppose this small pay bump, but that is \nexactly what the administration is doing. In a May 17, 2007, letter to \nthe House Armed Services Committee, the President's budget director \nannounced the pay increase included in the House bill is \n``unnecessary.'' I believe it is necessary. I believe it is necessary \nto do anything we can to provide for the welfare of our fighting men \nand women. Salaries for newly minted enlistees start at about $15,600 \nper year. To put this in perspective, new enlistees with three or more \ndependents are eligible for food stamps.\n  Among the sacrifices we ask of our men and women in harm's way, going \nhungry should not be one of them. In addition, the administration \nopposes a $40 per month increase in allowances for the widows of slain \nsoldiers. Again, this is a modest bump in benefits and pales in \ncomparison to the sacrifice these families have made. Forty dollars a \nmonth extra won't make it any easier to face another day without a \nloved one who is lost, but it could help pay the rent, keep the heat \non, and relieve a bit of stress for families facing a new world without \ntheir spouse. That is why I am urging the administration to reconsider \ntheir opposition to a pay increase and additional survivor benefit. \nSupporting our troops is something we all agree on, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  I ask the President to reconsider his opposition to increased pay for \nour soldiers and aid for this war's widows. We may not all agree on \nwhat we should do in Iraq going forward, but I believe we can and \nshould reach a simple accommodation on troop pay.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend getting prepared. I ask for 1 or 2 \nminutes' indulgence.\n\n\n                           children's health\n\n  Mr. President, in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles, the book \nof Ben Sirah counsels: ``Observe the opportunity.''\n  This year, the Senate has the opportunity to improve the health of \nmillions of American children, for the next decade.\n  The Senate has the opportunity to renew and improve the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.\n  Let us seize the opportunity.\n  There is no greater health care priority for me this year.\n  In a few short weeks, the Finance Committee will consider legislation \nto reauthorize and strengthen this successful 10-year-old program.\n  Many of us were present in this Chamber when we created CHIP in 1997. \nSince then, this program has proven to be a true success.\n  Since its inception, CHIP has brought health insurance to more than \n40 million low-income children.\n  It has saved the lives of many children, and it has improved the \navailability and quality of care for many more.\n  In my home State of Montana, Fawn Tuhy has some pretty active kids. \nMontana is a State full of active kids, and active kids get hurt.\n  Fawn's 2-year-old needed stitches after hitting her head. Fawn's 6-\nyear-old broke his arm twice.\n  Fawn's medical bills could have sunk their family of six. But she \ncredits CHIP with keeping her kids healthy, and her family afloat.\n  CHIP has made that kind of difference for millions of Americans, in \nthe last 10 years.\n  Among families with incomes less than about $34,000 a year--that is \ntwice the poverty level--the share of uninsured children has dropped by \na quarter.\n  CHIP has held the number of uninsured children down, even as the \nnumber of uninsured adult Americans has increased.\n  But Congress cannot rest on its laurels. We have to continue CHIP. We \nhave to build on its success, and we have to do it before CHIP's \nfunding expires, on September 30.\n  The Finance Committee is poised to act, with a markup early next \nmonth.\n  In this reauthorization, we will pursue five principles:\n  First, we must provide adequate funds to keep coverage for those who \nhave it now.\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that CHIP needs \nan additional $13.4 billion, just to maintain current coverage.\n  Maintaining level funding is just not good enough. If funding stays \nflat, then 4 million American children could lose health coverage, over \nthe next 10 years.\n  Second, we must also reach the 6 million uninsured children who are \neligible for either CHIP or Medicaid coverage but not enrolled.\n  CBO says that the best opportunity to further reduce the number of \nuninsured children is to target CHIP enrollment toward more families \nwhose incomes are below twice the poverty level.\n  Third, we must support State efforts to expand CHIP coverage to more \nkids. States have found innovative ways to reach as many uninsured kids \nas possible. States have acted according to their unique abilities and \nneeds.\n  Fourth, we must improve the quality of health care that children \nreceive.\n  We are making great strides to improve the quality of health care for \nadults through Medicare. Yet there is no comparable investment in \nquality\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nstandards for children. We can and must do more.\n  Fifth, whatever we do, we must not add to the numbers of the \nuninsured.\n  Right now, Federal waivers let some States provide CHIP coverage to \npregnant women, to parents of eligible children, and even to some \nadults without children.\n  Congress may not want CHIP to cover all those groups in the future, \nbut we must not pull the rug out from under anyone who has health \ncoverage today.\n  Too many CHIP recipients are already in imminent danger. Right now, \n14 State programs are facing shortfalls for this year--even before \nCHIP's 10-year authorization expires.\n  I worked hard to include funds to cover funding shortfalls in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  But even if we fix this year's shortfalls, many more States will face \nfunding gaps in the coming years. We need to ensure greater \npredictability and stability of CHIP funding.\n  Ten years ago, we simply did not know how much funding CHIP would \ntake. We know much more now, and we should make the appropriate \nfinancial commitment to keep kids healthy. We must take a forward-\nthinking approach.\n  We must consider the likelihood of continuing increases in health \ncare costs, and we must consider likely population changes.\n  We must consider that a child born today may have a shorter life \nexpectancy than his or her parents. But that is what we face, due to \nthe threats of obesity and related illnesses. So reauthorization must \nstrengthen prevention and early screening benefits.\n  As we tackle CHIP, we should keep in mind the deep need for broader \nhealth reform. There are still too many families whose health stories \ndon't have happy endings. CHIP cannot help them all. But it should help \nmore.\n  One morning last year, Kearstin Jacobson woke up in Whitefish, MT, \nwith a severe headache. Tests showed that the high school senior had a \nclot, preventing the blood flow from her brain.\n  Kearstin got wonderful care. But it cost almost a quarter of a \nmillion dollars, and her family did not have health insurance.\n  So even as the hospital staff wheeled Kearstin out of the emergency \nroom, this young lady with a life-threatening condition was worried \nabout money.\n  She was telling her parents how concerned she was about the financial \nburdens that her care would cause.\n  Kearstin feared that her parents would be paying for her care for \nmany years to come, and they are.\n  This year, Congress has a historic opportunity to help families like \nKearstin's.\n  We have an opportunity to make a good health policy for children even \nbetter.\n  An overwhelming majority of Americans support CHIP.\n  I extend my hand to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Let's \nwork together.\n  CHIP is not a Democratic priority or a Republican priority. It is an \nAmerican priority.\n  America's kids are depending on us to do this right. We must not \ndisappoint them.\n  Let us observe the opportunity to improve the health of millions of \nAmerican children. Let us observe the opportunity to give peace of mind \nand financial security to millions of families. And let us renew and \nimprove the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was sharing with my colleagues before \nthe leadership break a number of issues about the immigration bill. \nPerhaps it will cause some to think unless it is improved, it should \nnot be passed. Some will be encouraged, hopefully, to support \namendments that could make it better. To some, I am sure it will make \nno difference. They intend to vote for it, maybe, or against it, as it \nis today. But I am glad we will now have all week. The Democratic \nleader has changed his previously stated view that we would vote this \nweek. We brought the bill up only last night. If it was written in \nformal bill language, it would be one of the longest pieces of \nlegislation ever considered in the Senate, maybe the longest piece of \nlegislation since I have been here, other than perhaps an omnibus bill, \nbut not a legislative bill.\n  We need to be thinking about the basic principles that are important \nto immigration reform. That is what I wish to continue discussing. The \nRepublican leader, Mitch McConnell, said:\n\n       One thing's for sure, if this bill gives them any \n     preferential treatment towards citizenship over people who \n     came into the country in the proper way, that's a nonstarter.\n\n  I have made a number of points about some of the things that actually \nare in the bill that provide for a person who came into our country \npreferential treatment toward the process of being a citizen that are \nnot given to somebody dutifully waiting outside the country to be \ncalled up when their time comes. I want to point that out in a number \nof ways.\n  For example, only illegal persons would be eligible for these Z \nvisas, visas that would allow them to live and work here forever, as \nlong as they are renewed every 4 years. That visa would not be \navailable to anyone currently living in the United States who came here \nto work legally or someone who did not overstay their visa but went \nhome when they were supposed to. So if you came here for a work visa \nand your work visa is 1 year, and you are complying with the law, and \nyou don't want to go home at the end of your year, you still have to go \nhome. But if a person broke into the country illegally and they don't \nwant to go home, they are given the Z visa, they get to stay, and they \nget to apply for a green card that leads to citizenship. Even if they \nentered the country last December 31, getting past our National Guard, \nthe new fences and the Border Patrol, and got into the country as late \nas last December, a single person with no skills, that person is \neligible for the Z visa and could be here forever.\n  A Z visa plan is a better plan than the plan we had last year, I have \nto say, but it still has some real problems with it. Namely, it still \nleads to citizenship.\n  My colleagues say: Well, nothing is perfect. Yes, there are things in \nit I don't like, but we have to do something.\n  Well, why don't we fix things such as that? If it is not right, why \nshould it be in the bill? We don't have to let the Z visa be a pathway \nto citizenship, it could just be renewable forever.\n  Well, they say, we can't touch anything that affects the core of the \nbill. All of us--the senators in the secret room--have agreed.\n  Who agreed? This group that met for several months with one another \nand outside groups, and they wrote up this bill and plopped it down on \nthe floor last night. Until last night, we were still on last year's \nfatally flawed bill that should never, ever have become law. Although \nit passed this Senate, it never had a dog's chance of passing in the \nHouse. That is where we are, and I am concerned about that.\n  A third example of preferential treatment is Z visa holders get legal \nstatus 24 hours after they apply, even if their background checks \naren't complete. The bill says ``No probationary benefits shall be \nissued to an alien until the alien has passed all appropriate \nbackground checks or the end of the next business day, whichever is \nsooner.'' Nobody else gets immigration status benefits if their \nbackground check is not complete. Fourth, visa holders are exempted \nfrom a long list of inadmissibility grounds, including fraud or \nmisrepresentation to obtain an immigration benefit and false claims for \nU.S. citizenship, and their prior deportation or removal orders can be \nwaived, even if they never left, if they can show extreme hardship to \ntheir illegal alien family members.\n  An illegal alien who applies to be a Z visa holder is exempted. That \nincludes anyone that got here before January 1 of this year. They can \nwalk in and they get a Z visa. They don't have to pass a background \ncheck to get the visa immediately--at the end of the next business day. \nPresumably, they will check pretty quickly. But what if we had hundreds \nand thousands of people showing up with convictions for crimes and that \nkind of thing that makes them ineligible, how are we going to find \nthem? They will have the probationary z visa.\n  If they have participated in a scheme to obtain immigration benefits \nor have\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nfalsely claimed with official documents to the U.S. Government that \nthey are a citizen, this is a crime under Title 18, section 911, that \ndoes not bar them either. What would happen if an American citizen made \na false claim to the Government? Title 18, section 1001, false claims \nto the Government is a Federal felony that can put you in jail for 2 \nyears, 5 years. But if you made a false claim to be a citizen or some \nother benefit under immigration law and you are one of the people who \ncame here illegally and not through a system, you get immunity from \nthose cases, whereas a citizen does not. We have to be careful about \nwhat we do in legislation such as this. This is why amnesty deals are \nimportant. We should not be put in the position of ever having to do \nthis. We said we would not do it again. After 1986, we said we were not \ngoing to ever do another amnesty again because it was so painful. It \nworked so poorly. All it did was encourage additional immigration, as \nthose who opposed it in 1986 predicted.\n  It is very interesting. I looked back at the debates. You could see \nwho was right and who was wrong. The people said: This is going to be a \none-time thing. Don't worry about it. This will end the backlog and \nbring people out of the shadows, and we don't have to enforce the law \non these people. Let them stay, and we will give them for one time \namnesty. We won't do it again.\n  Others said: Wait a minute. This is a principle of importance. How \ncan we say in the future we won't give amnesty if people come \nillegally, when we did this time? Doesn't this put us on the road to \nrepeat amnesty in the future? Aren't we afraid it won't work?\n  What happened? After the 1986 bill, 3 million people claimed the \nbenefits of amnesty. Twenty years later, we now have maybe 12 to 20 \nmillion that will be claiming amnesty. There are consequences to making \nthese kinds of choices. That is a preference given to people who have \ncome illegally over someone waiting outside the country to come \nlegally.\n  Fifth, a Z visa holder will be able to get a green card through their \nown separate point system and without being subject to the regular \nannual numerical limits. This is a huge benefit to them. In other \nwords, they will not have to compete with other persons around the \nworld on a merit basis, as we are supposed to be moving to, but, in \nfact, they will have an inside track. They will not be in a line that \nhas the standard numerical limit, instead they will have their own \nlike, so that at most they will have to wait only 5 years for a green \ncard after they are eligible for one.\n  That makes clear to me--I think it is clear to anyone--the way the \nbill is now written there is a preference given in quite a number of \nareas on the question of citizenship, as well as other questions, \nfrankly, that they get benefits over persons who came here waiting to \ncome legally or came locally.\n  In fact, another thing they have left out of the bill--and it was in \nlast year's bill--they do not have to pay back taxes. So the illegal \nalien community that has been working here for half a dozen years--and \nwe hear there are so many of them, and many of them have decent-paying \njobs. I think that is true, quite a number do have decent-paying jobs \nand are supposed to be paying taxes. If they did not pay their taxes, \nthey don't have to pay them as a condition for getting z visa amnesty. \nAmerican citizens have not been exempted from paying their taxes for \nthose same years. That is just true.\n  You may say: Well, you are just harping and complaining, Sessions. \nWell, I pay my taxes. Most Americans pay their taxes. If somebody has \ncome here illegally and makes $50,000, $80,000 a year--some do--and \nthey did not pay taxes, we are just going to wipe that tax debt out? I \ndo not think so. It is not a principle, to me, that I could adhere to, \ninstead it is one I would dispute.\n  So what about the chain migration question? Are we eliminating that? \nAnd what should we do?\n  Let me say it this way--and this is accurate, and there are other \nways to look at it--it is accurate to say that instead of eliminating \nchain migration, which was one of the principles in the talking points \nthat circulated around as this new bill was drafted, the bill actually \nescalates chain migration two to three times over the next 8 years. \nThat is an indisputable fact.\n  Not only are the current chain migration numbers maintained--the \n140,000 that was eliminated is now used to adjust backlogged chain \nmigration applications.\n  They did eliminate chain migration. No new applications will be \naccepted. Let's go back and be fair about the bill. The bill eliminates \nchain migration in the future. That is an important thing. Chain \nmigration means collateral relatives; it does not mean your wife or \nyour child. They would get to come with you. If you are a citizen or a \npermanent resident, your wife and children get to come with you. It is \nthe question of the brothers and sisters, adult children that perhaps \nare married and have their own families, or aging parents that are part \nof chain migration.\n  If a person comes, then you can bring your brother and sister. If \nyour brother is married, the wife comes with your brother. If they have \nthree children, those come. If she moves forward to a green card or \ncitizenship, she can also bring in her relatives. Then the wife can \nbring in her brothers and sisters. So that is how this system works. It \nis unrelated to skills and the productivity of the person intending to \ncome. It is unrelated, therefore, to the national interests of the \nUnited States. It is unconnected to them. It is their interest they are \nconcerned about and not the national interest, which is to make sure \nthe persons who come are honest, hard-working, decent people with \nskills and capabilities to be successful in America.\n  So how did all this work out in reality? Not only are the current \nchain migration numbers maintained--the 140,000 was eliminated, so to \nspeak, but it will be applied during the 8-year period after the bill \nto provide more green cards, increase the numbers of green cards for \nfamily migration, most of which are for chain migration persons who are \nwaiting to get green cards as a result of their applications over a \nperiod of time. So if a brother applies to come to the United States \nwith a wife and child, because they have a brother here who is a \ncitizen, they apply and they are put on a list. This is non-skill-based \nimmigration. It is purely based on kinship. Those numbers have been set \naside to allow the people who are backlogged to clear, and it is going \nto take 8 years, they estimate 8 years. As we look at the numbers, it \nlooks as if it could well be longer than that. It looks as if the \nbacklog will not be eliminated in 8 years but could be much more.\n  So what we will do then I am not able to say because we have not had \na chance to read the bill sufficiently from last night. So I just would \nsay we are concerned about that aspect of it. So the first 8 years we \ncan expect, as we calculate it this way--hold your hat--in the first 8 \nyears, there would be family-based green cards--not skill based--lots \nof them chain migration-based green cards--issued in numbers over \n920,000 each year. That is almost a million each year who would come in \nunder that program, unrelated to skill-based immigration that the bill \npurports to establish.\n  I will admit, after that 8 years, if the bill is unchanged--and who \nknows what would happen in that period--there would be a bigger shift \nto merit-based immigration and well over a million people will enter \nthe country legally--probably closer to 2 million per year under this \nplan--whereas the current number of legal immigrants each year into \nAmerica is about 1 million. So it is going to increase quite a bit the \nnumber of people entering the country with green cards, but it is not \ngoing to shift us to a merit-based system until at least 8 years go by. \nThat is a serious defect, in my mind.\n  They say: Well, it is implemented for those who qualify. That is \nright. Out of a million, a million and a half, 2 million--closer to a \nmillion and a half to 2 million--who will be coming legally in the next \n8 years, only 150,000 of those will enter based on the Canadian point \nsystem, merit-based system. That is not much. It is a disappointment to \nme that the hopes that were held out for a system like Canada's point-\nbased system were not realized. I am disappointed in that.\n  I will read an example prepared by the Senate Republican Policy \ncommittee, which did a nice study on merit-based permanent immigration. \nIt is a look at Canada's point system.\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\n  Remember now, there are a number of categories of issues we will deal \nwith. One is a temporary worker program. We are going to have two votes \non that, I understand, this afternoon. I intend to support Senator \nBingaman's amendment, although I have not seen it. But based on what I \nknow about it, it would reduce the number of people who would come in \nunder the temporary worker program from 400,000 to 200,000.\n  Now, this is all, in my view--I do not want to be too cynical--a \nlittle bit of a put-up job. I talked to administration officials \nearlier in the year, and I asked: Well, how many would be expected to \nenter under the temporary worker program? They said: Well, about \n200,000.\n  So the bill comes out, and it is 400,000 per year, and you stay for 2 \nyears. There is an escalator clause in it that could take the cap to \n600,000. So under the bill that was plopped in last night, you would \nhave 400,000 the first year--and it could be fifteen percent more than \nthat with the escalator clause--plus 400,000-plus the second year. Now, \nat that point, in the second year of the new program, you have about \n900,000 temporary workers here competing for jobs in our economy--at \none time, almost a million. That is a big number. That is bigger than I \nthink anybody ever intended.\n  So we are going to have an amendment this afternoon, and it is going \nto allow the Senators to impact the agreement, and they are going to \nbring those numbers down, and we are all going to pat ourselves on the \nback, I guess, and go back to our working people in our communities and \nunion people and say: See, we knocked that business bill down to a \nrational number that is much better. Now we may be able to vote for the \nbill. But I have to tell you, that was the number I was told some \nmonths ago was the appropriate number by an official in the Bush \nadministration who certainly is not timid about asking for temporary \nworkers in America.\n  So I am inclined to support the Bingaman amendment. I do, however, \nhave concerns about the Dorgan amendment because it strikes me that a \ngood temporary worker program is good for America; it just needs to \nwork, it just needs to be effective. I can tell you one good example. A \nportion of my State and a large portion of Louisiana and Mississippi \nwere devastated by Hurricane Katrina. There is tremendous construction \nwork there. A lot of people moved out of the neighborhoods and no \nlonger live or even work there. So immigrant labor in numbers larger \nthan you would normally expect to be needed were needed and were \nhelpful and remain helpful. So a good system of temporary workers would \nconsider those kinds of things because those workers in New Orleans, \nright now, are not likely to be putting Americans out of work or even \npulling their wages down any noticeable degree.\n  I think a temporary worker program is good. I am not inclined to vote \nfor the Dorgan amendment, as I understand it at this moment. But we do \nneed to work to examine the temporary worker program that is in this \nbill because it still has defects.\n  Now, let's take an example of a would-be seeker of permanent \nresidence as they apply to Canada according to the RPC paper. This is a \nmade-up example of how the system works.\n  Stella, an individual from Cyprus, desires to reside permanently in \nCanada. She has a master's degree in computer science. For that, she \nwould get 25 points. She has a job offer from Nortel. That would give \nher 10 points. She has 3 years of paid work experience in her home \ncountry. Canada gives her 19 points for that. She is 23 years old, and \nbecause she is younger and Canada prefers younger people--\nunfortunately, for some of us, she is younger--she gets extra points \nfor being younger, an extra 10 points. She has a moderate to good \nproficiency in English. She gets 10 points for that. So she has a total \nof 74 points. She has met the minimum of points required to apply for \npermanent residency in Canada. But she previously studied in Canada, \nand that gives her another 7 points. And the fact that her sister \nresides in Toronto gives her another 5 points--for a total of 86 \npoints. She can apply to be a permanent resident at the Canadian \nEmbassy in Cyprus and would be eligible promptly--immediately. So that \nis the way the system works in Canada. It is something that I think \nwithout doubt should be a part of our immigration reform.\n\n  So we are a nation of immigrants. We are at a point in our history in \nwhich the influx of immigrants into America is as high as it has ever \nbeen. Once, I believe, in our country's history we peaked at this high \nof an immigration rate, but along came the Depression and World War II \nand we almost stopped immigration entirely. We went to very low \nimmigration rates. Then we have gone back into a new cycle of very \nstrong immigration.\n  It looks as if there is not any likelihood that this Nation will stop \nthis current rate and go back to zero. Most of us believe immigration, \nproperly handled, is good for America, but we do have to consider the \nactual numbers. The numbers cannot be too great, or it takes jobs from \nAmericans and can, in fact, create cultural problems that wouldn't \noccur if it was a little slower. So we have a situation where we would \nlike to see immigration continue.\n  Now, if we are going to maintain a very high level of immigration at \nhistoric highs for America, it only makes good sense and common sense, \nit seems to me, that we would look around the world and we would give \npoints like Canada does to the persons who are most likely to be happy \nand prosperous in our country, who are most likely to not go on \nwelfare, most likely to have good jobs and pay taxes, who will help us \nbalance the budget rather than causing a drain on the budget, and in \nfact attract people who really desire to be an American and who want to \nbe a part of our society and deeply desire to make a permanent move, \nand who want to create a new allegiance from their prior country to \ntheir new home in the United States. That was the ideal of American \nimmigration, and I certainly think that remains our ideal today. We \nought to keep that in mind as we go forward.\n  Doing the right thing, creating the right number in the right \ncategories with the right skill sets, while at the same time having a \nlegal system that really works, is within our grasp.\n  Forgive me if I am disappointed that the framework which I thought \nhad so much great potential has not been fleshed out with statutory \nlanguage that meets the ideals of that framework. My concern is it is \nso far from the ideals of that framework that it is not a good choice \nfor us at this moment. There will be time for us to fix it on the \nSenate floor. There will be time for us to pass amendments that could \nmake it better, but it is troubling to me at this point.\n  I hope our colleagues who are involved in actually writing this bill \nwill not be so hard-headed about their commitment to sticking together \non the core principles that they all agreed to and pull out all the \nstops to make sure they have the votes to not allow any significant \namendments. We do need some significant amendments to make this bill \nappropriate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I think there is a previous unanimous \nconsent agreement by which I will be recognized for the purposes of \noffering an amendment. The Senator from Georgia has asked if he could \nbe recognized in morning business for 10 minutes. I have no objection \nto that, providing that I be recognized following the presentation by \nthe Senator from Georgia so that I might offer my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his graciousness in allowing me 10 minutes.\n  Two years and five months ago, I made my first speech as a United \nStates Senator on the floor. It was a speech about the issue of \nimmigration, both legal and illegal. A year ago today I made another \nspeech about immigration on the day I offered an amendment\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\nthat has become known as the trigger amendment on immigration.\n  I rise for the third time in 2 years and 5 months to talk about the \nmost significant issue facing the United States of America as far as \ndomestic policy is concerned.\n  Our borders to the south have been leaking far too long and in too \ngreat of numbers. We have had an immigration policy that for the better \npart of 21 years has been to look the other way as people flowed across \nour southern border to calibrate on a low basis legal immigration to \nsay we are doing something about it, while millions come into this \ncountry. It has to come to an end. It is the reason the controversy is \nso great over this issue today.\n  I, first of all, want to thank the Members who have worked with me \nover the last 6 weeks on the concept of putting a trigger in the \nunderlying bill, to be the trigger upon which immigration reform either \ntakes place or doesn't. There is so much misinformation out there right \nnow about this issue, so I want to spend the remainder of my time \ntalking about what trigger must be pulled in order for immigration to \nbe reformed.\n  The underlying bill we are debating today says the following: No \nprogram granting status to anyone who enters the United States of \nAmerica illegally may be granted until the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity has certified that all the border security measures in section \n1 are completed, funded, and in operation. There is no wiggle room. \nThere is no Presidential waiver. There is no possibility of the \nSecretary saying: Well, maybe we are OK. This is absolute.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues what those five are. No. 1 is 370 new miles \nof walls. Many of us got this in the mail last year. When Congress \nattempted to debate a flawed immigration bill that called for no border \nsecurity, they mailed bricks because they wanted barriers. This bill \ncalls for 370 miles. It calls for 200 miles of obstacles on those areas \nwhere vehicles might come across the border. That 200, plus the 370 \nmiles of walls, is 570 miles.\n  It calls for four unmanned aerial vehicles, eyes in the sky, 24/7, \neach with a 150-mile radius. That 600 miles, added to the 570 miles, is \n1,170 miles. Then it calls for 70 ground-positioning radar systems with \na radius of 12 miles, or 1,680 miles of seamless security. That 1,680 \non top of the 1,170 is almost 2,800 miles of seamless security. There \nare not 2,800 miles on the border. We have redundancy all along the \nborder.\n  The next trigger is 27,500 detention beds on the border so when \nsomebody is intercepted, they are held until their court date comes up. \nNo more catch and release. Then, importantly as well, 18,000 Border \nPatrol agents have to be trained and in place and functioning. We have \n14,500 right now. That is another 3,500. Those agents, by the way, are \ntrained ostensibly in Georgia at FLETC, the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center. They are trained on border security, on intervention, \nand on capture. Then, it requires the seamless border security. It \nrequires the ID that is biometric and is secure. It ends the largest \ngrowth industry on the southern border, and that is the forged document \nindustry.\n  When those five triggers are in place and when the Secretary of \nHomeland Security has certified them, then and only then is the \nimmigration reform in place because we have stopped the bleeding.\n  There are a lot of people talking about this issue of immigration \nfrom a lot of different standpoints, but I know one thing: When you go \nto the doctor, you don't want him to treat the symptom. You want him to \ntreat the cause. If you are cut, you want him to sew up the cut, not \njust put a Band-Aid on it. If you hurt and you hurt badly, you want him \nto x-ray and find out whatever that source is.\n  We know what the source is in America. The source is we have a 2,000-\nmile land contiguous border with a country that is less developed than \nours and has less opportunity, and the United States of America is a \nmagnet without obstacle for them to get in. We have to stop the source \nof the problem or we will never be able to reform it for the future.\n  I come to this debate as a second-generation American. My grandfather \ncame here in 1903 from Sweden. In 1926, he became a naturalized \ncitizen. It took him 23 years to follow what is the only right pathway \nto citizenship, and that is legal immigration.\n  I stand before my colleagues today to say the American people want \nborder security. I want border security. If it is the trigger for \nimmigration reform, it ensures that we will never have to repeat the \nmistakes of 1986 and that America once again will restore confidence in \nits borders, confidence in its immigration policy, and legitimacy with \nits people.\n  I am where I began. There is no wiggle room in this trigger. There is \nno waiver. There is no looking the other way. If we in Congress don't \nfund the money, it doesn't work. If the President doesn't do what he is \nsupposed to do, it doesn't work. If the Secretary of Homeland Security \ndoesn't do what he is supposed to do, it does not work.\n  The American people, for the first time, have an ironclad guarantee \nthat our biggest problem, and that is an insecure border in the south, \nwill be fixed and fixed forever.\n  I again thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for giving \nme the chance to make this presentation.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1153 to Amendment No. 1150\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am going to offer an amendment. I \nbelieve by a previous unanimous consent agreement, I will be recognized \nfor offering an amendment. I don't know whether my amendment is at the \ndesk.\n  I believe my amendment is at the desk, and I will offer that \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer, who is a cosponsor of \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     and Senator Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1153 to \n     amendment No. 1150.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1153\n\n      (Purpose: To strike the Y nonimmigrant guestworker program)\n\n       Strike subtitle A of title IV.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we will hear ample discussion today--and \nwe heard it yesterday and we will hear it the rest of this week and \nperhaps another week going into the month of June--about this issue of \nimmigration. It is not an insignificant issue; it is a very significant \nissue with great policy implications for our country. We will hear that \nit is a moral imperative that we deal with the issue of immigration.\n  We have a lot of moral imperatives in this country, and particularly \nin this Chamber of the Senate. I don't disagree that the issue of \nimmigration is one of them. There are people living among us in this \ncountry who have been here 10, 20, 25 years who came across the border \ndecades ago. They found work here, raised a family here. They were \nmodel citizens. I understand that we are not going to round up people \nwho have been here for 2\\1/2\\ decades and deport them to say: You have \ncome illegally and therefore you are not entitled to stay. That is a \ndifferent sensitivity, however, than what is in the underlying bill \nthat says: By the way, if you came here by December 31 of last year, we \nwill deem you to be here legally.\n  I think there are serious problems with that approach. What about \nsomeone overseas who has been waiting to come to this country and they \nknow that we have a legal method of coming to this country. There are \nquotas for each country, and we allow people to sign up and make \napplication and then over a period of time their name comes to the top \nof the list and they are able to come to this country under their \nimmigration quota. Some, perhaps, have waited 5 years, some 10 years \nand are now near the top of the list.\n  What they discover today is they would not have had to wait 5 or 10 \nyears for a legal mechanism by which to come into this country. They \ncould have come across the border at the end of last December, and by \nthis legislation would have been deemed to be legal, would have been \ndeemed to have been here legally.\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\n  I understand this country is a magnet for people from across the \nglobe who would like to come to this country. I was flying via \nhelicopter one day some time ago between Honduras, Nicaragua, and El \nSalvador. Regrettably, the helicopter I was flying in on ran out of \ngas. I learned one of the beautiful laws of the air that afternoon. \nThat is, when you are in a flying machine and it runs out of fuel, you \nwill be landing very quickly.\n  We landed, and we were safe, but, nonetheless, in the mountains and \njungles, somewhere--we were not sure where--in an Army helicopter. We \nwere there 4 or 5 hours before other helicopters found us and pulled us \nout. While there, the campesinos came walking to see who had come down \nin these helicopters. So I had a chance with some hours to talk to the \ncampesinos, the poor people from around the area.\n  I recall visiting with one woman, a young woman in her early \ntwenties. She told me she had only three children. She seemed \ndisappointed by that fact. It was explained to me later that because \nthey have no social security system in her country, you have as many \nchildren as you can in your childbearing years, hoping that enough of \nthem will survive, and if you are lucky enough to grow old, you will \nhave enough children to provide for your support. That was a form of \nfamily social security. Only three children, she said.\n  I said: What do you aspire for yourself and your children?\n  Oh, that is easy, she said through an interpreter. To come to \nAmerica, to come to the United States of America.\n  I asked why.\n  She said: The United States of America, that is a country with \nopportunity and hope for me and my children. Standing there in the \nclearing near the helicopters, this young woman was telling me what \npeople would tell you in many parts of the world. They would aspire to \ncome to the United States because this is the land of opportunity.\n  Ask yourself what would happen were this country to have no \nimmigration quotas, no immigration restrictions, no border security of \nany type, and instead a public policy that said the following: To those \nof you who live on this planet, let us say we welcome you. Come to \nAmerica. See the United States. Stay here. Live here. Work here. We \nwelcome you. We welcome any number.\n  I ask the question: How many people would migrate to the United \nStates and from where? Before you answer, let me explain that this \nwonderful planet we live on circles the Sun, and on this planet there \nare, I believe, close to 6.5 billion neighbors, many of them living in \nvery difficult conditions. Half of them have never made a telephone \ncall, one-half of them live on less than $2 a day, and 1.5 billion do \nnot have access to clean, potable water on a daily basis. It is a \nchallenging planet on which we live.\n  So if the United States of America, this great beacon of hope and \nopportunity, said to the rest of the world: Times have changed, we no \nlonger have any immigration laws, come here, join us, live here, be a \npart of the American experience, we would, I venture to say, have tens \nand tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of people journeying to this \ngreat country. Why? Because many live in abject poverty. Many, if they \ncan find work, are working for 10 cents or 20 cents an hour in unsafe \nplants, in unsafe working conditions, in circumstances where they would \nbe put in prison if they decided to organize the workplace. That is a \nfact of life in many parts of the world. We would be overrun by those \nwho wish to come to this country.\n  As a result, what we have done is understand that immigration is good \nfor our country. It refreshes and nurtures a country such as ours. So \nwe have a process by which legal immigration occurs, with quota systems \nfrom various countries around the world, and immigrants come to live in \nthis country.\n  I venture to say that almost every Member of the Senate found their \nway to this country or found their way at least to this Senate by \nlooking back in the rearview mirror and seeing some unbelievable \nancestors--mine were the same--people who came to this country with \nnothing.\n  One of my ancestors was a woman named Caroline. She came to this \ncountry with her husband. Her husband died of a heart attack, and with \nsix children--think of this, six children and virtually no assets at \nall--she got on a train and went to the southwest corner of North \nDakota and pitched a tent on the prairie to homestead. She, from that \ntent, built a house, raised a family, and operated a family farm. Think \nof the strength and courage of that Norwegian woman who decided: I am \ngoing to do this.\n  All of us have that story in our backgrounds. So we understand the \nvalue of immigration, the value of immigrants, and we provide for it in \na quota system by which we accept people from around the world.\n  Last year, nearly 1.5 million people came into this country through \nthat system. In addition, there were other people who came in as \nagricultural workers. In addition to that, there were people who came \nin illegally. So here we are on the floor of the Senate saying: Now we \nhave about 12 million people who have decided to come to this country, \nno, not through the process by which we accept immigration on a legal \nbasis but come to this country in other ways--get a visitor's visa, \ncome in, get dropped off by an airplane, never go home, stay here \nillegally, or they come across the border, walk across the border \nwithout a visitor's visa and decide they are going to stay here without \nlegal authorization. So we have, some say, 12 million people who are in \nthat status.\n\n  The underlying bill says: Let's decide, as a matter of course, we say \nto all who came into this country or those who came to this country up \nuntil and through December 31 of last year: OK, you are no longer an \nillegal immigrant. You entered without legal authorization, but as of \nthis day forward, when this legislation passes, you have legal \nauthorization to stay. We will give you an opportunity to work and an \nopportunity to gain citizenship.\n  In addition to that, which is the ingredient of a compromise that was \ncreated in the last week, this legislation says we wish to add \nsomething called guest workers or temporary workers. I will talk at \nsome length about those temporary workers. The issue of temporary \nworkers is an important one because we live in a time in this country \nwhere there is downward pressure on income for American families.\n  This morning, Tuesday, a whole lot of people, millions of people got \nup this morning to put on clothes and go to work. When they got to \nwork, they discovered, as they do every day these days, that there is \nno opportunity for upward mobility at their job. In fact, every day \ntheir employers are trying to find ways to push down wages, eliminate \nretirement, and eliminate health care.\n  What has happened in this country, with what is called the ``new \nglobal economy,'' is dramatic downward pressure on income for American \nworkers.\n  I couldn't help but notice a story recently--I mentioned this on the \nfloor of the Senate a while back--that Circuit City, a corporation most \npeople know about, decided they were going to fire 3,400 of their \nworkers. Those folks got up in the morning, went to work that morning, \nprobably kissed their spouse goodbye and said: Honey, I will see you \nthis evening. I love my job. I do a good job. I have been there 8 \nyears. I know my business. But they found out when they got there that \nthe corporation that has a chief executive officer who makes $10 \nmillion a year decided they are going to eliminate 3,400 of these \npeople. We are going to fire them. Why? Because they make $11 an hour, \nand we want to rehire people at a lower wage. So 3,400 people came home \nthat night and said to their families: I lost my job. No, it wasn't \nbecause I did something wrong, it wasn't because I was a bad worker, it \nwasn't because of performance. My company told me that $11 an hour was \ntoo much money, and they want to replace me with someone with less \nexperience and someone to whom they can pay a lower wage.\n  There is dramatic downward pressure on income all across this country \nfor American workers, and that is especially true for workers at the \nbottom of the economic ladder.\n  I don't need to go through all the data, but it is unbelievable when \nyou take a look at what is happening in this country. Those at the very \ntop are getting wealthier, much wealthier, and those at the very bottom \nare being squeezed with substantially less income.\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n  Incidentally, the bill that has been offered--this document--has been \nput on all our desks a few minutes ago, or in the last hour or so. This \nis the immigration bill. I think I can speak with certainty that no \nMember of the Senate has read this. It just became available. So I \nassume everyone will have their evening reading going through a bill \nthat size and a bill of such importance.\n  Earlier, I stated that if we had no immigration quotas and no \nrestrictions, we would have massive numbers of people who live and work \nin poverty, who in many cases can't find a job at all in other parts of \nthe world, who are experiencing famine and war, pestilence and disease, \nwho would want to find their way to this country.\n  It is interesting. You can now go to your computer and Google \n``Earth.'' If you haven't done that, I encourage people to do that. \nGoogle ``Earth,'' and you can, from the air, come down and find out \nwhat is happening on Earth--any spot on the Earth. So if you Google \n``Earth'' and try to evaluate what is happening on this planet, the \nUnited States doesn't look so much different than anyplace else. It is \njust a piece of property on this planet of ours. But it is a very \ndifferent piece of property, a very unusual piece of property. It was \nborn and nurtured by those who wrote a Constitution starting with the \nwords ``We the people'' that has created the most affluent country on \nEarth, with a dramatic expansion of the middle class and opportunity \nthat is universal opportunity--universal education, saying that every \nchild can become whatever their God-given talents allow them to become \nin this country of ours.\n  What a great place we have created. But given what is happening on \nthis planet, we have had to at least provide some order and some \nlimitation with respect to immigration into this country because so \nmany would want to come. So we have a legal system of import quotas. \nThat is a system that many have used. They have waited for years to be \nat the top of the list to come to this country. But it is a system that \nmany have ignored, instead deciding they wanted to get a visiting visa, \njump on an airplane, and when it lands, disappear into the populace, \nnever to be seen again, and stay here illegally, or others have come \nacross on foot, across the Rio Grande or from other areas, deciding to \nremain here without legal authorization.\n  Border security has become very important. It was something discussed \nat great length in the year 1986, when the Simpson-Mazzoli bill was \npassed by the Congress. That was a period of time when we had an \nimmigration crisis. The Simpson-Mazzoli bill was designed to address \nthe immigration crisis. It was going to shut down employment \nopportunities for illegal immigrants by providing employer sanctions. \nIt was going to provide for border security, employer sanctions, and it \nwas going to shut down this system and, therefore, we were going to \nsolve the immigration problem. Even as that bill was passed, it \nprovided for amnesty for 3 million people at that point who had come \nhere illegally.\n  Well, we know that since 1986 that didn't work. All the promises that \nwere offered then have been promises that were not kept. So we find \nourselves, from 1986 to 2001, with Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and \nothers associated with al-Qaida deciding to launch an attack on our \ncountry and murder a good number of Americans, thousands of Americans, \non that fateful day of 9/11/2001. All of a sudden, we have another \nspurt of interest in border security. Not with respect to specifically \nthe issue of immigration but border security with respect to keeping \nterrorists out of our country. Because if you don't control your \nborder, if you don't know who is coming in and keep track of them, you \nhave unbelievable security problems for this country.\n  So we, at various times, have had these spurts of interest with \nrespect to border security. Now we come to the year 2007, and the issue \nagain is a comprehensive immigration bill--but as a portion of it, \nborder security. Of course, border security ought to be, should be, \nsome say will be, but certainly must be the first and foremost \nimportant element of any immigration reform. If you can't provide for \nborder security, let us not spend a lot of time thinking about how we \nare going to keep people out if you can't keep them out. Border \nsecurity is first and foremost the responsibility of any immigration \nreform plan--border security that works.\n  Yes, it is important for terrorism; it is also important with respect \nto this bill dealing with immigration. If border security is important, \nand I believe it is the most important issue at this moment, then other \nissues--if you have solved the border security issue, and I don't \nbelieve this piece of legislation has--other issues are also important \nas well, one of which is the issue I came to talk about, and that is \nthe issue of the guest worker amendment.\n  The guest worker amendment in this compromise on immigration provides \nthat 400,000 people who are not in this country now, who are living \noutside of our country, will be able to come in to assume jobs in our \ncountry per year--400,000 a year. The bill says there are 12 million \npeople who came here illegally who will be given status to stay here \nand to work here. That is what the bill says. So it gives us 12 million \npeople who will have legal status. It says to someone who came across \nDecember 30, 2006: You are going to be deemed to be here legally, or at \nleast have legal status to stay, and we will give you an opportunity to \nwork. So we have 12 million in that circumstance.\n  In addition, there is a provision dealing with guest workers. My \nunderstanding is that provision comes at the request of the Chamber of \nCommerce and big business that want an opportunity to continue the flow \nof cheap labor. That is not the way they would describe it, that is the \nway I am describing it. This is a country in which we are seeing more \nand more jobs being outsourced in search of cheap labor overseas, \nparticularly to China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, and the \nsame interests that wanted to move American jobs overseas in search of \ncheap labor, enjoy the opportunity to bring, through the back door, \ncheap labor from other countries.\n\n  So we have what is called a guest worker or temporary worker \nprovision. Here is how it works. I don't know how one can construct \nsomething this Byzantine, but it nonetheless got done. Here is how this \nsystem will work. A so-called guest or temporary worker will be able to \ncome in, and 400,000 of them will come in the first year. They are able \nto stay for 2 years. They are able to bring their family, if they \nchoose. Then they have to go home for 1 year, take their family home \nwith them, and then they are able to come back 2 years later. So they \nare here 2 years working, then they go home for 1 year; then they can \ncome back for 2 years, then they have to go home for 1 year; then they \nget to come back for 2 years. That is the case with 400,000 a year.\n  This grid shows you what it looks like and what it adds up to do. If \nyou talk about the years of employment, you are talking about 18, 19 \nman-years of employment here with respect to this grid. It is a kind of \nByzantine proposition. We say: Come here and work, bring your family \nand stay here 2 years. Then you all go back and stay where you came \nfrom for 1 year. Then everyone is welcome back for 2 more years, but \nyou have to leave again and stay back 1 year and then come back for 2 \nmore years.\n  I guess there is a provision that if you bring your family one of the \nfirst 2 years, which is your choice, then you only get to come back \ntwice for 2 years. I don't know how you concoct something like that. It \nmakes no sense at all. But aside from the merits of deciding that we \ndon't have enough workers in this country so we need to import cheap \nlabor, aside from that, how on Earth would you construct this approach \nto importing cheap labor?\n  I wish to make some comments about this suggestion that we don't have \nenough people in this country to assume jobs and, therefore, we must \nhave a temporary worker or a guest worker program. There are plenty of \nbig businesses, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that take that \nposition: We need to bring in people who aren't here now to assume \nAmerican jobs. I mentioned earlier we are suggesting that is the case \nat a time when a whole lot of people at the bottom of the economic \nladder in this country are trying to keep up and not doing well at all.\n  This chart shows from 1979 to 2003--and this is from the \nCongressional Budget Office--what has happened with\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\nrespect to income for the various income groups. Look at what has \nhappened to the top 1 percent. A 129-percent increase in income in \nnearly a quarter of a century.\n  Look what has happened to the bottom fifth in a quarter of a century. \nIn a quarter of a century, these folks who are going to work every day, \nthe people you don't see very often, they are the people who pass the \ncoffee to you across the counter or help out at the gas station and do \nthose kinds of jobs, they get a 4-percent increase in 25 years. \nUnbelievable.\n  In that circumstance, in an economic circumstance where the people at \nthe top are doing well, where there is substantial inequality of income \nwith greater income going to the people at the top and much less income \ngoing to the people at the bottom, we are told we need to bring in \nadditional workers from overseas.\n  We are told they are to be brought in because, for example, in the \narea of food preparation jobs, we just can't find enough American \nworkers. There are just not enough people, we are told, in food \nservice.\n  Let's look at food service jobs: 86 percent of the people working in \nfood service in this country are legal citizens, U.S. citizens, or \nlegal immigrants. We are told these are jobs Americans will not take, \nso let's bring in some guest workers. Explain this. Explain how it is \nthat, at least in food preparation, 86 percent of the people working in \nthose areas are Americans or people here legally.\n  If you want to bring in people at the bottom of the economic ladder, \nlow-wage workers, you know what that does to the other 86 percent. It \npushes down. It puts downward pressure on income. We don't have to \ndebate about that. That debate is over. That is exactly what that does.\n  We are told we have other industries like that, such as the \nconstruction industry. We can't find enough people in the construction \nindustry. But 88 percent of the people in the construction industry in \nthis country are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. Once again, we have \npeople who would love to bring in low-wage workers at the bottom to put \ndownward pressure on wages. But it is simply not true that we need low-\nwage workers to come in, more workers to come in because we cannot find \nAmericans to do this job.\n  I understand those who support the temporary worker provisions by and \nlarge want lower incomes. I am talking about the interests outside of \nthis Chamber. There are plenty of them who want to pay less income. \nTransportation jobs--93 percent of the workers in transportation are \nU.S. citizens or legal immigrants. Is someone going to debate this \nissue, that we cannot find Americans to work in these jobs? Clearly, \nthat is not the case.\n  I understand there are those who have these jobs who do not want to \npay a decent wage for them. There are a whole lot of companies that do \nnot want to pay a decent wage. They want to strip the retirement \nbenefits away, they want to strip health care benefits if they ever \ngave them in the first place, and then they want to try to depress the \nincome to the extent they can. I understand that. But it is not the \nright thing.\n  What is the moral imperative in this country? We have a moral \nimperative to stand up for all of the people in this country who get up \nin the morning and go to work and do a good job and hope at the end of \nthe day they get a fair day's pay. Productivity is on the rise in this \ncountry. Productivity increases but workers' incomes do not increase. \nWhy? Those who hire them do not have to increase those incomes even as \nworkers become more productive because they have a supply of cheap \nlabor coming in.\n  Transportation jobs--you can't find Americans to do them? Not true.\n  Manufacturing jobs--94 percent of manufacturing jobs are jobs that \nare performed by American citizens or legal immigrants.\n  I have made the point before that there is no one in this Chamber who \nhas lost their job because of a job being outsourced. But there are so \nmany Americans who understand this. There is a man named Blinder. He \nused to be the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. He is a \nmainstream economist. With respect to the outsourcing of American jobs \nto China and other areas of low wages, he says there are 44 million to \n52 million jobs that are able to be outsourced or tradable. He says not \nall of them will leave our country. But, he says, even those that stay \nwill have downward pressure on their income because they will be \ncompeting with 1.5 billion people in the rest of the world, many of \nwhom work for pennies an hour.\n  As American workers confront that issue, we are told we can't find \nenough workers in manufacturing and we need to bring in temporary \nworkers who do not now live here. That is not true. Most of the workers \nin manufacturing are U.S. citizens and legal immigrants.\n  If someone wants more workers, I will tell you where you can get \nthem. Go find the people who used to work for Levis. They don't make \nLevis in this country anymore. They got fired. Find the people who used \nto work for Fruit of the Loom underwear. They got fired, too. They must \nhave some opportunity for some manufacturing jobs if you can find them. \nFind the people who used to work for Huffy bicycle. Their jobs went to \nChina. They got fired. Go find the people who worked for Radio Flyer \nLittle Red Wagon. They got fired. Go find the people who worked for Fig \nNewton cookies. They got fired. Their jobs went to Mexico.\n  I could talk at great length about where you might find American \nworkers who lost their jobs because they couldn't compete with 20-cent-\nan-hour labor in China.\n  In my State of North Dakota, last week we received some pretty somber \nnews. The Imation Corporation decided they were shutting down their \nplant in Wahpeton, ND, with 390 workers. After I pried it out of them, \nI discovered that slightly less than half of those people are going to \nlose their jobs because the product of their work is going to go to \nJuarez, Mexico, where you can pay 1/10 the wage. That is what is facing \nthe American worker, that downward pressure on income.\n  Now we are told in this bill, let's ignore that. What we need is to \nbring in some more temporary workers to assume jobs Americans will not \ntake. Again, how about paying a decent wage in this country? How about \npaying a decent wage? You will find plenty of people to take these \njobs.\n  There is a study by Professor George Borjas at the John F. Kennedy \nSchool of Government, and he talks about the impact of immigration from \n1980 to 2000, 20 years, on U.S. wages by ethnicity of workers. Over the \nlast 20 years, as a result of immigration--that is low-wage workers \ncoming into this country and putting downward pressure on wages--the \naverage wage is down 3.7 percent; for the average Asian, 3.1; average \nWhite, 3.5; average Black, 4.5; Hispanic, minus 5 percent in wages. The \nfact is, it doesn't require a huge study to understand the consequences \nof that. We all understand that would be the result of bringing in a \nlow-wage workforce. That is not unusual at all.\n  Let me be clear. None of the discussions we are having now have \nanything to do with agricultural workers. In addition to the temporary \nworker program, there is a separate program dealing with agricultural \nworkers. So you have three things: You have legal immigration through \nimport quotas and so on; then you have agricultural workers, well over \n1 million of them, I believe 1.5 million in legal immigration; and then \nyou have a temporary worker permit which, if you add up with the chart \nI have shown you, you are talking about millions of jobs. We are told, \nno, this doesn't matter much because, frankly, businesses say they just \ncan't find Americans to take these jobs.\n\n  I believe that is not the case. I understand what is really at work. \nWhat is at work, in my judgment, is the handprints of those who want to \nbring in additional cheap labor. I do not support it.\n  The amendment I have offered is an amendment that is simple on its \nface. It addresses that provision, that title in this immigration bill \nthat deals with temporary workers. I am not talking about the status of \nthe 12 million people. I am talking about the creation of a status for \npeople who are not in this country now, for people who live outside of \nthis country who, as a result of this bill, are going to be told: You \ncome on in to this country. We will give you a temporary worker status.\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\nYou can come for 2 years at a time, 3 times, a total of 6 years. I do \nnot understand the urgency of putting a provision like this in this \nbill.\n  I am told again, as we are always told, if you offer an amendment \nthat is successful, you will kill this bill because it is a fragile \ncompromise. It is the old argument. It is about the loose thread on a \ncheap sweater. You pull the thread and the arm falls off. God forbid if \nyou pass an amendment, it is going to destroy this compromise.\n  In my judgment, part of offering amendments and getting amendments \nagreed to to improve this legislation should be beneficial even to \nthose who represented a part of this compromise.\n  I say clearly that I think immigration has, for as long as this \ncountry has existed, refreshed and nurtured this country. I support \nimmigration through the legal means of immigration quotas each year. I \nalso support, at this point, strong, assertive border enforcement, \nborder security. Let me describe why we have failed so miserably.\n  Here is a chart. When you talk about the need for border security and \nemployer sanctions, here is a chart that shows what has happened in the \nlast 6 or 7 years with respect to enforcement. As you see, there is a \ndecline in the worksite enforcement to almost zero. It has gone back up \na little bit. I haven't put the last 2 years on there. But you will see \nenforcement with respect to employer sanctions and worksite enforcement \nhas gone down to almost zero. This administration didn't do anything \nwith respect to worksite enforcement.\n  Let me describe what has happened with respect to fines that have \nbeen levied. In 1986 they passed an immigration bill and said we are \ngoing to impose fines if someone would hire illegal workers. Here is \nwhat has happened with the fines. It was $3.6 million nationally, \nacross the whole country in 1999. It is down to $118,000 in 2004. That \nis pathetic enforcement. That is not enforcement, that is just looking \nthe other way.\n  Yet we come to this floor with an urgent problem with immigration, \nand the compromisers say: Let's put all these things together to \nlegalize 12 million people, up to those who came across on December 31, \nand let's decide, as well, we are going to bring additional people in \nwho do not now live here. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  One of the moral imperatives, as I indicated, is to stand up for the \ninterests of workers in this country yes, all workers in this country.\n  Let me conclude. There is so much to say, but let me conclude by \ntelling a story about a piece I saw in the New York Times one day. It \nwas just a small piece. It was a few years ago. It was about a New \nYorker who died. I thought it was a curious piece, so I asked a staff \nperson: Can you track down and see what this little news item in the \nNew York Times is? They did.\n  It was a man named Stanley Newberg who died in New York City. Stanley \nNewberg, my staff discovered, was a man who came to this country with \nhis parents to flee the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. Stanley \nNewberg and his parents landed in this country as new immigrants. \nStanley was a little boy, and he followed his dad around the lower east \nside, apparently, peddling fish. This young boy walked with his dad \npeddling fish in New York City as a very young man.\n  As his parents made a living peddling fish, Stanley learned English. \nThen Stanley went off to school and Stanley became a pretty good \nstudent. Then Stanley graduated from school, he went to college, he \ngraduated from college and then got a job in an aluminum company. He \nworked in this aluminum company, did really well, was a good worker, \nand he rose up to manage the aluminum company and then eventually he \nwas able to buy the aluminum company.\n  So here was Stanley Newberg, this young boy who came with his father \nand mother to this new country and walked in the lower east side of New \nYork peddling fish and now owns an aluminum company in this country. It \nis a very wonderful American success story.\n  Then Stanley Newberg died. They opened his will and that became the \nsubject of a very small item in the New York Times. Stanley Newberg's \nwill left $5.7 million to the United States of America. He said ``with \ndeep gratitude for the privilege of living in this great country.''\n  This little boy who followed his daddy peddling fish, who went to \nschool, became a successful businessman and then died, wanted in his \nwill to remember this country and left $5.7 million to the United \nStates of America ``with deep gratitude for the privilege of living in \nthis great country.''\n  This country did not become this great country by accident. ``We the \npeople,'' the framework of our Government, a wonderful Constitution, a \nseries of initiatives that created a body of law, initiatives in the \nprivate sector, the genius and the entrepreneurship of inventors and \ninvestors and business men and women--it is a wonderful place.\n  But we have obligations. As I indicated earlier, if we had no \nimmigration quotas we would be overrun by millions, tens of millions of \npeople who want to move from where they are on this planet to this spot \nbecause this is the land of opportunity.\n  We have a process of legal immigration. That process needs to work. \nFirst and foremost, we need border security. Second, it seems to me, we \nneed to be sensitive to find a way to deal with the status of those who \nhave been here a long while. Third, and most importantly, we ought not \ndecide to bring legislation to the floor of the Senate that says: On \nbehalf of those big interests, big economic interests that want to hire \ncheap labor through the back door--even as they export good American \njobs through the front door--we ought to say this provision needs to be \nstricken.\n  My amendment is very simple. On behalf of myself and Senator Boxer, I \noffer an amendment to say: Strike this provision.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.) The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota. I certainly concur with \nseveral of the comments he made, about the need to secure our borders, \nabout the need to have a workable immigration system, and the need for \nreform that ensures the rule of law is restored in the United States.\n  Where I differ with him is in his belief that we can actually achieve \nthese goals if we have no ability for temporary workers to come to the \ncountry. His amendment would eliminate the temporary worker program \nfrom this bill.\n  Now, there are several reasons why a temporary worker program, within \ncertain constraints, is a good idea. The first reason is because it \nwill help to relieve the magnet for illegal immigration. This is one of \nthe things President Bush has talked about frequently.\n  The reason most of the people are crossing our border illegally is to \nget employment. There are jobs available for them. Some people say this \nis work Americans will not do. That is actually not true. In all of the \ndifferent work areas, whether it be construction or landscaping or \nworking in a hotel or motel, whatever it might be, roughly half the \npeople working in those industries are American citizens. But there are \nnot enough American citizens to do all of the work that needs to be \ndone. So naturally the law of supply and demand sets in here. People \ncome across the border illegally, and they take that work. What we want \nto do is both close the border, secure the border of the United States, \nbut also eliminate the magnet for illegal employment here, because the \nreality is desperate people will always try to find some way to get \ninto the country.\n  It would be nice if, instead of having to rely strictly on fences and \nBorder Patrol agents, we also relieved the pressure so American \nemployers would have the workers they need and there would be no \nopportunity for illegal workers to come into the United States. Another \nway we have done that, by the way, is to have a very good employee \nverification system put into this legislation.\n  But the key here is to, in effect, have a pressure cooker safety \nvalve. When there is too much employment need here to match up with the \nnumber of workers, then we let off the pressure by allowing some visas \nor temporary\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nworkers to come here temporarily. In the bill they either come 10 \nmonths out of the year--that is the seasonal workers--and then return \nhome, or they can get a 2-year visa, which enables them to come here \nand work for 2 years, then go home for a year. They could reapply. They \ncould reapply twice for a total time of 6 years. But in between each 2-\nyear time period working in the United States, they would have to \nreturn to their home country for a year, in order to try to prevent the \nsituation in which they put down a stake in the United States and \nbelieve after a period of time they are entitled to stay here, thus \nraising the same kind of problem we have had in the past where a group \nof people come here and then do not want to go home, and somehow \nAmerica doesn't have the will to enforce its law, in this case to \nrequire them to go home.\n  That is why the program was set up the way it was. The concept here \nis if you relieve that pressure for employees, by having an opportunity \nfor people to temporarily come here as the guests of the United States \nto work here under our conditions and our rules and then go back home, \nthat will both serve our needs and serve their needs. That is the \nrationale for a temporary worker program.\n  Now, why wouldn't you want to immigrate all of the people here as \nlegal permanent residents? Well, obviously you are talking about \nmillions of people, as the Senator from North Dakota said, in addition \nto the quotas we currently have. But, secondly, you need to have some \nability to adjust. Let me mention the construction industry in my home \nState of Arizona as a good example of this.\n  Two or three years ago we could not find enough workers to build \nhomes in Arizona. The reality is, the Home Builders Association was \ncandid in saying this, that if they had to guess, they would guess \nabout half of the people building homes in Arizona were illegal \nimmigrants. They had the legal papers, but we all know that is a joke. \nThat is why we have to have a workable employee verification system, \nwhich we have put into the bill we are now debating. But the law \ncurrently is not good in terms of verifying employment documents.\n  So you have a construction boom that is occurring in Las Vegas, \nPhoenix, Tucson, and other cities in the Southwest, and we need workers \ndesperately. About 6, 8 months ago, the market began to taper off, and \ntoday we are in a situation where we have an excess of workers for the \njobs available. The market has not tanked completely, by any means, but \nthere is clearly a downturn in the housing construction industry in \nArizona. So we do not need nearly as many workers now. Now that is \ndepressing wages.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is correct in one respect here with \nregard to wages. If you have a greater supply of labor than you have \njobs available, you will depress wages. That indeed has happened in \nsome sectors of our economy, particularly in some low-skilled areas. \nBut the reason is because you have a glut of workers. The workers who \ncame here illegally find it very difficult to go home. Moreover, they \nwill undercut the wages of American workers or depress those wages. \nThey are here and they are depressing wages. Wouldn't it be better to \nhave a temporary worker program, where everyone is working within the \nlaw so when we need the temporary workers to build houses, for example, \nwe issue more of these 2-year visas, but when we don't need them, we \nstop issuing the visas? When those visas run out, we wait until we need \nmore workers. Then we issue more visas. That is the way the temporary \nworker program is designed to work.\n\n  The alternative some people want--well, there are two alternatives. \nEither you allow the illegal situation to continue, which nobody \nwants--that is not a solution--or you adjust all of the quotas Senator \nDorgan was talking about and let everyone come in as a permanent \nworker.\n  That totally upsets our immigration quotas, for one thing. Secondly, \nyou do not have the flexibility of moving up or down depending upon \nwhat the labor requirements or demands are. Again, in housing, if we \nhad let all of these workers come in as green card holders, as legal \npermanent residents, they are here and there is no ability to send them \nback where they came from. They have a legal right to be in the United \nStates for the rest of their lives. That is why you do not want to try \nto deal with temporary, especially low-skilled worker categories, with \nextra green cards. That is why you have a temporary worker program, in \naddition to relieving the magnet for illegal employment.\n  Let me make a couple of other points here. The Senator from North \nDakota says even the temporary worker program will depress wages. Well, \nthere are two reasons why that is not true. The first is it is adjusted \nbased on the labor needs. So at least ideally you never have a glut of \nworkers, an oversupply of workers compared to the demand. The market \nworks to set the wages at the proper rate.\n  If you have green cards, for example, you can easily get a depression \nin wages, because you never can adjust that downward once the workers \nare here. Secondly, in order to get a temporary worker under this bill, \nyou have to advertise at a wage which, in effect, is the average wage \nthat is being paid in that area in that industry. Now, you have to do \nthat to be fair to American workers, because otherwise what would \nhappen is you say: Hey, I have got a construction job; it pays $8 an \nhour. Well, there are not very many Americans who would do heavy \nconstruction for $8 an hour, so nobody shows up.\n  Then the employer goes to the Department of Labor and says: Well, \ngee, I could not get an American to take the job. Let me have some \ntemporary workers. You cannot do that. If it is a carpenter--I am not \nsure what the wage is; maybe it is $18 an hour, maybe more. If he says \nI need 10 carpenters, he has got to say the wage I am paying is $18 an \nhour. Then if American workers are out of work and want to work for \nthat wage, that is the average wage in that industry in that place, and \nthey can come in and work with the knowledge that they are not \nreceiving a depressed wage.\n  If you have Americans willing to do the work, then there is no \ntemporary worker. But if there is not an American to come do the work, \nthe temporary worker comes in at the same wage that is paid to everyone \nelse, so there is no wage depression under this temporary worker \nprogram. I think that argument is not an argument to eliminate this \nprogram.\n  Finally, the Senator from North Dakota began his argument with \nsomething that is absolutely true. He made the point that we cannot \nallow everybody in the world to come to a better place, to come to the \nUnited States. That is absolutely true. We have got a big heart, but we \nhave only got so much room.\n  As a result, we have an immigration system that tries to establish \nquotas, and it establishes areas of immigration in which we will allow \npeople to come here: countries from which they can come; some family \nimmigration; some work visas; asylum, and all of the other categories \nwe have. Then we draw a limit. We say that is it, except for certain \ncategories, except for the nuclear family.\n  A temporary worker program allows us to remain true to that general \nimmigration philosophy we have always had in this country. That is to \nsay, when we need more workers temporarily, we will bring them into the \ncountry, but when we no longer need them here, they return home. That \nway you are not, as the Senator from North Dakota said, opening your \ndoors to all of the people in the world who want to come here. I agree \nwith him; we cannot do that. But when we have a need that is not being \nsatisfied and we have advertised the job for the same wage Americans \nare earning, and we cannot get an American to do that work, then it is \nappropriate to say to a foreign national: If you want to come here and \nwork under our conditions, abiding by our rules, we will allow you to \ndo that and, of course, when you are done, you will return home.\n  That is the essence of the temporary worker program here. It is a \ngood program. I hope my colleagues will appreciate that there are \nstrong reasons for including it in this legislation, as I said, \nstarting with the proposition that it will eliminate the magnet for \nillegal employment that exists today.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act \nwe are debating right now is a long and complicated bill that touches \non a number of important issues. It addresses the concerns I believe \nall of us have about securing our borders, something I strongly \nsupport, and that is long overdue. It addresses the need to hold \nemployers accountable when they knowingly hire illegal immigrants, \nsomething which certainly under the Bush administration has not been \nthe case.\n  This bill addresses the very contentious and difficult issue of how \nwe respond to the reality that there are some 12 million illegal \nimmigrants in this country today, and how we can carve out a path which \neventually leads to citizenship, which is something I support.\n  But today I want to concentrate on one major aspect in this \ncomprehensive bill, and that deals with the Dorgan amendment and the \nwhole issue of guest laborers. That point centers around the state of \nthe economy for working people in the United States and, in my view, my \nstrong view, the negative impact this overall legislation will have for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Let me begin by pointing to this quote, this quote right here, from \nMr. Randel K. Johnson, the vice president of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, which was reported in the New York Times on May 21, the other \nday. This is what Mr. Johnson said:\n\n       We do not have enough workers to support a growing economy. \n     We have members who pay good wages but face worker shortages \n     every day.\n\n  Mr. President, let me suggest that Mr. Johnson and many of the other \nbig business organizations and multinational corporations that have \nhelped craft this legislation are not being quite accurate when they \nmake statements such as this. The major economic problem facing our \ncountry today is not that we do not have enough workers to fill good-\npaying jobs. Rather, the problem is we do not have enough good-paying, \nlivable wage jobs for the American people, and that situation is \ngetting worse. Over the last 6 years, 5.4 million more Americans have \nslipped into poverty, with the national minimum wage remaining at a \ndisgraceful $5.15 an hour.\n  By the way, Mr. Johnson's organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nopposes raising the minimum wage.\n  With over 5 million more Americans slipping into poverty, where are \nall those good-paying jobs these workers can't seem to find? Over the \nlast 6 years, nearly 7 million more Americans have lost their health \ninsurance. Where are all those good jobs that provide benefits such as \na strong health insurance package? Where are all those good jobs Mr. \nJohnson talks about when millions of Americans are losing their health \ninsurance completely or are asked to pay substantially more for \ninferior coverage?\n  In the last 6 years since President Bush has been in office, some 3 \nmillion American workers have lost their pensions. If all of these good \njobs are out there, why are more and more Americans slipping into \npoverty, more and more Americans losing their health insurance, and \nmore and more Americans losing their pensions?\n  From the year 2000 to 2005, median household income declined by \n$1,273. For 5 consecutive years, median household income for working \nage families has gone down. In other words, despite Mr. Johnson's \nassertion about all of the good-wage, good-paying jobs that are out \nthere waiting for the American worker, the reality is, all over our \ncountry people are desperately looking for jobs that pay a livable \nwage. The real income of the bottom 90 percent of American taxpayers \nhas declined steadily from $27,060 in 1979 to $25,646 in 2005. While \nwomen have done somewhat better in recent years, real median weekly \nearnings for males has actually gone down since 1979. Despite Mr. \nJohnson's assertion, the economic reality facing our country is that \nthe middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing, and the gap \nbetween the very rich and everybody else is growing wider and wider.\n  I am assuming most Members of the Senate took economics 101 in \ncollege. One of the major tenets of free market economics is the law of \nsupply and demand. Under that basic economic proposition, if an \nemployer is having a difficult time finding a worker--and Mr. Randel \nJohnson tells us that is the case--then the solution to that problem on \nthe part of the employer is to provide higher wages and better \nbenefits. That is what the free market economy is supposed to be about. \nThat is what supply and demand is all about. If you are having a \ndifficult time attracting workers, you pay them higher wages and better \nbenefits, and they will come. I wonder how it could be that with a \nsupposed scarcity of workers out there, wages and benefits are going \ndown. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If Mr. Johnson were \nright, you would expect that wages would be going up, benefits would be \ngoing up. In fact, the opposite is true.\n  What this legislation is not about is addressing the real needs of \nAmerican workers. It is not about raising wages or improving benefits. \nWhat it is about is bringing into this country over a period of years \nmillions of low-wage temporary workers with the result that wages and \nbenefits in this country, which are already going down, will go down \neven further.\n  Let's talk about what really is going on in our economy today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a document entitled \n``May 2005 Occupational Wages and Estimates'' which comes from the \nState of Vermont Department of Labor. That is the latest such report \navailable.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  MAY 2005 VERMONT OCCUPATIONAL WAGE ESTIMATES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                          Reporting\n                  SOC                          Occupation title             units      Employment       Mean\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n41-2011...............................

Let me discuss the 10 largest categories of employment \nin my State of Vermont and the wages workers earn who do that work. We \nwill talk on some of them, not all 10. The occupation in Vermont with \nthe most employment is that of being a cashier. Those are people who \nobviously work at retail stores and who take in money, make change. The \naverage wage for this category of worker 2 years ago--these are the \nlatest figures we have seen--was $8.71 an hour. Many of those workers \nhave inadequate or no health care at all. That is $8.71 for that \ncategory of work in which more Vermonters perform than any other. Are \nthese the good wages to which the Chamber of Commerce is referring?\n  In that same survey, the second largest job category in Vermont is \nthat of retail salespersons. That mean hourly wage was, as of 2 years \nago, $11.88 an hour. That is better than cashiers earn but less than \n$26,000 a year.\n  On and on it goes: bookkeepers in Vermont, $14.14 an hour; waiters \nand waitresses, $8.97; secretaries, $12.91; office clerks, $11.17 an \nhour; janitors and cleaners, $10.51 an hour.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of jobs \navailable today in northern Vermont and in the Littleton, NH, area as \nposted by the Vermont Department of Labor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Vermontjoblink.com, May 22, 2007]\n\n     1.

These are the jobs which are available today. If any \nMember of the Senate wanted to retire today and they wanted to run up \nto northern Vermont or to the Littleton, NH, area, these are the jobs \nwhich are available today, posted by the Vermont Department of Labor: \nIf you wanted to be a flagger, you can make $10 an hour; if you want to \nbe a dispatcher, $11 an hour; home care attendants, thousands of home \ncare attendants taking care of the elderly and the frail make all of \n$7.53; store clerk, $8 an hour; construction laborer, $11 an hour; \nreceptionist, $8 to $10 an hour; shipping, $11 an hour; machine \noperator, $8 to $10 an hour. On and on it goes. Those are the jobs \navailable today in northern Vermont, what we call the Northeast \nKingdom, and the Littleton, NH, area.\n  Over the years in Vermont and throughout this country, people have \nbeen trying to understand a very important concept: How much money does \nan individual and a family need in order to survive economically with \ndignity? That means having an adequate home, having a car that works, \npaying your electric bill on time, having some health insurance, having \nchildcare for a child if that is what you need. That whole concept is \ncalled a livable wage--the means by which an American citizen can live \nin dignity.\n  For a single person living alone in the State of Vermont, that wage \nis $14.26 an hour. That is substantially more than the wage being paid \nin Vermont for a cashier, which is what more people do than anything \nelse. If you are a single parent with one child, that livable wage is \n$21.40 an hour; single parent with two children, $20.59 an hour; two \nparents, two children, and one wage-earner, $24.89.\n  What is my point? My point is a simple one: Despite the Chamber of \nCommerce assertion that there are all these great-paying jobs out there \nand the major problem facing our economy is that we just can't find the \nworkers to do them, I can tell you, in the Vermont-New Hampshire area, \nthere are thousands and thousands of decent, hard-working people making \n10 bucks an hour, 11 bucks an hour, 12 bucks an hour, less than that, \nand many of those workers have no health insurance. Many of those \nworkers are having a hard time making ends meet.\n  Here is my concern about this legislation. At a time when millions of \nAmericans are working longer hours for low wages and have seen real \ncuts in their wages and benefits, this legislation would, over a period \nof years, bring millions of low-wage workers from other countries into \nthe United States. If wages are already this low in\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nVermont and throughout the country, what happens when more and more \npeople are forced to compete for these jobs? Sadly, in our country \ntoday--and this is a real tragedy--over 25 percent of our children drop \nout of high school. In some minority neighborhoods, that number is even \nhigher. What kind of jobs will be available for those young people?\n  This is not legislation designed to create jobs, raise wages, and \nstrengthen our economy. Quite the contrary. This immigration bill is \nlegislation which will lower wages and is designed to increase \ncorporate profits. That is wrong, and that is not an approach we should \naccept.\n  Today, corporate leaders are telling us why they want more and more \nforeign workers to come into this country to compete with American \nworkers. I find it interesting that just a few years ago, during the \ndebate over our trade policy, this is what these same people had to \nsay. Let me quote. According to an Associated Press article of July 1, \n2004, Thomas Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, was quoted as saying that he ``urged American companies to \nsend jobs overseas'' and that ``Americans affected by off shoring \nshould stop whining.'' Then he told the Commonwealth Club of California \nthat ``one job sent overseas, if it happens to be my job, is one too \nmany. But the benefits of [outsourcing] jobs outweigh the cost.'' That \nwas from an AP story, July 1, 2004.\n  Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, said in January of \n2004: ``There's no job that is America's God-given right anymore,'' as \nher company Hewlett-Packard has shipped over 5,000 jobs to India, \noutsourced almost all of their notebook PC designs, production, and \nlogistics to Taiwan, and manufactures much of their product in China. \nMs. Fiorina may have had a point. A few years ago, she lost her job as \nCEO due to poor performance. But unlike the thousands of jobs she was \nresponsible for shipping overseas, Ms. Fiorina walked away with a $21 \nmillion golden parachute.\n  I should add that Hewlett-Packard, among many other corporate leaders \nin outsourcing, just coincidentally happens to be one of those \ncorporations most active in the immigration debate. In other words, if \nthese large corporations are not shutting down plants in the United \nStates, throwing American workers out on the streets, moving to China, \nwhere they pay people 50 cents an hour, what they are doing is \ndeveloping and pushing legislation which displaces American workers and \nlowers wages in this country by bringing low-wage workers from abroad \ninto America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Vermont will \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on that point, I was thinking of something \nour colleague from Arizona said a few minutes ago. He talked about the \nfact they are going to provide substantial border security, No. 1. Then \nlater he said the reason we have to allow guest or temporary workers--\n400,000 of them--to come into this country is if we do not let them \ncome in, there will be more tension for illegal immigration. Well, \nwhere is the illegal immigration going to come from if you have secured \nthe border? If you have not secured the border, isn't it the case that \nwhat you have simply done is said we are going to have 400,000 people \ncome across the border or come into this country and assume jobs? Do \nyou know what we will do? Let's just call them legal. Isn't there an \ninherit contradiction in what we just heard--and we will hear again, I \nam sure--the proposition that we have to have temporary workers because \nif we do not, people will come in illegally? How will they come in \nillegally if you have secured the border? And shouldn't you first \nsecure the border in a way that is credible?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I agree with my friend from North Dakota. \nBut he will remember something else. Doesn't this argument about \npassing legislation that will stop illegal immigration ring a bell in \nterms of the debate we had over NAFTA? Does my friend from North Dakota \nremember that one of the reasons we had to pass NAFTA was to improve \nthe economy in Mexico so workers there would not be coming into this \ncountry?\n  It sounds to me as if it is the same old tired argument. It certainly \nhas not worked with regard to NAFTA. Since NAFTA has passed, among many \nother things, there has been a huge increase in illegal immigration. \nThe point the Senator makes is quite right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, this is \nanother piece of evidence that in this kind of discussion in the \nCongress, you never have to be right; all you have to have is a new \nidea--and you just keep coming up with new ideas that are wrong.\n  The Senator is perfectly correct with respect to NAFTA. In fact, the \nsame economists who were giving all this advice about NAFTA, who were \nfundamentally wrong, are now giving us advice on this issue and telling \nus how they are going to create new jobs and all of these related \nissues.\n  The fact is, at its roots, isn't it the case that what this kind of \ntemporary worker provision does is put downward pressure on the income \nfor American workers and bring in low-wage workers to assume American \njobs? Isn't that the case?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, that is exactly right.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota has been very strong on this \nissue. We are looking at two sides of the same coin, with the result \nthat the middle class gets squeezed and workers are forced to work for \nlower wages. That is, on one hand, a trade policy which corporate \nAmerica pushed through the House and the Senate that says we can shut \ndown plants in America, run to China, pay people there pennies an hour, \nand bring those products back into America. They have laid off millions \nof American workers. On the other side of the economy, we still have \nservice jobs in this country, some of which may pay a living wage. Many \nof them do not. American corporations and companies say: We need to be \nable to make more profits, so if we cannot shut down restaurants and \nMcDonald's in America and take them to China, well then, I guess what \nwe have to do is bring those workers back into the United States. But \nas the Senator from North Dakota just indicated, the end result is the \nsame: more and more workers experiencing cuts in their wages, poverty \nin America increasing, and the middle class shrinking.\n  Let's not forget--I think a lot of people do not know this, and the \nmedia does not necessarily make this point--behind a lot of this \nimmigration legislation stands the largest corporations in America, one \nof them being Microsoft, having played a very active role in this \ndebate. Here is what the vice president of Microsoft said, as quoted in \nBusinessWeek in 2003:\n\n       It's definitely a cultural change to use foreign workers, \n     but if I can save a dollar, hallelujah.\n\n  Four years ago, Brian Valentine, Microsoft's senior vice president, \nurged his managers to ``pick something to move offshore today.''\n  The CEO of Microsoft has said--this is Steve Ballmer; this is \nrelevant to this debate--``Lower the pay of U.S. professionals to \n$50,000 and it won't make sense for employers to put up with the hassle \nof doing business in developing countries.\n  Lower the pay of professionals in America.\n  What I find interesting about corporate America's support for this \ntype of legislation is their arguments now distinctly contradict the \narguments they made when they told us how good outsourcing is for this \ncountry and how good our trade policies such as NAFTA and permanent \nnormal trade relations with China would be. What hypocrisy. One day \nthey shut down plants with high-skilled, well-paid American workers and \nmove to China. That is one day. On the next day, after having shut down \na plant with highly skilled workers, they have the nerve to come to the \nCongress and tell us they cannot find skilled workers to do the jobs \nthey have. Give me a break.\n  I think we all know what is going on here. Greed rather than love of \ncountry has become the driving force behind corporate decisions. While \ncorporate profits are at their highest share of gross domestic product \nsince 1960--up more than 90 percent since President Bush took office--\nmedian earnings are at their lowest share since 1947. In other words, \nas a result of all of these policies, people on top--corporate\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nAmerica--are doing very well. The middle class is struggling. While \nmillions of workers are working longer hours for lower wages, the CEOs \nof major corporations are now earning 400 times what their employees \nmake.\n  Today, in America, the top 300,000 Americans earn nearly as much \nincome as the bottom 150 million Americans combined. Today, in America, \nthe richest 1 percent own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, and \nwe now have the most uneven distribution of wealth and income of any \nmajor nation on Earth. That is the reality, and these immigration \npolicies, these trade policies, are directly causing this disparity of \nwealth and income.\n  We hear over and over again from large multinational corporations \nthat there are jobs Americans just will not do and that we need foreign \nworkers to fill those jobs. Well, that is really not quite accurate. If \nyou pay an American or any person good wages and good benefits, they \nwill do the work.\n  In June 2005, Toyota, in San Antonio, TX, announced the opening of a \nplant. That plant received, in a 2-week period, 63,000 applications for \n2,000 jobs. That story has been repeated all over this country. If you \nare going to pay decent wages, they will come and they will do the \nwork. Yes, it will be difficult to attract an American worker to work \nin, say, a meatpacking house if the pay is 24 percent lower today than \nit was in 1983--24 percent lower. But guess what. In 1980, when the \nwages of meatpacking workers were 17 percent higher than the average \nmanufacturing sector wage--because they had a strong union--American \nworkers were prepared to do that difficult and dirty job. They did it \nbecause they were paid well. They had a union. They had dignity.\n  I have talked about the crisis in terms of low-wage jobs. Now let me \nsay a few words about the problems facing our country in terms of \nhigher wage jobs.\n  While our corporate friends bemoan the lack of skilled professionals \nand want to bring hundreds of thousands of more employees into this \ncountry with a bachelor's degree, an M.A., or a Ph.D., earnings--while \nthis process goes on--of college graduates were 5 percent lower in 2004 \nthan they were in 2000, according to White House economists. In other \nwords, for college graduates, their earnings are also in decline. But \nwhat this legislation does is expand the opportunity for people with \nM.A.s and Ph.D.s and B.A.s and B.S.s to come into this country. When it \ncomes to the H-1B visa, our corporate friends tell us Americans cannot \ndo it. We cannot do that work. We are either too dumb or just not \nwilling to do the following jobs.\n  Let me for a moment mention some of the eligible occupations for H-1B \nvisas that Americans are, apparently, too dumb to be able to do: \ninformation technology/computer professionals, university professors, \nengineers, health care workers, accountants, financial analysts, \nmanagement consultants, lawyers--my God, if there is one thing in this \ncountry, one area where we have too many, it is lawyers; I am not sure \nthere is a pressing need to bring more lawyers into this country--\narchitects, nurses, physicians, surgeons, dentists, scientists, \njournalists and editors, foreign law advisers, psychologists, technical \npublication writers, market research analysts, fashion models--fashion \nmodels--and teachers in elementary or secondary schools. I just did not \nknow we were incapable of providing teachers in our elementary or \nsecondary schools.\n  Having said that, I do recognize we do have a serious problem in \nterms of labor shortages in some areas. That is true. But, in my view, \nour major strategy must be to educate our own students in these areas \nso they can benefit from these good-paying jobs. These are the jobs \nwhich are paying people good wages. Rather than bringing people from \nall over the world to fill them, I would rather our kids and \ngrandchildren were able to do these kinds of jobs.\n\n  Let me give you one example. Right now, it is absolutely true that we \nhave a major shortage of nurses in this country. That is true. But at \nthe same time as we have a major shortage of nurses, some 50,000 \nAmericans last year applied to nursing schools, and they could not get \ninto those schools because we do not have the faculty to educate \nAmericans to become nurses. How absurd is that? So it seems to me, \nbefore we deplete the Philippines and other countries of their stock of \nnurses--doing very serious harm to their health care systems--maybe, \njust maybe we might want to provide educators in this country for our \nnurses. The same thing is true of dentists. It is a very serious \nproblem with regard to shortages of dentists. Yet in dental schools all \nover this country we lack faculty to educate people to become dentists. \nWhile there is a dispute as to whether we do have a shortage in \ninformation technology jobs, there is no doubt we should make sure that \nenough Americans--far more Americans--are better educated in math and \ncomputer science than we are currently doing.\n  The bottom line is we need to take a very hard look at our \neducational system and, among other things, make college education \naffordable to every American while we increase our focus on math and \nscience. How absurd it is that hundreds of thousands of low-income kids \nno longer are able to go to college because they cannot afford it, and \nthen we say: Well, we don't have the professionals we need in this \ncountry; we have to bring them in from abroad. So the long-term \nsolution is making sure college is affordable and improving our public \nschools so our people can fill these jobs.\n  As this debate on this bill continues, I am going to do everything I \ncan to make sure any immigration reform legislation passed by this body \nhas the result of lifting wages up and expanding the middle class, \nrather than doing the contrary.\n  Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to cooperate with my friend from \nCalifornia. I have been here for the debate with the Senator from North \nDakota, and I want to respond.\n  If the Senator needs 5 or 8 or 10 minutes----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I will be glad to withhold and speak after that \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator so much.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, can the Chair tell me when I have gone \nabout 9 minutes, and then I will wrap up.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, if the Senator will permit me, I ask to \nbe recognized at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, would the Chair inform me when I have 1 \nminute left of my 10 minutes so I can wrap up at that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). She will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon--I wanted to be \nhere for this entire debate, but I have been chairing a hearing over in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, where our attorney general, \nJerry Brown, is here to make a very strong and persuasive case for our \nState and 11 other States to begin to take on the issue of global \nwarming in terms of emissions of movable sources, mobile sources--cars. \nI came over as soon as I could.\n  I am so grateful to Senator Dorgan for once again showing the \nleadership to offer us an amendment that I think has tremendous merit \nand that is to strip from the immigration bill this guest worker \nprogram. I wish to make it clear that this guest worker program has \nnothing to do with the agricultural jobs program that is in this bill \nthat I support, a bill that has been vetted at hearings. We know there \nis a need. There seems to be very little, if any, disagreement on that \nportion of the bill.\n  But this is a generalized guest worker program. I did hear the \ncomments of Senator Sanders. I wish to associate myself with his \nremarks. Senator Sanders makes a brilliant point. How many times have \nwe seen workers huddled in a corner with tears in their eyes because \nthey received a notice that they have been laid off--not by the tens, \nnot by the twenties, not by\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\nthe hundreds but sometimes by the thousands. Big employers in this \ncountry seemingly with nowhere to turn tell us: Oh, my goodness, we \nhave to compete, we have to pare down our employment, and they lay \npeople off. Those same employers are now begging for a guest worker \nprogram. Why? You have to ask yourself why? I do have a degree in \neconomics, but I would say that was a long time ago. You don't need a \ndegree in economics to understand what is at stake. These large \nemployers want a large, cheap labor pool that they can draw from. My \ncolleagues on the other side say: Oh, we are protecting those workers. \nOh, they will be fine.\n  No, they will not be fine. How many workers do you know ever in the \nhistory of America who have to leave after 2 years and wait a year to \ncome back to a program, leave after the next 2 years, come back, and by \nthe way, how powerless are these workers, these temporary guest \nworkers? They know if they say one thing to criticize, perhaps, a \nmanager or to complain or to beg for a sick day because they have a \nsick child at home, when they know they have no power, everything rides \non their being able to come back into the country because the employer \nsays they can come back in. We are setting up a system of exploitation. \nWe are setting up a system with this generalized guest worker program, \na system that will put downward pressure on the American worker. We are \nalready worried about what is happening with trade.\n  Many of us have been saying for years: Where are the workers' rights \nin these trade agreements? Where are the environmental standards? Now \nthey claim they are coming in with these agreements. I will believe it \nwhen I read the fine print. But the point is we are already in trouble, \nour workers are, competing with workers from around the world. Now we \nare bringing them in here, 400,000 a year, every single year, millions \nof workers.\n  Now, I know my dear friends who put this together tried their best to \nbring us a fair bill, but this is not fair. I know my friends who \nworked so hard to put this together said: Well, we have to give up \nsomething to get something. I know that, believe me. I just brought my \nfirst bill to the floor as a chairman. It was tough, very tough. I \nunderstand that. But there is a point at which you have to say: Time \nout; let's look at this. This isn't good. I say we make this bill so \nmuch better if we can strip out this generalized guest worker program. \nI think Senator Sanders has shown us, by way of his research, that this \nwhole thing is a phony request that we need these workers, when we \nalready know that big business is laying off our workers.\n  I think we have to look at what we are about to do. The underlying \nbill takes 12 million undocumented immigrants, most of whom are in the \nworkforce already, and they put them on a path to legality. I support \nthat. If they have worked hard and if they have played by the rules and \nif they are good people, I support that. It is not amnesty. I have seen \nwhat this bill does. They have to pay heavy-duty fines. They have to \nget in the back of the line. That is fine. But on top of the 12 million \nworkers, we then have our regular program of green cards. Madam \nPresident, 1.1 million receive green cards; 1.5 million in 2005 were \ngiven temporary worker admission. So here we have a circumstance where \nwe are legalizing 12 million people, most of whom are workers; we have \nanother 3 million who come in every year, plus we have our regular \nimmigration system, and now we are adding on top of that 400,000 \nworkers a year.\n  Now, according to the Economic Policy Institute, nearly 30 million \nAmericans make an average wage of $7 an hour. The plight of these \nworking poor is not getting better. In fact, real wages for the bottom \n20 percent of American workers have declined from 2003 to 2005. Let me \nrepeat that. Real wages between 2003 and 2005 have declined. People \ncannot live on $7 an hour, to be honest with you. I was going through \nmy son's old pay stubs when he worked his way through college in the \n1980s. He worked as a clerk at a grocery store. He made $7 an hour in \nthe 1980s; $11 on the weekend. A good job. That is what a lot of the \nworkers still make. That is not right, to stagnate like that. It is not \nright.\n  Now, you add to the fact that our workers are losing ground; you say \n400,000 guest workers. By the way, if we did this industry by industry, \nit might make a little more sense, but oh, no. These workers can come \nin and go anywhere. They can go anywhere. So it is a pool of cheap \nlabor at the expense of the American workers. It is as simple as that. \nI don't think it takes an economics degree to understand it. Our \ncolleagues say: Well, these are jobs that American workers would not \ntake. Baloney. We heard the jobs. A lot of them are good jobs.\n  We are going to work on this. We may not make this amendment. I hope \nwe win it. I think everyone who cares about American workers today \nshould vote for the Dorgan-Boxer amendment and strip this guest worker \nprogram from the bill--leaving the AgJOBS in place, of course--but \nstrip this from the bill. Get rid of this terrible program. If that \ndoesn't work, there will be amendments to cut it in half and maybe \nmore. Let's do that. I will have amendments to make sure there are some \nchecks on this program, that if more than 15 or 16 percent of the \nworkers don't obey the rules and stay here, even though they are \nsupposed to go back, the program will be finished, over, done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So there will be a series of amendments on this guest \nworker program.\n  I also will have an amendment that has the Department of Labor \ncertifying that this guest worker program is good for America. It is \ngood for the American worker. If they cannot so find, they will tell \nus, and we will have to reauthorize this program every single year. \nThis is written in a way that no matter what the unemployment rate, no \nmatter what is happening on the ground to our workers, 400,000 guest \nworkers come in. Imagine that. Imagine that. Imagine a time in America \nwhere we could be up to 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent unemployment. \nI have lived through those days, and I know the Senator from North \nDakota has as well. But there is no automatic change in this program. \nWe will still have 400,000 workers a year coming in. We have to put a \ncheck and balance on that program.\n  So I want to be able to vote for an immigration bill that is fair and \njust. This program is unfair. It is unjust. It will place downward \npressure on the American worker who is struggling as we speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am going to address the Senate on a \ndifferent but very important issue and ask that these remarks be placed \nin the appropriate place in the Record and then address the amendment \nthat is before us.\n  I see my good friend from Florida wishes to address the amendment, \nand we have notified our leaders that we are hopeful we will be able to \nget a vote in the not-too-distant future, for the benefit of Members. I \nwanted to speak now briefly, if that is all right.\n  The Senator from Florida has been waiting a good deal of time, so if \nhe would like to take 10 minutes and speak, I plan to be around here \nanyway, so if he would like to do that, I will be more than happy to do \nthat.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. That would be fine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized after the \nSenator from Florida speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I wanted to speak on the subject of \nthe Dorgan amendment and maybe try to set the record straight on some \nthings.\n  It is obvious that there is a different point of view on the relative \nmerits of this amendment and also on the situation our country faces \ntoday relative to labor. I come from a State where the unemployment \nrate is barely above 2.5 percent and where, frankly, there is a \nshortage of workers to do any number of jobs, from picking citrus to \nworking in our hotels and many other tourist attractions. That is a \nfact of life. When you talk to the hospital administrators of our \nhospitals, they will tell us without a doubt there is a shortage of \nnurses. Our Governor very wisely has\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\ncreated some programs to enhance the number of nurses in our State by \nproviding expanded educational opportunities. But the fact remains, we \ndo have a problem. From time to time, there are needs for workers that \nour Nation simply cannot meet. To say otherwise simply would be \nignoring the reality we face today.\n  So as we speak to this issue, I wish to try to go through several \naspects of the bill that I think are important to keep in mind as we \ntalk about this guest worker program. The eligibility requirement for Y \nworkers, this is what the workers must do. They have a valid labor \ncertification issued within 180 days. They have to have eligibility to \nwork. They must have a job offer from a U.S. petitioner employer, and \nthey must also have the payment of a processing fee and the State \nimpact fee. Whatever State they are going to be going to, there is \ngoing to be an impact on that State as it relates to health care and \nschools and whatever else, and that impact fee will be paid to the \nStates. They have to have a medical examination and, very importantly \nfor our national security, a complete criminal and terrorism-related \nbackground checks. They also must not be inadmissible or ineligible, \nmeaning if we have deported you before, you need not apply.\n  Here is something else. For the Y-3 visa, they must have a wage 150 \npercent above the poverty level for the household size, and if they \ncome with their families, which Y-3s would be allowed to in very \nlimited numbers, they also must have insurance for their family as they \ncome.\n  Now, if a worker fails to timely depart at the time that his \ntemporary worker status is up, they will be barred from any future \nimmigration benefit except where the applicant is seeking asylum. So it \nmeans that when the time is up, if you don't leave, you have quit \nplaying the game, you are not coming back.\n  Here are some of the requirements that are placed on the employer \nbefore they can bring in an employee to work under this program. The \nemployer of the Y visa worker must file an application for labor \ncertification and a copy of the job offer. They have to pay a \nprocessing fee, so that this is a pay-as-you-go program. They must also \nmake efforts to recruit U.S. workers for the position for which the \nlabor certification is sought. Now, they must start recruiting no later \nthan 90 days before the filing day for the application to the \nDepartment of Labor, and they must also, as part of their requirements, \nadvertise in the area where the job is sought to be filled.\n  They advertise with labor unions, other labor organizations, and the \nDepartment of Labor Web site saying: Please come work for me, we have a \njob available. Then and only then, if there is a certification that the \njob goes unfilled, could a guest worker come to work on our shores.\n  The Secretary of Labor and the employers must attest that it will not \ndisplace, nor adversely affect, the wages or working conditions of U.S. \nworkers, and that the wages will be paid not less than the greater of \nthe actual wage paid by the employer to all similarly situated workers \nor the prevailing competitive wage.\n  We are doing this because there is a need, not because we simply want \nto. It is obvious that all of us would love to see American workers \nflourish first and foremost, but the facts are such that this is a \nnecessary thing that we must have in our economy.\n  As to the issue of whether it will help border security, I happen to \nbelieve if we have a legal means for people to come across the border \nto meet that same supply and demand we are talking about--there is a \ndemand for workers, there is a ready and available supply--those two \nare going to meet one another, and we are going to enhance our border \nsecurity.\n  But would it not help border security if we also had a legal means by \nwhich people could come and work in this country? Of course, it will. \nThat will give us a safety valve. It will give us an opportunity for \nlegal workers to come to work for a period of time to fulfill a need \nwhen necessary--after certification, after advertising, and for the \nprevailing wage in that area. I think it is a reasonable thing to do. \nIt is part of what our economy needs.\n  I could get into all kinds of other issues, such as wage scale and \nforeign trade and issues such as that, but I don't know that they are \nrelevant to the subject at hand.\n  I do hope my colleagues will support defeating the Dorgan amendment \nbecause I believe this amendment would not only do great harm to the \nbill, it would be the end of this very comprehensive immigration bill. \nAt the same time, in this bill I think we have, negotiated through this \nprocess, carefully balanced the needs of our economy with the rights of \nworkers, as well as made sure that we are keeping a good balance \nbetween the needs of the economy and also that which is necessary to be \nfulfilled by a foreign workforce.\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank my friend from Florida for his \ncomments and helpful statements.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5:45 \np.m. today be for debate with respect to Dorgan amendment No. 1153, \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no amendments in \norder prior to the vote, and that the time be divided as follows: 20 \nminutes under the control of Senator Dorgan and the remaining time \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Kennedy and Kyl or \ntheir designees; and that at 5:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  Madam President, we have the Dorgan amendment that is before us and \nwill be acted on at 5:45 pm. It effectively eliminates the temporary \nworker program that provides for 400,000 visas a year. Let's understand \nwhere we are. It is important to look at the total legislation to \nunderstand each part of it.\n  First of all, Madam President, we have very tough border security \nproposals. That has been talked about and will have a greater \nopportunity to talk about those enormously important provisions.\n  Secondly, it has very important interior enforcement proposals. That \nis very important. It does not exist today. It didn't exist in the 1986 \nAct. I opposed the 1986 Act. President Reagan signed the Act and \namnesty was part of it. But, the 1986 Act was a different proposal and \nlegislation and has no relevancy whatever with this. So, this \nlegislation has tough border security and tough interior enforcement \nprovisions.\n  The legislation does have an impact on chain migration, which will be \nan issue to debate and discuss later. The legislation does include a \ntemporary worker program. There are provisions that many in this body \nfelt were extremely important. They are included in this legislation. \nWe've also included in this legislation assurance to the 12 million \nundocumented immigrants that are here that they will be safe and secure \nand not deported like a number of families were deported in my own \nstate of Massachusetts in the city of New Bedford.\n  The legislation also eliminates the backlog. Some families have been \nwaiting 20 years to be reunited with their families will now be \nreunited over eight years. That is enormously important. It has the \nAgJobs bill. I listened carefully to my good friend from California \nbeing opposed to temporary workers, with the exception of temporary \nworkers in agriculture. We have an AgJobs bill for farmworkers who \nprobably have the most difficult backbreaking job in America. This bill \ngives them the opportunity to emerge from the shadows and into the \nsunlight. This is enormously important. Many of us remember the \nextraordinary work of Cesar Chavez, who was a leader on the issue of \nfarmworker rights. This bill gives the workers the respect they \ndeserve. This amendment would deny many families the opportunity to see \ntheir children of undocumented workers get help and assistance after \nthe children have worked hard, played by the rules, graduated from \nschool but would be unable to continue their education.\n  This bill is a real sign of hope for many families. These are the \nconcepts in the temporary worker program, which are the target of the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nfrom North Dakota. He wants to get rid of the temporary worker program. \nWe believe, as the Senator from Florida pointed out, even if you have a \nsecure border--we are hopeful of having secure borders--it won't stop \nillegal immigration.\n  As the Governor of Arizona who probably knows as much about this as \nany other member of the United States Senate, has pointed out, you can \nbuild the fence down there, but if it is 49 feet high, they will have a \n50 foot ladder. Talk to the Arizona governor. The fact of the matter \nis, some workers will come here illegally, or legally, one way or the \nother they come in. That is where the temporary worker program comes \nin. We say if we close this down, if we eliminate this program, you \nwill have those individuals that will crawl across the desert and \ncontinue to die as they do now. Or you can say, come through the front \ndoor and you will be given the opportunity to work for a period of time \nin the United States--two years--and return.\n  Who are these people we are talking about? If an employer wants a \ntemporary worker, what does that employer have to do? First of all, \nthat employer has to advertise at the local unemployment office. \nSecond, they have to advertise at their workplace. Third, they have to \nadvertise in the newspaper. Fourth, they have to offer the job at the \nprevailing wage to any American. All of that applies. Prevailing wage. \nEven if the employer is not paying the prevailing wage to the others, \nhe still has to pay it to the new employee and if they do more they \nhave to pay to the guest worker what they pay to the other workers. If \nthey pay an average of $10 at the facility, they have to pay $10 here.\n  Also they cannot have guest workers in high unemployment areas as \nwell. Now, that is the situation. Now, what do they get when they \nactually arrive in here? What kind of protections do they have? This is \nwhat they will have. If they are guest workers, they are treated \nequally under U.S. labor laws. They are not treated that way today.\n  They are not treated that way today, but under our legislation they \nwill be. The employers provide workmen's compensation. So they are \nprovided by protections under OSHA. If they have an accident they get \nworkman's compensation. The employers with the history of worker abuse \ncannot participate in the program. And there are strict penalties for \nthe employers that break the rules. Now, what is happening today? What \nis happening today?\n  We have listened to the Senator from North Dakota. Let's keep it as \nit is today. Let's look at the program today. Look what happens to \nundocumented workers that were exploited. This is what is happening \ntoday in America. This is what happens today. That is what the Senator \nfrom North Dakota wants. He wants to continue what we are doing today.\n  Here is the New Bedford example. Workers rights were trampled on. \nThey were fined for going to the bathroom, denied overtime pay, docked \n15 minutes pay for each minutes they were late, they would be fired for \ntalking while on the clock, forced to ration on toilet paper.\n  Why? Because they were undocumented. Without this program, temporary \nworkers will come here and be exploited. That is the history of \nimmigration. Read history. It is sad. That is what has happened. There \nis exploitation. That is what we are trying to deal with. That is what \nwe are trying to deal with.\n  One in 10 workers is injured every year by sharp hooks, knives, \nexhausting assembly line speeds or painful damage from repetitive \nmotions. Workers are subject to chlorine mist, lead to bloody noses, \nvomiting and headache. Undocumented workers don't report their injuries \nbecause they live in fear they will lose their jobs and be deported. \nThat is what the problem is. That is what we are attempting to \neliminate. And the idea that you just write an amendment and eliminate \nthat is reaching for the stars. It just ain't the way it is.\n  It isn't me that is saying this. But you take the Governor Napolitano \nand others who have studied it and lived it, they understand it. So \nthat is what the alternative is. Either we are going to have a program \nthat is limited. Might not be the program that I like but, it is the \nprogram that is in there. Those workers are going to come on in here. \nThey are going to have protections. If you close and try and slam that \ndoor, it isn't going to work. It is not going to work. That is what we \nhave seen over a period of time. They are going to come in as long as \nthe magnet of the American economy is there. That is what is happening. \nAnd the idea that you just say, oh, we're offering an amendment and \njust going to eliminate this and then everything will be all set, \neverything will be all worked out, everything will just be fine. It \njust defies logic, understanding, experience and the history of this \nissue. Under this program, those that come in here will have the kind \nof worker protections that they should.\n  And finally, we won't have the situation that we have now where you \nhave the undocumented workers come in here. They drive the wages down \nbecause they'll work for virtually nothing. And that drives American \nwages down.\n  You want more of that? I don't. You want more of that? I don't. I \ndon't. So I would hope that this amendment will not pass.\n  Madam President, I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I believe Senator Kyl has 19 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 \\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 8 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, we will put Senator Kennedy down in the \n``undecided'' column on this issue, but I was very much persuaded by \nhis argument.\n  The goal is to create a balance that will allow this country to move \nforward and not replicate the problems of the past, allow us to move \nforward and learn from our mistakes of the past, allow us to move \nforward in the best traditions of this country, and allow us to move \nforward in order to be competitive in a global economy.\n  The temporary worker program is one of the key elements of this bill. \nWhy do we have 12 million people, plus, probably, here illegally? I \nthink most of them came, hopefully they all came, not to destroy \nAmerica but to earn more money here than they could in their home area. \nThe problem is they are doing it illegally. They are subject to being \nexploited. There are no controls over how these people are being \ntreated. There is no control over how they are paying taxes. It is a \nlose-lose. It is a losing situation for the economy and it is a losing \nsituation for the worker.\n  If we do away with the temporary worker program, the only thing I can \npromise you for sure is the next Congress and the next generation of \npolitical leaders will look back on our time in shame. They will be \ncursing us because we failed to rise to the occasion and to logically \ndeal with a problem that is crying out for a solution.\n  Providing a temporary worker program allows people from other parts \nof the world to make their life better on our terms. They will pay \ntaxes. They won't be exploited. And before they get one of these jobs, \nwe will have to advertise it in the area in question to American \ncitizens. Only when an American citizen refuses to do a job in question \ncan the temporary worker be hired, and at a competitive wage in order \nto take care of our people and also to take care of our economy.\n  This is a win-win. People from other places in the world can come \nthrough in an orderly process, get a tamperproof card, so we will know \nwho they are. They will have a visa where they will never have to worry \nabout being afraid of the law while they are here, as long as they obey \nthe law. They can do jobs American workers are not doing at a \ncompetitive wage. That is a blessing to this country.\n  Everybody in the world doesn't want to come here to get a green card. \nThere are a lot of people who want to come for a temporary period of \ntime and improve themselves and go back and improve the country from \nwhence they came. If we want to be competitive, we need to have the \nworkforce vis-a-vis the rest of the world to make us competitive. If \nyou take the temporary\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nworker program out of the mix, then you are going to ensure in the \nfuture more illegal immigration. If you don't have a temporary worker \nprogram that is regulated, you are going to ensure exploitation.\n  From the economic side and the humanitarian side, we need to do this. \nIf this amendment would somehow pass, then we will have repeated the \nfundamental mistake of the past. We will not have fixed a thing, and we \nwill have ensured that more people will come here illegally, because \nthe magnet will still attract them. We will ensure they get exploited, \nand we will hurt our economy because we can't regulate this workforce.\n  The Y card will be tamper proof. People will have to give a \nfingerprint; they will have to sign up; they will be regulated in terms \nof how they are treated; they will be paid a competitive wage, and we \nwill know where they are and what they are up to; and we will allow \nthem to work here and go back to where they came three different times, \n6 out of 8 years, to better themselves. If they want to be a citizen, \nthey can apply for a green card. The more points they earn during their \ntemporary worker period, the more competitive they will be.\n  If they go to school at night, as my good friend Ken Salazar has \nsuggested, if they get a certificate in an employment area and learn a \nskill, they will get points. If they get a GED, if they work hard \nduring the day and improve themselves at night, then they get rewarded. \nLet me tell you about the individuals we are talking about. They work \nhard. Neither one of my parents graduated high school. They started a \nsmall business, a restaurant, where they opened before the sun was up \nand closed at 10 o'clock at night. They worked like dogs. When they \nwere sick, they went to work, because there was nobody there to take \ntheir place.\n  The people we are talking about here are coming from other parts of \nthe world and who are good workers. I am confident they will have a \nchance to prove their worth to our country, add to our economy, and \nmake us a better nation. Some of them will want to become citizens, and \nthey can. We need the Ph.Ds from India and other places, but we also \nneed people like my parents, who will come and work hard, play by the \nrules, better themselves, and find a niche in our economy. Without a \ntemporary worker program, we are going to ensure people come here in \nfear, live in fear, get exploited, and don't contribute to our economy.\n\n  This bill is as balanced as I know how to make it. I am always \nopenminded to better ideas, but I am close-minded when it comes to \ndestroying it. A temporary worker program is the key to not repeating \nthe mistakes of the past, which is exploitation, not controlling who \ncomes here, not having economic control over your workforce, and \nleaving people to be exploited. If it stays a part of this bill, we all \ncan hold our heads up high and say we created a win-win situation that \nsays to the hard-working person, who looks to America as a place to \nstart a new life, to learn a skill, to improve themselves, there will \nbe a place for you. Those who want to stay after their temporary worker \nperiod is over, you can get points to stay, and the more you do, the \nmore you better yourself, the better chance you will have.\n  To me, it is exactly what we have needed for years. My good friends, \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Salazar, and so many others, have sat down \nand tried to make this temporary worker program meet our economic needs \nand be humanitarian in its application. I think we have done a darned \ngood job. For the sake of this country and all we stand for, let us \nkeep this bill moving forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may I ask how much time we have on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \n25 seconds, and the Senator from North Dakota has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself the 11\\1/2\\ minutes we \nhave remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I first say how good it is to see \nthe Senator from Colorado in the chair as debate on this first crucial \nvote on this bill winds down. Because while sitting in the chair and \npresiding is a functional part of the Senate's normal operation, in \nthis debate, for the Senator from Colorado and this Senator from New \nMexico, it means a little more than that. My neighboring Senator, the \nnew Senator from Colorado, has indeed spent a great deal of time and \neffort and applied some very good common sense, when others were not \napplying it, to this bill. He has done more than his share to see to it \nthat we arrived here today at this point and can move ahead with a very \ndifficult bill, with some very difficult propositions being put forth, \nand I commend him for that.\n  Let me say to those who are listening, I still want, at some point \nbefore we close debate, probably within the next 5 or 6 or 8 days, to \ntalk to the Senate about my family and the whole history of how we got \nhere--how we survived the immigration laws, which were very complicated \n50 or so years ago when I was a little kid. They were so complicated \nthat my mother was arrested by the Federal Government because they said \nshe was not a citizen. She was arrested right in front of all of us \nchildren, only to find out there were some technical problems with her \nefforts to become a citizen. We had to sit there and watch her march \noff, as some people talk about happening to them today.\n  But today I want to talk about where we are with a complicated bill \nand what should happen tonight. First, many Members worked hard and \nlong with two Cabinet members to weave together a very interesting bill \nto manage illegal aliens and aliens who want to come to this country to \nget ahead, as my folks did when they got on a boat and went to France \nand ended up in Albuquerque from the little town of Lucca in northern \nItaly. They came and followed the laws of that day. Others want the \nsame thing.\n  The important thing to know is that relevant laws, and what has \nhappened to immigrants, and how those laws have been applied to those \npeople, is in shambles. Americans know that. Every day they tell us \nabout something happening on the border, and then they remind us of \nthose things because they are very upset and angry citizens. And what \nthey are upset about is that we have a body of laws but those laws \naren't being enforced because we are right up alongside some countries \nthat are poor and whose people want to work and make more money than \nthey can make at home by getting over here and getting a job.\n  Everybody should understand that the big problem here is the problem \nof economics. People from Mexico and other countries in or near this \ncontinent want to make a living and they can't make a living at home. \nThings are in disarray because that big force, that economic force, \ndrives these people who have families they want to send money to, who \nare trying to get away from starvation. That is pushing everything into \nthe ground and pushing people from what they should do to what they are \ndoing, and lo and behold, there is a huge illegal immigration problem \neverywhere you turn.\n  In putting the pieces together, those who wrote the bill we have \nbefore us decided that, among all of the pieces, we needed to have a \nlegalized temporary worker piece to this American fabric of a bill that \nwill control guest workers henceforth. When we are finished, we will \nhave a law that works against and in favor of, depending upon who you \nare and what you are doing, and will regulate the law applying to guest \nworkers and undocumented aliens.\n  There is no question, according to those who worked so hard on this \nbill, that we need a temporary worker component in the bill. So they \nput it in there. It is a 2-year program. You get a special card, and \nyou can work for 2 years as a temporary worker and then you must go \nhome for a year. This is a temporary worker permit. It is different \nfrom anything else in the bill. Those who worked so hard to piece the \nbill together so that it would work said: Among the things we have, \nlet's\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nmake sure we have a temporary worker permit.\n  This is not for agricultural workers only, and anybody who thinks it \nis does not know what is happening in America. The illegal aliens are \nworking in all kinds of jobs. It would shock you to know what \nindustries. If this bill works and these undocumented workers turn \nthemselves in, we are going to have a great big shock in America when \nwe find out who these individuals are, what they do, where they work \nand how they make a living. When those 10 to 12 million Americans show \nup and agree that they want to take a chance on America, that will be \none phase of this bill. But even after that is finished, we will decide \ntonight whether there will be room for the next 50 years, or until we \nchange it, for new people to come here and take a place as temporary \nworkers in the United States, as described and defined, for 2 years, \nand then they must go home. They must stay home a year and then come \nback. Do we want that?\n  Those who have worked hard on this bill say a resounding: Yes, we do. \nWe need it. It is part of the entire panorama of the pieces of the \nbill, and taken all together, we ought to vote aye and this part of the \nbill ought to stay intact. That will be the first indication tonight \nthat we understand that those who worked hard to put this bill together \ndeserve our confidence regarding this very important piece of \nlegislation for temporary workers.\n  I hope everybody who is interested in a good law will keep this piece \nin the bill tonight when they vote. With that, I understand there are \nothers who might want to speak on our side. I had the remaining time \nbecause no one was here, but since Senator Specter is here, I am going \nto yield. Whatever that does for him, I am glad to do it. I yield back \nany time I have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 20 minutes; \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, 4 minutes 25 seconds; the Senator from \nPennsylvania, 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to make his \nstatement at this point?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Not now.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me be recognized and ask I be notified when I have 5 \nminutes remaining. It will be my intention to close debate on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a Byzantine argument. This has \nbeen interesting to listen to. It reminded me, sitting here, of Will \nRogers. He once said:\n\n       It's not what they know that bothers me, it's what they say \n     they know for sure that just ain't so.\n\n  I am listening to this, and I am hearing, first of all, we have \nborder security in this bill. We are going to beef up border security. \nWe have it fixed.\n  Then I hear this: We have to have a guest worker provision. We have \nto have temporary workers come in because: One way or another those \nimmigrants are coming across the border. You try to close that door, it \nis not going to work.\n  This from the people who wrote the bill. Two of them have said it. It \nseems to me what they are saying is we can't stop illegal immigration \nso let's try to figure out who is coming across and call them legal. \nThat is what this looks like to me.\n  Let me say it again. Those who put this bill together say: One way or \nanother, these people are coming in. We are not going to stop them. You \ncan't close that door. It would not work. The solution? Make them \nlegal.\n  What does that say to people across the world who have decided they \nwant to come to the United States of America, and there is a quota by \nwhich their country can allow some people to come in, we will accept \nthem. They put their name on the list 8 years ago and they have been \nwaiting patiently to be able to come to our country legally. Now they \ndiscover that on the floor of the Senate some people put together a \nplan that says: It is true you waited for 8 years and you are still not \nhere and you may be near the top of the list, but all those who came \nhere through December 31 of last year, we will now declare that they \nare here legally.\n  What does that say to a lot of people around the world who thought \nthis was on the level, that our immigration quotas were real quotas?\n  If this amendment fails, the one that says let's get rid of the \ntemporary worker provision which will bring millions of additional \npeople into this country at the bottom of the economic ladder--if this \namendment fails, it doesn't mean we are not going to have immigrant \nworkers. There will be a million and a half who come in legally with \nthe quota system and the relatives and so on; and there will be over a \nmillion a year who come in working in agriculture, because this is not \nabout agriculture. You are talking about over 2 million a year, even if \nmy amendment fails.\n  But we are told: No, this amendment has to fail. We have to keep this \ntemporary worker provision in the bill because if it is not in the \nbill, we have this finely structured, crafted bill that is not \nperfect--everybody who worked on it said it is not perfect. We get \nthat. We knew that when we saw it. But if you pass this amendment, that \nchanges this bill and the whole stool collapses.\n  There has been no talk about American workers today. This is about \nimmigration. I understand that. But we have a whole lot of folks at the \nbottom of the economic ladder who went to work this morning struggling, \ntrying to make ends meet. It has been 9 years since we increased the \nminimum wage in this country, 9 years for those American workers out \nthere struggling at the bottom of the ladder.\n  I mentioned a while ago what is happening to American workers. You \nknow it. Read the paper. Circuit City says: You know what, we have \ndecided we are going to fire 3,400 of our workers. Because they are bad \nworkers? Oh, no. They are making too much money. The chief executive \nofficer of Circuit City makes $10 million a year. The average worker \nwas making $11 an hour. So we decided we are going to get rid of them. \nThey have too much experience and we don't want to pay $11 an hour, so \n3,400 people get fired.\n\n  Bo Anderson, the top executive agent for General Motors in \npurchasing, calls in all the companies making parts for General Motors. \nHere is what he said to them: You need to outsource your jobs to China \nto reduce costs. Get those American jobs moving to China right now.\n  Pennsylvania House Furniture--I have told this story before. Governor \nRendell told me about that. Fine furniture made by Pennsylvania House, \ntop-of-the-line furniture with Pennsylvania wood and craftsmen who made \ngreat pieces of furniture. La-Z-Boy bought it and said: You know what, \nwe will move all those jobs to China. We will ship Pennsylvania wood to \nChina, bring it back, and we will still call it Pennsylvania House \nFurniture.\n  On the last day of work, when all those craftsmen lost their jobs, \nthe last piece of furniture to come off that line they turned upside \ndown and all those workers, those craftsmen at Pennsylvania House \nFurniture, signed the bottom of that piece of furniture, knowing it was \nthe last piece of furniture they were going to make as American \nworkers, craftsmen who knew their jobs and made great furniture. The \nlast piece--they all signed it.\n  Somebody in this country has a piece of fine furniture called \nPennsylvania House, signed by all the craftsmen who got fired because \nthose jobs went searching for 20-cent and 30-cent-an-hour labor.\n  I am telling you, the same economic interests, the same corporate \ninterests that are finding ways and searching for ways to ship American \njobs overseas in search of 20-cent and 30-cent-an-hour labor are the \nones pushing this provision through the back door.\n  I have heard precious little discussion today about the plight of the \nAmerican worker. They say we don't have enough workers, can't find \nworkers. One of my colleagues said we have jobs in America that \nAmericans will not do at a competitive wage.\n  Oh, really? Is that the case? Or is it the case they are not paying a \ncompetitive wage and don't want to have to pay a competitive wage? I \nthought maybe we would have some people here who studied economics 101, \nabout supply and demand. You are having trouble finding workers? Maybe \nincrease\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\nthe price of that job a little bit, increase the wage offer a little \nbit. You know these people who work in the hospital corridors keeping \nit clean at night, the people who make the motel beds, the people who \nare across the counter of the convenience store. You can't find \nworkers? Maybe you better pay a little better wage. That is supply and \ndemand, isn't it? But you don't have to do that if you can bring in \npeople at the bottom of the economic ladder, bring in millions of them.\n  This Byzantine plan, let me tell you what it is: 40,000 temporary \nworkers a year, they can stay for 2 years, they can bring their family \nfor 2 years if they wish. Then they have to go home for a year and they \nhave to take their family with them. Then they can come back for 2 \nyears. Then they have to go home for a year, can come back for 2 \nadditional years, but if they brought their family either during the \nfirst or second stay, they can only come back twice for 2 years. You \nthink that is goofy? That is the plan. I am telling you, if you can \nread, open it up and read it and ask yourself whether that makes any \nsense at all.\n  Do American workers have a stake in this plan? You are damn right \nthey do. American workers have a big stake in this issue, and I hear \nprecious little attention to the plight of the American workers. People \nsay they can't find them. I will tell you what, go read the newspaper \nand figure out who is throwing them out of work today. These jobs \nmigrate to China. I can stand here for 15 minutes and tell you the name \nof companies that have laid off thousands, tens of thousands, in fact, \n3 million and counting more jobs in search of cheap labor overseas. You \nwant to go find somebody to do your work? Find the people who got laid \noff because their job got outsourced to cheap labor. You don't have to \nbring in millions of additional people--no, not 400,000 a year. Add \nthat up over 10 years, 400,000 a year, plus an escalator, plus stay for \n2 years, go home for a year, come back 2 years, go home for a year, \ncome back for 2 years, do that every year and you are talking about \nmillions of low-wage workers coming in to assume low-wage jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I wish to put in the record at this point letters from folks who run \nsome of the labor organizations in our country: Terry O'Sullivan, \nLaborers International Union of North America; Joe Hansen, United Food \nand Commercial Workers, the presidents of those unions; James Hoffa, \npresident, Brotherhood of Teamsters; Newton Jones, international \npresident, Boilermakers Union; Bill Samuel, director of the AFL-CIO; Ed \nSullivan, president of Building and Construction Trades--they all say \nexactly the same thing, support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters be printed in the Record and I \nreserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 21, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our more than 3 million members, \n     our Unions write to urge your support for true immigration \n     reform, but in opposition to immigrant worker abuse. That is \n     why our Unions have joined together to support Senator \n     Dorgan's effort to strip out the new guestworker provision of \n     the compromise immigration legislation.\n       The compromise legislation has good and bad elements, but \n     as the New York Times noted just yesterday, ``The agreement \n     fails most dismally in its temporary worker program . . . It \n     offers a way in but no way up, a shameful repudiation of \n     American tradition that will encourage exploitation--and more \n     illegal immigration.\n       This is not a deal that we would have negotiated, nor one \n     that our members--if they had an opportunity to ratify--would \n     accept. Neither should the United States Senate.\n       Senator Dorgan's amendment to eliminate the new guestworker \n     Y visa program is the right approach at this time. With a \n     positive plan to provide earned legalization to as many of \n     the 12 million undocumented workers as proposed, it is hard \n     to justify the need for an additional 400,000-600,000 workers \n     at the same time. This new visa program is a Bracero-type \n     guestworker model, forcing workers to toil in a truly \n     temporary status with a high risk of exploitation and abuse \n     by those seeking cheap labor. In addition, we are all aware \n     that the current guestworker programs are badly in need of \n     reform. Those reforms should be addressed before any broad \n     new expansion takes place.\n       We appreciate the difficulties in brokering a compromise on \n     this critical issue, as well as the conflicting perspectives \n     that need to be addressed. However, on this critical issue, \n     we have made it clear from the very beginning that an \n     agreement which forced future immigrant workers to be \n     obligated into indentured servitude would be anathema to us. \n     We are disappointed that such a provision was included in the \n     legislation, but are gratified that Senator Dorgan will be \n     offering an amendment which will permit Senators who oppose \n     this provision a positive vote to improve the legislation, \n     and take a stand in support of worker's rights--both domestic \n     workers and immigrant workers.\n       We strongly support Senator Dorgan's amendment to strike \n     the guestworker provision and urge your support for it as \n     well.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.

In addition. the \n     current guestworker programs are badly in need of reform. \n     Those reforms should be addressed before any broad new \n     expansion takes place.\n       For this reason, we urge your support for the Dorgan-Boxer \n     Amendment to strip out the Y guestworker provision of the \n     compromise immigration legislation. The Y visa would lock \n     millions of new workers into a life of virual servitude. This \n     is not a deal that we would have negotiated, nor one that our \n     members--if they had an opportunity to ratify--would accept. \n     Neither should the United States Senate.\n       If the Dorgan-Boxer Amendment fails, the Senate will then \n     have an opportunity to curtail the size, scope and potential \n     negative impacts of this new program. The Bingaman Amendment \n     would cap the Y guest worker program at 200,000 each year and \n     eliminate the escalator that allows it to grow as much as \n     600,000 guestworkers a year.\n       Certainly, our Union understands the difficulties in \n     brokering a compromise on this crucial issue, as well as the \n     conflicting viewpoints that need to be addressed. However, on \n     this issue. any agreement which forces future immigrant \n     workers to be obligated into a virtual indentured servitude \n     would be deplorable to us.\n       The Boilermakers urge you to support the Dorgan-Boxer \n     Amendment and the Bingaman Amendment, which will permit \n     Senators who oppose this provision a positive vote to improve \n     the legislation, and take a stand in supprt of worker's \n     rights--both domestic workers and immigrant workers.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request. If you \n     have questions or need more information, please contact \n     Bridget Martin.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Newton B. Jones,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor, Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: The pending immigration bill includes a \n     massive guestworker program that would allow employers to \n     import hundreds of thousands of truly temporary workers every \n     year to perform permanent jobs throughout the U.S. economy. \n     Without a real path to legalization, the program will ensure \n     that America has two classes of workers, only one of which \n     can exercise even the most basic workplace rights. For this \n     reason, we urge you to support the Dorgan-Boxer Amendment to \n     eliminate the Y guestworker visa program from the bill.\n       If the Dorgan-Boxer Amendment fails, the Senate will then \n     have an opportunity to curtail the size, scope and potential \n     negative impacts of the poorly crafted Y guest worker \n     program. The Bingaman Amendment would cap the Y guest worker \n     program at 200,000 each year and eliminate the escalator that \n     allows it to grow to as much as 600,000 guestworkers a year.\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\n       The Y visa would lock millions of new workers into a life \n     of virtual servitude. It does not belong in a bill whose \n     alleged purpose is to relieve 12 million currently \n     undocumented workers of the very same exploitations. The AFL-\n     CIO urges you to vote for the Dorgan-Boxer and Bingaman \n     Amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               William Samuel,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor, Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the twelve international unions \n     of the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, \n     I urge you to support the Dorgan/Boxer Amendment to strike \n     the guest worker provision from the compromise immigration \n     legislation.\n       Throughout the debate on comprehensive immigration reform \n     the Building Trades have opposed the creation of a new guest \n     worker program. We feel that American workers have enough \n     downward pressure on their wages and the last thing they need \n     is to have an influx of hundreds of thousands of temporary \n     workers every year competing for their jobs at substandard \n     wages.\n       If the Dorgan/Boxer Amendment fails, we ask for your \n     support to curtail the size and scope of the guest worker \n     program by supporting the Bingaman Amendment. The Bingaman \n     Amendment would cap the guest worker program at 200,000 each \n     year and eliminate the escalator that allows it to grow as \n     much as 600,000 guest workers a year.\n       On behalf of America's construction workers and all the \n     workers that would be negatively impacted by the \n     implementation of the proposed guest worker program, we urge \n     you to vote for the Dorgan/Boxer and Bingaman Amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Edward C. Sullivan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WEBB. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield 5 minutes of his \ntime?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes. He has 11 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield 4 minutes to my \ncolleague from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I did not come to \nthe floor to speak on this amendment. I have long admired the Senator \nfrom North Dakota in his sometimes lonely attempts to preserve the \nwell-being of the American worker. But I couldn't sit and listen to his \ncomments without saying a few words in support of this amendment.\n  There seems to be a trend running through the Congress that disturbs \nme. It is a trend of omission. I do not see enough people who are \nwilling to stand up and speak on behalf of the people who are doing the \nhard jobs in this society. We can talk about all the benefits of \ndifferent portions of this bill, but at the same time we are faced with \na set of realities, not only with respect to the American workers but, \nin a broader sense, with respect to people in this country who are \nhaving to do the hard work of our society. Who is speaking for them? \nThis used to be the function of the Democratic Party, to speak for \nthem.\n  We are in a situation in this country right now where corporate \nprofits are at an all-time high as a percentage of our national wealth. \nYet wages and salaries as a percentage of our national wealth are at an \nall-time low. How does this happen? One of the ways that it happens is \nexactly what the Senator from North Dakota is talking about. We have \nthese programs that benefit Wall Street, and they are not necessarily \nbenefiting the people who are doing the hard work of our society, the \nwage earners who are getting cut out because of an underground economy.\n  I support, in many ways, the move toward giving permanent status to \npeople who have come to this country illegally at one point and who \nhave put down roots and who want to move into the mainstream of our \nsociety. But this particular portion of this bill is not designed to do \nthat. It is designed to increase the difficulties that we already have. \nIt is not a compromise, it is a fabrication.\n  I have that concern also when it comes to what we are doing on the \nIraq bill. We are sending a supplemental back right now that is not in \nany way going to support the troops who are having to do the hard work \nin Iraq. We are going to be talking about benchmarks.\n  There is nobody in the Pentagon, there is nobody in the \nadministration, there are precious few people in the United States \nCongress who are aware, in a measurable way, of what we are doing to \nthe well-being of the ground troops who are having to go back to Iraq \nagain and again.\n  If this is a conflict that is requiring that sort of commitment on \nthe ground, then why isn't the administration talking differently about \nthe number of troops it needs? Because the people who volunteered to go \nin the military are supposed to go again and again and do their duty.\n  Well, they are probably on their third and their fourth tours. I put \nin a bill, along with Senator Hagel, that said you cannot send anybody \nback to Iraq unless they have been home as long as they have been gone. \nThat, to me, is common sense if you have ever been deployed. I have had \na father who was deployed. I have been deployed. I have had a son who \nhas been deployed. I know what it is like. There are a lot of people \nwho know what it is like. Unfortunately, they do not seem to be forcing \nthe administration on that end.\n  We see it in areas such as what has happened to our gas prices here. \nWe are going to get a vote on the Attorney General, apparently, a no-\nconfidence vote. How about getting a vote on how the American people \nare getting ripped off at the pump? Those things can be documented. You \ncan have all of the economic theories in the world about why these gas \nprices are going up. Gas was $24 a barrel when we went into Iraq. It is \nnow close to $70. The people who are making money off of that are \nmaking money largely off of foreign policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senator has used \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. WEBB. Fifteen seconds, Mr. President. There is a theme in this. \nThe theme is that this is the party that is supposed to be taking care \nof the people who are doing the hard work of our society. There is no \nshame to stand up and say that what the Senator from North Dakota is \nproposing is for the good of the people who are doing the hard work of \nour society.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield that time to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject the \namendment by the Senator from North Dakota. This identical issue was \nconsidered by the Senate a little more than a year ago, on May 16 of \nlast year, when Senator Dorgan made a similar motion, and I, in my \ncapacity at that time as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, moved to \ntable. The tabling motion was agreed to 69 to 28.\n  I submit that the same reasons which justified the rejection of the \nDorgan amendment last year are applicable here. We have a situation in \nthe United States where according to the Bureau of Labor Statics, the \nnational unemployment rate for April, last month, 2007, is 4.5 percent, \nwhich constitutes virtual full employment. So there is a need for extra \nworkers.\n  In structuring the bill, we have provided for flexibility so that the \nnumber can be raised or lowered depending upon what circumstances \nexist. We have taken steps to protect American workers who are \navailable to fill the jobs with a statutory requirement that there will \nhave to be extensive advertising before the guest worker program can be \nutilized and workers can be employed.\n  Last year, the bill was considered by the Judiciary Committee. This \nyear we did not follow that process. Perhaps it was an error. Instead, \nwe had very extended meetings over the course of the past 3 months, \nhour upon hour, customarily with as many as 12 Senators sitting to work \nout the issues.\n  This issue was considered at some length. But last year when the \nmatter\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\nwas before the Judiciary Committee, we had very persuasive, really \ncompelling testimony by a number of prominent economists in support of \nthe guest worker program.\n  On April 25, 2006, we had Harry Holzer, professor of public policy, \nGeorgetown University, April 25, 2006, before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee testifying that most economists believe immigration is a good \nthing for the overall economy, that it lowers costs, lowers prices, and \nenables us to produce more goods and services and to produce them more \nefficiently.\n  We had testimony of a similar nature from Dan Siciliano, executive \ndirector of the program in law, economics and business at Stanford Law \nSchool on April 25 of last year. Similarly, Richard Freedman, professor \nof economics at Harvard University, testified on April 25, expressed \nhis view:\n\n       I think all economists believe from evidence that \n     immigration raises not only the GDP of the United States \n     because we have more people now to do useful activities, but \n     it also raises the part of the GDP that goes to current \n     residents in our country.\n\n  This year, on May 3, earlier this month, the Assistant Secretary of \nPolicy at the U.S. Department of Labor, Leon Segeuira, testified that \nthere were three fundamental reasons the United States needs \nimmigration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The time for the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The three reasons were the aging workforce we have, the \nnecessity to maintain a higher ratio of workers to retirees, and, \nthird, that immigrants contribute to innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  So I think we have a record basis that this guest worker program is \nuseful, helpful to the economy, and that it is very important to the \neconomy to have an adequate workforce.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, as the sponsor of the \namendment, I would prefer to conclude the debate. So if Senator Kennedy \nhas additional time remaining, my hope is that he would take that time \nso I may conclude.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \n20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Chair let me know when I have 20 seconds left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what we are trying to do in this \nlegislation is have secure borders. Secure borders, not open borders. \nSecure borders.\n  Part of having a secure border is making sure the people who are \ngoing to come in are going to come in legally. The idea that you can \nhave a secure border and close it completely is something that has \nnever happened before and will not happen now.\n  The idea that you eliminate completely the guest worker program means \nwhat? It means you are going to have border guards who are going to be \nchasing after landscapers out in the middle of the desert and racing \nafter people who might be working in gardens or as bartenders in the \nfuture.\n  You want your border guards to be going after terrorists and \nsmugglers. How do you do that? You give a pathway for people to come \nhere legally. When they come here legally they get the protections of \nthe labor laws. If you do not do that, you think you can eliminate this \nprogram? You are going to have people who are going to come in \nillegally and they are going to be exploited day in and day out. When \nthey are exploited day in and day out, it is going to depress wages. \nThat is the way it has been. That is the way it is today.\n  That is the difference. Maybe you don't like this particular guest \nworker program. It is better than many others. Maybe you would like to \nshape it somewhat differently. That is the issue plain and square, \nplain and square. We are trying to take illegality out of this system: \nillegality at the border, illegality at the workplace, illegality in \nexploiting the undocumented, and illegality from the people who are \nhere, if they are going to pay their fines, work hard, go to end of the \nline. We are trying to reduce illegality.\n  If there is anybody in this Senate who believes you can just say, no, \nwe are going to close that border, 1,800 miles, and that is it--I would \nlike the chicken pluckers to pay $10 or $15 an hour. They do not do it. \nThey are not going to do it. Who are you trying to kid? Who is the \nSenator from North Dakota trying to fool?\n  These are the realities, the economic realities. No one has fought \nfor increasing the minimum wage more than I have. But you have got \nrealties that employers are not going to pay it. They are going to \nexploit people if you can get them here undocumented.\n  So that is the issue, Mr. President. I believe we have a reasonable \nprogram that makes sense. I think it makes sense from a law enforcement \npoint of view. I think it makes sense in terms of protecting the wages \nof American workers under this program.\n  We are going to make sure that all of those who are coming here with \nthe guest worker program are going to get the prevailing wage, they are \ngoing to be protected by OSHA, if they get hurt on the job they are \ngoing to get the workers' compensation. They are going to get those \nworker protections. If they are working on construction sites, they are \ngoing to be covered by Davis-Bacon.\n  You can either do it legally, or you can do it with the undocumented. \nThat is not just the Senator from Massachusetts, that is Governor \nNapolitano who knows something as the Governor of a border State who \nhas pointed this out time in and time out, Mr. President.\n  So I would hope this amendment would not be accepted.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 4 minutes 52 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Chair advise me when I have 30 \nseconds remaining?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me stand up and say a word on behalf \nof chicken pluckers. I had no idea that was the debate. But they will \nnever get $15 an hour as long as we bring in cheap labor through the \nback door to pluck chickens.\n  I am more interested in the issue of manufacturing. I am interested \nin people who got up this morning and packed a lunch pail and they are \ngoing to have to shower after work because they work hard and they \nsweat and they do not get paid very much. They have waited for 9 years \nfor an increased minimum wage; it has not come. They are worried about \nwhether they are going to be there. They are worried whether they are \ngoing to be called into a meeting someday and be told: Your job is \ngone. We are either moving your job to China or we are bringing in \nsomeone from the back door to take your job at much lower pay.\n  That is what workers face now. No one in this Chamber will face it. \nNobody. We all get up and put on a white shirt and a blue suit. We come \nhere and talk. No one is going to lose their job. None of it is going \nto be outsourced, and no one who comes through the back door is going \nto jeopardize a job in this Chamber. It is not going to happen on an \neditorial board in a newspaper. It is just the folks this morning who \ngot up and had an aspiration of going to their job and working hard and \nproviding for their families. They are the ones who are wondering: What \nis my future?\n  Now, let me make a very important point. The assumption is that if we \ndefeat the temporary worker program we are not going to have \nimmigration. The fact is, we are going to have a million and a half \npeople coming into this country under legal immigration having nothing \nto do with this program. We are going to have over a million people \ncoming into this country for agricultural jobs having nothing to do \nwith this program. Oh, we will have immigration. It is just that those \nwho wrote this said: That is not enough. We want more.\n  Now, my colleagues keep saying: Well, if we dump this thing called \ntemporary workers, they are just going to\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\ncome here anyway. They are going to be illegal.\n  Wait a second. I thought you were going to provide border security. \nNow you are telling me there is no border security because if you do \nnot decide to call them legal, they are going to come anyway. If that \nis the case, point to the area of this bill that says that you provided \nborder security. You know, this is like Groundhog Day. We have been \nhere once before, 1986. We are going to secure the border. Twenty years \nlater, 12 million people are here without legal authorization. Now we \nare going to secure the border.\n  But now we are told at this hour, just before the vote on my \namendment: Oh, by the way, if we don't provide for temporary workers to \ncall those coming in legal, if we do not do that, they will come in \nillegally anyway. So, then, where is the border security? Is that a \nfalse promise? One of these two options is the case. You either have \nborder security, and people are not going to come here by the hundreds \nand thousands because they can't, or you have no border security so you \nhave decided we will just name them all legal and call them temporary \nworkers.\n  My colleague cited a Harvard economist. Many of these economists \ncannot remember their home phone number, and they are giving us their \nthoughts on what is going to happen 5 years from now.\n  This one, Professor George Borjas from the John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment at Harvard, said: Here is what has happened to U.S. workers. \nU.S. workers have lost income in the 20 years as a result of \nimmigration. That is not disputable. Is anybody here disputing that? I \ndon't think so. We have had downward pressure on U.S. income as a \nresult.\n  This proposition in this bill says: You know what. That may be the \nexperience, but we have not had enough of it. We want more. We want \nmore of it.\n  Again, finally, if you decide to vote against my amendment, I want \nyou to have a town meeting and explain it.\n  We allow 400,000 workers in the first year. They can come for 2 \nyears. They can bring their family, if they wish. Then they have to go \nhome for a year and take their family with them. They can come back \nafter going home for a year, for 2 more years. Then they have to go \nhome for another year. Then they can come back for 2 more years unless \nthey decided to bring their family with them in the first place. In \nthat case, they get two stays for 2 years, with 1 year back home in \nbetween. We will do that cumulatively, and what you have here in 10 \nyears is roughly 12 million man-years of work by people who come in, \nleave, come in, leave. By the way, how many of you think these people \nare going to leave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to put in the record the \nextraordinary story that was in the Washington Post today, ``First \nCalled to Duty, Then Citizenship,'' about green card workers, members \nof the Armed Forces. We have 70,000 who are in Iraq and Afghanistan. So \nmany of them are working toward earning their citizenship and defending \nAmerica. It is a great story. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, May 22, 2007]\n\n                 First Called to Duty, Then Citizenship\n\n                          (By Brigid Schulte)\n\n       In a crowd of nearly 100 eager faces of newly sworn-in \n     citizens on the grounds of Mount Vernon yesterday, three men \n     in the front row stood out. Their black shoes shone to glossy \n     perfection. Their backs were ramrod straight. One wore the \n     crisp white uniform of the Navy. Another, the drab khaki of \n     the Marines and a third, the dress uniform of the Army. Two \n     had campaign ribbons from serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n       Until yesterday, the sailor, the Marine and the soldier \n     were among more than 40,000 ``green card'' service members--\n     non-citizens serving in the U.S. military. After swearing to \n     defend the Constitution, Petty Officer Reginald Cherubin, 30, \n     Marine Sgt. Brian Joseph, 38, and Army Sgt. Jeremy Tattrie, \n     24, joined another group: the more than 26,000 service \n     members who have become U.S. citizens since the Iraq war \n     began and the Bush administration expedited the citizenship \n     process for military members. Seventy-five service members \n     have received their citizenship posthumously since then.\n       It was the sight of Iraqis pulling down Saddam Hussein's \n     statue in 2003 that led Tattrie, a Canadian by birth who was \n     then in college in Florida, to join the military.\n       ``I felt the call to duty,'' he said, clutching one of the \n     small American flags that immigration officials had just \n     passed out. ``I just felt the urge to serve my country.'' \n     Even though when he enlisted, the United States wasn't, \n     technically, it.\n       The three were sworn in as the military and the country are \n     engaged in a vigorous, divisive debate about what place \n     immigrants should have in the armed forces and society at \n     large.\n       The ceremony at George Washington's home took place as \n     lawmakers on the other side of the Potomac River began \n     debating a controversial immigration bill that would, among \n     other provisions, grant legal status to virtually all \n     undocumented workers, create a temporary worker program and \n     tighten border controls.\n       The bill also calls for allowing the military to be a path \n     to citizenship for a limited number of undocumented \n     immigrants--those who were brought to the United States when \n     they were younger than 16 and have been living here for at \n     least five years.\n       The ceremony also came as some military experts want to \n     open the armed forces to undocumented immigrants and foreign \n     recruits to fill the ranks as the Army and Marines plan troop \n     increases.\n       Critics fear a flood of recruits lured solely by the \n     promise of legal status. ``A very large number of non-\n     citizens could change the purpose of the military from the \n     defense of the country to a job and a way to get a foot in \n     the door of the United States,'' said Mark Krikorian, \n     executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, \n     which advocates restrictions on immigration. ``It becomes a \n     kind of mercenary thing.''\n       Others argue that a liberalized policy could improve the \n     armed forces. Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer, Army \n     officer and law professor at West Point, noted that during \n     wartime, military brass can already sign up undocumented \n     immigrants, some of whom have received citizenship.\n       ``I think that it's great for the military to allow people \n     to enlist who are qualified to be in the military,'' Stock \n     said. ``Having papers doesn't tell me whether someone's \n     qualified or not.''\n       Official military policy is to accept legal permanent \n     residents with green cards, although Congress in January 2006 \n     gave military leaders wartime powers to enlist anyone they \n     deem ``vital to the national interest.''\n       At Mount Vernon yesterday, the three military men remained \n     stoic as they were swarmed by photographers and TV cameras \n     and held out by federal officials as the best that \n     immigration has to offer.\n       ``There's too much immigrant-bashing going on,'' said Dan \n     Kane, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n     Service. Featuring the three military personnel ``sends a \n     powerful message that immigrants make a meaningful \n     contribution to the United States.''\n       Legal permanent residents serving in the military were \n     given the right to apply for citizenship immediately by a \n     wartime executive order signed by President Bush in 2002. In \n     peacetime, permanent residents in the military are required \n     to wait three years.\n       Nonetheless, there has not been a rush to obtain \n     citizenship, according to Emilio Gonzalez, USCIS director. \n     ``After the executive order, we have not seen hordes of \n     people joining the military,'' he said. ``These people don't \n     join the military just to become citizens. These people \n     joined the military because they wanted to serve.''\n       Cherubin, who immigrated in May 1999, joined the Navy a few \n     months later and is based at Anacostia Naval Station, was the \n     first to be called to receive his citizenship papers \n     yesterday.\n       After high school in Haiti, there was nothing for him. He \n     just waited for the day when his father, already in the \n     United States, would call and say his visa had come through.\n       ``When you live in a country like Haiti, you don't think \n     about your future,'' Cherubin said. ``You live day by day. \n     The biggest dream you could possibly have is coming to the \n     United States.''\n       Cherubin joined the military so he could go to college. It \n     wasn't until the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that he found a \n     sense of purpose to his life in the Navy. An aviation \n     planner, he was deployed to an aircraft carrier and readied \n     F-18 hornets for bombing runs over Afghanistan.\n       ``To be part of that, to be among the first people over \n     there fighting back, it was a beautiful feeling,'' he said.\n       During the ceremony, Glenda Joseph slipped to the front row \n     to snap a photo of her husband. She'd been after him to get \n     his citizenship for the 14 years they'd been married. He'd \n     always wanted to but procrastinated. Then he was deployed for \n     10 months, running convoys throughout Iraq, and there was no \n     time.\n       Based in Quantico, Joseph is an aviation assignments \n     monitor and is charged with moving 10,000 Marines around the \n     globe. He moved from St. Vincent to Brooklyn, N.Y., with his \n     family when he was 6. He's been in the Marines for 16 years, \n     has earned two bachelor's degrees and is working on a \n     master's degree.\n       It was time to make it official.\n       ``At least,'' he said, ``now I'll be able to vote.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It strikes \nthe temporary worker provision. It does not mean there won't be \nimmigration coming into this country. We will have 2.5 million people \ncoming in under legal channels, agricultural work, so on. This is \nextra. We are told that 2.5 million is not enough.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank all of the Members.\n  If we could have your attention, please. We are lining up the \namendments for tomorrow. I think Senator Graham has an amendment. \nSenator Bingaman also has an amendment that is going to reduce these \nnumbers down to some 200,000. We had that issue that was raised before. \nSo we are trying to line up some amendments, trying to go back and \nforth during the morning. We would like those who have amendments and \nwho are prepared to go, if they would talk with Senator Kyl or myself, \nand we will try to do the best we can to both give the Members the \ninformation and to work out a process.\n  We thank all of our colleagues for their cooperation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I inquire whether we are going to bring up \nan amendment one at a time and that has to be voted on and disposed of \nor whether there will be an opportunity to offer multiple amendments \nand then work with the managers of the bill to try to queue those up \nfor a vote at the appropriate time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I thank the Senator. I think for the start of this \ndebate we ought to try to do them individually. I think that is what \nthe leaders had decided. We can see. As we make progress with the \nlegislation, we can consult. But it does seem to me we ought to just \ntake these. We have had a good debate, an extensive one on this issue, \nand it is enormously important. I think at the start of this we would \nlike to do them individually. We will do the best we can to cooperate \nwith people and their schedules, but I think we ought to try to at \nleast follow that. Then we can see, as we make progress on the \nlegislation, whether the leaders will decide on a different strategy to \nmove them.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one more \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, Mr. President, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the response, and certainly \nwe want to do this in an orderly fashion. But I think the majority \nleader and the Republican leader were very farsighted in extending the \ntime beyond this week where we could actually consider amendments on \nthe bill because I think there is a real need to have a full and fair \ndebate and a free opportunity to offer amendments because, frankly, \nthere are a lot of people who do not know what is in this bill yet. The \nfinal bill text was, I guess, filed last night, laid down at 9 o'clock. \nSo it is very hard to fashion those amendments until we have bill text \nback from legislative counsel and the opportunity to craft those \namendments.\n  So my only point is I hope we are going to continue to have the \nopportunity to offer those amendments, to have the debate, to have \nthose votes, and not get into a time crunch. Two weeks seems like a \nlong time, but with the kind of amendments, the number of amendments I \nknow are going to be offered, I think we need to have this opportunity \nfor a full airing of the issues and an opportunity to vote on those \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we want to have a full and complete debate \non this bill. But my experience has been that if we do not follow \nhaving one amendment--if the managers do not like it, they can move to \ntable it, or there are a lot of things you can do. But where we run \ninto trouble is where you stack up a bunch of amendments that are \npending because that is when the managers lose control of the bill. The \npeople who have offered all the amendments control what goes on with \nthe legislation.\n  So unless something untoward happens, I think we are so much better \noff having people offer amendments. If they are dilatory, the managers \ncan move to table. If that does not work, then we can try something \nelse. But for the foreseeable future, why don't we try to move through \nthis one at a time.\n  I think the debate today has been excellent. There have been no \nsurprises to what Senator Dorgan was going to do. I thought what would \nbe the right thing to do is have--we have had a Democratic amendment. \nIf the Republicans want to offer an amendment, let them offer the next \none, and go back and forth. The next Democratic amendment, as far as I \nunderstand it, is the Bingaman amendment; is that right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, we are working that out. Senator Graham may offer \nhis amendment. Then, there would be an amendment--I expect the Bingaman \namendment will be in the morning, some time in the mid, late morning.\n  Mr. REID. My only point is----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. We are trying to go back and forth. We are working \ntogether, Senator Kyl and ourselves. If there seems to be two \namendments on the same subject, we are trying to deal with those \nissues.\n  Mr. REID. Even tonight--there is an event for the spouses--if people \nwant to stay and work, that is fine, they can do that, too. There are \nno time limits on how late we can work. I want people to feel they can \nwork as late as they want. And we can have some late votes. I don't \nthink there is anything wrong with that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just make the point that the key \nis how many votes are allowed. We were on this measure for 2 weeks last \nCongress; there were 32 votes. This process\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\nwill work fine provided we get votes and move along and follow in an \norderly process. But if that breaks down, the Senator from Texas has a \npoint, that we need to get some amendments in the queue and try to \nhandle them as rapidly as we can.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas raised probably \nfour or five points that I know of in the course of these discussions. \nWe are familiar with the general subject matter.\n  If I could have the attention of my colleagues, he had raised \nprobably four or five issues that related to the title II. I listened \nto him this morning at the breakfast, and he raised a point on title \nII. So if he wants to, we are prepared to move ahead with the Senator's \namendments. We are familiar with the general area. I know there are \ngoing to be drafting issues, but we are glad to accommodate that. We \ndon't want the technical aspects to slow the process.\n  So we are familiar with those subject matters. The Senator could get \na hard look maybe over tonight about the particular areas and then talk \nwith us tomorrow, and we will make sure we have the time and that we \nare prepared to go ahead. We are more than ready to be here. We had a \ngood afternoon. We enjoyed it. We started on it at a quarter to 3 and \nworked until 6:15. We are prepared to go this evening or tomorrow or \ntomorrow night or the following night. We are not trying to rush \nanybody, but we are prepared to do business.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I enter this statement in the \nRecord in support of the Dorgan-Boxer amendment to strike the temporary \nworker program from S. 1348. While we certainly should fill jobs for \nwhich there is a shortage of American workers, it should be done on \nspecific needs and based on traditional visas. I believe that the \nintroduction of a large stream of low-skilled foreign workers would \nhave a negative impact on the wages of American workers. Finally, I \nfear that the inherent flaws in this proposed system will, in time, \nrecreate the very same undocumented worker crisis this bill seeks to \neliminate. A graduation event for my daughter requires me to be away \nfrom Washington, D. C. on the afternoon of May 22, 2007, and \nregrettably prevents me from officially registering my support of the \nDorgan-Boxer amendment.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, unfortunately, I had to miss today's \nvote on the Dorgan amendment to strike the new Y visa worker program in \nthe bill. As currently designed, the temporary worker program in this \nbill is designed to fail.\n  The program in the bill proposes to create a new 400,000 person \nannual temporary worker program that could grow to 600,000 without \ncongressional approval. It expands the existing seasonal guestworker \nprograms from 66,000 up to 100,000 in the first year and 200,000 after \nthat. At the end of their temporary status, almost all of these workers \nwould have to go home. That means at the end of the first 3 years, we \nwould have at least 1.2 million of these new guestworkers in the \ncountry with only 30,000 having any real hope of getting to stay.\n  As we have learned with misguided immigration policies in the past, \nit is naive to think that people who do not have a way to stay legally \nwill just abide by the system and leave. They won't. The current group \nof undocumented immigrants will be replaced by a new group of second-\nclass workers who will place downward pressure on American wages and \nworking conditions. And when their time is up, they will go into the \nshadows where our current system exploits the undocumented \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6455-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Dieruf\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 2 days ago, family and friends gathered \nat the Dieruf family farm near Lexington to celebrate a birthday and \ncontinue an annual tradition.\n  If this year was similar to years past, they played games and shared \nstories around a bonfire. But unlike years past, one man was missing. \nThat man is CPL Nicholas J. Dieruf, a U.S. marine.\n  Corporal Dieruf was taken from us on April 8, 2004. It is his \nbirthday that brings so many people together, a tradition that started \nwhen he was in high school.\n  Corporal Dieruf was mortally wounded in the Al Anbar Province of \nIraq. As the gunner of a light armored vehicle, his vehicle was in the \nlead of a convey when terrorists attacked with rocket-propelled \ngrenades and small arms. He was 21 years old.\n  For his valorous service, Corporal Dieruf received numerous medals \nand awards, including the Purple Heart.\n  As the youngest of four brothers--where the eldest and youngest are \nseparated by only 4 years--Nich learned quickly how to get along with \nothers.\n  His mother Barbara sheltered him from the youthful pranks that his \nbrothers, Charlie, Matthew, and Paul, tried to play on him, like when \nthey almost convinced him to swallow an earthworm fresh from their \nmother's rose bed.\n  But Charles Dieruf, their father, instilled confidence and self-\nrespect in his sons and reminded them that the only thing you will ever \nhave in life is your brothers. By the time the boys reached grade \nschool, they had developed a respect and admiration for one another \nthat persists to this day.\n  Nich became especially close to Matthew, the second oldest brother, \nwith a spirit and a temperament much like Nich's. In high school, Matt \nand Nich would take what they called ``fun runs,'' jogging through the \nbluegrass countryside. Runs that started as training for the cross-\ncountry team soon became what Matt calls ``a chance to get out and talk \nabout stuff.'' Barbara says Nich always looked up to Matthew and valued \nhis advice.\n  After graduating from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, in his \nhometown of Lexington in 2000, Nich enrolled in classes at Lexington \nCommunity College that fall. That October, however, he joined the \nMarines.\n  That decision was an important step in Nich's transformation, as his \nolder brothers watched the youngest brother who looked to them for \nadvice become the man they themselves would turn to for counsel.\n  ``When Nich was in town, everyone would come around,'' says his \nbrother, Matthew. ``People just gravitated to my brother.''\n  Nich deployed to Iraq for the first time in early 2003 and quickly \nacclimated to the 14-hour workdays. His commanding officers noted his \nleadership qualities, and when his platoon commander had to break in a \nnew staff sergeant, he assigned the sergeant to Corporal Dieruf's \nvehicle, to learn from the best.\n  The trust Corporal Dieruf's commanders placed in him with this \ndecision became clear when you realize that a staff sergeant is two \nfull ranks above a corporal. Another marine who worked with Nich, SGT \nJoseph Leurs, had this to say:\n\n       Corporal Dieruf was extremely tactful. If he saw me doing \n     something differently than how it was normally done, he would \n     suggest we get a drink, and only then would he propose that I \n     try it another way.\n\n  Sergeant Leurs went on to say that Corporal Dieruf earned the respect \nof those he served with, and never soured on his duties to the Corps.\n  Shortly before his first deployment, Nich gave a young woman named \nEmily Duncan a pearl ring--a promise\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\nring, which he asked her to wear while he was away. Emily Duncan, who \nwould become Emily Dieruf, wore his ring and sent him letters and care \npackages. When Nich returned from his first tour in July 2003, he asked \nEmily to replace that promise ring with a wedding band.\n  The young couple exchanged vows in January of 2004, and on February \n18, shared their last embrace before Nich deployed for his second tour \nin Iraq. In a note Nich sent to Emily from Iraq, he described why he \nwas honored to wear his country's uniform: ``If you could see what I \nsee, and compare it to back home,'' he wrote, ``you would see why we \nare needed.''\n  He was a loving, caring marine who believed deeply in what he was \ndoing, his wife Emily says. Nich was especially proud of the work he \nand his fellow marines were doing for the Iraqi children.\n  Nich, who had demonstrated his gift for taking things apart and \nputting them back together as a boy, planned to enroll in the \nUniversity of Kentucky's engineering program when he returned.\n  Then came that fateful day in April. Emily wrote Nich a letter and at \nthe end of the day fell asleep. Shortly after midnight, she was \nawakened by a knock at the door. Looking outside to see a marine on her \ndoorstep, her first thought was that Nich had come home to surprise \nher, as he had in the past. Tragically, she learned, instead, that her \nhusband had died earlier that day.\n  Corporal Dieruf was buried with full military honors at Lexington's \nCalvary Cemetery on Friday, April 16, 2004. Three years later, we \ncontinue to honor his life and his sacrifice, and I am very pleased \nthat some of his family and friends have traveled to Washington to meet \nwith me in the Capitol today.\n  Nich's beloved family members include his wife Emily, his father \nCharles, his mother Barbara, his brother Charlie, his brother Matthew, \nhis brother Paul, his sister-in-law Katie, his sister-in-law Court, his \nnephew Charles R. Dieruf, IV, his grandmother Fran, his mother-in-law \nJennifer Duncan, his uncle Thomas Greer, his aunt Wilma Greer, his \ncousin Ashley Greer, and many others. I ask the Senate to keep them in \nyour thoughts and prayers today. I know they will be in mine.\n  No words we can say today will ease the pain of the Dieruf family or \nfill the hole Nich leaves behind.

Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate about a very \nimportant subject. Too often it takes a crisis for Congress to take \naction on a national need. We have had crisis after crisis on drug \nsafety, and yesterday we learned of another. A report published in the \nNew England Journal of Medicine showed that the diabetes drug Avandia \nmay increase the risk of heart attacks and death. If further evidence \nwere needed that improving drug safety is an urgent priority, \nyesterday's report puts the matter beyond doubt. The Senate has \napproved strong and comprehensive legislation to improve drug safety. \nThat proposal should be taken up by the House and enacted without \ndelay.\n  Yesterday's report was based on an analysis of clinical trials \nconducted by a team of physicians and scientists, and I commend them \nfor their skill and perseverance. Why isn't FDA doing this kind of \nanalysis, and why aren't companies required to undertake additional \nsafety tests if there are unanswered questions about their products?\n  The simple answer is, the FDA does not have the resources to conduct \nthese analyses itself, and it doesn't have the authority needed to \nrequire companies to perform them. The legislation the Senate recently \napproved corrects both of these major flaws.\n  Our legislation requires FDA to link electronic health care databases \nto allow for better, faster identification and assessment of safety \nproblems. The bill adds to the fees that drug companies are required to \npay and devotes new funds to drug safety.\n  Unforeseen risks of a drug must be caught as quickly as possible so \nthat effective protections can be implemented before more lives are \nneedlessly put at risk, and our legislation makes that happen.\n  The New England Journal recommended a large prospective trial as the \nbest way to get the answers we need. FDA should have clear authority to \nrequire such trials, and our bill provides it.\n  Some trials studied in the journal report were included in a registry \nthat Glaxo voluntarily maintains. The Senate bill requires the results \nof clinical trials to be made available to the public in a single, \neasily accessible database. That will help patients get information \nabout the medicines they take, and it will help scientists identify \ndrug safety problems faster.\n  Information alone is not enough to protect public health. FDA needs \nthe authority to take action where needed. Right now all FDA can do \nafter approval is request a labeling change or request a medication \nguide or request patient labeling or request a review of drug \nadvertising. Safeguarding the lives of American patients should not \nhave to depend on requests. Our bill gives the FDA the authority to \nrequire those measures and impose civil monetary penalties to enforce \nthem.\n  Our legislation will make FDA, once again, the gold standard for \nprotecting public health. It should not take a new crisis to bring \nCongress to act. I look forward to working with our colleagues in the \nHouse to see that this legislation is signed into law without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6456-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6456-S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BETH SPIVEY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to bid \nfarewell to my senior legislative assistant, Beth Spivey, who is \ndeparting my staff after almost 10 years of outstanding service to the \npeople of Mississippi and the Nation.\n  Beth has been an integral part of my personal office staff for so \nmany years and we will genuinely miss her when she leaves. She joined \nmy staff as an intern during the summer of 1997 and never left, \nstarting as an employee that September. From the beginning, she \ndemonstrated exceptional skills and confidence. Starting as a \nlegislative correspondent, she showed that she could handle a large \nvolume of mail, promptly answering all letters with well thought out \nresponses.\n  Beth was eager to learn the substance of large and small issues \nalike, and it was only a matter of time and an available opening on my \nstaff before she was ready to move up to serve as a legislative \nassistant. She proved herself adept at handling a range of issues with \nskill and efficiency; from transportation to telecommunications, and \nfrom energy to the environment. She understands the key concerns, \norganizations, and people for her issues and knows how to bring them \ntogether to find common ground in order to advance legislation to \nbecome law.\n  It is the latter quality that I found so valuable in Beth. As my \ncolleagues know, I care about the Senate being productive in matters \nthat are resolvable. While there will always be issues that define the \ndifferences between the political parties, the vast majority of bills \ncan be worked out with a minimum of contested votes, or none at all, if \nMembers and their staffs are willing to work hard to reach an \nagreement. Beth has the skills and the desire to move bills through the \nlegislative process to enactment, sometimes negotiating two or more \nbills moving through the process at the same time.\n  Beth excels at multitasking. It has not been uncommon for her to \nsimultaneously work on the highest priority bills of the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee and the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. This skill was evident early on as she planned her \nMississippi wedding from Washington while working a rigorous schedule. \nWhether I was chairing a surface transportation subcommittee or an \naviation subcommittee, Beth was\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nmy point person for moving nationally significant legislation through \nthe committee and the Senate. When I was the majority leader, she led \nthe Senate Energy Task Force staff efforts.\n  Beth has been a key figure in the enactment of several important \nbills into law: the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and its previous \nincarnations, the Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, \nthe Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act, and the Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act--A Legacy \nfor Users. She also shepherded the Passenger Rail Investment and \nImprovement Act of 2005 through the Senate and the Advanced \nTelecommunications and Opportunities Reform Act through the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee during the 109th Congress. During \nthe 110th Congress, she has already guided the Aviation Investment and \nModernization Act through the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee. Beth always ensured that these bills were good for the \nNation and good for Mississippi.\n  While Beth is as gracious and charming as one would expect from her \nMississippi upbringing, she is also assertive and confident, and \ndeserving of respect for her abilities. She never hesitated to take \ncharge of her areas of responsibility or speak up if she felt she or \nanyone else was being overlooked.\n  Beth is not just a hard working, skilled staff member. She has been \npart of my personal office family for almost 10 years. Whether training \na new staff member, guiding interns through their Washington \nexperience, or cutting birthday cakes, Beth has been a trusted, steady, \nand caring colleague. As a former intern, she always ensured that our \nlegislative interns were provided challenging assignments and treated \nwith respect.\n  Mr. President, Beth has come a long way from Brandon, MS, and the \nUniversity of Mississippi. In addition to being a seasoned staff \nmember, she also is a wife and a mother. Beth now moves on to a new \nphase in her life, leaving for the private sector and making more time \nfor her husband Les and young daughter Ann Miller. We all will miss her \nvery much. I wish her the very best as she heads out in a new direction \nand pray that God will continue to bless her and her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6457-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NOPEC\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 879, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007, or \nNOPEC. The Judiciary Committee today reports that bill favorably, with \nan accompanying committee report. This is not the first time the \ncommittee has reported this legislation, but it ought to be the last. \nIndeed, the Senate Judiciary Committee under three different chairmen \nhas now considered and recommended this legislation for passage. It is \nlong past time for this bill to become law.\n  NOPEC will hold certain oil producing nations accountable for their \ncollusive behavior that has artificially--and drastically--reduced the \nsupply and inflated the price of fuel. It authorizes the Attorney \nGeneral to take legal action against any foreign state, including \nmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, for \nprice fixing and artificially limiting the amount of available oil.\n  Just this morning, I read in the Washington Post that the Energy \nDepartment declared that ``gasoline prices last week came within a half \npenny of tying the modern era's inflation-adjusted record set in March \n1981,'' and that the nationwide average price at the pump is $3.218 a \ngallon. That is a rise of more than 11 cents a gallon just in the last \nweek, according to the Energy Information Administration. These \nincreases in price have led to renewed calls for investigation into \ntheir causes, but we already know well one significant cause: \nanticompetitive conduct by oil cartels.\n  While OPEC actions remain protected from antitrust enforcement, the \nability of the governments involved to wreak havoc on the American \neconomy remains unchecked. If OPEC were simply a collection of foreign \nbusinesses engaged in this type of behavior, they would already be \nsubject to the antitrust laws.\n  I am disappointed that the administration recently announced it would \noppose this bill and recommend that the President veto it. When \nentities engage in anticompetitive conduct that harms the American \nconsumers it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate and prosecute. It is wrong to let OPEC producers off the \nhook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the seal of \napproval of national governments.\n  Americans deserve better, and it is time for Congress to act. With \nthe summer months approaching, there is no end in sight to the rise in \ngas prices. I am hopeful that the Senate will take up and pass this \nlegislation in June. I thank Senator Kohl for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6457-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6457-S6458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REVEREND JERRY FALWELL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about Reverend \nJerry Falwell, who passed away last week. Reverend Falwell loved God, \nloved people, and loved his country. He not only spoke about what he \nbelieved, he acted on what he believed and worked to help people and to \nmake this country better.\n  Jerry Falwell led a remarkable and inspiring life. He was born in \nLynchburg, VA, the son of a nonreligious bootlegger and the grandson of \na staunch atheist. This family background makes all the more real, some \nmight say dramatic, his conversion to Christianity and his lifelong \nunwavering commitment to Christ.\n  In 1956, he founded Thomas Road Baptist Church. Just 35 people \nattended its first meeting in the local elementary school. Although \nReverend Falwell became known to most for his national political \nefforts, he was in his heart a local church pastor and he led that \ncongregation for more than 50 years, seeing it grow to more than 24,000 \nmembers.\n  Reverend Falwell knew that faith cannot be segregated from life and \nthat Christ calls us to be doers, rather than simply hearers, of the \nWord. Reverend Falwell founded the Elim Home in 1959 as a residential \nprogram providing spiritual restoration and help for those battling \nalcohol and drug addiction. The home still operates today, just north \nof Lynchburg.\n  Proverbs 22:6 says to train up a child in the way he should go and \nso, in 1967, Reverend Falwell founded Lynchburg Christian Academy for \nchildren from kindergarten through high school. Four years later, he \nfounded Lynchburg Bible College with just 154 students and 4 full-time \nfaculty. Today, Liberty University is the largest evangelical college \nin the world, fully accredited with more than 20,000 students from \naround the world. In recent years, Reverend Falwell returned to this \nmission of Christian education and he was at work in his office when he \npassed away. His vision there continues to unfold. Liberty University \nLaw School, which achieved provisional ABA accreditation in just 18 \nmonths, graduated its first class this year and a medical school is on \nthe drawing board.\n  When it came to issues such as the sanctity of human life, Reverend \nFalwell once again put action to his words. He founded the Liberty \nGodparent Foundation in 1982, opening a home for unwed mothers while \nother evangelicals were content simply to protest abortion. I certainly \nagree that abortion is wrong because of what abortion is and does, but \nReverend Falwell demonstrated that there is more to being pro-life than \nsimply being opposed to death. He set an inspiring example, and today \nthere are more crisis pregnancy centers than abortion clinics in \nAmerica.\n  Reverend Falwell is perhaps best known for what launched him onto the \nnational stage, founding the Moral Majority organization in 1979. This \neffort brought millions of Americans into the political process and \nmade them more informed, more active citizens. In 1995, he launched a \nmonthly magazine, the National Liberty Journal, which reaches hundreds \nof thousands of pastors and Christian citizens. The author of more than \na dozen books over nearly 30 years, Reverend Falwell continued to write \nhis own e-mail newsletter and columns distributed widely through the \nworld.\n  Reverend Falwell certainly gained his share of notoriety for \npositions on certain issues or particularly controversial statements. \nThat happens to people who speak out, especially those\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nwho speak against the drift of the prevailing culture. Reverend Falwell \nchose to adopt a national profile and received a good amount of \ncriticism for taking public stances on difficult issues. But he \naccepted consequences and was not above admitting and apologizing for \nhis mistakes or, after more thought and reflection, adjusting some \nviews and adapting to change.\n  Reverend Falwell was not nearly as easily labeled as some might \nthink. For all the opposition he received from those on the left, some \non the right criticized him for appearing to move away from the \nfundamentalist and toward the evangelical camp. Others attacked him for \nhis friendship with leaders of the charismatic movement, speaking at \nconferences hosted by groups or leaders from different Christian \ntraditions, or working closely with Roman Catholic leaders. His Liberty \nBaptist College has hosted speakers from Reverend Billy Graham to, yes, \nSenator Edward Kennedy. Through it all, Reverend Falwell stayed true to \nhis own convictions while working with others on issues of common \npurpose to help people and to make our country better.\n  One of the most telling tributes about Reverend Jerry Falwell comes \nfrom a most unexpected source. After losing a libel suit to Penthouse \npublisher Larry Flynt in the Supreme Court back in 1988, Reverend \nFalwell befriended Flynt and the two appeared together in numerous \nmedia venues, visited each other, and even exchanged Christmas cards. \nIn a column published just a few days ago in the Los Angeles Times, \nFlynt declared that while he disagreed with everything Reverend Falwell \npreached, he found that they actually had a lot in common. He wrote: \n``The more I got to know Falwell, the more I began to see that his \npublic portrayals were caricatures of himself.'' The ultimate result of \ntheir relationiship was, as Flynt put it, ``just as shocking a turn to \nme as was winning that famous Supreme Court case: We became friends.''\n  Jerry Falwell leaves behind Macel, his wife of nearly 50 years, his \nthree children and eight grandchildren. His son Jerry has taken up the \nmantle as Chancellor of Liberty University and his son Jonathan had \nalready been named Executive Pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. \nReverend Falwell's example, his legacy, is so much more than the \ncontroversial remarks, views, or positions that some want to emphasize. \nReverend Jerry Falwell lived what he believed, he put action to his \nfaith, he inspired and educated, he led and equipped. He was a pastor, \na teacher, and a leader. He helped change countless lives and helped \nmake our country better. For all those reasons and so many more, he \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6458-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On May 18, 2007, in Greenville, SC, Sean Kennedy was beaten by an \nunnamed man which resulted in his death. Kennedy, a gay man, was \npunched in the face and knocked to the ground where he sustained \ninjuries to his head. Kennedy died of his injuries later that night at \na local hospital. The attacker was later brought into custody and \ncharged with murder. Because Kennedy was attacked while leaving a gay \nbar and the attacker used anti-gay epithets, the Greenville County \nSheriff turned the case over to the FBI for investigation as a hate \ncrime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/22/senate-section/article/S6458-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARDS\n\n Mr. SUNUNU.

A bill to establish a new budget process to create a \ncomprehensive plan to rein in spending, reduce the deficit, and regain \ncontrol of the Federal budget process; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise today to talk specifically about \nhow we get our fiscal house in order as a nation and especially as a \ngovernment. Just last week, the Congress passed--or at least the Senate \npassed and the House passed--a proposal for a budget which, \nunfortunately, fails the American people dramatically in the area of \ncontrolling spending and in the area of good tax policy. It creates a \ncascade. It is a Democratic budget that creates a cascade of new \nspending, hundreds of billions of dollars of new spending which will \ngrow the size of the Government dramatically and which is, therefore, \nundisciplined in its approach.\n  It also proposes tax policy which will radically increase taxes on \nworking Americans and have the effect of stifling what has been an \nextraordinary economic expansion, which in part has been a function of \nhaving a tax policy which understands that if you let people keep their \nmoney, they tend to be more productive with those dollars, they tend to \ngo out and take risks, be entrepreneurs, create jobs, and as a result, \nthe Federal Government gets more revenue because people creating these \njobs pay taxes and we end up with more economic activity. We have had \n72 months of growth, and we have created 7.4 million new jobs in this \ncountry, and that is a significant step in the right direction toward \neconomic expansion.\n  But all that is at risk because we, as a government, tend to spend \nmore than we take in, and we do not have in place a discipline \nnecessary as a government to effectively manage our own house. This was \nreflected in the budget that was just passed, regrettably. Therefore, \nas we also look to the future, we are confronting a cost to the \nGovernment which is going to radically increase the expenditures of the \nFederal Government to a point where our children and our children's \nchildren will not be able to afford them.\n  In fact, just the cost of three programs alone--Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and Medicaid--by the year 2025, because of the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation, will actually exceed the amount of money \nwhich the Federal Government has historically spent as a percentage of \ngross national product. So by about the year 2025, because of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation, three programs--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--will absorb all the money that \nhistorically the Federal Government has spent, which means there will \nbe no money left over for education, laying out roads, or environmental \nprotection.\n  We will be in a position where our children, in order to bear the \nburden of those three programs, will have to pay a tax rate which will \nmake it impossible for them to afford their own Government and will \nmake their lifestyle significantly constrained. The pressure on them \nwill be dramatic because the burden of taxes will exceed their ability \nto pay them and still maintain a quality lifestyle. Their ability to \nsend their children to college, to buy a house, to have a good \nlifestyle, to have the luxuries which our generation has had will be \nconstrained by the fact that the size of the Federal Government is \ngrowing out of control as a function of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration.\n  So these two events combined--the dramatic expansion in entitlement \nspending and the Democratic budget which was essentially grossly \nirresponsible in the area of spending on the discretionary side of the \naccount and in the area of creating debt; it will add $2.5 trillion of \nnew debt to the Federal Government over the 5 years of this budget--\nthese two events combined are going to put a lot of pressure on our \neconomy and on the well-being of our Nation.\n  A group of us believe very strongly that we need to put in place \nmechanisms in this Government which more effectively discipline the \nspending of the Government. So I am introducing today, along with 27 \ncolleagues--and that is a fair number of cosponsors--the Stop Over-\nSpending Act, SOS. This bill has eight basic elements. I am not going \nto go through them all, but I\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\nwish to highlight the ones that are significant.\n  Basically, what this bill does is it puts in place disciplines which \nallow this Congress, if it desires to do so--all of these disciplines \ncan be waived by 60-vote points of order, basically--if Congress \ndesires to do so, it can limit the growth of the Federal Government to \nsomething that is affordable to the American people.\n  The most important discipline this bill puts in place is one over \nentitlement spending. Right now, we have nothing that controls \nentitlement spending. This bill says that if entitlement spending \nreaches a certain level of use of general funds of the Treasury--and \nmost of these entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid--are not supposed to be overwhelming burdens on the general \nfund, the general fund being basic income taxes, not retirement taxes \nand health insurance taxes--if the burden of these programs exceeds a \ncertain level, then there are mechanisms which allow us to take a \nsecond look at these programs to improve them, to make them cost-\neffective while delivering quality services.\n  In addition, this proposal puts in place caps, serious caps on \ndiscretionary spending so that we know that when you hit a certain \nlevel of spending and you are trying to exceed the amount of money the \nFederal Government should spend, there will be a 60-vote point of order \nbefore that can occur. That is only reasonable, that is only good \nbudgeting, and it is something we need to have in place.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic budget which was just passed \nessentially got rid of caps for the year 2009, 2010, and it puts them \nin place for 2008, but that is almost irrelevant because it raises them \nso high that there is no way anybody is going to hit those caps unless \nthey are truly spendthrifts.\n  They basically add $200 billion of new spending over the next 5 \nyears, and next year they dramatically increase spending, both through \ntaking programs off the budget by declaring them emergencies, such as \nin the agricultural area, and putting them into the next year through \nadvanced funding, which is a total gamesmanship, and then actually \nincreasing the spending levels under the discretionary account. It is a \ngrossly irresponsible cascade of new spending we see coming at us next \nyear as a result of this Democratic budget. This Stop Over-Spending Act \nwill try to discipline that in a more effective way, and it is time we \ndid that.\n  In addition, it puts in place two very aggressive proposals to try to \ntake a look at how we are managing the bigger programs of the Federal \nGovernment. One is a proposal which came from Senator Brownback which \nis a bipartisan commission on accountability and Federal review. It is \nbasically a BRAC commission for all the Federal Government. So if we \nfind programs that are overlapping--and believe me, there are an awful \nlot of overlapping programs in the Federal Government--if we find \nprograms that are just not producing the results they are supposed to \nproduce or which have served their time, which were supposed to be 3-\nyear programs and they have been going on for 10, 15 years, we will \nhave a mechanism where those programs can come back to the Congress and \nvoted up or down, either they should be in place or not in place, the \nsame way we approach managing the defense spending accounts through \nBRAC.\n  There is a second commission put in place which, again, has an \nautomatic vote by the Congress, which is an attempt to address the most \nsignificant issue we have, which is this entitlement spending issue \nwhich was reflected in the chart I held up earlier. This is a \ncommission which would be set up, which would be bipartisan, which \nwould be Members of the Congress, and which would essentially take a \nlook at these programs--Social Security and Medicare specifically--and \nsee how we can improve them, see how we can make them work more \neffectively but see how we can make them more affordable for our \nchildren, and then in a bipartisan way, with an overwhelming \nsupermajority, so there is no question that anybody will be gamed, \neverybody will be at the table, and nobody will be gamed, bring those \nproposals back to Congress and vote them up or down without amendment \nso that we know this commission, when it makes a report, will actually \nget action from a report.\n  The problem is that we get all these commissions and they produce \nwonderful reports and nothing happens. This commission will have \nsomething happening. It is a critical element. It is important.\n  If we don't get on this issue of mandatory spending, we will be \nirresponsible as a generation. We are the generation that created this \nproblem, the baby boom generation. We are the generation governing \ntoday. Probably 80 percent of the people in this body are of the baby \nboom generation. And what we are doing is burying our heads in the sand \nand passing what we know is a huge problem--which is going to occur \nbecause all the people who are going to create this problem exist and \nthey are going to retire--we are going to pass that problem on to our \nchildren and say: You figure it out, even though it is a problem we \ncreated. That is irresponsible.\n  As people who have obtained a position of governing in this country, \nwe have an absolute responsibility to our children and our children's \nchildren and to this Nation's fiscal health to address this issue, and \nthis commission is an attempt to do that. This Stop Over-Spending Act \nis an attempt to do just that.\n  In addition, the proposal includes biannual budgeting, which is \nsomething many people around here think will help us be more efficient \nin the way we approach the accounts of the Federal Government. It \nchanges and reforms a lot of what are institutional mechanisms for the \npurposes of managing the day-to-day business of the spending of the \nFederal Government by putting in place baselines which are appropriate \nand limitations on the ability to spend money around here under \nreconciliation and limitations on the ability to raise taxes \narbitrarily on the American people.\n  So it is a balanced approach. It has 27 cosponsors, and, quite \nhonestly, if a percentage of these proposals were adopted, we would \nactually have some discipline around this place in the area of fiscal \npolicy. We would be back on a path toward making sure we have a \ngovernment that people can afford, while we still have a government \nthat is delivering the services that people want. That should be our \nbottom-line goal.\n  It is an honor for me to have a chance to introduce this today, to be \nthe primary sponsor of it, but I especially appreciate the support of \nmy colleagues in signing onto this bill, which I hope will be \nconsidered or at least elements of this bill will be considered because \nwe are running out of time.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 31. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to reduce \nfraud in certain visa programs for aliens working temporarily in the \nUnited States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the H-1B Visa Fraud \nPrevention Act of 2007.\n  Many American businesses rely on the H-1B visa program. When \nemployers can demonstrate that there are too few U.S. workers to fill \nparticular positions with defined education and skills standards, the \nprogram allows temporary, non-immigrant workers to fill vacancies in \nengineering, sciences, medicine, health, and other specialties.\n  The program is of considerable benefit to our economy. Unfortunately, \nthere has been a long history of some unscrupulous employers attempting \nto abuse the H-1B program. Last fall, the Portland Press Herald \nnewspaper in Maine printed a three-part series resulting from its in-\ndepth investigation of H-1B abuses.\n  The newspaper found evidence of shell companies filing applications \nfor H-1B visas in Maine, but no evidence of H-1B visa holders actually \nworking for those businesses in Maine. One company rented office space \nin Portland for a year and submitted at least 160 H-1B and green-card \napplications on behalf of foreign workers, but the building manager \nnever saw anyone there, and was asked to forward all mail to an address \nin New Jersey.\n  This legislation will help detect and prevent the kind of fraud \nidentified by the Portland Press Herald.\n  Before I describe the details of my legislation, I want to \nacknowledge the\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nleadership of Senators Grassley, Durbin, Gregg, Hagel, and Lieberman on \nthis issue. They have also drafted bills aimed at reforming the H-1B \nvisa issuance process as well as expanding the number of H-1B visas. My \nhope is that we can join forces to craft an amendment to the \nimmigration bill that will curb the fraud afflicting this program.\n  Specifically, my legislation is targeted at detecting employers who \ndo not have legitimate business operations that require H-1B workers \nand who intend only to transfer the H-1B workers they receive to \nanother employer. This bill prohibits employers from contracting their \nH-1B workers to an employer in a different State.\n\n  The Portland Press Herald's investigation showed that some employers \nmay have filed for H-1B workers in Maine in order to take advantage of \na lower prevailing wage, then transferred those employees to States \nwhere a higher prevailing wage would have been required on the H-1B \napplication.\n  The legislation I am proposing would remove onerous restrictions on \nthe Department of Labor's ability to investigate suspected fraud. It \nwould allow the Department to investigate applications that have clear \nindicators of fraud or misrepresentation, instead of merely checking \nfor completeness and obvious inaccuracies, as current law provides.\n  It also would expand the types of information that can be used to \ninvestigate fraudulent activity and eliminate a requirement that the \nSecretary of the Department of Labor personally approve each \ninvestigation. In addition, to further deter companies from filing \nfraudulent applications, the legislation would double the current \nmonetary penalties.\n  Preventing H-1B fraud and abuse also requires that the Department of \nLabor work more closely with the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, which is the agency \nthat ultimately approves an H-1B visa application. To that end, this \nlegislation requires the Director of USCIS to share with Labor \ninformation it receives from employers who file H-1B visa applications \nthat may indicate noncompliance with the H-1B visa program.\n  USCIS has taken first steps to detect fraud in other types of visas. \nFor example, last July USCIS completed an assessment of religious-\nworker benefit fraud that showed fraud in one-third of the cases \nsurveyed. From these surveys, USCIS developed known indicators of fraud \nfor religious-worker visas that it can now compare against incoming \napplications.\n  USCIS began a similar assessment of benefit fraud for H-1B visas \nnearly a year ago. It is not yet completed, despite repeated inquiries \nby my staff on its status. This legislation requires completion of the \nH-1B fraud assessment within 30 days, so that USCIS can begin using \nthis valuable tool to uncover fraud in other H-1B applications.\n  This legislation fills gaps in our ability to ensure that H-1B visas \nare granted and used in the manner Congress intended. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this proposal as we consider immigration-reform \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 31\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the acquisition process of the Department of \nDefense, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing this omnibus defense \nacquisition reform bill today to highlight the scope and urgent need \nfor comprehensive reform in how the Pentagon procures its biggest and \nmost expensive weapons systems.\n  Defense acquisition policy has been a major issue ever since \nPresident Eisenhower first warned the Nation, in 1961, about the \nmilitary-industrial complex. As Operation Ill Wind in the 1980s and the \nBoeing tanker lease scandal just a few years ago have taught us, \nEisenhower's comments apply with equal force today.\n  Despite the lessons of the past, the acquisition process continues to \nbe dysfunctional. In the 110th Congress, major acquisition policy \nissues have arisen in some of the biggest defense programs, including \nthe Navy transformational program, Littoral Combat Systems, LCS and the \nAir Force's second largest acquisition program, Combat Search and \nRescue Vehicle Replacement Program, CSAR-X.\n  We can not do much to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely \nin developing, testing and acquiring major defense systems. By \nincreasing transparency and accountability and maximizing competition, \ncomprehensive acquisition reform can provide the taxpayer with the best \nvalue; minimize waste, fraud and abuse; and, perhaps most importantly, \nhelp guarantee that the U.S. maintains the strongest, most capable \nfighting force in the world. That is what this legislative proposal is \nall about.\n  Our colleagues in the House Armed Services Committee have already \ntaken considerable steps in this area, which I applaud. It is my \nintention to offer this acquisition package to the defense \nauthorization bill this week. The defense bill which we will be \nconsidering this week in the Committee on Armed Services totals more \nthan $650 billion. That's serious money.\n  As stewards of the taxpayers' dollars we must assure the public that \nwe are buying the best programs for our servicemen and women at the \nbest price for the taxpayer. I have already highlighted critical weapon \nsystems with key acquisition problems. If we continue to buy weapon \nsystems in an ineffective and inefficient manner so that costs continue \nto go up or the deployment of the system is delayed, it will only hurt \nthe soldier, sailor, airman, or marine in the field.\n  The reason for this is quite simple. First, it does not take an \neconomics degree to understand that the higher that costs of a weapon \nsystem unexpectedly goes up, the fewer of them we can buy. A prime \nexample is the F-22 Raptor. The original requirement was for 781 jet \nfighters, now we can only afford 183. In addition, without fundamental \nreforms, such as I have proposed in this bill, we will continue to buy \nweapon systems in an ineffective manner, which usually results in long \ndelays and unexpected cost growth, as requirements, acquisition policy \nand resources never get in synch.\n  One aspect of how the Pentagon buys the biggest weapons systems that \nmy proposal addresses head-on is the ``requirements process''; that is, \nthe process by which the Pentagon defines the weapon system it wants to \nprocure. All too often, costly requirements, many of which are \nunrelated to what the unified commands say they need, are piled on to \nthese programs irresponsibly, without regard to the bottom-line. Just \nas egregious is the tendency to drop requirements that the warfighter \nhas said they need, which sometimes justified the system in the first \ninstance.\n\n  There is an emerging consensus that one way of addressing these, and \nrelated, problems is by integrating processes, that is, aligning the \nacquisition, resources, and requirements spheres of the procurement \nprocess in a way that provides the necessary accountability and agility \nfor the Pentagon to make sound judgments on its defense investments. \nHistorically, each sphere has been stove-piped and allowed to operate \nindependently in a way that has produced poor cost, scheduling and \nperformance outcomes, to the detriment of both the taxpayer and the \nwarfighter.\n  Elements of this legislative proposal that provide for ``integrated \nprocesses'' include 1. having the Service Chiefs help oversee \nacquisition management decisions; 2. standing-up a ``tri-chair \ncommittee''--so-called because it will be that headed by the primary \nplayers in the acquisition, resources and requirements communities--\nthat can help make enterprise-wide investment decisions more powerfully \nand with greater agility than any other procurement-related \norganization currently within the Pentagon 3. increasing the membership \nof the Pentagon's main requirements-setting body to include leadership \nfrom all three spheres; and 4. setting out guidelines that, when \ncoupled with certain provisions currently under law, can help the \nPentagon better manage unexpected cost growth.\n  Other elements of this proposal address particular structural \nproblems in major weapons procurement that Congress has observed over \nthe last few years. One such provision restricts the services from \nentering into multiyear contracts irresponsibly when buying weapons. \nBuying weapons under a multiyear contract restricts Congress's ability \nto exercise appropriate oversight. If Congress bought these items under \na series of annual contracts, there would be a meaningful opportunity \nfor it to annually review the programs' progress. For this reason, \nusing multiyear contracts should be limited to only the best performing \nand most stable programs. The approach provided for under this \nlegislative proposal would help to ensure that.\n  Other elements of this proposal would help reign in abuses in how the \nGovernment pays award fees and require defense contractors to maintain \na robust internal ethics compliance program that can help maintain \neffective oversight of defense programs.\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\n  In developing this reform package, I have pulled the ``best of the \nbest,'' that is, the best, most powerful ideas which enjoy the broadest \nconsensus among some of the most respected experts, whose ideas have \nbeen ventilated in public hearings and reps over the last 3 years, \nincluding the Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment Report, a.k.a. \nthe DAPA or the Kadish Report; the Center for Strategic International \nStudies' CSIS, Beyond Goldwater-Nichols Report; the section 804 report \nfrom the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and \nLogistics; a number of reports and analyses from the Government \nAccountability Office and the Congressional Research Service; and \nothers. Some of the elements of this package also institutionalize good \nideas that the Pentagon has informally put in place recently.\n  Acquisition reform of a bureaucracy as large as the Pentagon does not \nhappen overnight. That is why we need to act now. Our defense spending \nhas doubled in the last decade, from $350 billion to $650 billion. \nEvery American I talk to as I cross the country understands that we \nneed to spend as much as necessary for national defense. However, how \nmuch is enough? Taxpayers also expect that we spend his or her hard-\nearned tax dollars in a sound and cost-effective manner. We have not \nbeen fulfilling that expectation. We need to. This proposed legislation \nsets us on that course.\n  Chairman Levin and I have discussed the need for greater oversight in \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and the common goal of producing \nconcrete results on acquisition reform this year. I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Levin to fully adopt this acquisition package \nthis week and also working with his capable staff in taking \ncomprehensive steps, similar to what our House colleagues have done, to \nassure that we buy weapon systems at the best price and field them as \nsoon as practicable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 32\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to establish, promote, and \nsupport a comprehensive prevention, research, and medical management \nreferral program for hepatitis C virus infection; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague \nSenator Hutchison in introducing the Hepatitis C Epidemic Control and \nPrevention Act of 2007. Senator Hutchison's leadership has been \nessential in developing this legislation, which will encourage programs \nfor hepatitis C across the country similar to the programs that have \nbeen so effective in Texas. Our goal is to expand and improve health \neducation, screening, and treatment to deal more effectively with the \nepidemic of hepatitis C.\n  Hepatitis C is a life-threatening disease caused by a virus and is \nthe most common chronic, blood-borne infection in the United States. An \nestimated 5 million people, almost 2 percent of the population, are now \ninfected with the hepatitis C virus. More than half a million of these \nAmericans are suffering from chronic infection, and 30,000 more are \ninfected every year.\n  Those infected come from all walks of life, and their numbers are \ngrowing fast. People at greatest risk include emergency service \npersonnel, veterans, health care workers, and intravenous drug and \nmethamphetamine users. Hepatitis C also disproportionately affects \nmedically underserved populations, including African Americans, Native \nAmericans, persons of Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Island descent, and the \nhomeless.\n  It is truly a ``silent'' epidemic since the vast majority of these \nindividuals are unaware of their infection. Millions are not receiving \nthe care that could slow the progression of the disease or even cure \nit. Those who are not aware of their infection are less likely to take \nprecautions against spreading the disease to others. Unlike the \nhepatitis A and B viruses, there is no vaccine currently available to \nprevent hepatitis C infection. It is critical to improve the screening \nprocess, so that everyone infected can be identified, obtain treatment, \nand learn healthier behavior.\n  The infection has serious health effects. It can cause liver disease, \nincluding cirrhosis and liver cancer, and is the leading cause of adult \nliver transplants. Chronic liver disease, most of\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\nwhich is caused by this virus, is now the most common cause of death \namong persons infected with HIV. In addition to the human costs, the \ndisease has massive financial implications. Direct medical costs \nassociated with care are alone expected to exceed $1 billion a year by \n2010, and those costs will undoubtedly increase without better \nprevention and treatment programs.\n  Greater Federal investment will play a critical role in reversing \nthis silent epidemic. Our bill will increase public awareness of the \ndangers of hepatitis C, and make testing widely available. For those \nalready infected, it will provide counseling, referrals, and \nvaccination against hepatitis A and B and other infectious diseases. It \nwill also support research, including the development of a vaccine \nagainst hepatitis C. It also supports increased hepatitis C \nsurveillance activities by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, and creates hepatitis C coordinators to provide technical \nassistance and training to State public health agencies.\n  This bill will have a major impact on the lives of millions of \nAmericans who are infected by hepatitis C, and the families and loved \nones who care for them. I look forward to working closely with my \ncolleagues to act quickly to pass this needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Webb):\n  S. 1446. A bill to amend the National Capital Transportation Act of \n1969 to authorize additional Federal contributions for maintaining and \nimproving the transit system of the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \nsustain the Federal Government's longstanding commitment to the \nWashington Metropolitan area's Metrorail system. The National Capital \nTransportation Amendments Act of 2007 authorizes a total of \n$1,500,000,000 in matching Federal funds over the next 10 years to \nmaintain and improve America's public transit system. It is a companion \nto a measure introduced in the House by Representative Tom Davis, with \nstrong regional and bipartisan support, and is nearly identical to the \nlegislation which was approved by the House in the 109th Congress.\n  In March 2006, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority \ncelebrated the 30th anniversary of passenger service on the Metrorail \nsystem. Since service first began in 1976, Metrorail has grown from a \n4.6-mile, five-station, 22,000-passenger system into the Nation's \nsecond busiest rapid transit operation. Today the Metrorail system \nconsists of 106.3 miles, 86 stations and carries more than 100 million \npassengers a year. The Metrorail system provides a unified and \ncoordinated transportation system for the region, enhances mobility for \nthe millions of residents, visitors and the Federal workforce in the \nregion, promotes orderly growth and development of the region, enhances \nour environment, and preserves the beauty and dignity of our Nation's \nCapital. It is also an example of an unparalleled partnership that \nspans every level of government from city to State to Federal.\n  As the largest employer in this region, the Federal Government has \nhad a longstanding and unique responsibility to support the Metro \nsystem. This special responsibility was recognized more than 40 years \nago in the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960, when Congress \nfound that ``an improved transportation system for the National Capital \nregion is essential for the continued and effective performance of the \nfunctions of the Government of the United States.'' Today more than a \nthird of Federal employees in this region rely on Metrorail to get to \nwork, and at rush hour, more than 40 percent of Metro's riders are \nFederal employees. The service that WMATA provides is also a critical \ncomponent of Federal emergency evacuation plans for the region. The \nFederal Government's interest in Metro is ``unique and enduring.''\n  It took extraordinary perseverance and effort to build the 106-mile \nMetorail system. From its origins in legislation first approved by the \nCongress during the Eisenhower Administration, three major statutes, \nthe National Capital Transportation Act of 1969, the National Capital \nTransportation amendments of 1979, and the National Capital \nTransportation Amendments of 1990 were enacted to provide Federal and \nmatching local funds for construction of the system. In addition, in \nISTEA, TEA-21 and most-recently in SAFETEA-LU, we made the Metrorail \neligible for millions of dollars in Federal funds annually to maintain \nand modernize the system, and provided an additional $104 million for \nWMATA's procurement of 52 rail cars and construction of upgrades to \ntraction power equipment on 20 stations to allow the transit agency to \nexpand many of its trains from 6 to 8 cars.\n  But the system is aging and has been experiencing increasing \nincidents of equipment breakdowns, delays in scheduled service, and \nunprecedented crowding on trains. In 2004, WMATA released a ``Metro \nMatters'' report which found a $1.5 billion shortfall in funding over 6 \nyears to meet WMATA's capital and operating needs. A Blue Ribbon Panel, \nsponsored by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the \nGreater Washington Board of Trade and the Federal City Council \npublished a report a year later which concluded that WMATA faces an \naverage annual operating and capital shortfall of approximately $300 \nmillion between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2015.\n  This legislation seeks to provide additional Federal funds to help \nclose this gap. To be eligible for any Federals funds that may be \nappropriated annually under this legislation, the District of Columbia, \nthe State of Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Virginia must first \nenact the required Compact amendments and either establish or use an \nexisting dedicated funding source, such as Maryland's Transportation \nTrust fund, to provide the local matching funds. The legislation is \nstill subject to the annual appropriations process and it is my hope \nthat federal funding authorized under this Act will be forthcoming in \nfuture years. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National \n     Capital Transportation Amendments Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Metro, the public transit system of the Washington \n     metropolitan area, is essential for the continued and \n     effective performance of the functions of the Federal \n     Government, and for the orderly movement of people during \n     major events and times of regional or national emergency.\n       (2) On 3 occasions, Congress has authorized appropriations \n     for the construction and capital improvement needs of the \n     Metrorail system.\n       (3) Additional funding is required to protect these \n     previous Federal investments and ensure the continued \n     functionality and viability of the original 103-mile \n     Metrorail system.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators \nMikulski, Cardin and Warner, to introduce legislation that will \nreaffirm the Federal Government's continuing responsibility for the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, WMATA. Our legislation, \nin cooperation with State and local governments of the national capital \nregion, will aid in the preservation and maintenance of our regional \ntransportation system.\n  Our predecessors in Congress had a clear vision for rapid rail and \nbus service that would not only transport Federal employees, residents, \nand visitors around the national capital region but that would also \nalleviate traffic congestion, spur growth and development, improve the \neconomic welfare and vitality of all parts of the region, and ensure \nthat all area residents have sufficient mobility options.\n  The Washington Metro transit system has fulfilled that vision and \nmore, providing critical support to the Federal Government and the \nregion during emergencies, helping to protect the environment and \nimprove air quality in our Nation's Capital, and attracting visitors \nfrom around the country and the world to ride the system--now a \nmonument of its own.\n  With the Federal Government's commitment to reduce our Nation's \ndependence on foreign oil and to increase national security, Federal \nsupport of the Washington Metro system is more important now than ever \nbefore. Congress has a fundamental interest in the transit system, and \nwe must join our longstanding regional partners to help meet the demand \nof Metro's growing ridership and aging infrastructure.\n  Since the Washington Metro transit system began operating its first \n4.6 miles of the Red Line between Rhode Island Avenue and Farragut \nNorth in 1976, the Metrorail system has added over 100 miles and \nextended operations to a total of 86 stations throughout the District \nof Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. Almost half of all Metrorail \nstations today serve Federal facilities, and 42 percent of Metro's peak \nperiod commuters are Federal employees.\n  Metrorail and Metrobus ridership continue to grow as more than a \nmillion riders on average per weekday choose Metro as their preferred \nmode of transit for traveling around the national capital region. \nMetrorail ridership has grown steadily at an average annual growth of 4 \npercent, according to the Progress Report on the National Capital \nRegion's Six-Year Transportation Capital Funding Needs, 2007-2012, by \nthe Metropolitan Washington Transportation Planning Board, TPB. The \nreport predicts that transit ridership demand will exceed system \ncapacity by the year 2010. New funding authorized in this legislation \nwould provide the necessary resources to increase bus and rail capacity \nand meet forecasted ridership demands, before the system and region \nbecome totally mired in congestion.\n  The Washington Metro transit system has proven critical to the \nFederal Government, not only in moving its employees and serving \nFederal facilities but also in providing significant support during \nemergencies. Immediately following the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattack on the Pentagon, Metro continued operations and helped safely \nevacuate hundreds of thousands of people from the downtown core of the \nDistrict of Columbia. For a 30-day period after September 11, Metro \nopened Metrorail service half an hour early to support the Department \nof Defense as it heightened security actions and encountered major \ntraffic congestion accessing the Pentagon.\n  Metro is a key component in emergency transportation and continuity \nof operations plans for the entire region, including the civilian and \nmilitary Federal workforce. Without the use of the Metro system, \ngridlock would ensue on the region's roadways to a degree that would \nmake all emergency transportation evacuation plans inoperable. With \nenactment of the legislation we propose today, Congress will assist the \nWashington Metro transit system to continue to provide its vital \nservice and bolster security measures throughout the system.\n  Additional funding will also enable the transit system to continue to \nprovide the invaluable service of helping to reduce traffic congestion \nthroughout the region. With area roadways becoming increasingly \ncongested, the Washington Metro transit system is critical to the \nregion's infrastructure.\n  According to the 2005 Urban Mobility Report by the Texas \nTransportation Institute, TTI, the Washington metropolitan area has the \nthird-worst traffic congestion in the United States. Washington area \ncommuters sat in traffic for 145.5 million hours in 2003, costing \ndrivers an estimated $2.46 billion and wasting more than 87 million \ngallons of fuel. The report shows that the Washington area would have \nthe worst congestion in the Nation if not for its public transportation \nsystem. Moreover, the report concludes that Washington Metro transit \nimprovements are necessary to help further relieve congested corridors \nand serve major activity centers.\n  Currently, Metrorail and Metrobus services result in 580,000 cars \nbeing removed from the region's highways each weekday and eliminate the \nneed for 1,400 additional highway lane miles. A reliable and safe \npublic transportation system is essential to encouraging more commuters \nto utilize alternative modes of transportation, especially as \ncongestion on regional roadways is projected to increase, along with \nstrong job and population growth in the National Capital region.\n  The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, MWCOG, estimates \nthe area's population will grow 36 percent by 2030. Already struggling \nto meet its current ridership demands, the Washington Metro transit \nsystem desperately needs increased support from the Federal Government \nand State and local governments in the national capital region to keep \nup with the region's current and future economic progress.\n  Metro is an unparalleled asset to the region, not only reducing \ntraffic congestion and air pollutants but also helping to reduce our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil. Public transportation is an \ninherently energy efficient travel mode, with each transit user \nconsuming an average of one-half the oil consumed by the typical \nautomobile user, according to the American Public Transportation \nAssociation, APTA.\n  Current public transportation usage reduces U.S. gasoline consumption \nby 1.4 billion gallons each year. In concrete terms, that means 108 \nmillion fewer cars are filling up with gas per year, or almost 300,000 \nper day, 34 fewer supertankers are leaving the Middle East per year, \nand over 140,000 fewer tanker trucks are making deliveries to service \nstations.\n  Locally, the Washington Metro transit system saves the region from \nusing 75 million gallons of gasoline each year. As gas prices continue \nto rise, many Washington area residents will continue to seize upon the \nopportunity to save money on fuel consumption by taking public \ntransportation. Additional Federal funding will allow Metro to purchase \n340 new railcars and 275 new buses, which are necessary to accommodate \nmore riders and help further reduce oil consumption throughout the \nWashington region.\n  Public transportation not only helps reduce our dependence on foreign \noil, but it also helps reduce toxic emissions and air pollution caused \nby the large number of cars sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on area \nroadways. The Washington Metro transit system eliminates more than \n10,000 tons of pollutants from the air each year. Much of the Metrobus \nfleet is comprised of eco-friendly buses that run on ultra low\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nsulfur diesel fuel, compressed natural gas, diesel electric hybrid and \nadvanced technology fuels. Investing in Metro is one of the most \nsignificant contributions the Federal Government can make to help \nprotect the environment in the Washington metropolitan area.\n  Reliable Metrorail and Metrobus service is an attractive alternative \nto sitting in traffic, but if Metro does not receive additional \nfunding, reliability will diminish along with the public's confidence \nin the transit system. Already, Metro is struggling to accommodate more \nriders and modernize its existing assets. Additional dedicated sources \nof funding are needed if Metro is to continue to serve the Federal \nworkforce and thousands of other area residents and visitors.\n  For the past 30 years, the Washington Metro transit system has been a \nbedrock for the national capital region, providing reliable \ntransportation, facilitating day-to-day operations of the Federal \nGovernment, spurring economic growth and sensible development, reducing \nsprawl and traffic congestion, and improving the quality of life for \nthe region's citizens and visitors to the Nation's Capital.\n  The future of Metro and its continued success relies upon consistent \nsupport from the Federal Government and the regional localities it \nserves. Now is the time for the Federal Government to commit itself to \nproviding more long-term Federal funding for the Washington Metro \nsystem. Together, along with our jurisdictional partners, we must \ncontinue to invest in the transit system that has brought so many \nrewards not only to the region but also to the Federal Government and \nthe entire Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as it \nmoves through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 1448. A bill to extend the same Federal benefits to law \nenforcement officers serving private institutions of higher education \nand rail carriers that apply to law enforcement officers serving units \nof State and local government; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on April 16, 2007, our Nation faced a \nterrible tragedy, the deadliest shooting in the history of our Nation. \nI want to express my sympathy to the victims of this senseless \nviolence, one of whom was Daniel O'Neil, a 22-year-old Virginia Tech \ngraduate student from Lincoln, RI.\n  The unfortunate truth is that this unspeakable event could have \nhappened on any campus, anywhere. It highlighted how vulnerable our \nNation's university and college campuses can be to this type of attack.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the Equity in Law Enforcement Act, to \nextend Federal benefits to law enforcement officers who serve private \ninstitutions of higher education and rail carriers, including line-of-\nduty death benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, \nand eligibility for bulletproof vest partnership grants through the \nDepartment of Justice. This legislation would give sworn, licensed, or \ncertified police officers serving private institutions of higher \neducation and rail carriers the same Federal benefits that apply to law \nenforcement officers serving units of State and local government.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits, PSOB, Act of 1976 was enacted \nto aid in the recruitment and retention of law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters by providing a one-time financial benefit to the eligible \nsurvivors of public safety officers whose deaths are the direct result \nof traumatic injury sustained in the line of duty. Specifically, this \nlaw addresses concerns that the hazards inherent in law enforcement and \nfire suppression, and the low level of State and local death benefits, \nmight discourage qualified individuals from seeking careers in these \nfields.\n  The same risks also apply to police officers protecting our private \nuniversities and railways. Unfortunately, the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Act omitted coverage to sworn officers who are privately \nemployed, even though they enforce the law and have arrest powers \nwithin their jurisdiction. These brave officers, who protect our \ncollege and university campuses and railways every day and receive the \nsame training as their government counterparts, are thus excluded from \nreceiving the same line-of-duty Federal death benefits as law \nenforcement officers serving units of State and local governments.\n  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 25 \ncollege or university officers have been killed in the line of duty \nsince September 20, 1963. The names of these 25 officers, including \nOfficer Joseph Francis Doyle, who was killed in the line of duty at \nBrown University in 1988, as well as 59 railway officers who have been \nkilled in the line-of-duty are inscribed on the Memorial.\n  Since September 2004, three sworn campus police officers have been \nkilled in the line-of-duty. Two of these officers were from public \nuniversities: the University of Florida and the University of \nMississippi, whose sworn officers are covered by the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits Act. The third, however, was Butler University \nPolice Department Officer James L. Davis, Jr., who was shot and killed \nin the line of duty on September 24, 2004, while responding to a campus \ndisturbance. Because Butler University is a private university, Officer \nDavis was not eligible for the same Federal benefits as his \ncounterparts at the University of Florida or the University of \nMississippi.\n  I am pleased that Senators Leahy and Cornyn have joined me in \nintroducing this legislation to help remedy this discrepancy in death \nbenefit payments for law enforcement officers and ensure that these \npublic safety officers have access to the protective equipment they \nneed.\n  The bill would apply only to sworn peace officers who receive State \ncertification or licensing, and is supported by the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, IACP, and the International \nAssociation of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, IACLEA. Indeed, \nthe benefits of this legislation far outweigh the costs. A 2004 \nanalysis by the Congressional Budget Office found that there would be \nno significant budget impact by its enactment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, and Senators Leahy and Cornyn, in \ncosponsoring and passing the Equity in Law Enforcement Act, to ensure \nthat the brave officers that serve and protect our private college and \nuniversity campuses and railways receive the benefits that they \ndeserve. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Rocky Mountain Science Collections \nCenter to assist in preserving the archeological, anthropological, \npaleontological, zoological, and geologic artifacts and archival \ndocumentation from the Rocky Mountain region through the construction \nof an on-site, secure collections facility for the Denver Museum of \nNature and Science in Denver, Colorado; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today Senator Allard and I introduced the \n``Rocky Mountain Science Collections Center Act of 2007,'' a bill to \nestablish a secure collections facility and education center for \narcheological, anthropological, paleontological, zoological, and \ngeological artifacts and archival documentation from throughout the \nRocky Mountain region at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, Denver, \nColorado.\n  Our bill would authorize $15 million, subject to appropriations, for \nthe Secretary of Interior to provide grants to pay the Federal share, \n50 percent of the cost of constructing appropriate, museum-standard \nfacilities to house the collections of the Museum.\n  Since its founding in 1900, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science has \nbeen the principal natural history museum between Chicago and Los \nAngeles and has educated more than 70 million visitors. The Museum \nholds more than a million objects in public trust. Together, the \nMuseum's collections, library, and archives provide the foundation for \nunderstanding science and the natural and cultural history of the \nregion and serve as the primary resource for informal science education \nto Colorado school and general audiences. The Museum is a world leader \nin creating opportunities that allow the general public to participate \nin authentic collection based scientific research.\n  The majority of the collections that the Museum maintains in \nperpetuity are acquired through federal authorization, are cared for on \nbehalf of Federal agencies, or are controlled by federal legislation. \nOf the more than 840,000 items in the Museum's collection, more than \nhalf were recovered from federally managed public land. Construction of \non-site collection facilities, exhibition facilities and an education \ncenter for the Museum will provide a secure facility for the collection \nand ensure that it is accessible to members of the public, universities \nand research scientists alike. The Federal cost share will help pay for \nconstruction as well as the costs of design, planning, furnishing, \nequipping and supporting the Museum.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, here is a summary of the bill's \nprovisions:\n  Section 1. Short Title. The Rocky Mountain Science Collections Center \nAct of 2007.\n  Section 2. Findings. Recites several of the findings of Congress, \nincluding the size and breadth of the collections held by the Denver \nMuseum of Nature and Science and the finding that significant portions \nof these collections were recovered from public lands managed by \nvarious Federal agencies. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is \nthe federally designated repository for these collections and as such \nis governed by various Federal statutes and regulations in carrying out \nits trustee responsibilities.\n  Section 3. Definitions. The term ``Museum'' in the Act refers to the \nDenver Museum of Nature and Science. The term ``Secretary'' in the Act \nrefers to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior.\n  Section 4. Grant to the Museum. This section provides that the \nSecretary may provide grants to pay for the Federal share of the cost \nof constructing appropriate, Museum standard facilities to house the \ncollections of the Museum. The Federal share reflects the continuing \nFederal ownership of the artifacts and other scientifically significant \nmaterials held by the Museum in a trust responsibility. This section \nauthorizes the use of any grant funds for construction, design, \nengineering, plans, equipment, furnishing and other services or goods \nin furtherance of the construction of the Collections Center.\n  Subsection 4 (b). Application. The subsection provides an application \nprocess whereby the Museum provides the Secretary with the necessary \ndocumentation and information to assure the Secretary that grant \nproceeds are expended for the intended result.\n  Subsection 4 (c). Matching Funds. This subsection requires the Museum \nto provide a match for any amounts granted under the section and allows \nthe Museum to use cash, in-kind donations and/or services in \nsatisfaction of the match requirement.\n  Subsection 4 (d). Authorization. The Act authorizes $15,000,000 to be \nappropriated to the Secretary in carrying out the Act; such funds to \nremain available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1450. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Housing \nAssistance Council; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Housing \nAssistance Council Authorization Act. This legislation will authorize \nappropriations for the Housing Assistance Council, HAC, which has been \ncommitted to developing affordable housing in rural communities for \nover 35 years.\n  The bill provides $10 million for HAC in fiscal year 2008 and then \n$15 million in fiscal year 2009-2014. In the past, the Council has \nreceived appropriations from the Self Help and Assisted Homeownership \nOpportunity Program. The funding has helped HAC provide loans to 1,875 \norganizations across the country, raise and distribute over $5 million \nin capacity building grants and hold regional training workshops. These \ncritical services help local organizations, rural communities and \ncities develop safe and affordable housing.\n  Throughout the country, approximately one-fifth of the Nation's \npopulation lives in rural communities. About 7.5 million of the rural \npopulation is living in poverty and 2.5 million of them are children. \nNearly 3.6 million rural households pay more than 30 percent of their \nincome in housing costs. While housing costs are generally lower in \nrural counties, wages are dramatically outpaced by the cost of housing. \nAdditionally, the housing conditions are often substandard and there \nare many families doubled up due to lack of housing. Rural areas lack \nboth affordable rental units and homeownership opportunities needed to \nserve the population.\n  There are several Federal programs that are aimed at developing \naffordable housing and economic opportunities in rural communities in \nboth the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department \nof Agriculture. However, over the past 6 years, funding for these \nprograms has been reduced by 20 percent. For the fiscal year 2008 \nbudget, the administration proposed to eliminate $1.3 billion in rural \nhousing assistance. In many regions Federal funding might be the only \nassistance available for housing and economic development. The Housing \nAssistance Council is yet another tool that rural communities can \nutilize when trying to develop affordable housing.\n  In Wisconsin, HAC has provided close to $5.2 million in grants and \nloans to 17 nonprofit housing organizations and helped develop 820 \nunits of housing. Specifically, since 1972 the Southeastern Wisconsin \nHousing Corporation has partnered with the Housing Assistance Council \nto develop 268 units of self-help housing. The presence of the\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nCouncil in Wisconsin has made a huge impact on rural housing \ndevelopment in Wisconsin and other rural communities across the \ncountry.\n  I am very honored to work with Senator Snowe this legislation. Its \npassage will allow every State to better serve the needs of the people \nliving in rural areas. I look forward to Working with my colleagues to \nensure the adoption of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE:\n  S. 1451. A bill to encourage the development of coordinated quality \nreforms to improve health care delivery and reduce the cost of care in \nthe health care system; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise today because I will be \nintroducing my first bills as a Member of this esteemed body; \nlegislation that I hope will provide a helpful step forward as we \naddress one of the most significant challenges this Senate faces, \nreforming America's broken health care system.\n  I have heard from countless Rhode Islanders who have struggled to pay \nfor their health care and who live in fear of losing coverage on which \nthey and their families depend. I have met nurses frustrated and \nheartbroken that they must spend so much time coping with the paperwork \nand so little time caring for patients. I have talked with families \nwhose lives and health were shaken by terrifying medical errors, lost \npaperwork, missed diagnoses that should have been totally avoided.\n  I believe our current health care system is too complex and costs so \nmuch, yet so often does not provide patients with the quality of care \nthey should have. It does not have to be this way. I have seen \nfirsthand that we can make the system work better for everyone, we can \ncut costs, save lives, and improve the quality of the health care we \nreceive, a critical step toward ensuring that all Americans have health \ncare they can afford.\n  In Rhode Island, we have been working and experimenting for years to \nfind solutions to many of these challenges. I have been privileged to \nbe part of much of that work, most directly when I founded the Rhode \nIsland Quality Institute to focus on quality reforms in health care.\n  While we have a long way to go, so far we have been successful. It is \nthat Rhode Island experience that I bring to you today. It is Rhode \nIsland's good work that I hope will provide a good example.\n  Right now our health care system is a mess, such a mess that we \nshould hesitate to call it a health care system. It yields \nunsatisfactory results at vast expense. What I wish to talk about today \nis not how you finance the health care system--that is an important \nissue--but it is a different issue. I don't even want to talk about how \nyou get all Americans covered by our health care system. That is \nanother important issue, but that is not the subject today.\n  The subject today is the issue of how the system itself runs, how it \noperates, put bluntly, how badly in America it runs. If we can reduce \nthe cost of the underlying system by improving its performance, it will \nmake solutions easier for financing our health care system and for \nfinding a way to make sure every American gets health care coverage. \nOur health care system is a mess. The number of uninsured Americans is \nclimbing and will soon reach 50 million. The annual cost of the system \nexceeds $2 trillion every year, and that number is expected soon to \ndouble. We spend more of our gross domestic product on health care than \nany other industrialized country in the world, 16 percent. That is \ndouble the European Union average.\n  There is today more health care in Ford cars than there is steel. \nThere is more health care in Starbucks coffee than there are coffee \nbeans. Worse still, for all this money we spend, we get a mediocre \nproduct. We have the best doctors, the best nurses, the best procedures \nand equipment, the best medical education in the world. Yet the system \nproduces mediocre results. As many as 100,000 Americans are killed \nevery year by unnecessary and avoidable medical errors. That is just \nthe fatalities. Think how many people have to stay longer in the \nhospital and run up costs.\n  Life expectancy, obesity rates, and infant mortality rates are much \nworse than they should be in a country such as ours. We fail by most \ninternational measures. The system itself does not work. Hospitals are \ngoing broke. Doctors are furious, and paperwork chokes the system.\n  Quarrels between the providers and the payers drive up costs, while \npotential savings in billions of dollars are left lying on the table. \nMore American families are bankrupted by health care costs than any \nother cause. It is a system in crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this point too. If we do not fix \nthis system now, while we still can, if we don't get these savings now, \nthen we are going to be forced to consider very tragic choices in the \nfuture: Cutting coverage for seniors now on Medicare, throwing children \noff S-CHIP or pushing more and more out-of-pocket costs onto families \nwho need Medicaid in their struggle to get by.\n  Those will be tragic choices, awful choices, ones I hope we never \nhave to deliberate. But if we end up having to make these choices \nbecause today we failed to do our duty, then shame on us.\n  I believe what is wrong with our system can be identified. The \nreasons for its failures can be identified. The causes of those \nfailures can be corrected, and the failings can be cured.\n  In the days to come, I will speak at greater length on three critical \nareas of reform, one by one, and advance proposals for each one that \nwill help provide a cure.\n  Today, I wish to highlight all three of the major failures, how they \ncombine to worsen each other and keep our system broken, and how \nreforming those three areas can reinforce each other and repair our \nbroken system.\n  Left unattended, these three conditions will continue to degrade our \nsystem. Properly reformed, they will begin to improve it. This is \nbecause what we are dealing with, in a nutshell, is market failure. \nMarket forces are bottled up, logjammed, conflicted, and misdirected to \npush the health care system in a bad direction.\n\n  I trust market forces and I believe in market forces, but I see it as \nour job in Government to create the environment in which market forces \noperate in a healthy way to serve the public interest.\n  That is our job. It always has been. Where that healthy environment \nfor market forces does not exist--which is the case right now in our \nhealth care system--Government must act. The market failure in health \ncare has three core components: One, the American health care system \ndoes not optimize investment in quality of care, even where--indeed, \nparticularly where--that quality investment in improving care would \nalso lower costs; two, the system does not have the information \ntechnology infrastructure to support the improvements we need; three, \nthe way we pay for health care sends perverse price signals that steer \nus away from the public interest.\n  These problems can each be fixed, but fixing each in isolation will \nnot yield the change we need. Similar to three climbers roped together \nfor an ascent, the three solutions need to track with each other, not \nnecessarily in lockstep but staying close because each one reinforces \nthe other.\n  Let me tell a story about each one of those problems to illustrate \nthe three points. Let's look at the area where improved quality of care \nwould lower costs. That intersection, where improved quality of care \nand lower costs converge, should be our Holy Grail. A good example \ncomes out of the Keystone Project in Michigan, home to Senators Levin \nand Stabenow.\n  The Keystone Project went into a significant number of Michigan \nintensive care units to improve quality and reduce line infections, \nrespiratory complications, and other conditions that are associated \nwith intensive care units. In a 15-month span, between March 2004 and \nJune 2005, the project saved 1,578 lives, 81,020 days patients would \notherwise have been spent in the hospital, and it saved--in that 15 \nmonths--over $165 million.\n  The Rhode Island Quality Institute has taken this model statewide in \nRhode Island, with every hospital participating. Infections in patients \nwith catheters decreased 36 percent from the\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nfirst quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter. Eleven out of twenty-three \nparticipating intensive care units had zero infections for 12 months. \nSavings from the initiative are on track to produce $4 million \nannually. That is pretty good money in Rhode Island.\n  What is true in intensive care units in Michigan and Rhode Island is \nalso true far more broadly in health care. There are many areas where \nsignificant savings can be achieved by making care better. There could \nbe initiatives similar to Keystone throughout the health care sector. \nThey do not necessarily have to be reforms of existing procedures and \npractices because Keystone was. Quality improvements, quality reform, \ncould well involve improvements in prevention and detection of illness, \nstopping it before it even gets to the hospital. There are vast and \nunexplored horizons out there, rich with opportunity, and the Keystone \nstory is one example of how improved quality of care can lower costs \nand save lives. This takes us to the second story, this one about the \nreimbursement problem. Why isn't this quality reform happening \nspontaneously all over the country if these big savings are there? \nThink of Michigan, $165 million in 15 months in one State. That is big \nmoney.\n  Why isn't it being pursued? Why aren't we all doing this? Well, \nprimarily because the economics of health care pays providers not to \nand punishes providers who try. When a group of hospitals in Utah began \nfollowing the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society for treating \ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, significant complications fell from 15.3 \npercent to 11.6 percent, inpatient mortality fell from 7.2 to 5.3 \npercent, and the resulting cost savings exceeded half a million dollars \na year. But net operating income of participating facilities dropped by \nover $200,000 per year because treating the healthier patients was \nreimbursed at roughly $12,000 less per case.\n  In Rhode Island, when we got into this intensive care unit reform, \nthe Hospital Association estimated a $400,000 cost for $8 million in \nsavings, a 20-to-1 return on investment. But all the savings went to \nthe insurers and the payers, and the costs came out of the hospitals' \npockets. Do you know a lot of businesses that invest money in order to \nreduce their revenue? I don't. How many businesses would spend $400,000 \nin cash to lose $8 million in revenues every year? With reimbursement \nincentives such as the ones we have, it is no wonder that quality \ninvestments face an uphill struggle.\n  The final problem is our health care information technology, which is \ninexcusably underdeveloped and underdeployed. It has been described by \nthe Economist magazine as the worst information technology system in \nany American industry except one, the mining industry. We are leaving \nmassive savings in health care costs unclaimed as a result.\n  Some pretty respectable groups have looked at health information \ntechnology to see what an adequate system would save in health care \ncosts, and here is what they report: Rand Corporation, $81 billion per \nyear conservatively. David Brailer, the former National Coordinator for \nHealth Information Technology, $100 billion per year. The Center for \nInformation Technology Leadership, $77 billion per year. That is a lot \nof savings to leave sitting on the table, savings desperately needed by \nAmerican businesses and American families.\n  Here is my third story, about a courageous and passionate doctor in \nRhode Island trying to build an electronic health record for patients \nin our State. By the way of context, Rhode Island may be the lead State \nin the country at developing health information technology. We have \nPatrick Kennedy in the House, our Representative, who has been an \nabsolute leader on this issue; Lifespan and other hospitals are leaders \nin electronic physician order entry; the Rhode Island Quality Institute \nis a leader in e-prescribing, electronic health records and health \ninformation exchange; Rhode Island Blue Cross is beginning to fund \ninnovations; all the local Rhode Island health care folks are active in \nthis. It is very impressive. I mean no criticism by telling this story, \nonly to illustrate what an uphill struggle it is.\n  The lead on developing electronic health records in Rhode Island is \nbeing taken by a very frustrated doctor, Dr. Mark Jacobs, who put his \npractice on hold, went out and looked at what was available, found an \ne-clinical works platform, had it modified to suit what he thought \nwould be more useful for his needs, and is now raising capital and \ntrying to recruit his colleagues to get around that system and get it \nup. It is his passion, and he is dedicating himself to it with energy \nand conviction.\n  What Dr. Jacobs is doing is heroic, but if you went to any business \nschool and if they asked you, what is the best way to seize that $81 \nbillion a year in savings that RAND Corporation has said is out there, \nand you had said: Well, we are going to wait until a doctor gets so \nfrustrated he is willing to give up his practice and go out and try to \nlearn about health care technology and do it on his own, you would be \nlaughed out of that business school classroom. They wouldn't just say \nyou flunked the course, they would suggest you should maybe look at \nanother livelihood. But that is exactly the system we have right now.\n  If a truckdriver were to go out with a pick and shovel building bits \nof the interstate highway for us, that would be pretty heroic and \nnoble. But all the way back to Dwight Eisenhower, people in Government \nknew that would be a pretty nonsensical way to finance the Federal \nhighway system.\n  We have work to do in these three areas: fixing our information \ntechnology to increase efficiency and generate savings; improving \nhealth care quality and prevention in ways that lower costs; and \nrepairing the reimbursement system so it does not discourage those \nreforms but encourages and rewards them.\n  In the coming days, I will expand on each of these problems, and I \nwill propose solutions in those three areas that will unleash market \nincentives in positive directions. As I conclude, my message is this: \nThe health care system that underlies all our health care financing and \ncoverage problems is itself broken. The underlying health care delivery \nsystem is itself broken. It is administrative and bureaucratic \nmachinery, but it is still machinery. It needs to be repaired the way \nany broken machinery does. Fixing it, however, will reduce costs, \nimprove care, and make a badly operating system run better and move us \na critical step forward to making sure every American family has access \nto health care they can afford.\n  I sincerely hope to work with all of my colleagues on solving this. \nPlease think of it this way: If your car is not running right, there is \nno Republican or Democratic way to tune it up. There is just getting it \nworking. If your plumbing is jammed and water is flooding out, there is \nnot a Republican or Democratic way to fix that. It is either flowing \nproperly or it isn't. If your electric system is sparking and short \ncircuited, again, there is no Democratic or Republican way to solve \nthat problem. It is working right or it is not. Our health care system \nis not working right, and it needs to be fixed. Because the health care \nsystem is a dynamic system, you can't tell it what to do. You have to \ntake the trouble to identify what is wrong, identify why it is wrong, \nand correct the cause.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1452. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nnational center for public mental health emergency preparedness, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today Senator Domenici and I are \nintroducing the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of \n2007. I originally introduced this legislation during the 109 Congress \nto address mental health needs of those affected by disasters and \npublic health emergencies, and I want to thank Senator Domenici for his \nsupport of this legislation and for his strong leadership on mental \nhealth issues. The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of \n2007 would take several important steps toward preparing our Nation to \neffectively address mental health issues in the wake of public health \nemergencies, including potential bioterrorist attacks. We are pleased \nto be introducing this important legislation in anticipation of \nreauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration SAMHSA.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  I want to acknowledge and thank our partners from the mental health \ncommunity who have collaborated with us and have been working \ndiligently on these issues for several years, including the American \nPsychological Association, the American Public Health Association, the \nNational Association of Social Workers, and the American Academy of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry, and all the other groups who have lent \ntheir support.\n  The events of September 11, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and other \nrecent natural and man-made catastrophes have sadly taught us that our \ncurrent resources are not sufficient or coordinated enough to meet the \nmental health needs of those devastated by emergency events. We need a \nnetwork of trained mental health professionals, first responders and \nleaders, and a process to mobilize and deploy mental health resources \nin a rapid and sustained manner at times of an emergency.\n  It is clear that the consequences of emergency events like hurricanes \nor terrorist attacks result in increased emotional and psychological \nsuffering among survivors and responders, and we must do more to assist \nall who are affected. That is why I, along with Senator Domenici, am \nintroducing the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of \n2007.\n  This bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human services to \nestablish the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency \nPreparedness the National Center to coordinate the development and \ndelivery of mental health services in collaboration with existing \nFederal, State and local entities when our Nation is confronted with \npublic health catastrophes.\n  This legislation would charge the National Center with five functions \nto benefit affected Americans at the community level, including \nvulnerable populations like children, older Americans, caregivers, \npersons with disabilities, and persons living in poverty.\n  First, the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 \nwould make sure we have evidence-based or emerging best practices \ncurricula available to meet the diverse training needs of a wide range \nof emergency health professionals, including mental health \nprofessionals, public health and health care professionals, and \nemergency services personnel, working in coordination with county \nemergency managers, school personnel, spiritual care professionals, and \nState and local government officials responsible for emergency \npreparedness. By using these curricula to educate responders, the \nNational Center would build a network of trained emergency health \nprofessionals at the State and local levels.\n\n  Second, this legislation would establish and maintain a clearinghouse \nof educational materials, guidelines, and research on public mental \nhealth emergency preparedness and service delivery that would be \nevaluated and updated to ensure the information is accurate and \ncurrent. Technical assistance would be provided to help users access \nthose resources most effective for their communities.\n  Third, this bill would create an annual national forum for emergency \nhealth professionals, researchers, and other experts as well as \nFederal, State and local government officials to identify and address \ngaps in science, practice, policy and education related to public \nmental health emergency preparedness and service delivery.\n  Fourth, this bill would require annual evaluations of both the \nNational Center's efforts and those across the Federal Government in \nbuilding our Nation's public mental health emergency preparedness and \nservice delivery capacity. Based on these evaluations, recommendations \nwould be made to improve such activities.\n  Finally, the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 \nwould ensure that licensed mental health professionals are included in \nthe deployment of Disaster Medical Assistance Teams DMAT. Deployment of \nlicensed mental health professionals will increase the efficacy of the \nmedical team members by providing psychological assistance and crisis \ncounseling to survivors and to the other DMAT team members. Further, \nthis legislation would mandate that licensed mental health \nprofessionals are included in the leadership of the National Disaster \nMedical System, NDMS, to provide appropriate support for behavioral \nprograms and personnel within the DMATs.\n  We must not wait until another disaster strikes before we take action \nto improve the way we respond to the psychological needs of affected \nAmericans.

Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Domenici: On behalf of the \n     148,000 members and affiliates of the American Psychological \n     Association (APA), I am writing to express our strong support \n     for the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of \n     2007. This important legislation would significantly enhance \n     our preparedness, response, and recovery efforts to address \n     the mental health aspects of disasters and public health \n     emergencies.\n       Both human made and natural disasters can have significant \n     effects on the mental health and well-being of individuals, \n     families, and communities. Among the most common mental \n     health problems encountered by disaster survivors are \n     posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, \n     and increased alcohol, tobacco, and substance use. For many, \n     the psychological effects of disasters may be temporary, \n     while others may require more long-term mental health \n     assistance.\n       The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007 \n     would take several important steps toward enhancing our \n     Nation's public mental health preparedness and response \n     efforts in the event of a public health emergency. In \n     particular, this legislation would establish a National \n     Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness to \n     prepare for and address the immediate and long-term mental \n     health needs of the general population and potentially \n     vulnerable subgroups, including children, individuals with \n     disabilities, individuals with pre-existing mental health \n     problems, older adults, caregivers, and individuals living in \n     poverty. This center would undertake several important \n     activities, including developing and disseminating training \n     curricula for emergency mental health professionals, \n     establishing a clearinghouse of mental health emergency \n     resources, organizing an annual national forum on mental \n     health emergency preparedness and response, and ensuring the \n     inclusion of mental health professionals within Disaster \n     Medical Assistance Teams.\n       We commend you for your leadership and commitment to public \n     mental health preparedness and look forward to working with \n     you to ensure enactment of the Public Mental Health Emergency \n     Preparedness Act. If we can be of further assistance, please \n     feel free to contact Diane Elmore, Ph.D., in our Government \n     Relations Office.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gwendolyn Puryear Keita, Ph.D.,\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Public Interest Directorate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the American Public \n     Health Association (APHA), the oldest, largest and most \n     diverse organization of public health professionals in the \n     world, dedicated to protecting all Americans and their \n     communities from preventable, serious health threats and \n     assuring community-based health promotion and disease \n     prevention activities and preventive health services are \n     universally accessible in the United States, I write in \n     support of the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness \n     Act of 2007.\n       Despite recent efforts to improve all-hazards preparedness \n     in this country, the lack of mental health services available \n     to victims of public health emergencies remains troubling. As \n     lessons learned from the hurricanes of 2005 and essentials to \n     adequately prepare for and respond to a flu pandemic are \n     incorporated into national, state and local all-hazards \n     preparedness plans, we must also ensure that mental health \n     emergency preparedness and delivery is integrated into all of \n     these plans, including the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan and \n     the National Response Plan. To ensure that this happens, APHA \n     supports the provisions in this bill that would require the \n     inclusion of mental health professionals in National Disaster \n     Medical System (NDMS) leadership and Disaster Medical \n     Assistance Teams.\n       To ensure that public health preparedness and response \n     activities are comprehensive and incorporate mental health \n     needs and realities, APHA supports the creation of a National \n     Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness \n     (NCPMHEP) outlined in your legislation. The NCPMHEP would be \n     able to use existing data to train emergency health \n     professionals in the provision of mental health services, \n     coordinate mental health preparedness and response activities \n     with federal, state and local partners and ensure that \n     trained professionals in mental health service delivery can \n     be identified and quickly mobilized.\n       Thank you for your attention to and leadership on this \n     important public health issue. We look forward to working \n     with you to move this legislation forward this Congress.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the largest \n     professional social work organization in the world with \n     150,000 members nationwide. NASW promotes, develops, and \n     protects the effective practice of social work services \n     throughout the country. NASW strongly supports the ``Public \n     Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2007,'' and is \n     pleased to endorse it. We greatly appreciate your attention \n     and that of Senator Domenici to the important but often \n     neglected needs of emergency preparedness in mental health \n     services. NASW is particularly pleased to see that social \n     workers and other behavioral health professions would have an \n     enhanced role in the Nation's disaster response teams through \n     the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS).\n       NASW, both nationally and in state chapters, was a resource \n     for the identification of trained mental health professionals \n     during the Hurricane Katrina aftermath. In addition, several \n     NASW state chapters worked with local Red Cross organization \n     to ensure that mental health services were made available to \n     hurricane victims in affected states. We recognize the need \n     to be prepared to provide mental health training in \n     emergencies and the steps that are required to ensure the \n     availability of a wide network of trained professionals with \n     the skills to provide emergency mental health evaluation and \n     triage. We also understand the importance of providing \n     emergency mental health services.\n       Your tireless efforts on behalf of consumers of behavioral \n     health services and professional social workers nationwide \n     are greatly appreciated by our members. We thank you for your \n     sponsorship of this legislation. NASW looks forward to \n     working with you on this and future issues of mutual concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carolyn Polowy,\n     General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Academy of\n\n\n                                Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the American Academy of \n     Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), I write in support \n     of the Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of \n     2007. The AACAP is a medical membership association \n     established by child and adolescent psychiatrists in 1953. \n     Now over 7,000 members strong, the AACAP is the leading \n     national medical association dedicated to treating and \n     improving the quality of life for the estimated 7-12 million \n     American youth under 18 years of age who are affected by \n     emotional, behavioral, developmental and mental disorders. \n     AACAP supports research, continuing medical education and \n     access to quality care.\n       Tragic events, such as September 11 and Hurricane Katrina \n     are devastating to the mental health of children and \n     adolescents and could have significant alterations in child \n     and adolescent development. Changes in environmental and \n     societal patterns of parenting, socialization, education, \n     maturation, acculturation, and technology due to a traumatic \n     event all have significant ramifications. Too often mental \n     health services for children are fragmented. This bill \n     addresses the need to coordinate the delivery of mental \n     health services in times of public health emergencies, which \n     AACAP recognizes as elements of the treatment process.\n       It is your continued leadership that will help ensure a \n     bright future for today's youth and the continued assurance \n     of mentally healthy Americans. We look forward to working \n     with you on this most important issue.

Res. 213\n\n       Whereas, despite advances in medical technology and \n     research, men continue to live an average of almost 6 years \n     less than women, and African-American men have the lowest \n     life expectancy;\n       Whereas all 10 of the 10 leading causes of death, as \n     defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     affect men at a higher percentage than women;\n       Whereas, between ages 45 and 54, men are 3 times more \n     likely than women to die of heart attacks;\n       Whereas men die of heart disease at almost twice the rate \n     of women;\n       Whereas men die of cancer at almost 1\\1/2\\ times the rate \n     of women;\n       Whereas testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers \n     in men aged 15 to 34, and, when detected early, has a 95 \n     percent survival rate;\n       Whereas the number of cases of colon cancer among men will \n     reach over 55,000 in 2007, and almost \\1/2\\ will die from the \n     disease;\n       Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate \n     cancer is 1 in 6;\n       Whereas the number of men developing prostate cancer will \n     reach over 218,890 in 2007, and almost 27,050 will die from \n     the disease;\n       Whereas African-American men in the United States have the \n     highest incidence in the world of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas significant numbers of health problems that affect \n     men, such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, colon \n     cancer, and infertility, could be detected and treated if \n     men's awareness of these problems was more pervasive;\n       Whereas more than \\1/2\\ of the elderly widows now living in \n     poverty were not poor before the death of their husbands, and \n     by age 100 women outnumber men 8 to 1;\n       Whereas educating both the public and health care providers \n     about the importance of early detection of male health \n     problems will result in reducing rates of mortality for these \n     diseases;\n       Whereas appropriate use of tests such as prostate specific \n     antigen (PSA) exams, blood pressure screens, and cholesterol \n     screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self-\n     testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result in \n     the detection of many of these problems in their early stages \n     and increase the survival rates to nearly 100 percent;\n       Whereas women are 100 percent more likely to visit the \n     doctor for annual examinations and preventive services than \n     men;\n       Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their \n     health center or physician for regular screening examinations \n     of male-related problems for a variety of reasons, including \n     fear, lack of health insurance, lack of information, and cost \n     factors;\n       Whereas National Men's Health Week was established by \n     Congress in 1994 and urged men and their families to engage \n     in appropriate health behaviors, and the resulting increased \n     awareness has improved health-related education and helped \n     prevent illness;\n       Whereas the Governors of over 45 States issue proclamations \n     annually declaring Men's Health Week in their States;\n       Whereas, since 1994, National Men's Health Week has been \n     celebrated each June by dozens of States, cities, localities, \n     public health departments, health care entities, churches, \n     and community organizations throughout the Nation, that \n     promote health awareness events focused on men and family;\n       Whereas the National Men's Health Week Internet website has \n     been established at www.menshealthweek.org and features \n     Governors' proclamations and National Men's Health Week \n     events;\n       Whereas men who are educated about the value that \n     preventive health can play in prolonging their lifespan and \n     their role as productive family members will be more likely \n     to participate in health screenings;\n       Whereas men and their families are encouraged to increase \n     their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, \n     regular exercise, and medical checkups;
