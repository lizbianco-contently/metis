Mr. President, for almost 13 years, it has been considered \npolitically dangerous to come to the floor of the Senate and describe a \nfresh approach to fixing health care in America. I am going to do that \nthis morning because I do not believe it is morally right for the \nSenate to duck on health care any longer.\n  During the Senate's long absence, the skyrocketing costs of health \ncare have hit American communities like a wrecking ball. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that health care premiums will rise 11 \npercent this year, several times the rate of inflation. In America, \nwith the world's best doctors, nurses, hospitals, and other providers, \nmany with health coverage believe they are just one more rate hike away \nfrom losing the coverage they have, and more than 40 million Americans \nhave little or no coverage at all.\n  Just about all of us are baffled about how to purchase the health \ncare that is best for us. In fact, it is easier to get information \nabout the cost and quality of washing machines than it is to get \ninformation about health care that can mean life or death. I believe \nthe combination of cost hikes, increases in chronic illness, our aging \nsociety, and the disadvantage American employers face in global \nmarkets, where their competitors spend little or nothing for health, \nmeans our current health system cannot be sustained.\n  Since health care has been poked and prodded for so many years, I \nbelieve it is time for diagnosis and treatment. As usual, it makes \nsense to start with a look at the financial bottom line. Go there, and \nit sure looks as if we Americans are spending enough money on medical \ncare. Last year, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, Americans spent $2.2 trillion on health care. There are about \n300 million of us. You divide 300 million into $2.2 trillion, and it \nwould be possible to send every man, woman, and child in America a \ncheck for more than $7,000. Here is another way to look at it: For the \nmoney Americans spent on health care last year, we could have hired a \ngroup of skilled physicians, paid each one of them $200,000 to care for \nseven families, and all Americans would have quality, affordable health \ncare. Whenever I mention those figures to a physicians group, it takes \nabout 30 seconds before a doctor stands up and says: Ron, where do I go \nto get my seven families?\n  My conclusion, after reviewing the numbers and expenditures for \nhealth care: America is spending enough money on medical services; it \nis just not spending the money in the right places.\n  While the Senate has taken a pass on fixing health care and \nredirecting misspent health dollars, several State leaders have stepped \nforward. In my view, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mitt Romney deserve \nsubstantial credit just for trying to lead on health care. I will \ndiscuss in a minute why I do not agree with their decision to continue \nthe link between health insurance and employment, but Governors \nSchwarzenegger and Romney deserve America's thanks for making it clear \nthat they will not sit quietly by while Washington, DC, slow-walks \nhealth care.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend to help State \nofficials obtain the special waivers in Federal health programs they \nneed to make Federal dollars in their States stretch further for health \ncare. Having already stated that I believe enough money is being spent \non medical services, I am especially interested in helping the States \nmake better use of their existing funds. As a result of the new \ninitiatives in California, Massachusetts, and other States, some in the \nCongress believe the next few years should be spent watching how the \nStates fare in their efforts. Meaning well, these Congress people \nbelieve our role in the Congress should primarily be to ship more \nFederal money to the States for their reforms and then pretty much call \nit a day. Respectfully, I disagree. I believe there is no possible way \nthe States can fix health care because the States did not create the \nmajor problems in American health care. Who did? The Federal \nGovernment, the big spender of health dollars in America, the architect \nof the policies now driving American health care toward implosion.\n\n  Here is how it happened. More than 60 years ago, with wage and price \ncontrols in effect, our employers found that they could get good \nworkers by giving them health care benefits. Employer-based health \ncoverage was born and generously greased by the adoption of Federal tax \npolicies that make employer-based health coverage a deductible expense \nfor employers and a tax-free benefit for workers. Soon most workers \ncame to get their health coverage through their employer. It became the \nnorm for talented workers to quickly ask prospective employers: Say, \ntell me about your health package.\n  Today, these Federal tax breaks total more than $200 billion \nannually. The cost, however, involves more than dollars. These tax \nbreaks go disproportionately to the wealthiest in America and subsidize \ninefficiency to boot. A high-flying CEO at a major corporation can \nwrite off the cost of Cadillac health coverage or even getting a \ndesigner smile for his face, while the folks at the corner hardware \nstore lack company health coverage and get nothing. With employer-\nsponsored health coverage, an individual worker is largely in the dark \nabout whether they have been overcharged for health care, and the Tax \nCode allows for a writeoff for wasteful spending. These Federal tax \npolicies that reward regressive practices and inefficient health \nspending are taking a large and growing toll.\n  For example, an increasing number of the uninsured work at small \nbusinesses, like the hardware store that fares so poorly under the \nFederal Tax Code. Because these small businesses cannot afford health \ncare for their workers, these workers often ignore their illnesses \nuntil they can bear it no longer. Their next stop--the hospital \nemergency room, where the medical bills generated by the uninsured are \noften passed on to the insured and to taxpayers.\n  My next picture shows where we are headed with the employer-based \nhealth coverage. In an era where such cost shifting is widespread and \nsome companies spend almost as much on health care as they make in \nprofit, employer-based health coverage is melting away similar to this \npopsicle on the summer sidewalk in August.\n  If PricewaterhouseCoopers is right and health premiums rise another \n11 percent this year, those with employer-based coverage will face \nanother round of big copayments for their health care, more \ndeductibles, and additional benefit reduction this year. Their choice \nis likely to be worse coverage or no coverage.\n  Recently, a woman in her fifties came to one of my town hall meetings \nin Oregon and said:\n\n       I just hope my employer can keep offering health benefits \n     and I can hang in there until I get Medicare.\n\n  I believe this Senate ought to act when hard-working Americans go to \nbed at night worried about the prospect of losing their health coverage \nwhen they get up in the morning. Now, you could argue that 60 years ago \nemployer-based health coverage made sense. That was before U.S. \nemployers faced determined global competition, U.S. workers changed \njobs seven or eight times by the age of 35, and American society became \nmore mobile. It surely doesn't make sense today.\n  I believe you cannot fix American health care without changing our \nsystem of employer-based health coverage and the Federal tax breaks \nthat lubricate it. I believe you cannot fix American health care \nwithout changing the incentives that drive our choices and our \nbehavior. Not a State in the Union has the power to bring this about. \nWe in the Senate do.\n  In a few days, after some additional consultation with colleagues, I \nwill introduce legislation that offers a fresh and different approach \nto fixing health care in America. I call the legislation the Healthy \nAmericans Act, and it is based on four judgments about health care I \nhave made.\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\n  First, Democrats have been correct in saying that to fix health care \neverybody must be covered. This concept, of course, is known as \nuniversal coverage. Republicans, in my view, have been correct in \nsaying there must be more personal responsibility and personal \ninvolvement in making health care choices than there is today.\n  Second, there is a model for fixing health care that every single \nSenator--every Member of Congress--knows something about. It is the \nsystem that serves Members of Congress and their families, offering the \nMembers of this body high-quality, affordable, private health coverage \nwith lots of choice.\n  Third, America doesn't have health care at all; it has sick care. For \nexample, Medicare Part A will write checks for thousands of dollars so \nthat a senior can be treated in the hospital after they have had a \nheart attack or a stroke. Medicare Part B--the part of the program that \ncovers outpatient services--provides no incentives for changing the \nbehavior that led to the chronic illness and landed the senior citizen \nin the hospital. Certainly, it is clear that preventing disease, not \njust treating disease, must be a bigger part of America's health care \nfuture.\n  Fourth, in my view, you cannot fix American health care if you hurt \nthe middle class who have coverage in order to help those who do not. \nTo fix American health care, you must prove that all Americans have the \nopportunity to get ahead, starting with their first paycheck under a \nnew health care plan--the Healthy Americans Act that I have drafted and \nhas been posed at my Web site at wyden.senate.gov. Included at this \nsite is a written evaluation of the legislation, done by the Lewin \nGroup. The Lewin Group has been called the gold standard of health care \nactuarial data.\n  Their evaluation is clear. Under the Healthy Americans Act, all \nAmericans can be guaranteed a lifetime of private health coverage, at \nleast as good as their Member of Congress receives, for no more than \nour country spends on health care today. In addition, fixing American \nhealth care can be done more quickly than imagined--within 2 years \nafter a reform law is passed--and produce more than $4 billion in \nsavings in the first year, while expanding coverage.\n  The next chart is especially important because it shows that the \nHealthy Americans Act will slow the rate of growth in health care \nspending by almost $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is an expert in foreign affairs and our \npolicy with Iraq. I am sure that as he looks at the chart, he can see \nthat, according to the Lewin Group, the amount of money that would be \nsaved in slowing the rate of growth in health care spending is several \ntimes--threefold--the amount of money our country has spent on the war \nin Iraq.\n  Mr. President, it doesn't take long to explain how the Healthy \nAmericans Act works. It starts by going where Arnold Schwarzenegger and \nMitt Romney would not. It cuts the link between health insurance and \nemployment altogether. Under the Healthy Americans Act, businesses \npaying for employee health premiums are required to increase their \nworkers' paychecks by the amount they spent last year on their health \ncoverage. Federal tax law is changed to hold the worker harmless for \nthe extra compensation, and the worker is required to purchase private \ncoverage through an exchange in their State that forces insurance \ncompanies to offer simplified, standardized coverage, and prohibits \nthem from engaging in price discrimination.\n  Now, requiring employers to cash out their health premiums, as I \npropose in the Healthy Americans Act, is good for both employers and \nworkers. With health premiums going up 11 percent this year, employers \nare going to be glad to be exempt from these increases. With the extra \nmoney in their paycheck, workers have a new incentive to shop for their \nhealth care and hold down their cost. If a worker in Virginia can save \na few hundred dollars on their health care purchase, they can use that \nmoney so that one of the constituents of the Presiding Officer can be \non their way to Oregon to get in some sensational fishing.\n  In addition, the Healthy Americans Act is easy to administer and \nguarantees lifetime health security. Once you have signed up with a \nplan through an exchange in the State in which you live, that is it; \nyou have completed the administrative process. Even if you lose your \njob or you go bankrupt, you can never have your coverage taken away. \nSign up, and the premium you pay for the plan and all of the \nadministrative activities are handled through the tax system. For those \nwho cannot afford private coverage, the Healthy Americans Act \nsubsidizes their purchases.\n  Businesses that have not been able to afford health coverage for \ntheir workers, under the new approach, will pay a fee--one that is \ntiered to their size and revenue, with some paying as little as 2 \npercent of the national average premium amount per worker for that \nbasic benefit package. Mike Roach, the owner of the 8-person Paloma \nclothing firm in Portland, OR, is a 30-year member of the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, and he was instrumental in \nensuring that this legislation was small business friendly every step \nof the way.\n  Mr. President, that is pretty much it, in terms of how the Healthy \nAmericans Act actually works. It will be easy to administer, locally \ncontrolled, with guaranteed coverage as good as your Member of Congress \ngets; and on top of it, there is a model for delivering it that the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and everybody else in this body knows \nabout. Page 12 of the Lewin report on my Web site shows how the Healthy \nAmericans Act expands coverage for millions of people, guaranteeing \nhealth benefits as good as their Member of Congress gets, while saving \n$4.5 billion in health spending in the first year. Money is saved by \nreducing the administrative costs of insurance, reducing cost shifting, \nand preventing those needless hospital emergency room visits. Also, \nthere are substantial incentives that come about because insurance \ncompanies would have to compete for the business of consumers, who \nwould have a new incentive to hold down health costs, which I have \nalready described as the Virginian's opportunity to go fishing in \nOregon.\n  There are other parts of the Healthy Americans Act I wish to describe \nbriefly.\n  As the name of the legislation suggests, I believe strongly that \nfixing American health care requires a new ethic of health care \nprevention, a sharp new focus in keeping our citizens well, and trying \nto keep them from falling victim to skyrocketing rates of increase in \ndiabetes, heart attack, and strokes.\n  Spending on these chronic illnesses is soaring, and it is especially \nsad to see so many children and seniors fall victim to these diseases. \nYet, many Government programs and private insurance devote most of \ntheir attention to treating Americans after they are ill and give short \nshrift to wellness.\n  Under the Healthy Americans Act, there will be for the first time \nsignificant new incentives for all Americans to stay healthy. They are \nvoluntary incentives, but ones that I think will make a real difference \nin building a national new ethic of wellness and health care \nprevention.\n  Parents who enroll children in wellness programs will be eligible for \ndiscounts in their own premiums. Instead of mandating that parents take \nyoungsters to various health programs--and maybe they do and maybe they \ndon't--the Healthy Americans Act says when a parent takes a child to \none of those wellness programs, the parent would be eligible to get a \ndiscount on the parent's health premiums.\n  Under the Healthy Americans Act, employers who financially support \nhealth care prevention for their workers get incentives for doing that \nas well. Medicare is authorized to reduce outpatient Part B premiums so \nas to reward seniors trying to reduce their cholesterol, lose weight, \nor decrease the risk of stroke. It has never been done before. For \nexample, Part B of Medicare, the outpatient part, doesn't offer any \nincentives for older Americans to change their behavior. Everybody pays \nthe same Medicare Part B premium right now. The Healthy Americans Act \nproposes we change that and ensures that if a senior from Virginia or \nOregon or elsewhere is involved in a wellness program, in health care \nprevention efforts, like smoking cessation, they could get a lower Part \nB premium for doing that.\n  The preventive health efforts I have described are promoted through \nnew\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\nvoluntary incentives under the Healthy Americans Act, not heavy-handed \nmandates. Under the Healthy Americans Act, there is no national nanny \nestablished under the legislation to watch who is hitting the snack \nfood bowl.\n  What this legislation says is--let's make it more attractive for \npeople to stay healthy, to change their behaviors, to promote the kind \nof wellness practices we all know about but somehow don't seem to find \ntime to actually get done in our hectic schedules.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the Healthy Americans Act does not \nharm those who have coverage in order to help those who do nothing. The \nlegislation makes clear that all Americans retain the right to purchase \nas much health care coverage as they want. All Americans will enjoy \ntrue health security with the Healthy Americans Act, a lifetime \nguarantee of coverage at least as good as their Member of Congress \nreceives.\n  Most American families will obtain this coverage with either their \npremiums reduced from what they pay today or for less than a dollar a \nday more. That can all be seen in the Lewin chart as No. 10 at my Web \nsite. In addition, all Americans benefit from the reduced \nadministrative costs the legislation produces, the insurance reforms, \nand, of course, the new focus on prevention.\n  I am now going to explain briefly how care for the poor is handled \nunder the Healthy Americans Act and why this is good for both low-\nincome people and taxpayers. This is especially important in light of a \nrecent article in the health policy journal, ``Health Affairs.''\n  This article points out that more than half of the Nation's uninsured \nare ineligible for public programs such as Medicaid, but do not have \nthe money to purchase coverage for themselves.\n  At present, for most poor people to receive health benefits, they \nhave to go out and try to squeeze themselves into one of the categories \nthat entitles them to care. So what we have, Mr. President, in \nVirginia, in Oregon, and elsewhere, is citizens trying to crunch \nthemselves into one of these boxes, one of these categories that might \nmake them eligible for health care in Virginia or Oregon.\n  As former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber has noted, there are more than \n20 different categories of Medicaid. Administrating all of this takes \nfunds, in my view, that ought to be spent caring for poor folks in \nAmerica.\n  Under the Healthy Americans Act, low-income people will receive \nprivate health coverage, coverage that is as good as a Member of \nCongress gets, automatically. Like everyone else, they will sign up \nthrough the exchange in their State. When they are working, the \npremiums they owe are withheld from their paycheck. If they lose their \njob, there is an automatic adjustment in their withholding.\n  In addition, under the Healthy Americans Act, it will be more \nattractive for doctors and other health care providers to care for the \npoor. Those who are now in underfunded programs, such as Medicaid, are \ngoing to be able to have private insurance that pays doctors and other \nproviders commercial rates which are traditionally higher than Medicaid \nreimbursement rates.\n  Because low-income children and the disabled are so vulnerable, if \nMedicaid provides benefits that are not included in the kind of package \nMembers of Congress get, then those low-income folks would be entitled \nto get the additional benefits from the Medicaid program in their \nState.\n  I am now going to explain how Medicare is strengthened by the Healthy \nAmericans Act.\n  As the largest Federal health program, Medicare's financial status is \nfar more fragile than Social Security. Two-thirds of Medicare spending \nis now devoted to about 5 percent of the elderly population. Those are \nthe seniors with chronic illness and the seniors who need compassionate \nend-of-life health care. The Healthy Americans Act strengthens Medicare \nfor both seniors and taxpayers in both of these areas.\n  In addition to reducing Medicare's outpatient premiums for seniors \nwho adopt healthy lifestyles and reduce the prospect of chronic \nillness, primary care reimbursements for doctors and other providers \nget a boost under the Healthy Americans Act. Good primary care for \nseniors also reduces the likelihood of chronic illness that goes \nunmanaged. This reimbursement boost is sure to increase access to care \nfor seniors--and I see them all over, in Oregon and elsewhere--who are \nhaving difficulty finding doctors who will treat them.\n  To better meet the needs of seniors suffering from multiple chronic \nillnesses, the Healthy Americans Act promotes better coordination of \ntheir care by allowing a special management fee to providers who better \nassist seniors with these especially important services.\n  Hospice law is changed so that seniors who are terminally ill do not \nhave to give up care that allows them to treat their illness in order \nto get hospice. In addition, the Healthy Americans Act empowers all our \ncitizens wishing to make their own end-of-life care decisions.\n  The legislation requires hospitals and other facilities to give \npatients the choice of stating in writing how they would want their \ndoctor and other health care providers to handle various end-of-life \ncare decisions.\n  The tragic case of the late Terri Schiavo came before the Senate \nbefore the distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate had joined \nthis body, but I was particularly struck during that debate and \nafterwards how strongly the American people feel about making sure that \nthe patient and not Government gets to drive all of the decisions \nsurrounding their end-of-life care. Under the Healthy Americans Act, \nthat would be the norm rather than the exception.\n  In writing this legislation, I spent a lot of time looking back--\nlooking back literally over 60 years--since Harry Truman tried to fix \nhealth care in the 81st Congress in 1945. I tried to make sure, \nparticularly, that the lessons of 1994 were ones the Senate would pick \nup on and make sure that the same mistakes were not committed again.\n  For example, in 1994, the last time this Senate considered fixing \nhealth care, the principal piece of legislation before the Senate was \n1,369 pages long. The Healthy Americans Act posted at my Web site saves \na lot of Oregon trees by coming in about 1,200 pages shorter.\n  In 1994, getting to universal coverage was, in effect, put before \nsecuring the savings to responsibly finance an expansion of coverage. \nThe Healthy Americans Act, as noted in the Lewin report, generates \nbillions of dollars in savings in the first year as the legislation is \nimplemented.\n  In 1994, the principal method of financing universal coverage was an \nemployer mandate. The Healthy Americans Act requires no such employer \nmandate, provides financial relief for employers competing in tough \nglobal markets, and still ensures that every business takes some \nmeasure for financing health care in a way that is going to allow those \nbusinesses to be competitive in tough global markets. In 1994, there \nwas never a coalition of employers, union leaders, and patient \nadvocates behind a specific piece of legislation. Now, Andy Stern, \npresident of the 1.8 million-worker Service Employees International \nUnion; Steve Burd, CEO of Safeway with more than 200,000 workers, \npatient advocates representing various points of view, and employers of \nall sizes have joined behind the Healthy Americans Act.\n\n  There is also a moral question I would like the Senate to consider. \nGiven what I have just outlined, how can this Senate justify denying \nall Americans health care coverage as good as Members of Congress \nreceive? The Lewin report proves it can be done--proves it can be done \nwithout spending more money than the country spends now and, in fact, \ncan be done saving more than $4 billion in the very first year.\n  There is a model for putting reforms in place: the system enjoyed by \nall the Senators serving in this body today. Fixing health care under \nthe Healthy Americans Act will reduce administrative hassle and expense \nand allow all our citizens finally--finally--to go to bed at night \nwithout fear of losing essential medical care.\n  I want 2007 to be the year when the Senate, as well as the various \nState governments, step up on health care. The States deserve our \nsupport, but they cannot possibly remedy the health problems created by \nFederal leaders in this city more than 60 years ago. The Senate can \nprovide this remedy. Here on this floor, the Senate can\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\nacknowledge that the employer-based system of health coverage that \nworked back in 1945 no longer makes sense for 2007. We can acknowledge, \nas I have done today, that I think Democrats are right about making \nsure that everybody gets covered and Republicans are right about \npromoting personal responsibility and more personal involvement in \nmaking health care choices. We can end 13 years of ducking on health \ncare, 13 years of slapping Band-Aids on health care, and roll up our \nsleeves and go to work. A lot of it--and I know the distinguished \nPresident of the Senate has been to many community meetings in his home \nState of Virginia--simply means following up on what constituents say \nat home.\n  Every time health care comes up when I have community meetings \nsomebody usually says, ``Well, I guess we ought to go to what is called \na single payer system. You know, one where the Government essentially \nruns it and you don't have these private insurance companies.''\n  After somebody at a town meeting says we ought to have a single payer \nsystem, somebody else says, ``No, we already voted on that.'' In fact, \nOregonians did. They voted against a single payer system by more than 3 \nto 1 just a few years ago.\n  But the other speakers say, ``We don't want all that Government. We \ndon't want the Government to make all the decisions.''\n  So after a bit, somebody raises their hand at one of my townhall \nmeetings and says, ``Ron, what we want is what you Members of Congress \nhave. We want health care coverage like you have.''\n  Then everybody in the room shakes their head in agreement.\n  So much of what I propose in the Healthy Americans Act comes from \nthose townhall meetings that I hold in all of Oregon's 36 counties. I \nhave an approach that guarantees benefits like Members of Congress \nhave; that is delivered in the same way; and that can actually be \nimplemented with the very first paycheck that a worker gets under the \nnew system.\n  Part of the reason I have written this legislation as I have has been \nto ensure that the Congress and the Federal Government could pick up \nsome lost credibility on health care. My sense is that after the debate \nof 1994 on health care in America a lot of Americans said: The United \nStates Congress can't figure out how to put together a two-car parade \nlet alone a reform that involves one-seventh of the American economy.\n  That is why I have written this legislation so it can be understood \nand the effects can be seen from the time the very first paychecks go \nout under the legislation. The legislation works in a way that will be \nattractive to both workers and employers.\n  So I have spent a lot of time listening to my constituents as I \nbrought together the various principles that are contained in the \nHealthy Americans Act. I know colleagues in this body have other ideas.\n  I would like to wrap up by simply saying I think health care has been \nstudied enough. It has been commissioned. It has been blue-ribboned. It \nhas been the subject of white papers, blue papers, pink papers, papers \nof every possible description. It is time for the Senate to act. The \nSenate has ducked on health care for almost 13 years. Health care and \nIraq are the driving issues that our citizens care about most. It is \ntime to fix health care, and I think with the Healthy Americans Act, \nthis body can get the job done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am going to proceed in morning \nbusiness, but I want to welcome the new Senator from Virginia to the \nSenate. I look forward to serving with him. I am sorry that maybe the \nSenator's first time being in the chair he has to listen to my speech, \nbut I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak to you and Members \nof the body and the people of the United States about a very important \nissue that is going to be coming before us. This is an issue that I \nhave been speaking about for the last several days on the floor. In \nfact, I think 4 days last week I did. I talked about the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit and the so-called prohibition on Government \nnegotiation with drugmakers for low prices. I spent time doing that \nbecause people need to understand that some proposals could have \ndrastic consequences, not only for Medicare and the beneficiaries of \nMedicare but also for anyone else who buys prescription medicine.\n  I want to make this very clear because when you are talking about \nseniors and the disabled on Medicare, and on prescription drugs, you \nmight get the impression that we make a decision here, and the only \npeople it is going to affect are those on Medicare. But I hope I made \nit very clear last week, and I am going to go over this again today.\n  In other words, if we change Medicare in this instance dealing with \nthe prices of prescription drugs, it will increase prices of \nprescription drugs for everybody. It is not going to impact just those \non Medicare, the decisions we make. I have said it before, and I say it \nagain: Having the Government negotiate drug prices for Medicare might \nbe a good sound bite, but it is not sound policy if it is going to \nincrease the price of prescription drugs for everybody regardless of \nage in the United States.\n  I think the House bill, which is numbered H.R. 4 and passed the House \nlast week, very definitely falls into that category. It may be a good \nsound bite. It may be very politically beneficial. But a good sound \nbite is not good policy. It will be bad for Medicare beneficiaries and \nother consumers of prescription drugs.\n  That outcome was voiced by witnesses just last week when they \nappeared before the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by the Senator \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus.\n  At that hearing, one of the witnesses, Dr. Fiona Scott Morton, a \nprofessor of economics at Yale University, made a key point about the \nsize of the Medicare market and when you deal with the price that \nMedicare recipients pay for drugs, the fact that it has negative \nconsequences for everybody else in America.\n  She pointed out that of course we all want to obtain discounts for \ndrugs for seniors. But she said:\n\n       With close to half of all spending being generated by those \n     seniors, whatever price they pay will tend to be the average \n     price in the market.\n\n  Her point is, if you are half of the market, the math makes it \nvirtually impossible for your prices to be below average. Dr. Scott \nMorton said that because Medicare is so large, if drugmakers had to \ngive it the lowest price they give any customer, they would have a \nstrong incentive to increase their prices for everybody else.\n  Professor Scott Morton also stated:\n\n       This approach to controlling prices harms all other \n     consumers of pharmaceuticals in the United States and is bad \n     policy.\n\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\n\n  I pointed out how Part D has already given seniors, on the 25 drugs \nmost used by seniors, 35-percent lower prices than we anticipated when \nwe wrote the bill. While it is great to be doing things for seniors, \nthere is no free lunch. Everybody, regardless of age, will pay more for \nprescription drugs. Do you want that to happen? Do you want those \nunintended consequences to happen?\n  Then we had another witness at the hearing held by Senator Baucus \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee last week. It was a representative \nof the Government Accountability Office who talked about its Year 2000 \nreport on this very issue, and echoed Professor Scott Morton's view. \nRemember, in 2000 the General Accounting Office concluded:\n\n       Mandating that federal prices for outpatient prescription \n     drugs be extended to a large group of purchasers such as \n     Medicare beneficiaries could lower the prices they pay, but \n     raise prices for others.\n\n  That is from a nonpartisan Government agency working for the Congress \nof the United States called the Government Accountability Office.\n  One thing we keep hearing is that Medicare should not pay more than \nthe Veterans' Administration pays. We had another witness, Professor \nRichard Frank of Harvard University, who said that if Medicare got the \nsame prices the Veterans' Administration gets for drug prices--if that \nhappened--it would likely raise Veterans' Administration prices for our \nveterans for all drugs. Do you want to hurt veterans with these \nunintended consequences of some of these ideas that are floating around \nthis new Congress?\n  Then we had other panelists. As they listened to Dr. Frank's \nresponse, other panelists nodded in agreement. Talk about unintended \nconsequences, do you know who else agrees with these professors who \nhave been testifying before our committee? I point to the Military \nOrder of the Purple Heart. In a letter to Members of Congress, the \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart expressed its concern about the \nimpact that extending Veterans' Administration prices to Medicare could \nhave on veterans. In fact, they stated that several veterans \norganizations passed formal resolutions opposing legislation to extend \nthe Veterans' Administration prices to Medicare because it would \nthreaten Veterans' Administration's current discounts.\n  What is the end result? Higher drug prices for those who get their \ndrugs from the Veterans' Administration.\n  Another key point made at last week's hearing before the Senate \nFinance Committee was that it is not simply about the number of people \nfor whom you are buying drugs. In response to a question I asked \nProfessor Scott Morton, the professor said it doesn't matter whether \nyou negotiate on behalf of 1 million people or 43 million people--which \nis the number of senior citizens in this country. What matters is what \nleverage you have and how you use that leverage. And if you don't have \na fundamental tool, and that would be the formulary, you have no \nleverage over drugmakers. A formulary is a list of drugs that a plan \nwill cover.\n  Here is what Professor Scott Morton said would happen if someone \nnegotiating drug prices couldn't have a formulary:\n\n       Each manufacturer would know that, fundamentally, Medicare \n     must purchase all products. The Medicare ``negotiator'' would \n     have no bargaining leverage, and therefore, simply allowing \n     bargaining on its own would not lead to substantially lower \n     prices.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from Professor Scott Morton.\n  Then we had a Mr. Edmund Haislmaier, a fellow at the Heritage \nFoundation, talk about the limits of bulk purchasing power alone. In \nhis written testimony he said:\n\n        . . . volume purchasing encourages manufacturer \n     discounting, it is not, in and of itself, sufficient to \n     extract large discounts. Manufacturers will only offer \n     substantial discounts if the buyer combines the ``carrot'' of \n     volume with the ``stick'' of being able to substitute one \n     supplier's goods with those of another.\n\n  In drug negotiation, that stick he is talking about--Mr. Haislmaier \nis talking about--is the formulary.\n  Here is what is wrong with the House bill that just passed. It \nprohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using a \nformulary. Thus the stick that is necessary, that the Veterans' \nAdministration uses to drive down the price of drugs, is not even in \nthe bill that passed the House that is supposed to guarantee senior \ncitizens lower drug prices.\n\n  For all of their talk about getting savings from Government \nnegotiations, the House Democrats took away a key tool to get lower \nprices. That was a key lesson we also learned from last week's Finance \nCommittee hearing that Senator Baucus chaired.\n  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office said about H.R. 4. Here \nI have a chart. The bottom line of it is that it would have negligible \neffect on Federal spending. To emphasize that, I want to read it all. \nFor the benefit of new Members, I point out we will soon find out that \nwhen you refer to the Congressional Budget Office, it is like God on \nCapitol Hill. When the Congressional Budget Office says something costs \nsomething--and you might have intellectually honest, good reasons for \ndisagreeing with it--the Congressional Budget Office is always right. \nIf there is a point of order against it, then you get 60 votes. The 60-\nvote requirement around here almost makes anything or anybody or any \nagency a god, because it is difficult to get 60 votes. So CBO generally \nstands. Sometimes they are overridden but not very often. So this god \nof CBO:\n\n       CBO estimates that H.R. 4--\n\n  I want to emphasize, that is the bill that just passed the House last \nweek, a Democratic bill--\n\n     would have negligible effect on Federal spending because we \n     anticipate that the Secretary--\n\nmeaning the Secretary of HHS--\n\n     would be unable to negotiate prices across a broad range of \n     covered Part D drugs that are more effective than those \n     obtained by PDPs under current law.\n\n  You heard it during the campaign. You heard it a long time before the \ncampaign. If we do away with this noninterference clause, we are going \nto get drugs cheaper for the citizens. This is supposedly on top of the \n35 percent of the average reduction in the price of the 25 drugs most \noften used by senior citizens, and the god of Capitol Hill says there \nis not going to be the savings. That is not only for the people who pay \nout of their pockets some portion for drugs, but also saving the \ntaxpayers money.\n  I am going to quote another thing from the Congressional Budget \nOffice that gets back to this carrot and stick, the stick being the \nformulary that is used by the Veterans' Administration to get the low \nprices they get--the same pattern that proponents of doing away with \nthe noninterference clause want to follow, to get lower prices for \nsenior citizens, and that is the formulary. The Veterans' \nAdministration has a formulary, but the House bill passed last week \ndoes not have a national formulary, so you do not have a stick to \naccomplish the goals.\n\n       Without the authority to establish a formulary, we believe \n     the Secretary would not be able to encourage the use of \n     particular drugs by Part D beneficiaries, and as a result \n     would lack the leverage to obtain significant discounts in \n     his negotiations with drug manufacturers.\n\n  It is pretty clear that what we are being told you are going to get \nas a result of the House-passed bill is not happening. So I would quote \nanother independent actuary--maybe not quite the god that CBO is, but \nthe actuaries at the Center for Medicare Services, the agency that \noversees the Medicare drug benefit. They said about the same thing \nabout H.R. 4 not having a formulary.\n\n       Although the bill would require the Secretary to negotiate \n     with drug manufacturers regarding drug prices, the inability \n     to drive market share via the establishment of a formulary or \n     development of a preferred tier significantly undermines the \n     effectiveness of negotiations.\n\n  Whether you are CBO, responsible to the Congress of the United \nStates, working for the Congress of the United States, or whether you \nare the actuaries downtown at the Center for Medicare Services working \nfor the President of the United States--and maybe actuaries are fairly \nindependent--but the point being they came to the same conclusion, that \nthe tool that is necessary to accomplish what Democrats say they want \nto accomplish by doing away with the noninterference clause to \nnegotiate prices with drug companies isn't going to be effective \nbecause the tool to be effective is not in their legislation.\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\n  Let me point out the key downside of having the Secretary establish a \nnational formulary in my next chart. Fewer drugs would be covered. I \nhave made a point about keeping the Government bureaucrat out of the \nmedicine cabinet, not to be the person between the doctor and the \npatient. We set up, as a principle in the Medicare bill, to do it \ndifferently than the Veterans' Administration because the Veterans' \nAdministration did not allow every therapy to be available to a \nveteran. A bureaucrat makes a decision that a veteran can have this, \nbut a veteran cannot have that, the Government will not buy this. We \ndid not want the senior citizens to be treated that way, so every \ntherapy has to be available.\n  This chart shows only 30 percent of the drugs covered by Medicare \nwill be available to seniors if done the way the Veterans' \nAdministration does it. Do you want to get the complaints from the \nseniors of America, as I sometimes get from veterans? They come to my \ntown meetings saying: My doctor says I should not take this pill \nbecause there are side effects, I should take this one. Why won't the \nVeterans' Administration let me buy this pill? The doctor said I ought \nto have it.\n  I can go to the Veterans' Administration and advocate for this \nveteran, but it is not a sure thing. We do not have to worry about that \nwith seniors.\n  Let me sum up two important points from the Senate Committee on \nFinance hearing we had last week and from the experts from the \nCongressional Budget Office and the chief actuary of Medicare.\n  First, giving Medicare the lowest price a drugmaker gives any \npurchaser, whether that is a private plan or the Veterans' \nAdministration, will increase prices of prescription drugs for everyone \nelse in America. That means higher prices for working Americans and for \nsmall businesses. Second, in summary, the ability to use a formulary to \nnegotiate means you have to be able to tell a drugmaker: If you do not \ngive me a good price, I will pick another drug to put in my formulary. \nIf you do not believe all the experts, if you do not believe all of the \npeople that have studied this over a long period of time, whom are you \ngoing to believe?\n  I remind everyone from where the prohibition on negotiations came. We \nhave 10 new Members of the Senate, and a lot of them will not be \nfamiliar with the genesis of the noninterference clause. The opponents \nof the drug benefits seem to conveniently forget their own bills had \nthe same language and that they supported a benefit run by private \nplans. My next chart demonstrates this better.\n  The prohibition of Government negotiation--what is referred to as a \nnoninterference clause--first appeared in Democratic bills; in total, \nseven bills introduced and supported by 34 Senate Democrats and more \nthan 100 House Democrats had the prohibition in these legislation. On \ntop of that, many of the Members who are now twisting that language \ncosponsored that very legislation.\n  I will not emphasize every Democratic Congressman or Senator who \nintroduced these seven bills, but I will emphasize President Clinton, \nin 1999, when he proposed from the White House a plan for prescription \ndrugs for seniors. The plan proposed by President Clinton took the same \napproach. President Clinton said so many good things that I didn't have \nto think up new things, just repeat what President Clinton said about \nsaving money and the ability of plans to negotiate and save money, and \nto make sure there was a wide range of drugs available for our seniors.\n  We have a good basis for including in our bipartisan bill that passed \nin 2003 things that Democrats had in their bills before we passed our \nbill. I don't see any of them embarrassed about that fact even while \nthey go on talking about how bad the provision is now that it's in a \nbipartisan bill. Plans are negotiating for seniors, and those \nnegotiations are reducing the cost of the 25 most often used drugs by \nseniors on an average of 35 percent. President Clinton said so many \ngood things that I don't have to say them. I wish Members would read \nsome of the things President Clinton said about this.\n  Continuing to summarize, the Secretary does not need the authority to \nnegotiate and a national formulary is a bad idea. Competition among \nthese plans that seniors are now joining--91 percent of the seniors \nhave prescription drug coverage; the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nis a voluntary program; they do not have to get in it if they don't \nwant to--had led to lower drug prices for beneficiaries and, more \nimportantly, lower costs for taxpayers and the States. This is saving \ntaxpayers $189 billion. I will cover that in a minute.\n  Premiums are lower than they were estimated to be. I talked of lower \ndrug prices, but now I am talking about the premiums to join the plans. \nBefore 2006, the Medicare chief actuary estimated the average monthly \npremium would be $37. In fact, we struggled to make sure, when we wrote \nthe Medicare bill, that the premium would be between $35 and $40 a \nmonth because we felt above that there would be resistance to joining, \nand we would not have 91 percent of the people in. We planned on $35 to \n$40. The chief actuary said $37. But because of competition, it ended \nup being only $23 in 2006. In the year 2007, premiums are going to \naverage $22. Competition is working.\n  The net cost to the Federal Government is also lower than expected. \nThis is that $189 billion. Last week, the official Medicare actuary \nannounced the net 10-year cost has dropped by $189 over the original \nbudget window used when the Medicare Modernization Act was enacted. \nThat is a 30-percent drop in the actual costs compared to what was \nprojected. Competition is working.\n  I ask any Member how often a Federal program comes in under cost. We \nalways speak of overruns. Every Federal program is costing more than we \nanticipate when we pass it. Overruns do not seem to be the sin they \nought to be. We have a program $189 billion under what we thought it \nwould cost, so we have an underrun. We never hear of that. We could not \nget the lower prices and lower costs unless the prescription drug plans \nare, in fact, what we anticipate they would be--strong negotiators with \nthe drugmakers. Competition is working.\n  I know the opponents of the drug benefit will likely keep up their \nattacks on the program. They have pandered through the last election \nand they have to deliver. What are they delivering? They are delivering \na pig in a poke. They may be delivering something very negative for the \nseniors of America. I have been working hard this week to give people \nimportant facts that have been left out of the debate on negotiation of \ndrug prices.\n  The plain and simple fact is that competition among the plans is \nworking. The Medicare plans are delivering the benefits to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. These private sector plans have the experience in \nnegotiating better drug prices. As I pointed out last week, for 50 \nyears, Federal employees, under the Federal Employee Health Benefit \nProgram, have been doing it this way. It has successfully worked. That \nis why we adopted it for seniors.\n  These Medicare negotiators have proven their ability to get lower \ndrug prices. The Medicare plans are negotiating with drug companies \nusing drug formularies within the rules set by law. These plans have to \nbe approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Medicare \nbeneficiaries have access to the drugs they need and 70 percent of the \ndrugs that are out there under the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nare not offered by the Veterans' Administration to veterans.\n  I have an example from the ALS Association, better known as the \nassociation dealing with Lou Gehrig's disease. Here is what they said \nabout repealing the noninterference clause in a January 4 letter to \nMembers of Congress:\n\n       The elimination of the noninterference provision will have \n     particularly cruel consequences for people with ALS. It means \n     that even if a new drug is developed to treat ALS, many \n     patients likely will not have access to it. That's because \n     price controls can limit access to the latest technologies.\n\n  The letter continues to say that individuals with ALS:\n\n     . . . will either be forced to forego treatment, or only have \n     access to less effective treatment options--ones that may add \n     a few months to their lives but not ones that will add years \n     to their lives.\n\n  Just for the record, drugs to treat ALS are covered under the \nMedicare drug benefit right now.\n  I end with a statement I have so often used in the last week: If it \nain't broke, don't fix it.\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           The Amyotrophic Lateral\n\n\n                                        Sclerosis Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 4, 2007.\n       Dear Member of Congress: I am writing on behalf of the ALS \n     Association to express our strong opposition to legislation \n     that would eliminate the noninterference provision of the \n     Medicare Modernization Act (MMA). Legislation that authorizes \n     the federal government to negotiate Medicare prescription \n     drug prices will significantly limit the ability of people \n     with ALS to access the drugs they need and will seriously \n     jeopardize the future development of treatments for the \n     disease--a disease that is always fatal and for which there \n     currently are no effective treatment options.\n       The ALS Association is the only national voluntary health \n     organization dedicated solely to finding a treatment and cure \n     for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More commonly known \n     as Lou Gehrig's disease, ALS is a progressive \n     neurodegenerative disease that erodes a person's ability to \n     control muscle movement. As the disease advances, people lose \n     the ability to walk, move their arms, talk and even breathe, \n     yet their minds remain sharp; aware of the limitations ALS \n     has imposed on their lives, but powerless to do anything \n     about it. They become trapped inside a body they no longer \n     can control.\n       There is no cure for ALS. In fact, it is fatal within an \n     average of two to five years from the time of diagnosis. \n     Moreover, there currently is only one drug available to treat \n     the disease. Unfortunately, that drug, Rilutek, originally \n     approved by the FDA in 1995 has shown only limited effects, \n     prolonging life in some patients by just a few months.\n       The hopes of people with ALS--those living today and those \n     yet to be diagnosed--are that medical science will develop \n     and make available new treatments for the disease; treatments \n     that will improve and save their lives.\n       However, The ALS Association is deeply concerned that the \n     elimination of the MMA's noninterference provision will \n     dampen these hopes and will result in unintended consequences \n     for the thousands of Americans fighting this horrific \n     disease. The potential impacts are significant and include:\n\n\n                          Limits on Innovation\n\n       While reducing the cost of prescription drugs is an \n     important goal, it should not be done at the expense of \n     innovation. Unfortunately, eliminating the MMA's \n     noninterference provision will limit the resources available \n     to develop new breakthrough medicines. This is especially \n     troubling for a disease like ALS, for the development of new \n     drugs offers patients their best, and likely only, hope for \n     an effective treatment.\n       Additionally, by establishing price controls, Congress will \n     undermine the incentives it has established to encourage drug \n     development in orphan diseases, like ALS. As resources \n     available for research and development become more scarce, \n     there will be even less incentive to invest in orphan drug \n     development.\n\n\n                            Limits on Access\n\n       The elimination of the noninterference provision will have \n     particularly cruel consequences for people with ALS. It means \n     that even if a new drug is developed to treat ALS, many \n     patients likely will not have access to it. That's because \n     price controls can limit access to the latest technologies. \n     Proponents of government negotiated prices cite the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs as a model for how the \n     government should negotiate prices for Medicare prescription \n     drugs. Yet under that system, patients do not have access to \n     many of the latest breakthrough treatments. For example, two \n     of the most recently developed drugs to treat Parkinson's and \n     Multiple Sclerosis, neurological diseases like ALS, are not \n     covered by the VA due to the government negotiated price. \n     Ironically, those drugs currently are covered by Medicare \n     Part D.\n       Given this scenario, we are deeply concerned that any new \n     drug that is developed for ALS will not be available to the \n     vast majority of patients who need it. Instead they either \n     will be forced to forgo treatment, or only will have access \n     to less effective treatment options ones that may add a few \n     months to their lives, but not ones that will add years or \n     even save their lives.\n\n\n                    People with ALS Rely on Medicare\n\n       A significant percentage of people with ALS rely on \n     Medicare, and the newly established prescription drug \n     benefit, to obtain their health and prescription coverage. In \n     fact Congress recognized the importance of Medicare coverage \n     for people with ALS by passing legislation to eliminate the \n     24-month Medicare waiting period for people disabled with the \n     disease. This law helps to ensure patients have timely access \n     to the health care they need. With the establishment of the \n     Part D benefit, Congress also has now, helped to ensure that \n     people with ALS have access to coverage for vital \n     prescription drugs.\n       Yet this improved access is threatened by short-sighted and \n     inappropriately cost driven efforts to remove the \n     noninterference provision. If Congress makes this change, \n     they will undo what the MMA sought to ensure: access to \n     needed prescription drugs.\n       While The ALS Association appreciates attempts to improve \n     access to affordable prescription drugs, we believe that \n     Congress must consider the implications of its actions on \n     coverage, access and the advancement of medical science. We \n     fear that in an effort to control costs, Congress may limit \n     treatment options, discourage innovation, and extinguish the \n     hopes of thousands of Americans whose lives have been touched \n     by ALS and who are fighting to find a treatment and cure. On \n     behalf of your constituents living with Lou Gehrig's disease, \n     we urge you to oppose legislation to eliminate the \n     noninterference provisions of the Medicare Modernization Act.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Steve Gibson,\n\n                              Vice President, Government Relations\n     and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Military Order of the Purple Heart,\n\n                                Springfield, VA, January 10, 2007.\n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Speaker: In the coming days the House will take \n     up legislation that, if enacted will repeal the \n     noninterference clause of the Medicare Prescription Drug, \n     Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The Medicare \n     Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, H.R. 4, will \n     require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     negotiate lower covered part D drug prices on behalf of \n     Medicare beneficiaries. While there is no specific mention of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the favorable \n     pricing they receive on pharmaceutical products through the \n     Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), I would like to share with you \n     the concerns of The Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH) \n     as you consider H.R. 4.\n       As you know, Federal law currently enables the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) to purchase pharmaceutical products \n     for veterans through the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). \n     Because of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, the prices \n     the VA pays through the FSS are substantially discounted from \n     the prices private sector purchasers pay. Extending access to \n     the FSS pharmaceutical discounts to larger groups would cause \n     FSS prices to rise and would dramatically increase the VA's \n     pharmaceutical costs. The Government Accounting Office and \n     the VA have documented the magnitude of this effect in 1995, \n     1997 and 2000 in response to previous proposals to extend FSS \n     prices to other entities. The studies estimate that the VA \n     would incur many hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     additional expenses.\n       Our concerns about such proposals were expressed in The \n     Independent Budget of 2006 sent to every Member of Congress. \n     Sixty-two veteran and allied organizations endorse The \n     Independent Budget. Additionally, several veteran \n     organizations have passed formal Resolutions opposing \n     legislation extending FSS prices to Medicare or other \n     programs because it would threaten discounts the VA currently \n     receives.\n       MOPH is on record as supporting lower prescription drug \n     prices for all Americans, but not at the expense of those \n     veterans enrolled in the VA health care system and the \n     favorable pricing that the VA receives through the FSS.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Thomas A. Poulter,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S536-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S536-S545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECENT TRIP TO INDIA, SYRIA, AND ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on \nthe recent trip I made from December 13 to December 30 to India, Syria, \nand Israel.\n  The trip to India was a revelation to me--to see the vast economic \nprogress that this gigantic nation of 1.1 billion people has made. For \na long time, the nation of India resisted foreign investment, perhaps \nas a result of the colonialization by the British. But for most of the \npast two decades, India has been open for investment and trade. During \nthe course of my travels there, which are detailed in a lengthy \nstatement that I will include for the Record at the conclusion of my \nextemporaneous remarks, I have detailed the many U.S. plants we \nvisited, such as GE and IBM, all showing a remarkable aptitude for the \ntechnology of the 21st century.\n  I recall, several years ago, being surprised when I sought a number \nfrom information and found out that the answering person was in India. \nI have since learned that this is a common practice because, whereas, \nit used to cost about $3.50 for a minute conversation between the \nUnited States and India, it now costs about 7 cents.\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\n  The Indians are very highly educated. They are able to take on jobs, \nso-called outsourcing, at a much lower rate of compensation. They have \nphysician groups who are available to read, through the miracles of \nmodern technology, x rays. They have a 10\\1/2\\-hour time difference, so \nthey are prepared to do it on pretty much on an around-the-clock basis. \nWhile, obviously, there is a loss of jobs with outsourcing, I think our \nlong-range benefits in trade with India--a major trading partner--and \nthe strengthening of this democracy in Asia will provide a tremendous \nsource of strength and assistance to the goals of the United States. I \nthink it is especially important to see the Nation of India develop \nwith its 1.1 billion people as a counterbalance, so to speak, to China \nwith 1.3 billion people. We have in India a democracy, contrasted with \nthe authoritarian government which prevails in China and, in the long \nrun, the incentives and the productivity of free people in a democracy \nshould be quite a counterbalance, if not a nation which will exceed the \ntremendous strides which China has seen.\n  A major topic of conversation on my trip to India was the recent \nagreement between the United States and India, where we will make \nnuclear technology available to the nation of India. When I first \nlearned of that proposal, I had very substantial misgivings because \nIndia was not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But on \nexamining the issues further and seeing that India had not joined that \ntreaty as a matter of principle, feeling it was discriminatory, since \nthe only people who were part of the so-called nuclear club, or were \nrecognized to be part of the so-called nuclear club, were the five \nmajor powers. I think if the U.N. Charter were being written today, \nIndia would be included as one of the five major powers of the world. \nAt any rate, that was a major topic of conversation.\n  The nuclear technology that the United States will make available to \nIndia will strengthen India's economy and will be a good bridge in \ncementing relations between the United States and India.\n  I had the privilege of meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of \nIndia to discuss a wide range of issues. He expressed great pleasure at \nhis relations with President Bush and with the signing of the nuclear \nagreement, and he made a comment that India did not want another \nnuclear power in the region and specifically said he was opposed to \nseeing Iran gain nuclear weapons. I thanked Prime Minister Singh in \nIndia for the vote which they cast in support of the U.S. position in \nthe United Nations on the Iranian issue, and I think the agreement will \nbe very helpful in promoting good relations between the United States \nand India.\n  I then traveled to Syria, which was my 16th visit to that nation, \nstarting in 1984. During the course of those visits--I have had the \nopportunity to meet with former President Hafez al-Assad, on nine \noccasions, and with his successor, his son, President Bashar al-Assad, \non four occasions. I recollect that the first meeting I had with Hafez \nal-Assad was in January of 1988, and it lasted 4 hours 38 minutes, \ndiscussing a wide range of issues on the Iran-Iraq war, which had just \nbeen concluded, and then on Syrian-Israeli relations and then on U.S.-\nU.S.S.R. relations, and I found President al-Assad at that time to be a \nvery engaging interlocutor. I suggested, on a number of occasions, that \nI had taken a sufficient amount of his time, and he generously extended \nthe time until we had discussed a very wide range of issues. I found \nthose discussions with President Hafez al-Assad to be productive.\n  In 1996, when Prime Minister Netanyahu took office, he made a public \nannouncement that he would hold Syria responsible for the Hezbollah \nattacks on northern Israel. Syria then realigned their troops. I was in \nJerusalem, and Prime Minister Netanyahu asked me to carry a message to \nPresident Hafiz al-Assad that he wanted peace, and I did. Later, now \nForeign Minister Walid al-Mouallem said that that comment helped to \ndefuse the situation.\n  For many years, President Hafez al-Assad refused to negotiate with \nIsrael unless all five of the major superpowers sponsored the \ninternational conference. Israel's Prime Minister Shamir was opposed on \nthe grounds that he would attend the conference sponsored by the United \nStates and the U.S.S.R. but not when the odds were stacked 4 to 1 \nagainst Israel. I discussed that matter on a number of occasions with \nPresident Hafez al-Assad, whether my urging him had any effect. The \neffect is that President Hafez al-Assad agreed to go to Madrid in 1981 \nto a conference sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union. I \nhad urged President Hafez al-Assad to allow the Syrian Jews to leave. I \nmade a point to him in the early to mid-1990s that the Jewish women in \nSyria had no one of their own faith to marry. He made an interesting \nsuggestion. He said that if anyone will come and claim a Syrian Jewish \nbride, she could leave the country. I translated that offer to the \nlarge Syrian-Jewish community in New York and, regrettably, there were \nno takers. But after a time, President Hafez al-Assad let the Jews go \non his own, which was a constructive move.\n\n  I first met President Bashar al-Assad at the funeral of his father. I \nwas the only Member of Congress to attend the funeral. It was a 33-hour \ntrip--15 hours over, 3 hours on the ground, and 15 hours back. I made \nthe trip to pay my respects and to meet the new President. On this \noccasion, I met extensively for more than an hour with Foreign Minister \nWalid al-Mouallem and the next day for a little over an hour with \nPresident Bashar al-Assad. President Assad said that he was interested \nin undertaking peace negotiations with Israel. He said he was obviously \nlooking for a return of the Golan but that he had a good measure of \nquid pro quo to offer Israel and assistance on the fragile truce which \nIsrael now has with Hezbollah and also assistance with Hamas. In my \nformal statement, I go into greater detail on that subject.\n  I pressed President Bashar al-Assad on the obligations Syria had to \nabide by U.N. Resolution 1701 to not to support Hezbollah, and he said \nSyria would honor that requirement, that obligation. I, also, pressed \nhim on allowing the U.S. investigation into the assassination of \nLebanese Prime Minister Hariri, and again I received assurances on that \nsubject. It is always difficult to know the validity of the assurances, \nbut I think the dialog and the conversation and pressing the point is \nvery worthwhile.\n  With respect to Iraq, President Bashar al-Assad said that Syria would \nbe interested in hosting an international conference attended by the \nwarring factions in Iraq and that Syria had already gained the \nconcurrence of Turkey to participate and Syria would invite other Arab \ncountries to such a discussion. I realize that there is some \ndisagreement with the issue of dialog with Syria, but it is my view, \ndeveloped over many years of foreign travel, that dialog and talk is a \nvery important and worthwhile undertaking.\n  My trip there followed visits by Senators Bill Nelson, Chris Dodd, \nand John Kerry. I think all came away with the same conclusion that the \ndialog was very much worthwhile. I then traveled to Israel, where I had \nan opportunity to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Olmert. I relayed to \nhim the interest that Bashar al-Assad had in dialog. Prime Minister \nOlmert had been reportedly cool to any such discussions subsequent to \nmy visit. Some more positive statements were coming from Israeli \nofficials about possible negotiation also with Israel, but Prime \nMinister Olmert insisted on having some display of good faith on the \npart of Syria before even considering undertaking such discussions.\n  We also met with Foreign Minister Livni and former Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and our conversations are detailed in my written statement.\n  We then traveled to Ramallah to talk to Salam Fayyad and Hannan \nAshrawi, members of the so-called Third Way, a very small Palestinian \nparty but a very able people and very stalwart advocates for peace. \nThose comments are contained in my written statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Report on Foreign Travel\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to report on \n     foreign travel, as is my custom, from December 13 to December \n     30, 2006.\n       I traveled to India, Syria, and Israel with overnight \n     travel stops in the United Kingdom, Qatar, and Italy. I was \n     joined by my\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\n     wife Joan, my aide Scott Boos, Colonel Gregg Olson, United \n     States Marine Corps, and Dr. Matthew Needleman, United States \n     Navy.\n\n\n                             united kingdom\n\n       On December 13, we departed Dulles International Airport \n     outside Washington, DC. Our first stop was in London, England \n     where we landed at Heathrow International Airport after a \n     flight of just over 7 hours. Upon arriving in London, we were \n     greeted by Mr. James Sindle of the American Embassy in \n     London. After a brief overnight stay, we headed back to the \n     airport and departed for Mumbai, India, the next morning.\n\n\n                                 india\n\n       Upon arriving in Mumbai in the early morning hours of \n     December 15, we were greeted by Mr. Wilson Ruark, from the \n     U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai. Mr. Ruark, a Vice Consul at \n     the Consulate, was assigned to be our Control Officer. Being \n     that it was 2 a.m. local time, we quickly headed to our hotel \n     for some much-needed rest after two full days of air travel.\n       Among other issues, our meetings throughout India focused \n     on the U.S./India Nuclear Deal, business outsourcing, and \n     India's relationship with the U.S. and its neighbors, \n     including Pakistan.\n       On the afternoon of December 15, we received a Country Team \n     Briefing with the Consul General, Mr. Michael S. Owen, and \n     his staff: Mr. Wilson Ruark, Vice Consul; Mr. Matthew B. \n     Sweeney, a special agent of the Diplomatic Security Service; \n     Mr. Glen C. Keiser, Consular Chief; Mr. Bill Klein, Consul; \n     and Ms. Elizabeth Kaufmann, Public Diplomacy Chief.\n       I was pleased to hear that U.S. relations with India are at \n     an ``all-time high,'' much in part to the U.S./India Nuclear \n     agreement, part of a new ``global partnership'' entered into \n     on July 18, 2005, by President Bush and Indian Prime Minister \n     Manmohan Singh. Completion of the final terms of the deal \n     will allow the U.S. to engage in peaceful nuclear cooperation \n     with the world's largest democracy, one that commands respect \n     in an important part of the world. When the United Nations \n     was created in 1945, the 5 permanent members of the Security \n     Council were the United States, Britain, France, China, and \n     Russia. If that decision were made today, there is no doubt \n     in my mind that India would be among the world powers \n     considered for membership. With a population of 1.1 billion, \n     an educated young workforce, and an ever-expanding economy, \n     India provides an important counter-balance to China in its \n     region of the world.\n       On the U.S./India Nuclear deal, the President characterized \n     the agreement as ``hugely important'' for our strategic \n     relationship with India, and I agree. By way of background, \n     U.S. nuclear energy cooperation with India goes back to the \n     mid-1950's when the U.S. assisted in the building of nuclear \n     reactors in Tarapur, India, and allowed Indian scientists to \n     study in the U.S. During negotiations of the 1968 Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), India refused to join the NPT \n     on grounds that it was discriminatory and only recognized 5 \n     nations with the right to possess nuclear weapons. All other \n     signatories are required to dismantle their nuclear weapons \n     operations. I heard this same sentiment expressed with many \n     of the people I met with in India. However, after India \n     tested a nuclear device in 1974, the U.S. and other nations \n     tightened export controls leaving India in a difficult \n     position without sufficient access to supplies for its \n     civilian nuclear program. An additional test by India in \n     1998, and a subsequent counter-test by Pakistan, certainly \n     did not advance their ability to obtain fuel and equipment \n     from world suppliers.\n       On August 26, 1995, on travel with Colorado Senator Hank \n     Brown, I met with India's Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. He \n     stated his interest in negotiations which would lead to the \n     elimination of any nuclear weapons on the Indian subcontinent \n     within ten or fifteen years. Two days later, I raised the \n     issue with Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. She \n     expressed genuine surprise over the content of my discussion \n     with Prime Minister Rao. She stated that this was the first \n     time that she had heard any such commitment from India and \n     she asked if we had it in writing. I suggested to Prime \n     Minister Bhutto that the U.S. serve as an intermediary to \n     facilitate dialogue. I wrote a letter to President Clinton \n     summarizing the meetings and suggested that it would be very \n     productive for the U.S. to initiate and broker discussions \n     between India and Pakistan. Unfortunately, he did not share \n     my interest in the issue, perhaps because his attention was \n     focused on the election. After the election, I raised the \n     issue again with the President, but again he did not show \n     interest.\n       Despite being a non-signatory to the Nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), India has complied with most \n     of its main tenets. It should be noted that India, unlike its \n     neighbor Pakistan, has not shared its technology or weapons \n     with outside nations. They have been a responsible nuclear \n     weapon state, though not recognized under the NPT like the 5 \n     acknowledged nuclear weapon states: U.S., Russia, France, \n     Britain, and China.\n       For India, a deal with the U.S. will provide India much-\n     needed credibility and the potential for energy security with \n     access to equipment, fuel, and other assistance for its civil \n     nuclear power program. The international community is likely \n     to follow the lead of the U.S. In return, India, which does \n     not currently have International Atomic Energy Agency \n     safeguards on all nuclear material in peaceful nuclear \n     activities, agrees to open its civil nuclear power reactors \n     to inspection.\n       Congress recently approved authorizing legislation, with \n     some controversial modifications regarding Iran which I will \n     discuss in more detail later in this report, setting the \n     stage for a final cooperation agreement. The legislation \n     retains the prerogative of Congress to vote on the actual \n     cooperation before it takes effect.\n       U.S. business ties with India are also on the rise, and \n     have been for some time. India recently hosted 240 American \n     businessmen and women, representing 190 companies--the \n     largest delegation of its kind ever. New Delhi appears to be \n     taking additional steps to embrace trade and has loosened \n     various trade restrictions in recent years.\n       The Consulate explained that several societal and political \n     functions appear to be restricting the advancement of the \n     country. The risk of ``political paralysis'' has become an \n     issue among competing political factions in the 543-seat Lok \n     Sabha (People's House). No single political party has come \n     close to a parliamentary majority in recent times and \n     coalitions have become necessary to wield greater influence \n     over national affairs. Currently, the National Congress Party \n     occupies more parliamentary seats (145) than any other party, \n     and through alliances with powerful regional parties, leads \n     India's government under the United Progressive Alliance \n     coalition. Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, the daughter-\n     in-law of assassinated former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi \n     and widow of assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, \n     has considerable power over the ruling coalition's policy-\n     making process. The Bharitiya Janata Party (BJP), associated \n     with Hindu nationalism, is the country's largest opposition \n     party and controls eight state governments. Meanwhile, the \n     government is led by Manmohan Singh, a Sikh and India's \n     first-ever non-Hindu prime minister.\n       We discussed India's history and the arrival of the \n     British, who brought rule of law to India despite flagrant \n     disobedience which exists today. Politically controlled by \n     the British East India Company from the early 18th century \n     and directly administered by Great Britain starting the mid-\n     19th century, India became a modern nation-state in 1947 \n     after a struggle for independence marked by widespread use of \n     nonviolent resistance as a means of social protest.\n       I was surprised to see that the Indians would have built a \n     ``Gateway of India'' monument to celebrate the arrival of \n     King George V and Queen Mary in 1911. Completed in 1924, the \n     massive structure sits atop the port of Mumbai on the Arabian \n     Sea. It did not make sense that the Indians would have built \n     such a structure to celebrate those who were there to exploit \n     their interests, and I was right. As it turns out, the \n     British built the Gateway of India.\n       While Muslims represent just 15 percent of India's \n     population, the 140 million Muslims places India behind only \n     Indonesia and Pakistan among countries with large Muslim \n     populations. Eighty percent are Hindu, but they represent a \n     diverse mixture of regional characteristics with numerous \n     languages. Three percent of Indians are Sikh; around one \n     percent are Christian. The Jewish population has declined as \n     a result of emigration to Israel since 1948. Currently, 5,000 \n     Jews live in Mumbai and another 4,000 live elsewhere in \n     India.\n       The Consulate explained the numerous challenges to India's \n     desire to expand its economic base. India has not spent \n     enough money on roads, rail, ports, power, and water \n     infrastructure. The weight of 1.1 billion people has strained \n     India's physical infrastructure, clearly evident driving to \n     meetings throughout Mumbai and along the route to the \n     airport. While India has numerous world-class schools, the \n     Consular staff explained that access to education in rural \n     areas has been getting worse. India recently surpassed South \n     Africa as the country with the most individuals living with \n     HIV and AIDS, registering at over 5 million persons.\n       Immigration is a highly emotional subject, with some \n     objecting to Indians taking jobs from U.S. workers. However, \n     it is worth noting that these are very bright people and that \n     we are a nation of immigrants. There is a desire to see the \n     U.S. lift its cap on H1B visas, highly sought by Indians in \n     the Information Technology (IT) industry. The current cap is \n     at 65,000 and some are expressing a desire to see that number \n     lifted to 125,000. Overall, the Consulate in Mumbai issued \n     120,000 visas last year, 15,000 to highly skilled workers. \n     They expect steady and double-digit annual increases in \n     demand.\n       Finally, we discussed India's relations with Pakistan and \n     the threat of terrorism that exists in India. Continuing \n     violence in Kashmir remains a major source of interstate \n     tension. Both India and Pakistan have built large defense \n     establishments--including nuclear weapons and ballistic \n     missile programs--at the cost of economic and social \n     development. Little substantive progress has been made toward \n     resolving the Kashmir issue, and New Delhi continues to \n     complain about what it views as insufficient Pakistani \n     efforts to end Islamic militancy that affects India.\n       On July 11, 2006, a series of explosions on seven crowded \n     commuter trains in Mumbai left more than 200 dead and at \n     least 800 injured. On December 1, 2006 Indian police filed \n     formal charges against 28 suspected members of the connected \n     to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Sunni militant\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\n     group fighting in Kashmir and designated as a terrorist \n     organization by the U.S. Police also have alleged that \n     Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence was \n     behind the bombings. Pakistan has denied the accusation. \n     Thirteen of the accused are in police custody, and the rest \n     are at large.\n       Later in the afternoon on December 15, I met with several \n     impressive Indian business executives for a roundtable \n     discussion on outsourcing--a word which has picked up a \n     negative connotation resulting from lost jobs in the U.S. \n     which have been shipped to India. These men were very \n     knowledgeable and I was amazed at their rise to such \n     important positions at such young ages--the four men ranged \n     in age from 38 to 42. Anish Tripathi of KPMG, heads the \n     knowledge function in India and reports directly to the \n     Director and CEO. He explained his firm's role in advising \n     U.S. firms on whether, and how, to outsource their operations \n     to India and elsewhere in search of a lower-cost operations \n     base. Saurabh Sonawala, the head of business processing \n     outsourcing for HindiTron, a travel software producer and \n     outsourcing advisor to over 20 major airlines, explained, \n     ``It's not always about cost. India can do a better job.'' \n     Manish Modi, Managing Director of Datamatrix Technologies \n     Ltd., described the process of outsourcing certain accounting \n     functions for the auto industry. While the actual invoice \n     must be handled and mailed in the U.S., a scanned copy on a \n     computer screen in Mumbai allows an Indian worker to perform \n     related accounting tasks. Satish Ambe of KALE Associates also \n     was present in the meeting.\n       They explained that 80 per cent of outsourcing consists of \n     so-called ``call centers,'' where English-speaking Indians \n     perform various functions from India. I asked how it would \n     make sense to pay the cost of a phone call to India and still \n     achieve cost-efficiency. They explained that 12 years ago, \n     the cost of a phone call was $3.50 per minute. Today it is \n     only 7 cents per minute. The cost of a data connection has \n     also become much cheaper. Ten years ago a 64K line would have \n     cost $10,000 per month. Today it is only $50 to $100 per \n     month.\n       Other factors contribute to the desirability of using India \n     as a base for operations. The time zone difference allows \n     companies to employ low-cost labor instead of paying the \n     ``graveyard shift'' in the U.S. At a management level, labor \n     costs only 30-40 percent of that in the U.S. At an entry-\n     level, labor in India costs only 10 percent of that in the \n     U.S. The gentlemen I met with claimed that India's workforce \n     is better skilled and better educated. In the U.S. it is \n     difficult to find someone with an accounting degree to man a \n     phone line. However, in India, a degree has become a \n     prerequisite due to the heavy competition for employment. In \n     addition, India has a very large labor pool of young workers. \n     The average age in India is 25, compared to an average age of \n     35 in China. Finally, workers in India speak English, a \n     characteristic not often found in low-cost labor markets.\n       Our discussion extended beyond outsourcing to India's \n     economy in general. It was represented that 200 years ago, \n     India's economy accounted for 26 percent of the world's GDP. \n     Today it is only 2 percent, leaving room for expansion. I \n     question the ability to gauge such a statistic, but it still \n     shows the power of the East India Trading Company.\n       We discussed the similarities and differences between India \n     and China. They explained that perhaps a totalitarian \n     government is most effective in propelling a nation of over \n     1.3 billion people. Regardless, China's economic expansion \n     began about 10 years before India's and India is likely to \n     eventually surpass China, due in large part to its large \n     population of young workers. However, they explained that \n     the ``aspiration level'' is easily understood--of workers \n     in India is relatively low. Indians who really ``aspire'' \n     move to the U.S. The men agreed that the impending U.S./\n     India Nuclear deal was an important symbolic event which \n     will solidify the relationship between our nations.\n       On December 16, I met with Julio Ribeiro, Head of \n     Enforcement for the Indian Music Industry (IMI), to discuss \n     issues related to copyright infringement, copyright \n     enforcement and to discuss the IMI's experience in anti-\n     piracy efforts. Mr. Ribeiro was a very impressive man with a \n     long resume of achievement. He joined the Indian Police \n     Service in 1953 and served as Mumbai's police commissioner in \n     the 1980s, commanding a force of 35,000 officers. From 1989 \n     to 1992, he served as Indian Ambassador to Romania. IMI \n     members include major record companies including Saregama \n     India Ltd., Universal Music, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, \n     and Virgin Records. Mr. Ribeiro explained that the copyright \n     laws in India are good, but are not well understood. \n     ``Education is key to enforcement,'' according to Mr. \n     Ribeiro. Corruption in India is a huge obstacle and without \n     proper supervision enforcement of copyright laws becomes a \n     low priority. When I asked who was being bribed, Mr. Ribeiro \n     replied, ``You tell me who is not being bribed.''\n       That same afternoon, we sat down for a lengthy meeting and \n     lunch with the Director (Projects) of the state-owned Nuclear \n     Power Corporation of India (NPCIL), Mr. S.K. Agrawal to \n     discuss the nuclear power industry in India, its growth \n     prospects, its role in upholding India's non-proliferation \n     regime (outside of the NPT), and the commercial prospects for \n     U.S. companies should the U.S./India civil nuclear agreement \n     become reality. I also pressed Mr. Agrawal on some of the \n     more politically sensitive issues surrounding the agreement, \n     particularly with respect to Iran and its nuclear intentions. \n     Overall, Mr. Agrawal said that his company is ``euphoric'' \n     over the U.S./India Nuclear deal.\n       The NCPIL has ambitious expansion plans, and hopes to \n     procure more technology and hardware abroad once the U.S./\n     India Nuclear deal is complete. Mr. Agrawal explained that \n     with India's massive population and thirst for energy in an \n     expanding economy, it will need 700GW of electricity capacity \n     by 2032. India's 16 nuclear power reactors currently cover \n     only 2 percent of India's electricity demand, but their goal \n     is to reach 10 percent by 2031 and 30 percent by 2050. The \n     NCPIL has a capacity of about 3.9GW and, if its current \n     construction and future plans for additional reactors come to \n     fruition, it will reach 60GW by 2031. Over 20 foreign \n     reactors will be necessary to achieve this goal. Thermal \n     (coal and gas) currently provides over 80GW of electricity, \n     but India's reserves of fossil fuels are going down. Hydro-\n     electricity provides another 33GW and renewables provide only \n     6GW.\n       Mr. Agrawal claims that India already has sufficient know-\n     how to build additional plants, but because India is not a \n     signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Agreement (NPT), \n     foreign countries will not sell reactors. He explained that \n     the leverage of the U.S. trusting India and making a deal \n     will send a strong signal to other countries who will also be \n     interested in exporting its reactors. Mr. Agrawal explained \n     that there is enough business for everyone and that India \n     ``can accommodate France, Russia, and the U.S.'' He also \n     assured me that imported uranium would be used ``only for \n     civilian purposes and not for any para-military'' purpose and \n     that the reactors will be open for IAEA inspection.\n       I raised the issue of Iran with Mr. Agrawal. The Senate \n     version of the U.S./India Nuclear deal included a requirement \n     that the President determine that India is fully and actively \n     supporting U.S. and international efforts to dissuade, \n     sanction, and contain Iran's nuclear program. Due to heavy \n     pressure from New Delhi, the Conference Report included a \n     watered-down version which only requires an annual report to \n     Congress on India's efforts in this regard. Regardless, this \n     provision has raised opposition and debate over the deal in \n     India. When I asked Mr. Agrawal for his feelings on the \n     matter, he initially claimed that it was not his place to \n     comment, that he was ``just a utility company.'' However, \n     when I pursued the issue, he said that India does not support \n     nuclear proliferation in Iran. He explained that ``India has \n     a uniform policy'' and that it doesn't ``pick and choose'' \n     when, and for whom, to oppose proliferation. I responded that \n     it's appropriate to pick and choose when a country threatens \n     to wipe another country off the face of the Earth, as Iran's \n     President has done towards Israel. During Senate \n     consideration, I supported an even more stringent amendment \n     which would have required Presidential certification that \n     India has agreed to suspend military-to-military cooperation \n     with Iran, including training exercises, until such time as \n     Iran is no longer designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. \n     Regardless, I told Mr. Agrawal that I know that India is a \n     responsible nation and that we wouldn't solve the problem \n     over lunch. I was pleased to see Mr. Agrawal be candid with \n     his views, and those of his country, on this, and a number of \n     related issues.\n       Mr. Agrawal explained that no final approval would be \n     necessary from the parliament in India, but that a two-day \n     debate would take place on December 18-19. He said that we \n     would see the two sides of public opinion, those who support \n     the deal, and those who question India limiting its ability \n     to freely act on its own foreign policy. Mainly, the \n     discussion will try to answer the question, ``Did the U.S \n     come through with the July agreement'' between Prime Minister \n     Singh and President Bush, or ``did Congress change it too \n     much,'' referring to the Iran report requirement. An article \n     appeared in the Times of India newspaper on the day of our \n     meeting written by ex-scientists claiming that the deal \n     denies India the opportunity for full cooperation in civil \n     nuclear energy. Unlike the U.S., India wants to reprocess its \n     spent nuclear fuel for new experimental reactors for which \n     technology will be ready for development in 15-20 years. \n     However, the Congress included language in the legislation to \n     prohibit such a practice. The legislation passed by Congress \n     also includes a termination clause should India export \n     nuclear-related mater, equipment, or technology--though a \n     Presidential waiver is available. Also, while India hasn't \n     said whether or not it will conduct a nuclear test again, the \n     deal would terminate should a test occur. Despite the \n     article, Mr. Agrawal assured us that the scientists did not \n     represent the majority opinion of Indians.\n       When I asked why India won't become a signatory to the NPT, \n     he explained that it is a discriminatory arrangement whereby \n     only the 5 acknowledged nuclear weapon states are permitted \n     to possess nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, its neighbor Pakistan, \n     also not a signatory, has been an irresponsible nuclear \n     weapon state and, according to Mr. Agrawal, India is ``not \n     ready to eliminate its weapons'' because it needs them as a \n     deterrent to offset those possessed by its neighbor. In order \n     for India to join the NPT and enjoy the benefits of civil \n     nuclear cooperation, it would be required to draw down its \n     arsenal. Unlike Pakistan, India has shown its global\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\n     aspirations. India paid a price for supporting the U.S. \n     already when Iran was referred to the Security Council. A \n     pending deal to build a much-needed natural gas pipeline \n     through Pakistan was put on hold. The deal shows that India \n     needs to be recognized in a realistic way as a nuclear weapon \n     state, because they do in fact possess them. I said I am \n     pleased to see the U.S./India Nuclear deal moving forward. \n     Once complete, India's massive population will be able to \n     enjoy the benefits of peaceful civil nuclear cooperation.\n       During lunch, Mr. Agrawal explained that the NCPIL would be \n     creating a new university for nuclear training in Mumbai. A \n     state department official who joined me in the meeting \n     expressed interest in possible cooperation with U.S. \n     universities.\n       On December 17, we departed Mumbai for Cochin, located in \n     the southern state of Kerala. Upon arrival, we were greeted \n     by Mr. Fred Kaplan, Ms. Kelly Buenrostro, and Mr. Finny Jacob \n     of the U.S. Consulate General in Chennai. They provided \n     excellent support and arranged good meetings through my \n     travel in south India.\n       We departed the airport and drove into Cochin for tea and a \n     tour of the Mattancherry Synagogue with Samuel Hallegua, the \n     leader of the Jewish community. Mr. Hallegua is a former \n     businessman who came from a wealthy Jewish family whose \n     ancestors had migrated to Kerala in 1692 from Spain, by way \n     of Aleppo, Iran, and held large areas of land in Cochin. He \n     explained that his ancestors in Kerala were in the rope trade \n     business and cultivated coconuts and rice on their estate \n     until land reform in 1917 when they were forced to give up \n     land. Once a vibrant community of 2,500 Jews, Cochin now has \n     only a very small Jewish population--32 individuals in the \n     city and another 20 in the suburbs. Entire families and \n     congregations departed for Israel upon its statehood in 1948. \n     I was pleased to hear Mr. Hallegua say that Jews in Cochin \n     have enjoyed ``total religious freedom.'' I asked, ``If it's \n     so good here, why did everyone leave for Israel?'' He \n     explained that they were ``observant Orthodox Jews'' and that \n     they ``felt they could be more observant'' in Israel.\n       After tea in Mr. Hallegua's 200-year old ancestral home, he \n     walked us through the neighborhood to the Mattancherry \n     Synagogue. Built in 1568, it is one of the great historic \n     places of interest in Cochin. Mr. Hallegua showed us scrolls \n     of Jewish scriptures, copper plates in which the privileges \n     granted by the Cochin Maharajas to the Kerala Jewish \n     community are recorded, and the building's antique \n     chandeliers and Chinese hand painted tiles. As I signed my \n     name into the guest book, I noted that Queen Elizabeth of \n     Britain visited the synagogue in 1997 and signed the same \n     book. I was later told that Mr. Hallegua drew a curious look \n     from the Queen when he told his wife ``Queenie'' to ``hurry \n     up, Queenie.''\n       That evening I attended a dinner with 12 member of the \n     Indo-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) in Kerala, including \n     Mr. C.P. Sebastian, CEO of Excel Globe and current President \n     of the Chamber. Founded in 1968, the IACC serves as a link \n     between the businesses in India and the United States and \n     seeks to promote bilateral trade, investment and \n     technology transfer, and other joint ventures. The Kerala \n     branch of the IACC was established in 1992 and has over 60 \n     members. We discussed a number of issues related to the \n     process of outsourcing American jobs to India at a lower \n     cost. They explained that while jobs may be lost in \n     America, India provides a benefit to the American consumer \n     with lower costs for products and services. Our \n     conversation extended into other areas including the U.S./\n     India Nuclear deal. We discussed their views on the \n     Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as discriminatory and how \n     it confers second-rate status on Indians, the crisis in \n     the Middle East and the problems in Iraq, relations with \n     China, and intellectual property rights. We toasted the \n     good relations between our nations, and I extended an \n     invitation for the executives to visit the U.S.\n       On the morning of December 17, we departed our hotel for a \n     boat tour of the Cochin area. Along the way, we saw Chinese \n     fishing nets. Cochin is the only place in the world outside \n     of China where these nets are in use. We also toured areas \n     affected by the tsunami. I was curious to know that the \n     tsunami hit the west coast of India. In Cochin, water was \n     sucked away from land for 45 minutes and then the water \n     rushed back to land killing 80 people and destroying many \n     houses.\n       I joined 8 area business executives who are members of the \n     Cochin Chamber of Commerce for a working lunch. The Chamber \n     President Mr. Jose Dominic, Managing Director of the CGH \n     Earth Hotels, told me that the Chamber is celebrating its \n     150th anniversary. Commerce in the region began with English \n     traders in the Cochin area. Today, the region specializes in \n     shipping, agriculture, and tourism. The locals refer to the \n     area as ``God's own country.'' Kerala's economy grew by 9.2 \n     percent last year, largely in part to a growth rate of 13.8 \n     percent in the services sector. Due to the lack of industrial \n     investments, Kerala has a major unemployment problem with \n     over 4 million people out-of-work. Again, we discussed a \n     mixture of business related issues and other issues of \n     international importance. Almost all of the executives had \n     visited the U.S. and many had children in our universities. \n     They remarked that it is ``amazing'' that our 2 big \n     democracies haven't been closer sooner. We discussed the \n     effect of the ruling Communist government and how it \n     restricts the flow of trade. They explained that state funds \n     going into investment are not providing an adequate return. \n     However, the schools and healthcare are exceptional. ``If you \n     were a poor person, Kerala would be a good place to live,'' \n     one man said.\n       Later that afternoon, I met with Chief Justice V.K. Bali \n     and 4 senior judges of the Kerala High Court in Cochin, the \n     highest court in the state. In India, one cannot be a Chief \n     Justice in their native state to avoid any allegations of \n     impartial rulings influenced by area relationships. To become \n     a judge at the High Court, lawyers who practice at the court \n     are chosen by the Chief Justice based on their daily \n     performance. The Chief Justice explained that 45 is a good \n     starting age and that judges are bound to retire at age 62-65 \n     for the national Supreme Court. I told them that in the U.S., \n     Oliver Wendel Holmes served on the federal bench until he was \n     91. They explained that in India, everything is open to \n     judicial review, including actions taken by the Prime \n     Minister. In the U.S., President Bush campaigned in 2004 on \n     nominating judges that would not legislate from the bench. \n     When I asked if judges in India legislate from the bench, \n     they explained that sometimes it is necessary to ``fill in \n     the gaps,'' and they do so despite the criticism. They gave \n     me an example where a public smoking ban was put into effect \n     by the High Court based on a provision in their constitution \n     providing a ``right to life.''\n       On December 19, I met with the Editorial Board of the \n     Malayala Manorama, one of the largest circulated newspapers \n     in India with 1.4 million copies sold daily. We discussed the \n     good relations between the U.S. and India bolstered recently \n     by the nuclear deal. They also asked questions about how the \n     deal relates to their relations with Pakistan, Iran, and \n     India's ability to decide foreign policy without foreign \n     influence. We also discussed the Middle East and my view that \n     we should be willing to talk to our adversaries if we intend \n     to solve the problems at hand. I was asked questions about \n     religious freedom, personal privacy in the U.S. since 9/11, \n     the 2008 Presidential election, trade policy with India, \n     relations with Pakistan, and my views on India as an \n     investment destination. I was very surprised by the \n     newspaper's account of my interview, as published on December \n     20. The board of editors grossly mischaracterized my \n     statements on the war in Iraq, the war's relationship with \n     the Muslim community, treatment of detainees at Guantanamo \n     Bay, and my view of India in the world. I would certainly \n     rethink granting another interview with the Malayala Manorama \n     newspaper on any future visit to Kerala. I wrote the Managing \n     Editor, Mr. Philip Mathew, and explained the \n     misrepresentations in their reporting. I ask consent that a \n     copy of my December 22, 2006, letter be included at the end \n     of these remarks.\n       Later that day, we drove into the backwaters area of Kerala \n     for a boat tour of the region.\n       On December 20, we departed Kerala for Bangalore, India, a \n     city of nearly 10 million people. The state of Karnakata has \n     around 60 million people and all of south India has nearly \n     250 million people. Again, we were accompanied by the very \n     able officers of the U.S. Consulate in Chennai. Also joining \n     us from the State Department on this leg of the trip was Mr. \n     George Mathew who provided helpful information on the local \n     issues.\n       Upon our arrival, I hosted a lunch with former Chief \n     Justice Malimath of both the Karnakata and Kerala High \n     Courts, the Indian equivalent of a state supreme court in the \n     U.S. However, the Chief Justice earned his distinct \n     reputation for his leadership of a judicial reform committee \n     focused on criminal procedures which recently published a \n     report bearing his name. Among the recommendations to reduce \n     the backlog of criminal court cases and bring order to the \n     system was the introduction of plea bargaining, which was \n     absent in the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. That \n     recommendation has been adopted. He explained that police \n     interrogation techniques in India often involve torture \n     because police are not aware of proper methods. When a \n     detainee dies in custody, suicide is usually given as the \n     reason for death. Reforms to the system now require police to \n     report any instance of death with reasons and must perform a \n     video-recorded postmortem. Another recommendation pending \n     approval is the creation of a witness protection program. The \n     Chief Justice explained that in India only 7 percent of \n     serious offenses end up in conviction because witnesses are \n     afraid to testify. The Chief Justice also headed a \n     comprehensive study of child trafficking in India for the \n     National Human Rights Commission. Its recommendations have \n     been enacted into a government program to disrupt such \n     networks.\n       We also discussed procedures for confessions, double \n     jeopardy, and the lack of a right to a trial by jury. I was \n     interested to learn that the Chief Justice has a daughter \n     living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n       We then visited the IBM Global Operations Center in \n     Bangalore, located in a massive commercial office park with \n     many other U.S. based corporations. The operations center \n     enables IMB to use the high quality workforce at a low cost \n     of labor to remotely troubleshoot and maintain computer \n     networks for clients at locations around the world. For \n     example, during Hurricane Katrina, their monitoring system \n     identified server outages throughout the Gulf Coast. They \n     explained the challenges that come with working in India, \n     including poor infrastructure of roads, ports, and power \n     supply,\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\n     exemplified by the lights going out during the presentation. \n     Delayed decision-making of coalition politics and labor laws \n     limiting work hours also are not well suited to the \n     information technology (IT) industry. Still, the Chairman and \n     CEO of IBM, Sam Palmisano, recently announced that over the \n     next 3 years, IBM will triple its investment to $6 billion in \n     India.\n       Later that afternoon, we visited the General Electric (GE) \n     Jack Welch Technology Center, where over 3,000 scientists and \n     support personnel conduct various research and development \n     operations. The center holds 30 patents. One such innovation \n     breakthrough is the development of a digital railway system \n     where wireless information technology (IT) logistics can be \n     used to monitor operations. The center is also responsible \n     for the development of a diagnostic imaging device where the \n     bone can be taken away from a CT scan. I received a \n     demonstration of the machine and saw very advanced 3 \n     dimensional digital scan a human brain.\n       On December 21, we departed Bangalore and traveled south to \n     Thiruvananthapuram, India, better known as Trivandrum. We \n     were joined on this leg of the trip by David Hopper, the \n     Consul General of the U.S. Consulate General in Chennai.\n       Our first meeting was a working lunch at U.S. Technologies, \n     a 100 percent U.S. owned, California-based information \n     technology (IT) firm, specializing in IT consulting and \n     development services for healthcare, retail, financial \n     services, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and \n     logistics clients. We were greeted at the door by 2 elephants \n     and an indigenous music arrangement consisting of horns and \n     drums. Established in 1999, U.S. Technologies' goal is to \n     become a $1 billion company with a workforce of 30,000 \n     employees by 2010. Already the largest employer in Kerala, \n     they explained that they have a 99.24 percent defect-free \n     process and strive for quality and happy employees. One of \n     their major clients is Blue Cross Blue Shield, based in \n     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n       Later that afternoon, we met V.S. Achuthanandan, the 83-\n     year old Chief Minister of Kerala, India. A Chief Minister in \n     India is equivalent to a governor in the U.S. The Chief \n     Minister assumed the position in May 2006 and is a prominent \n     leader, and true believer, of the Communist Party of India-\n     Marxist (CPI-M). He had been a Communist party worker for 66 \n     years and the party's politburo member for 10 years. In \n     India, the CPI-M politburo is a policy making committee which \n     advises the government on how to rule. The CPI-M has a \n     history of anti-U.S. rhetoric, especially when it is the \n     opposition party. After the death of his father, the Chief \n     Minister left school after just 7 years to assist in his \n     brother's business. Our conversation covered a number of \n     topics including Communist thought and dialect \n     materialism, the policies of President Bush, China, and \n     Cuba.\n       In between events, we stopped briefly at Trivandrum's \n     Napier Museum where we saw a vast collection of antique, \n     cultural, and artistic artifacts.\n       Early that evening, I visited his Highness Marthanda Varma \n     Maharaja, the head of the Royal family of Travancore, and \n     other members of the Royal Family for high tea at the Kowdiar \n     Palace. The Royal Family used matrilineal succession. \n     Marthanda Varma's elder sister, Lakshmi Bayi, uses the palace \n     as her residence along with her two daughters Gouri Parvathi \n     Bayi and Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, and their children. Marthanda \n     Varma's brother Bala Rama Varma was the last member to hold \n     power. When Lakshmi Bayi's uncle died, he became King as a \n     small boy in 1941. After his death in 1991, his Highness \n     Marthanda Varma assumed the role as head of the family. Next \n     in line would be her son, a 50 year old doctor in Bangalore. \n     Travancore was a princely state which covered most of central \n     and southern Kerala during the British period. . After \n     independence, the Royal Family lost political power and the \n     princely state merged with other Malayalam language-speaking \n     areas in south India to form Kerala. We discussed the \n     challenges of holding power and how it is different from the \n     current democratic government structure.\n       On December 22, we departed the southern areas of India for \n     the eastern city of Bhubaneswar, located in the state of \n     Orissa. I was greeted by Mr. Doug Kelly, Public Affairs \n     Officer at the U.S. Consulate General in Calcutta.\n       Our first meeting was a working lunch with Mr. Vishambhar \n     Saran, Chairman of VISA Steel, and numerous Orissa government \n     officials, at the home of Mr. Saran's son, also an executive \n     at VISA Steel. The lunch provided an opportunity to interact \n     with senior businessmen and state officials and get their \n     insights on Orissa's current economic, political, and social \n     issues. Mr. Saran was a educated to be a mining engineer, \n     served as Director of Raw Materials for TATA Steel, and has \n     over 37 years experience in the mining and steel industry. He \n     explained that the demand for steel in India is growing at a \n     rate of 10 percent and India faces competition from China and \n     the Ukraine. Power is an important issue for their mining and \n     steel-making operations. He told me that India has 300-400 \n     years of coal remaining, but that the quality is not as good \n     as the coal in Pennsylvania. Mr. Saran explained that India \n     is currently producing 42 million tons of steel. By 2012, it \n     will produce 80 tons and by 2020, it will reach 110 tons or \n     more. During lunch we also discussed the situation in Iraq \n     and India's relations with Iraq. Mr. Saran told me that he \n     has been to Pittsburgh several times to visit family.\n       After lunch, we visited Infosys where I was briefed on \n     company operations by Mr. Ardhendu Das. He also led me on a \n     tour of the Infosys campus which includes cafeterias and \n     recreational areas for employees. Infosys provides clients \n     with business management consulting, information technology \n     (IT) consulting, reengineering and maintenance support, and \n     outsourcing and offshoring services. The company was created \n     in 1981 with 7 employees and $250. Today, it operates in 18 \n     countries and 50 major cities, employing over 66,000 workers \n     with 476 clients. The Infosys CEO was recently named Forbes \n     Asia Businessman of 2006. We discussed India's well-educated \n     labor pool and business comparisons with China.\n       I met with Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to discuss \n     the state of affairs in Orissa and elsewhere in the world. \n     The Chief Minister, head of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD)-\n     Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition, was first sworn in on \n     March 2000 and then again in March 2004. He began his \n     political career in 1997 after the death of his father. He \n     also served in Prime Minister Vajpayee's Cabinet as Minister \n     in charge of Steel and Mines. Prior to his political career, \n     Mr. Patnaik was a writer. We discussed the U.S./India Nuclear \n     deal, the growing information technology (IT) industry, steel \n     and mining, tourism, the difference between elections in \n     India and the lengthy process in the U.S., and global issues \n     including the war in Iraq.\n       Later that evening, my wife and I attended a dinner hosted \n     by Baijayant (``Jay'') Panda, a Member of Rajya Sabha, \n     India's parliament. We discussed world affairs with some 20 \n     prominent citizens of Bhubaneshwar and toasted the successful \n     relationship of our two countries. Born in 1964 and educated \n     in the U.S., Mr. Panda has a very bright future ahead and is \n     one of New Delhi's prominent young parliamentarians. His wife \n     Jaggi runs a cable television network in Bhubaneshwar.\n       On December 23, I departed Bhubaneshwar for the capitol \n     city of India, New Delhi, where I was greeted at the airport \n     by Mr. Geoffrey Pyatt, Deputy Chief of Mission, and Ms. Karen \n     Schinnerer, consular officer and our control officer.\n       After some difficulty landing in New Delhi due to fog, I \n     immediately drove to the residence of India's Prime Minister \n     where I was joined by the U.S. Ambassador to India David C. \n     Mulford for a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. My \n     meeting was the first U.S. visit with the Prime Minister \n     since President Bush signed legislation earlier that week \n     allowing the U.S. and India to move forward with civil \n     nuclear cooperation. The Ambassador told me that 680 million \n     people watched the ceremony on 11 stations, attesting to the \n     interest in the expanding relations between our nations. In \n     between the signing and our meeting, harsh skepticism was \n     voiced in parliament against the U.S./India Nuclear deal. I \n     urged the Prime Minister to move forward quickly with the \n     remaining technical terms of the agreement, which I am told \n     should not be too difficult. The U.S. Congress must still \n     give final approval of the technical terms of the deal. We \n     also discussed the Presidential signing statement and my \n     belief that Congress should be able to sue if the legislation \n     is changed by a statement.\n       We discussed the strong relationship between India and the \n     U.S. and the good relationship with President Bush. We also \n     discussed the diversity of India, a country with the world's \n     second largest Muslim population. He spoke of his commitment \n     to the rule of law including freedom and human kindness. On \n     the issue of India's relations with Pakistan, I asked the \n     Prime Minister if U.S. involvement could be helpful in \n     mediating the differences between the countries. I explained \n     that I had tried to have President Clinton invite the heads \n     of state of India and Pakistan to the Oval Office in 1995, \n     but without success. The Prime Minister explained that he has \n     had several meetings with Pakistan's President Pervez \n     Musharraf and there has been talk of normalizing relations.\n       I expressed my appreciation for India's vote on Iran in the \n     U.N. on nuclear proliferation. The Prime Minister expressed \n     that India is not in favor of another nuclear state in the \n     region and would oppose Iran having nuclear weapons. We also \n     discussed, more broadly, the difficult situation in the \n     Middle East including the war in Iraq, the struggles in \n     Israel, and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n       We also discussed relations with China, Afghanistan, and \n     Israel, the future direction of economic cooperation between \n     the U.S. and India, and Indian students in the U.S. We also \n     exchanged stories about our children and grandchildren. One \n     of the Prime Minister's daughters graduated Yale Law School \n     and now works on civil rights in New York City. I previously \n     met with the Prime Minister in 2001 when he served as the \n     opposition leader in parliament.\n       Following my meeting with the Prime Minister, I joined the \n     Ambassador at his home for a country team briefing with his \n     staff. We discussed the nuclear proliferation agenda of Iran \n     and North Korea and its relation to India, which has stopped \n     a cargo ship from North Korea to Pakistan with equipment for \n     nuclear weapons.\n       We discussed in more detail the U.S./India Nuclear deal and \n     the political fallout the Prime Minister is facing due to \n     language in the bill passed by Congress requiring a \n     Presidential report on India's efforts to keep Iran\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\n     from becoming a nuclear power. We also discussed economic \n     ties with India, outsourcing of American jobs, and China's \n     practice of currency manipulation. He explained that in the \n     coming years, the U.S., China, and India will continue to \n     emerge as the world's largest economic powers.\n\n\n                                 QATAR\n\n       On December 24, I departed India for Al Udeid Air Base near \n     Doha, Qatar, as a stopover on the way to Damascus, Syria. \n     Upon arrival I was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Chase \n     Untermeyer and Michael Ratney, Deputy Chief of Mission, who \n     briefed me on overall relations between the U.S. and Qatar \n     and the importance of our air base there. While at Al Udeid, \n     I had an opportunity to visit with Pennsylvania troops \n     stationed there. We exchanged stories, took photographs, and \n     I wished them a happy holiday.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n       On December 25, I arrived in Damascus, Syria. My 16th visit \n     included my 4th meeting with President Bashar al-Assad. I had \n     previously met his father, President Hafez al-Assad, on nine \n     occasions and attended his funeral in 2000. During the course \n     of my previous visits, I have found the dialogue with the \n     Syrian officials to be very helpful and have carried messages \n     to other foreign leaders, including Israeli prime ministers, \n     and back to the President of the United States. These visits \n     have contributed to the discussion of many issues with my \n     colleagues in the United States Congress.\n       Upon arrival I was greeted by the Charge d'Affaires, Mr. \n     William Roebuck, and our State Department Control Officer, \n     Mr. Hilary Dauer. Our first meeting was a Country Team \n     Briefing at the U.S. Embassy in Damascus with Mr. Roebuck, \n     Mr. Dauer, and the rest of the State Department staff: Maria \n     Olson, Acting Political/Economics Chief; Allen Kepchar, \n     Acting Consul General; Adrienne Nutzman, Acting Public \n     Diplomacy Chief; David Hughes, Political Section; John J. \n     Finnegan, Jr., Management Counselor; Michael Mack, Regional \n     Security Officer; and Mike McCallum, Acting Defense Attache.\n       We discussed the difficulties associated with controlling a \n     large border between Syria and Iraq and a recent Memorandum \n     of Understanding (MoU) between the nations to control the \n     traffic of foreign fighters from Yemen, Algeria, Kuwait, \n     Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere seeking to fight the U.S. forces \n     in Iraq. They explained that the Syrians have increased \n     troops on the border and have built new guard positions, but \n     that serious difficulties still remain.\n       We discussed the public stance taken by Syria on their \n     willingness to negotiate ``without preconditions'' with \n     Israel. The State Department officials explained that in \n     reality, the Syrians are interested in starting any \n     negotiations from where they previously left off. This \n     includes a return of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel, \n     as a ``basis'' for negotiations to resume. They explained \n     that since Prime Minister Sharon took office, negotiations \n     have been ``frozen'' with little interest on the Israeli \n     side. We discussed many issues including the Golan and Syrian \n     interests in Lebanon.\n       We discussed the perceived power of Bashar al-Assad as \n     compared with the influence of his father. The State \n     Department officials feel that he is not as strong as his \n     father was and does not rule with the same ``iron fist.'' \n     However, they explained that there is not much opposition to \n     President Assad within Syria. I asked if he is, or was, \n     concerned with a U.S. attempt at regime change. They felt \n     that he is less concerned now than when U.S. troops first \n     entered Iraq. Ongoing U.S. problems in Iraq and Afghanistan \n     have eased fears that the U.S. would turn next to Syria.\n       We discussed Syria's role in Lebanon, its influence over \n     Hezbollah, and its cooperation with U.N. Resolution 1701 \n     regarding the flow of arms to Hezbollah in south Lebanon. \n     They explained that Syria is a ``corridor window'' for Iran \n     to Hezbollah with strong support through Damascus, and that \n     high level political contacts play a role in the tensions in \n     Lebanon through street protests and other actions. They \n     explained that President Assad has taken various positions on \n     his influence in Lebanon in his recent visits with Senator \n     Bill Nelson, and then with Senators Christopher Dodd and John \n     Kerry.\n       We discussed the February 2005 assassination of former \n     Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the ongoing U.N. \n     investigation into the matter. The State Department staff \n     described second-hand accounts of threatening conversations \n     between President Assad and Hariri. They explained that the \n     Syrians are experts at removing the command structure from \n     the evidence, making it difficult to establish facts to back \n     up allegations. The first two reports U.N. reports by Detlev \n     Mehlis described Syrian interference in the investigation. \n     However, the most recent reports by Serge Brammertz have \n     described Syrian cooperation with the investigation.\n       Later that evening, I sat down with Syrian Foreign Minister \n     Walid al-Mouallem. He had not accepted my offer for a meeting \n     until I called him on the phone that afternoon. We discussed \n     a variety of issues including the U.S. presence in Iraq, \n     Syria's influence with Hezbollah, peace negotiations with \n     Israel, the Hariri assassination, Syrian relations with Iraq, \n     and Iran's influence in the region. We also discussed the \n     peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and the \n     complications of a government led by Hamas. We recounted our \n     previous visits and agreed that only through dialogue can we \n     achieve a common ground on the difficult issues at hand.\n       The Foreign Minister told me that it is time to rethink \n     U.S. policy towards Syria. He told me that isolating Syria \n     was not working and that we are isolating ourselves at the \n     same time. He blamed much of the instability in the Mideast \n     to the Bush Administration. He explained that in Syria, the \n     number one priority is peace in the region, including an end \n     to the Arab/Israeli conflict. When I asked why a peace \n     agreement has not been completed with Israel, he told me that \n     there is a ``lack of political will'' in Israel since Yitzhak \n     Rabin's assassination in 1995. He told me that Syria is \n     willing to negotiate with Israel without preconditions, but \n     not without the ``basis'' of ``land for peace.''\n       I asked if the problems with Hezbollah could be solved \n     through a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. He \n     answered, ``Without a doubt,'' but then explained the need \n     to resolve the issue of the Golan Heights and, in \n     particular, Shebaa Farms, a small area of disputed \n     ownership located at the junction of Israel, Syria, and \n     Lebanon controlled by Israel since 1967. When I asked if \n     U.N. Resolution 1701 would be observed in the absence of \n     an Israel/Syria peace agreement, the Foreign Minister told \n     me that in history, no ceasefire can stand without a \n     political solution. Thus, he said, it cannot stand \n     forever. When I explained the distrust in the U.S. with \n     Syria's position that they do not supply arms to \n     Hezbollah, Mouallem asked me to present proof to the \n     contrary. He told me that Syria would respond quickly with \n     corrective action if the allegation could be founded with \n     documentation.\n       On the issue of the assassination of former Lebanese Prime \n     Minister Rafik Hariri, Mouallem explained that Hariri was a \n     friend to Syria and denied involvement in his murder. ``No \n     wise man can shoot his own finger,'' he said. He told me that \n     Syria is cooperating fully with the investigation and he \n     expressed suspicion of political motives in the initial U.N. \n     Mehlis investigative reports, which said Syria was not fully \n     cooperating.\n       We discussed then-Secretary Colin Powell's 2003 visit when, \n     according to Mouallem, Powell arrived with six ``take it or \n     leave it'' demands of Syria, including closing the borders, \n     ending support for Hezbollah, ending support for Hamas in \n     Damascus, and ending its chemical program. He explained his \n     preference to seek solutions through dialogue, not through \n     demands and a threat of U.S. troops in Iraq next turning to \n     Syria. He explained that after their meeting, Powell held a \n     press conference at a nearby hotel explaining that Syria was \n     not willing to work with the U.S.\n       Despite this history, Mouallem told me that he is ``ready \n     to turn this page'' and seek constructive dialogue with the \n     U.S. with the objective of peace.\n       We discussed Syrian relations with Iraq and the recent \n     establishment of an embassy in Baghdad. According to \n     Mouallem, Syria has taken in one million refugees from Iraq \n     and took another 300,000 Lebanese during the conflict with \n     Israel this past summer. Regional stability is sought by the \n     Syrians, he explained. He discussed the recent Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MoU) for border and security cooperation \n     between Iraq and Syria focusing on information exchange and \n     improved presence and training on the borders. In our \n     meeting, the Foreign Minister declined my request to have a \n     copy of the MoU. He suggested I get a copy from the Iraqis.\n       The Foreign Minister pointed to U.S. mistakes in Iraq \n     including our being unwilling to open dialogue with all \n     factions of Iraqis including the Saddam-loyalists. If we \n     don't attract the ex-officers, he said they will simply train \n     the resistance. ``They need to eat,'' he said. He said that \n     the Maliki Government needs to be strong and decisive in \n     dismantling militias and that constitutional modifications \n     are needed to assure unity in Iraq. On the issue of a U.S. \n     timetable for withdrawal, he said that it would be immoral \n     for the U.S. to leave now and leave Iraq in the hands of \n     terrorists. He said that Syria, too, wants real leadership in \n     Iraq. He said that a timetable would oblige them to take over \n     and not leave a vacuum.\n       On the influence of Iran in the region, the Foreign \n     Minister was careful not to speak for Iran, but noted that \n     the U.S. may have missed opportunities to deal with more \n     moderate leadership in the past. We discussed Iran's efforts \n     to achieve a nuclear weapon and he said there is a double-\n     standard when we allow Israel to possess a nuclear weapon. I \n     responded by telling him that unlike India which has recently \n     been recognized by the U.S., Iran is not a responsible \n     country and has threatened to wipe Israel off the face of the \n     Earth.\n       On the following morning, I met with Syrian President \n     Bashar al-Assad at his Presidential palace in Damascus. \n     Despite the Administration's policy of isolating Syria, I \n     believe dialogue is important. My meeting with President \n     Assad in Damascus is part of increased Congressional \n     oversight in fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities \n     in foreign affairs as a reaction to unprecedented turmoil in \n     the Mideast.\n       We discussed ways that Syria could help provide stability \n     in Iraq by controlling the border and the flow of fighters \n     into, and out of, Iraq. Assad said that both sides must make \n     an effort, but Iraq is currently unable to fully enforce its \n     border. However, a recently signed Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MoU) between the two nations, which I had also \n     discussed with the Foreign\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\n     Minister, might help the situation. President Assad agreed to \n     provide a copy of the MoU.\n       President Assad explained that Syria has an interest in a \n     stable Iraq, but that U.S. policies have created instability \n     by ignoring political issues and instead focusing on security \n     issues. He attributed much of the sectarian violence in Iraq \n     to the Iraqi Constitution, as it is currently written. He \n     discussed a national conference which could be held in \n     Damascus that would bring all relevant groups in Iraq \n     together in an attempt to stop the violence. He explained \n     that U.S. involvement would be important, but that the \n     conference could not be seen as having been organized by \n     the Americans because of our poor image with many Iraqi \n     factions. He told me that the Prime Minister of Turkey has \n     already agreed, in principle, to participate. President \n     Assad expressed the importance of Iran's participation in \n     the national conference. Iran, he said, is a nation which \n     also does not want complete chaos in Iraq.\n       We discussed the possibility of resuming peace talks with \n     Israel, continuing my discussion from the night before with \n     the Foreign Minister. President Assad explained that \n     negotiations without preconditions means that any further \n     negotiations must start from the foundation of the Madrid \n     peace conference in 1991 and on where negotiations with \n     former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin left off. When I asked \n     what Israel would get in exchange for the Golan Heights, \n     President Assad said that Israel would get normal relations \n     and peace with both Syria and Lebanon, and that issues \n     related to Hezbollah would be ``solved simply.'' He \n     acknowledged the importance of the U.S. in the peace process, \n     but said that there is currently ``no vision for peace.''\n       We discussed Syria's role in Lebanon and allegations that \n     it was involved in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime \n     Minister Rafik Hariri. President Assad told me that despite \n     the conflicting reports in the Melhis and Bremmertz \n     investigations of the Hariri assassination, Syria will \n     continue to give its full support to the U.N.'s \n     investigation. President Assad denied any threatening \n     conversation in which he threatened to break Lebanon over the \n     head of Hariri, as was recounted by various second-hand \n     witnesses in the U.N. reports. He described some concerns \n     with a U.N. tribunal on the Hariri assassination and stressed \n     that it should follow the Lebanese constitution.\n       On the issue of Syria allowing arms shipments to Hezbollah, \n     President Assad said that such allegations should be backed \n     up with evidence. He said that missiles could not be smuggled \n     discretely ``like drugs on the back of a donkey,'' but could \n     only be transported by truck. On a related note, President \n     Assad warned that a decreased presence of Hezbollah in \n     Lebanon would mean an increased presence of al-Qaeda, which \n     is already active in northern Lebanon. Overall, he told me \n     that Syria still has considerable influence in Lebanon, but \n     that Syria's ``happiest day'' was when his army left Lebanon.\n       We discussed issues relating to Hamas in the peace process \n     between the Palestinians and Israelis. While unity would be \n     needed among the Palestinians, he noted that Hamas is now \n     talking about the so-called ``line of 1967'' as part of \n     future negotiations, a softening of position. He said that \n     without a comprehensive peace agreement including everyone in \n     the region, we would have a ``time bomb'' waiting to happen.\n       I asked President Assad about the two Israeli soldiers \n     captured at the beginning of the conflict between Israel and \n     Hezbollah on Israel's northern border this past summer. He \n     said that they are ready to negotiate a release in exchange \n     for some 20 individuals captured by Israel, but that a \n     mediator was needed. I also asked President Assad about an \n     Israeli soldier, Guy Hever, who went missing in the Golan \n     Heights in 1997 and is suspected to be in a Syrian prison. He \n     said that perhaps the soldier was lost in the high mountains \n     during the winter.\n       I asked President Assad about the Iranian President Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad and his comments about wiping Israel off the face \n     of the earth. President Assad said that he is not as radical \n     as we think and that we should talk to him. He said that his \n     denial that the Holocaust occurred is his own opinion. \n     President Assad expressed his opposition to nuclear weapons \n     in Iran, or any other country in the region, including \n     Israel.\n       I raised the issue of the security of the U.S. Embassy in \n     Damascus. He explained that his own office is very close to \n     the U.S. Embassy and that the entire area is well protected. \n     Closing the street, he said, would not improve security as it \n     would still be vulnerable to missile attack. Instead, he \n     suggested that the Embassy move to a new area outside \n     Damascus and a pledge of timely approvals and availability of \n     land was made.\n       President Assad told me that he wanted to travel to the \n     U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York in 2005, but the \n     U.S. government would not issue a visa.\n       Before leaving Syria on December 26, I held a press \n     conference at the airport to discuss my meetings.\n\n\n                                 israel\n\n       On December 26, we departed Damascus for Israel. Our travel \n     required a technical stop in Amman, Jordan. Upon our arrival \n     in Israel, we were met by Peter Vrooman of the U.S. \n     Embassy in Tel Aviv who briefed me on the current issues \n     while on the long car ride to Jerusalem. Along the way, we \n     stopped at my father's gravesite in Holon, Israel.\n       On the morning of December 27th, I met with the U.S. \n     Ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones. I briefed the \n     Ambassador on my meetings with the Syrian Foreign Minister \n     and President in Damascus. We discussed the details of the \n     land issues related to the Golan Heights and Shebaa Farms, \n     the fragile ceasefire created under U.N. Resolution 1701 and \n     the need for a political solution, the perception that the \n     U.S. would seek regime change in Syria following the 2003 \n     invasion of Iraq, and the U.S. policy of pressuring Syria \n     through isolation. We discussed the threat posed to Israel by \n     Iran and discussed the positive impact of Saddam Hussein's \n     removal for Israel.\n       Later that morning, the Ambassador and I met with former \n     Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I told him about \n     my trip and my meetings with Syrian President Assad. We \n     discussed the Syrian President's interest in resuming peace \n     negotiations from where they last left off, with the obvious \n     inclusion of the Golan Heights in any discussion. Netanyahu \n     explained that peace is based on deterrence and that once you \n     give Syria the Golan Heights, one must ask themselves what \n     remains to keeps President Assad to his word of providing \n     normal relations and peace. He told me about his 1998 \n     discussions with Hafez al-Asad which abruptly ended in \n     disagreement over the Golan Heights. The former Prime \n     Minister told me that, unlike the statements of Syria, he \n     does have preconditions to talking with Syria, namely that \n     they stop waging war against Israel. ``They are killing my \n     countrymen,'' he said.\n       We also discussed the Iranian President's comments \n     regarding the Holocaust never happening and his desire to see \n     Israel wiped off the earth. I related Iran's nuclear \n     ambitions to those of India, a country which can be trusted. \n     He told me that President Bush is doing a good job of \n     pressuring Iran, but said that the ``noose must remain \n     tight.''\n       On the afternoon of December 27th, we met with Israel's \n     Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. We discussed President Assad's \n     interest in negotiating a peace agreement with Israel. She \n     suggested that while President Assad may be sending signals \n     for negotiations, in reality he may just want to ease the \n     international pressure that currently exists on Syria due to \n     the Hariri investigation and allegations of arms transfers to \n     Hezbollah. She said that Syria's intentions must be clearly \n     understood before engaging in talks. I told her that \n     President Assad said a mediator was needed to allow for the \n     release of the two captured Israeli soldiers. She said that \n     Kofi Annan had already tried, but little progress is actually \n     being made.\n       Overall, she said little progress is being made right now \n     on either the Israel/Syria front or between Israel and the \n     Palestinians. ``Only headlines,'' she said. She said there is \n     a desire to negotiate with Palestinian moderates towards a \n     two-state solution and said she ``smelled signs'' of \n     progress, as evidenced by a recent December 23rd meeting \n     between Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President \n     Mahmoud Abbas. When I noted that we live in a changing world \n     where terrorist groups want to participate in politics, she \n     suggested that rules should be established to prevent such \n     practices.\n       We discussed Israel's decision-making process and its \n     practice of consultation with the U.S. before taking action. \n     Foreign Minister Livni explained that the U.S. and Israel \n     share many of the same values and interests in the region and \n     it does not benefit either country to surprise the other \n     without first consulting on an issue. I agreed. I urged \n     Israel to be independent and to follow its own interests.\n       On the issue of Iran, Foreign Minister Livni said that the \n     world cannot afford to allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons. \n     She expressed her fear that a ``domino effect'' could occur \n     where others in the Mideast will either appease Iran in the \n     interest of safety, or they will seek nuclear weapons of \n     their own for deterrence. She cited the need for stronger, \n     ``real'' sanctions against Iran.\n       That evening the Ambassador and I met with Israeli Prime \n     Minister Ehud Olmert at his offices in Jerusalem. I briefed \n     the Prime Minister on my meeting with Syrian President Bashar \n     al-Assad. I told him that President Assad says he wants to \n     negotiate with Israel and that he says he can be helpful in \n     dealing with Hamas and Helzbollah. The Prime Minister said he \n     was ``more than interested'' to hear this message, but also \n     said, ``I don't want to fool myself and my friends.'' He \n     cited Syrian support for terrorist groups including Hamas, a \n     group whose leader Khaled Mashal ``sits in Damascus.'' He \n     said Israel would need a ``credible sign'' that Assad is \n     sincere before giving him legitimacy that he currently \n     doesn't deserve.\n       The Prime Minister described resolving the conflict with \n     the Palestinians as his top priority. The Prime Minister told \n     me about his meeting on December 23rd with President Mahmoud \n     Abbas. He described it as an important bilateral step without \n     the assistance of the U.S., or anyone else. He characterized \n     the meeting as ``very difficult, but very significant.'' As a \n     result of that meeting, he said $100 million would be \n     unfrozen for humanitarian and security purposes.\n       On the issue of U.S. involvement in Iraq, he said he was \n     glad that Saddam Hussein is gone. He would not give his \n     opinion on whether the U.S. should draw back its forces. He \n     did note that pulling out prematurely ``would encourage \n     radical countries.''\n       On the issue of Iran, the Prime Minister described \n     Ahmadinejad as a ``madman'' in\n\n[[Page S544]]\n\n     control of a nation of over 70 million people. He suggested \n     that economic measures should also be taken outside of the \n     U.N. Security Council to pressure Iran, particularly from \n     European Union member countries.\n       Despite the regional difficulties, the Prime Minister told \n     me that the economic situation in Israel is better than ever. \n     Over the last year, Israel has seen a positive balance of \n     trade with overall growth of 4.8 percent and low inflation. \n     Before the conflict in south Lebanon, growth was projected at \n     only one percent.\n       On the morning of December 28th, I held a press conference \n     at the David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem to discuss my foreign \n     travel, particularly my meetings in Syria and in Israel.\n       Following my press conference, I was joined by Michael \n     Schreuder of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, and by Jake \n     Walles, Consul General and Chief of Mission in Jerusalem. We \n     traveled into the West Bank for several meetings in Ramallah.\n       Our first meeting in Ramallah was with Salam Fayyad, a \n     Palestinian in the Third Way party who was the Finance \n     Minister of the Palestinian National Authority in the Fatah \n     government in 2002. He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the \n     University of Texas at Austin and has lived in the U.S. for \n     over 10 years. He explained his interests in decency and \n     fundamental human values, qualities which will help the \n     Palestinian people be better neighbors to Israel.\n       We discussed his successful reforms in his three and a half \n     years as Finance Minister. He explained that many of those \n     reforms are not being carried out by the current government.\n       He explained that despite the undesirable outcome of the \n     January 2006 elections, he and other like-minded people are \n     still trying to make progress with Israel and are focusing on \n     providing security. He noted that Hamas is having many \n     problems because of their lack of governmental experience, \n     but still found it difficult to see how elections could be \n     held in the near future. Hamas, he said, is a real problem, \n     because they do not recognize Israel and they judge right and \n     wrong based on ideology and fixed notions of the world. He \n     acknowledged that Hamas will always be part of the system, \n     but he hoped it would not continue to be a majority.\n       We discussed the recent meeting between President Abbas and \n     Prime Minister Olmert. We also discussed the threat posed to \n     Israel by Iran and Syria's behavior in Lebanon, which he \n     characterized as ``disgusting.'' Fayyad said he has a harder \n     time believing President Bashar al-Assad than he did his \n     father.\n       We then joined Hannan Ashrawi, also a member of the Third \n     Way party, for lunch in Ramallah. She explained that under \n     the Hamas government, the ``republic has become polarized,'' \n     alternatives have not been permitted to rise, and people have \n     lost their sense of volunteerism. According to Ashrawi, there \n     is currently no process for peace and there hasn't been since \n     2000. However, she explained that some options exist for \n     President Abbas to negotiate, even though the powers of the \n     President were reduced in 2002 when the position of Prime \n     Minister was created.\n       We discussed the Palestinian distaste for Israeli \n     occupation within the West Bank. She said that Israeli \n     occupation includes control over the airspace, borders, and \n     checkpoints. She described the difficulties of carrying out \n     even the most mundane tasks as a Palestinian, such as going \n     to the airport. She described the checkpoints as being there \n     ``to humiliate.'' We discussed the technicalities of what \n     appears to be a new settlement in the West Bank, which Israel \n     claims is only an expansion inside an existing area and not \n     in violation of its commitment to the U.S. of no new \n     settlements.\n       We discussed my meeting with Syrian President Assad, the \n     potential for future talks with Israel, the difficult \n     situation of a Hamas majority in government, the \n     possibilities for new elections, and the need to engage in \n     dialogue with Iran.\n       Early that evening back in Jerusalem, I met with the mother \n     of an Israeli soldier, Guy Hever, who is believed to be a \n     prisoner in a Syrian jail. Mr. Hever disappeared on the Golan \n     Heights near the Syrian border on August 17, 1997. I \n     previously met his mother on November 6, 2002, and wrote \n     President Assad asking for an inquiry into Mr. Hever's \n     whereabouts. I raised the issue in person with the Syrian \n     President on January 3, 2003, and again in my most recent \n     meeting on December 26, 2006.\n       That evening in Jerusalem, I met with Saeb Erakat, Head of \n     the Negotiations Affairs Department for the Palestine \n     Liberation Organization. We discussed my visit to Syria and \n     its stability under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. He \n     told me that Hafez al-Assad used to ``play Iran as a card, \n     but now Ahmadinejad plays Assad as a card.''\n       On the situation with Hamas, he said there is no \n     alternative but to seek elections. However, he said that \n     Fatah needs to change in a short period of time. It was \n     beaten by a ``party without a program.'' If Hamas sees that \n     Fatah remains weak and does not come up with a plan, it may \n     call for elections again and take more power in government.\n       We discussed the December 23rd meeting between President \n     Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert, a meeting Mr. Erakat \n     attended. He explained that many Palestinians did not want to \n     see the meeting occur and it fell into place at the very last \n     minute. He praised the courage and leadership of President \n     Abbas for ``sticking his neck out'' to start something. \n     Permanent solutions were not on the table. Rather, four \n     committees focusing on security, economy, prisoners, and \n     sustaining the ceasefire were created to attempt to answer \n     the question of ``where do we go from here.'' He explained \n     that a third party in negotiations is helpful, but that the \n     ``real work'' must be done on a bilateral basis. He expressed \n     his optimism that future negotiations can succeed despite \n     interference and violence spurred by Hamas.\n       Mr. Erakat requested that the U.S. Congress ease \n     limitations on aid to Palestinians, citing the need to show \n     that President Abbas can deliver for his people.\n       We also discussed Iran's emerging influence in the region \n     and its impact on the Palestinian people. Mr. Erakat \n     suggested adding another nation to the maps instead of \n     Ahmadinejad's suggestion that Israel be wiped off the map.\n\n\n                                 ITALY\n\n       On the morning of December 29th, we departed Israel for a \n     stopover in Rome, Italy, on the way back to the U.S. Upon our \n     arrival, we were greeted by our State Department Control \n     Officer Mikael McCowan. We drove to the U.S. Embassy and \n     discussed a variety of issues during a Country Team Briefing \n     with the embassy staff headed by Ms. Anna M. Borg, Deputy \n     Chief of Mission. Ambassador Ronald P. Spogli was not in \n     Italy during my visit.\n       We discussed U.S. relations with the new ``left of center'' \n     government which has withdrawn Italy's 3,000 troops from \n     Iraq. We discussed other forms of military cooperation \n     between the U.S. and Italy, including ties with American \n     businesses selling arms to Italy. Elsewhere, Italy has some \n     8,400 troops stationed around the world. Following on the \n     summer conflict in Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel, \n     Italy has played a major role in the peacekeeping operation \n     by providing 2,400 troops, the largest contingent of any \n     country. They are also playing an important role in \n     Afghanistan with some 2,000 troops. Italy also has some 3,500 \n     troops stationed in the Balkans.\n       We also discussed the judicial structure in Italy where \n     there are three independent levels of jurisdiction, the \n     latest developments on the reported Italian cooperation with \n     CIA renditions, Italy's economy, and its relations with Iran. \n     They explained that Italy, which has a sizeable amount of \n     trade with Iran, has been put in a difficult situation by \n     having to support sanctions against Iran for its nuclear \n     proliferation efforts.\n       On December 30, 2006, we departed Rome, Italy, and returned \n     to the United States.\n       I ask unanimous consent that the following be included in \n     the Congressional Record as if read on the Senate floor:\n       1.

My letter to President Bashar al-Assad dated January 5, \n     2007\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2006.\n     Philip Mathew,\n     Managing Editor, Malayala Manorama,\n     Kerala, India\n       Dear Mr. Mathew: I was very surprised by your newspaper's \n     account of my interview with your board of editors on \n     December 19, 2006 in Kerala, India.\n       Contrary to your report, as to the war in Iraq, I said only \n     that had the U.S. known Saddam didn't have weapons of mass \n     destruction we would not have gone to war. Once there, we \n     could not precipitously withdraw and leave the country \n     destabilized.\n       I did not say that the U.S. war was widely characterized as \n     being against the Muslim community.\n       The U.S. has already explained that faulty intelligence led \n     to the conclusion that Saddam had weapons of mass \n     destruction. Beyond faulty intelligence, I did not say that \n     U.S. policy required more thoughtful consideration.\n       As to Guantanamo Bay, I said that the U.S. should allow \n     habeas Corpus to determine if detainees are properly treated.\n       As to a permanent seat for India on the U.N.

Bush has \n     said he would not change his policy regarding those two \n     countries; Specter thinks he should.\n       ``I disagree with the policy of not dealing with Iran,'' he \n     said.\n       ``When he [Ahmadinejad] says he wants to wipe Israel off \n     the face of the earth, I'd like to tell him how unacceptable \n     that is,'' Specter said, explaining what he would tell \n     Ahmadinejad.\n       ``When he says there was no Holocaust, I'd like to tell him \n     about the Holocaust survivors I've talked to, and about how \n     much evidence there is about the Holocaust. Yes I'd like to \n     see the president of Iran, he could use some information,'' \n     he said.\n       Specter brushed aside the criticism of his trip to Damascus \n     that was voiced by some in the Bush Administration who argued \n     that his visit, as well as recent visits by three democratic \n     senators, granted legitimacy to the Syrian government. \n     Specter said that as a member of the powerful Senate \n     appropriations committee that sends billions of dollars each \n     year to the Middle East, he was dutybound to see first hand \n     what was happening in the region.\n       Specter said that while he acquiesced to the Bush \n     Administration's request not to visit Damascus on previous \n     tours to the region last December and August, ``this year in \n     coming it seemed to me that the Administration's program is \n     not working.''\n       Regarding what he hoped to achieve by going to Damascus, \n     Specter said, ``I believe that all the wisdom doesn't lie \n     with the Administration, there are others of us who have \n     studied the matters in detail, have made contributions in the \n     past, and have something to add here.''\n       The senior Pennsylvania senator said that while he had a \n     great deal of respect and admiration for US President George \n     W. Bush, there were issues with which he did not agree with \n     the president, and that it was his responsibility ``to speak \n     up, and do so in an independent way.''\n       Specter said he did not believe that his visit ``alters the \n     issue of legitimacy'' regarding Syria, and pointed out that \n     the US talked to the leaders of the Soviet Union even though \n     there was a Cold War for decades, and that the US talked with \n     the Chinese despite disagreements over slave labor.\n       Specter reiterated what he said in Damascus earlier this \n     week, that the Syrians were interested in entering into \n     negotiations with Israel without preconditions, and that \n     Syrian President Bashar Assad had told him that in return \n     Syria could be helpful in dealing both with Hamas and \n     Hizbullah.\n       Specter said that Assad denied that arms were being \n     smuggled into Lebanon through Syria.\n       Asked whether he believed Assad, Specter, who has met with \n     him five times and with his father Hafez Assad nine times, \n     said, ``I don't know, I can not make the judgment on that, \n     the Israelis will have to do that.''\n       Specter, who has served in the senate for 26 years, said \n     that the situation in the Middle East is more problematic now \n     than at any time since he was first elected.\n       ``I do not see anyway out except through dialogue,'' he \n     said. ``I do not think there are any assurances that dialogue \n     will succeed, but I think there are assurances that without \n     dialogue there will be failure.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Jan. 5, 2007]\n\n       Why Congress Can and Must Assert Itself in Foreign Policy\n\n                        (By Sen. Arlen Specter)\n\n       My recent meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in \n     Damascus is part of increased congressional oversight in \n     fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities in foreign \n     affairs as a reaction to unprecedented turmoil in the Middle \n     East. As I mentioned in an extensive Senate speech in the \n     July 16, 2006, Congressional Record, and also in an article \n     in the current issue of the Washington Quarterly, significant \n     results have flowed from my meetings with foreign leaders \n     (some of whom have been unsavory), over the last two decades.\n       The starting point is a senator's constitutional duty to \n     participate, make judgments, and vote on foreign affairs. In \n     26 years in the Senate, I chaired the Intelligence Committee \n     in the 104th Congress and have served on the appropriations \n     subcommittees on defense and foreign operations. Senators \n     vote on ratification of treaties, on the confirmation of \n     cabinet offices including the Departments of State and \n     Defense, and on appropriations of $8 billion a month for Iraq \n     and Afghanistan and more than $500 billion annually for \n     military and homeland defense. Under the constitutional \n     doctrine of separation of powers, senators are purposefully \n     independent of the executive branch to provide checks and \n     balances. Accordingly, Congress has a vital role in the \n     formation and execution of foreign policy.\n       My foreign travels have included 16 visits to Damascus \n     since 1984 involving nine meetings with President Hafiz al-\n     Assad and four with his son, President Bashar al-Assad. When \n     the administration asked me not to go to Syria when I was in \n     the region in December 2005 and August 2006, I deferred to \n     that judgment. But now--with the Middle East embroiled in a \n     civil war in Iraq, a fragile cease-fire between Hezbollah and \n     Israel, and warfare between Fattah and Hamas undercutting any \n     potential peace process between Israel and the Palestinians--\n     I decided it was time for Congress to assert its role in \n     foreign policy. My decision was influenced by the 2006 \n     election, which rejected U.S. policies in Iraq, and by the \n     Baker-Hamilton Group report on Iraq, urging direct dialogue \n     with foreign adversaries including Syria.\n       My talks with Assad, following his meetings with Sens. Bill \n     Nelson (D., Fla.), Chris Dodd (D., Conn.), and John Kerry \n     (D., Mass.), produced his commitment to tighten the Iraqi-\n     Syrian border to impede terrorists and insurgents from \n     infiltrating Iraq. In my meeting, Assad made a new offer for \n     Syria to host an international conference with all factions \n     in the Iraqi conflict and other regional powers to try to \n     find a formula for peace. I carried a strong State Department \n     message to Assad concerning Syria's obligations under U.N. \n     Resolution 1701 not to arm Hezbollah, and Syria's obligations \n     to cooperate with the U.N. investigation into the \n     assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri.\n       Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was interested in the \n     nuances of my conversation with Assad on Syria's potential \n     assistance with Hezbollah and Hamas as part of an Israeli-\n     Syrian peace treaty involving the Golan Heights. When I met \n     with Olmert, he appeared to be moderating his prior \n     opposition to Israeli-Syrian peace talks, perhaps as a result \n     of many voices, including mine, urging him to do so.\n       In previous trips to Damascus, especially in the 1990s, I \n     relayed messages between then-President Hafiz al-Assad of \n     Syria--who initially refused to participate in an \n     International Conference with Israel unless sponsored by all \n     five permanent members of the Security Council--and then-\n     Prime Minister Itzhak Shamir of Israel. Shamir would attend \n     such a conference only if it were organized by the United \n     States and the Soviet Union. Shamir did not want to deal with \n     four adversaries and only one friend. Whether my efforts to \n     persuade Assad to accede to Shamir's terms had any effect is \n     speculative, but it is a fact that Syria went to the Madrid \n     Conference in 1991 sponsored by the United States and the \n     Soviet Union.\n       Shortly after becoming Israeli prime minister in 1996, \n     Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel would hold Syria \n     responsible for Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Syria then \n     realigned its troops near the border with Israel, creating \n     considerable tension in the region. Netanyahu asked me to \n     carry a message to Assad that Israel wanted peace, which I \n     did. I was later credited by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid \n     al-Moualem with aiding in relieving the tension.\n       In many visits to Damascus, I urged Assad to let Syrian \n     Jews emigrate. Assad at first refused, saying it would be a \n     brain drain. It is hard to say whether my appeals influenced \n     Assad's later decision to let the Syrian Jews go. These and \n     other results from my many trips to Damascus are cited in \n     contemporaneous Senate floor statements reporting on those \n     visits.\n       More, rather than less, congressional attention is needed \n     on U.S. foreign policy generally and on the Middle East in \n     particular. While we can't be sure that dialogue will \n     succeed, we can be sure that without dialogue there will be \n     failure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 2007.\n     His Excellency Bashar al-Assad,\n     President, Syrian Arab Republic,\n     Damascus, Syria.\n       Dear President Assad: I am writing to thank you for your \n     hospitality during my recent visit to your country. I found \n     our discussion to be very insightful and believe it will \n     prove useful as I continue to advocate for a renewed dialogue \n     between our governments. I would also like to renew a request \n     for your assistance in determining the fate of Mr. Guy Hever, \n     an Israeli soldier who disappeared from the Golan Heights on \n     August 17, 2006. I have raised this matter with you on \n     several occasions, most recently during our meeting on \n     December 26, 2006.\n       According to information provided to my office, at the time \n     of Mr. Hever's disappearance, he was dressed in army \n     fatigues, wore a military disk numbered 5210447, and carried \n     a key chain and identification papers (Geneva Convention \n     Card). Despite a thorough search, no trace of the missing \n     soldier has ever been found. Some have suggested that Mr. \n     Hever may have illegally crossed the Israeli-Syrian border, \n     leading to his detention in a Syrian jail.\n       I have twice met with Mr. Hever's mother, most recently on \n     December 28, 2006. The long interval of time which has passed \n     since Mr. Hever's disappearance has caused his family great \n     pain. Given that your personal intervention could potentially \n     end the Hever's family's search for answers, I respectfully \n     request that you order an inquiry to determine if any Syrian \n     authority could assist in resolving Mr. Hever's whereabouts \n     and well being.\n       Thank you once again for your hospitality and your \n     consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S545-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S545-S546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRO BONO REPRESENTATION FOR GUANTANAMO DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note another Senator in the Chamber \nwaiting to speak, so I will be relatively brief in comments on one \nother subject.\n  I note that an official in the Department of Justice has challenged \nthe attorneys who have been doing pro bono\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nwork for detainees at Guantanamo, raising an issue as to whether that \nrepresentation is proper and raising the suggestions that their \ncorporate employers might be interested in reconsidering their \nemployment based on their representation of the detainees at \nGuantanamo.\n  It is a little hard to understand how anyone in 2007 would raise a \nquestion about pro bono work being done by lawyers who may be \nundertaking or who are undertaking unpopular causes. That has been the \nlong tradition of the legal profession.\n  The first noteworthy example was Andrew Hamilton, a famous \nPhiladelphia lawyer who represented Peter Zenger at the time when there \nwere hostilities between the United States and Great Britain. Andrew \nHamilton took on an unpopular cause and set the standard for lawyers to \ndo just that.\n  I recollect the trials under the Smith Act of the Communists where \nlawyers of the highest repute undertook the representation of the \ndefendants in those cases, a highly unpopular matter. And in the \nPhiladelphia prosecution of the Smith Act, some of the most \ndistinguished lawyers of the city, again, undertook that \nrepresentation.\n  A lawyer's duty is to undertake the representation of a client, and \nit is up to the court to make a decision on whether the attorney is \nright or the attorney is wrong.\n  This challenge by a Department of Defense official is in line with \nthe recent position of the Department of Justice in seeking to limit \nthe right to counsel for corporate officials who are being \ninvestigated, with the Department of Justice under the so-called \nThompson memorandum taking the position that charges might be increased \nif the firm and the individual did not waive the attorney-client \nprivilege. Then the Department of Justice objected to the firm paying \nthe legal fees.\n  A Federal judge in the Southern District of New York has already \ndeclared it unconstitutional to challenge the payment of the legal \nfees.\n  I have introduced legislation which would revise the Department of \nJustice policy even further than the revision by Deputy Attorney \nGeneral McNaulty in the so-called McNaulty memorandum.\n  But when lawyers undertake the representation of individuals in \nunpopular causes, they are entitled to praise and not criticism.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, this afternoon I will have the \nglorious opportunity to travel to the White House to celebrate the 2006 \nWorld Champion St. Louis Cardinals, and the echoes of the cheers of St. \nLouis I will hear.\n  But today there are even stronger cheers coming from the angels in \nHeaven because today the angels in Heaven are cheering for a lifetime \nof kindness and compassion that belonged to the Missouri legend, Larry \nStewart.\n  Larry was known by many names--dad, son, husband, friend--but his \nfavorite name was Secret Santa. This was a title that was given him by \nhundreds and thousands of anonymous people he had helped over the 26 \nyears that he had a very special way of celebrating our Christmas \nholiday.\n  Larry Stewart knew something of the life of those he had helped, but \nlike any legendary, larger-than-life superhero, he remained \nmysteriously anonymous until the closing days of his life. He grew up \npoor in Mississippi, later telling stories about how he resorted to \nsleeping in his car early on just to get by. He, in fact, was homeless.\n  He told a story of how in 1971 he was eating in a diner, and when the \ntime came to pay for his meal, he realized he didn't have the money. He \nsaw a $20 bill had been dropped next to him on the counter, and he got \nthe attention of the man he had seen drop the $20 bill. The man turned \nout to be the owner, and the $20 bill had been dropped on purpose. It \nwas a subtle gift trying to not make Larry Stewart feel uncomfortable \nabout not having the money to pay for his meal. Larry Stewart would \nnever forget that moment.\n  Years later in 1979, well into his career as a businessman, he faced \nhis second Christmas season unemployed. Worried about how he was going \nto take care of his young family and receiving the news that he had \njust lost another job, he saw a carhop working outside in the cold with \nvery little to keep her warm. Faced with the situation that his \nproblems were not as serious as hers, he gave the woman a $20 tip, and \nthe joy that $20 tip gave him began a tradition that lasted the next 26 \nyears of his life.\n  I was lucky enough to be in his very wide circle of friends in Kansas \nCity. I was even more fortunate because there was a time when he turned \nto me and said: Claire, would you like to go on a sleigh ride?\n  I said of course, welcoming the opportunity to see Larry Stewart do \nwhat really no one else realized he was doing.\n  The sleigh ride went something like this: We met at Larry's home \nearly in the morning near Christmas. He wore always white overalls--he \nwas a big man--white overalls with a bright red flannel shirt. We would \nsit in his kitchen drinking coffee. He would be exuberant with \nexcitement as to what was going to happen that day. He would stuff his \npockets with mountains of cash. His dear friend, Tom Phillips--then a \nsheriff's deputy, now the sheriff of Jackson County--would accompany us \nto make sure that our journey was safe, and off we would go in a large \nSuburban with another few fortunate friends to watch Santa do his work.\n  He had a method. I asked him one time: Larry, how do you decide where \nyou go to spread this money?\n  He said: I try to go places where people are doing their best to get \nby.\n\n  So we would travel to autopart stores where people at the Christmas \nseason were trying to buy that battery to make that car work. We would \ntravel to bus stops where he would love to find people dressed in fast-\nfood uniforms trying to catch a bus to work.\n  The Suburban would slow down, and Larry would hop out. We would all \nget out. Quickly he would approach the people and stuff $100 bills in \ntheir hands and say: Merry Christmas.\n  Astonished, these people would look up suspiciously, thinking that \nmaybe something was wrong. Then they realized: It was just a wonderful, \nkind man spreading Christmas cheer.\n  We would go into laundromats. We would go into 7-Elevens. We would go \nanywhere that Larry thought he would find people who were doing their \nbest and having a difficult time making ends meet during the holiday \nseason. I watched Larry Stewart hand out thousands and thousands of \ndollars to people who were astonished at his generosity, strangers he \nhad never seen before and would never see again. Every Christmas, year \nafter year, this was his tradition.\n  Those sleigh rides I took with Larry Stewart are some of the most \nmemorable days of my life. I will never forget the feelings that washed \nover me as I watched the true spirit of Christmas in operation.\n  On every sleigh ride he would always find some special recipients. \nThis was research he did ahead of time, trying to find families who \nwere really in need. The stories that I have to tell of those special \nmoments I can literally cry thinking of what I witnessed.\n  I remember one instance where we drove to the suburbs of Kansas City \nand pulled up in front of a very modest home. I asked Larry what he was \ndoing. He explained to me that there was a woman who lived in this \nhouse who had to get dialysis three times a week. She lived with her \ndaughter. Her daughter was a single mom with three kids. They had a \nbroken down van, and her daughter would have to arrange her three jobs \nshe worked to try to take her mother into Kansas City for dialysis, and \ninvariably the van would break down.\n  Larry heard about this situation, and this was going to be one of his \nspecial Christmas gifts. He had a van outfitted with a handicap ramp \nfor her wheelchair, a brandnew van, and he had it fixed up with a giant \nred bow. He had someone driving it who had a remote-controlled walkie-\ntalkie.\n  Up we go to the front door of this house. Larry pounds on the door in \nhis white overalls and red flannel shirt, and peeking through the door \nis the very suspicious daughter. I am standing over to the side \nwatching all this.\n  Larry says to this woman: Merry Christmas. I hear that you are having \na\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\nhard time getting your mom to dialysis.\n  You can hear her mother in the background saying: Who is it? Who is \nit? Who is it? Her mother, with difficulty, comes to the door and is \nstanding just behind her daughter.\n  This daughter says: Yes.\n  You can see the broken down van in the driveway.\n  Larry says: I want to try to help to see if we can't get your mom to \ndialysis with a little more reliability, and with that he talks into \nthe walkie-talkie and says:\n  Bring it around. And around the corner comes the new van with a big \nred ribbon on it. It pulls into the driveway, and with that, Larry \nhands the daughter an envelope with $10,000 in cash in it and says: \nMerry Christmas.\n  He walks away and says: The title is in the van.\n  Of course, you can imagine the reaction of these women--shocked, \nsurprised, joy. And, of course, I am balling like a baby standing \nthere, as all of us were. There were about four of us who watched this \nevent.\n  That is just one story I can tell, but imagine having the privilege \nof seeing that kind of scene played over and over several years in a \nrow when I was fortunate enough to be on the sleigh ride. This was an \nextraordinary man.\n  During the time he was playing Secret Santa in Kansas City and across \nour country, he gave out $1.3 million in cash. Kansas City was lucky \nenough to receive most of his gifts, but he also landed his sleigh \nfrequently in his home State of Mississippi, Florida after the \nhurricanes, New Orleans after Katrina, New York after 9/11, and this \npast Christmas, his last, knowing that it was probably his last, he \ntraveled to Chicago to spread cheer around his dear friend Buck \nO'Neil's neighborhood where Buck O'Neil grew up poor. Buck O'Neil was \none of his best friends and, of course, another Kansas City legend we \nlost last year.\n  He told the public about his role as Secret Santa last Christmas, so \nthe world knew who Secret Santa finally was. Thousands of people who \nreceived his generous spirit contacted him in the closing days of his \nlife. He called me on Christmas Eve to say this was the most special \nChristmas of all because of the outpouring of love he had felt from all \nof the people he had helped over the years. What Mr. Stewart, who had \nbuilt a fortune from nothing, may have seen as a small holiday gift was \nactually a gesture of compassion so few experience or ever understand \ndue to the frenetic pace of our lives.\n\n  Known by his family and friends and colleagues for a soul born of \nkindness and warmth and a personality as unassuming as his generosity \nwas great, Larry kept his identity under wraps until this year. He was \ndiagnosed with esophageal cancer and in his last months his identity \nwas revealed. When word spread, he was flooded with national media \nattention about which he could care less. Frankly, he didn't even want \nto handle it. But he was excited because he realized he had an \nopportunity to spread what he had done to others and hopefully have it \ncatch on. He loved hearing the stories, but he continually said to all \nof us this was not about him. It was God's work. He was merely a \nservant of his Lord.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring and celebrating the life of \nLarry Stewart, Missouri's own Secret Santa. I ask that this \ndistinguished body join me in extending our greatest sympathies to his \nfamily: Paulette, Joe, John, Kim, and Mark, and the thousands who, like \nme, were fortunate enough to call him a dear friend.\n  Mr. Stewart's gifts of hope touched many recipients. However, the \ncompassion that drove his generosity was contagious to all who knew him \nand that was even a greater gift. As we honor Larry today, let us \nrejoice in his life, remember his kindness, his sense of humor, and \nrevel in his generosity. He was Santa. He was real, right down to the \ntwinkle in his eye. He loved others as the good Lord intended. May his \nlegacy of kindness always be a reminder to us all to spread hope and \ncompassion to one another.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, there has been good progress made on ethics \nand lobbying reform. We have had a good debate. It is time to move to \npassage of this meritorious legislation.\n  We will have three votes beginning at 5:30 this afternoon. First we \nwill vote on the Durbin amendment to strengthen the definition of \n``targeted tax benefit'' and other aspects of Senator DeMint's earmark \ndisclosure proposal. I appreciate Senator DeMint working with Senator \nDurbin and others to strengthen his amendment.\n  Second, we will vote on the underlying DeMint amendment on earmark \ndisclosure.\n  Finally, we will vote to invoke cloture on an amendment that I \noffered strengthening the rules on gifts and travel, including travel \non private airplanes. Once cloture is invoked on that key amendment, we \ncan move forward to finishing the bill this week. As I announced this \nmorning, we are going to finish the bill this week. If we finish it \nThursday at 10 o'clock, we will be finished with votes for the week. If \nwe finish it Saturday at 10 o'clock, we will be finished with votes for \nthe week. But we will finish this legislation.\n  This ethics reform bill is vitally important to Congress and the \nAmerican people. Over the past few years, the media has been filled \nwith stories of elected officials who have violated the public trust \noften in their dealings with lobbyists. Each episode of public \ncorruption contributes to the public's growing cynicism about Congress \nand other institutions of Government.\n  First, let me say, lobbyists are not a class who should be denigrated \nin any way. They render a vital service to their constituents and to \nCongress. So I want everyone to know we are not trying to berate \nlobbyists. What we are saying with this legislation is we need to know \nmore about what lobbyists are doing. I think it is going to help them, \nit will help us, and it will certainly give the American people more \nconfidence in Government.\n\n  Think what this country has gone through. For the first time in 131 \nyears, a person working in the White House is indicted. That trial is \nstarting today. In addition to that, a person the President appointed \nto handle Government contracts involving billions of dollars, Mr. \nSafavian, was led away from his office in handcuffs and has been \nconvicted.\n  Two former Members of the House of Representatives are now in prison \nfor selling legislative favors--in prison. A third Member of the House \nof Representatives, one who has served as the second highest official \nin the House of Representatives, was forced to resign from Congress \nbecause he was indicted. There are other investigations going on as we \nspeak. If there were ever a time when Congress and the executive branch \nneeded to take dramatic action to show the American people we are \nserious about restoring public trust in Government, this is the time. \nThat is what we have tried to do.\n  That is what I tried to do with this legislation. In order to send a \nmessage about the importance of ethics reform, I designated the bill as \nS. 1 and brought it to the floor on the first day of legislative \nactivity, meaning that it is an extremely important piece of \nlegislation in the minds of the country, the Congress, the Democrats, \nand the Republicans. I say the Republicans because I asked the minority \nleader to cosponsor S. 1 with me, something that hadn't been done for \nmore than 30 years. I did this because I wanted to show this issue \ntranscends partisan politics.\n  The bill I introduced with Senator McConnell on the first day of the \n110th Congress is a very strong piece of legislation. It is based on \nthe text of the bill that passed the Senate last year.\n  What does it do? It prohibits lobbyists from giving gifts to \nlawmakers and their staffs. It prohibits lobbyists from paying for \ntrips or taking part in privately funded congressional travel. It \nrequires public disclosure of earmarks. It slows the revolving door by \nextending to 2 years the ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress.\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\n  It makes pay-to-play schemes such as the ``K Street project'' a \nviolation of Senate rules.\n  It makes lobbying more transparent by doubling the frequency of \nreporting and requiring a searchable electronic database.\n  The K Street project. What was that all about? What it was all about \nis that lobbyists met with Members of Congress--initially they even met \nhere in the Capitol, and then they moved the meetings downtown at a \nlater time. They would discuss what job openings there were and, of \ncourse, the only people who were eligible for hire were Republicans \nand, in fact, companies actually got in trouble with the K Street \nproject, members of the Majority party at the time, for hiring \nDemocrats. That is what part of this legislation is going to prevent.\n  This bill we have introduced, S. 1, would require for the first time \nthe disclosure of shadowy business coalitions that engage in the so-\ncalled ``astroturf'' lobbying campaigns. What does this mean? It means \nthese grassroots campaigns will be able to continue, but there will \nhave to be disclosure of paid campaigns that are, in effect, financing \nthese so-called grassroots campaigns. The American people should know \nwhy, suddenly showing up here in Washington or the State capital or one \nof the other States, these groups are trying to affect legislation, and \nthey wonder why they are trying to do it. The fact is it is because we \nhave lobbyists representing different organizations paying for all \nthis. This would be prevented.\n  Even though S. 1 is an extremely sound, strong piece of legislation, \nI wanted to show that we heard the electorate loudly and clearly. So \nthe minority leader and I offered a substitute amendment to make the \nbill even stronger. Not only did Senator McConnell and I, for the first \ntime in three decades, cosponsor legislation which is the first bill to \ncome before the Senate, but we moved even farther to include new \nprotections to prevent dead-of-night additions to conference reports, \nto add new rules to say that Members may not engage in job negotiations \nwith industries they regulate, to require fuller disclosure by \nlobbyists, to ensure proper valuation of tickets to sporting events, to \nmake sure that the Senate gift and travel rules are enforceable against \nlobbyists, and we toughened criminal penalties for corrupt violations \nof the Lobbying Disclosure Act.\n  Senator McConnell and I offered the substitute amendment at the start \nof the debate, and it remains pending. Since then, we have had a debate \nin the Senate that strengthened the bill even more. The Senate has \nadopted other amendments on a bipartisan basis, including Senator \nKerry's amendment to strip pensions from Members convicted of \ncorruption, Senator Salazar's amendment to ensure public access to \ncommittee proceedings, and two amendments by Senator Vitter to \nstrengthen enforcement of ethics rules.\n  Soon we will adopt the Durbin and DeMint amendments to require full \nand timely disclosure of all earmarks. The Durbin amendment is a \nnecessary addition to the DeMint proposal because it strengthens the \ndefinition of tax earmarks and because it requires public disclosure of \nearmarks before floor debate. In effect, we have combined the best \nideas from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, to \nestablish the strongest possible disclosures rules in this regard. Once \nwe are done, the Senate earmark rules will be even stronger than those \nrecently adopted by the House. That is why I said we need to look at \nwhat we are doing. Senator Durbin's amendment gives the DeMint \namendment structure that was lacking last week in the original \namendment. That is why it didn't pass. Taxes need to be included in \ndetail and now will be when the Durbin amendment passes. So the work \ndone by Senator DeMint and Senator Durbin is noteworthy and very good.\n  After we vote on the Durbin and DeMint amendments later today, we \nwill vote on whether to invoke cloture on an amendment to strengthen \nthe ban on gift and travel bans in the underlying measure. I recognize \nSenators Feingold, Obama, and McCain have contributed to this and I \nappreciate their work for a number of years in regard to airplane \ntravel in this country and other issues. This amendment will profoundly \nchange the rules, banning not only lobbyists but entities that hire \nlobbyists from providing gifts and travel. Most notably, it will \nrequire that when Senators travel on airplanes, they must pay the full \ncharter rate. Last week I modified the amendment to include additional \nideas from Senator Inhofe, Feingold and McCain.\n  Let me say a word about corporate jets. The State of Nevada is very \nlarge areawise. The cities of Las Vegas and Reno are separated by about \n450 miles. There is good travel between those two cities. But to get \naround the rest of the State is not easy. When you travel from Las \nVegas to Reno, I again say it is easy. But then let's say you want to \ngo to Elko. By Nevada standards, it is a pretty large city. Going on a \ncommercial airplane, it is very, very, very difficult, and to go to Ely \nis next to impossible. These two cities, both important in their own \nright, have required on a number of occasions calling upon people you \nknow who have an airplane to take us up there. Under the old rules, you \ncould pay first-class travel. An example of that is Senator Ensign and \nI, last August, had to go to Ely. It was extremely important. We were \nworking on a piece of legislation that has since passed. We wanted to \nsit down in person and talk to the people in Ely about what we were \ndoing.\n\n  For us to get there was very difficult. The time factor was \nsignificant. To drive up and back is 2 days, 1 day up, 1 day back. It \nwas complicated by the fact that Senator Ensign had a longstanding \nengagement in Reno. To go from Ely to Reno--it is hard to get there. If \nyou drive very fast, you can make it in 6 hours. So I called a friend \nof mine, Mike Ensign, Senator Ensign's father. This good man has done \nvery well in the business world. He is a man with limited education but \na great mind. He started out working in somewhat menial jobs in the \ngaming industry. He worked his way up. He became a dealer, a pit boss, \na shift boss, and then Mike Ensign moved into the corporate world and \nbecame an executive and then ultimately started buying hotel properties \nhimself and has done very well. He is the principal officer and owner \nof Mandalay Bay, a huge company. It is the second largest hotel-casino \noperator in the country. I called him and I said: Mike, with one of \nyour airplanes, can you fly me and your son to Ely?\n  He is a wonderful man, just the greatest guy. He said: Sure, I will \nbe happy to do that. And he did that. He is an example of the type of \npeople we have called upon for these airplanes.\n  I tell this story. I have used these airplanes a lot because I live \nin Nevada and because of other duties I have here. The reason I tell \nthe Mike Ensign story is because Mike Ensign doesn't want anything from \nme. There isn't a thing in the world I can give this man. He is famous, \nhe is rich, he has a wonderful family. I can't do anything to help Mike \nEnsign. He did this because he is my friend.\n  Most every--I should not say most. For every airplane I fly on, of \ncourse I don't have the relationship with them that I have with Mike \nEnsign, but I want everyone who has allowed me to use their airplanes \nto know I am not in any way denigrating them. They have done this out \nof the goodness of their heart. I have never had anyone say: I will \ngive you an airplane ride if you give me something, or, I have a piece \nof legislation pending, will you help me with that? That has never \nhappened. I want all these people to know that I am certainly not in \nany way disparaging these good people who have allowed me and others to \nfly on their airplanes.\n  What I am saying, though, is that in this world in which we live, \nbecause of all the corruption that has taken place in the last few \nyears here in America, that you not only have to do away with what is \nwrong but what appears to be wrong. I am confident I have never been \ninfluenced by anyone who provided me with the courtesy of a private \nairplane, but I have come to the realization that this practice \npresents a major perception problem. It is a major perception problem \nbecause the American people have the right to insist that we do what \nseems right as well as what is right. Does it appear it is OK? For us \nto fly around in these airplanes doesn't appear to be the right thing, \nno matter how good-hearted these people\n\n[[Page S549]]\n\nare, just like Mike Ensign. So because a perception isn't right, this \namendment is pending, and it means Senators should pay the full fare \nwhen they fly on someone's private airplane. This is an important \namendment. Any Senator who is serious about ethics reform will vote to \ninvoke cloture so this amendment can be included in the final bill.\n  In the course of this debate on this bill, the Senate has properly \nfocused on ethics and lobbying reform, not on other matters, such as \ncampaign reform. The Senate has wisely tabled matters dealing primarily \nwith campaign finance issues, but Senator Feinstein has assured the \nSenate and me that campaign finance reform will be addressed separately \nand comprehensively in her committee, the Rules Committee.\n  I have some concern about campaign finance rules. I think we need to \nhave serious public hearings on these issues. We have problems dealing \nwith so-called 527s, their foundations--they are basic campaign finance \nproblems we need to look at, and we need to look at them in detail. \nSenator Feinstein has said she will do that, and I am grateful to her \nfor doing that.\n  There will also be separate consideration of the proposal to \nestablish an independent ethics enforcement agency. We debated that \nproposal last year, and it was defeated resoundingly after a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators on and off the Ethics Committee questioned the wisdom \nof such a proposal. Again, the Rules Committee has said they will take \nthis matter up and look at it very seriously.\n  Senators Voinovich and Johnson served as chair and vice chair of the \nEthics Committee in the last Congress. They both spoke vigorously \nagainst a new ethics agency. Senator Johnson, as we know, is recovering \nfrom an illness. As a matter of fact, I spoke to his family not long \nbefore coming here. He is doing very well. Here is what he said last \nyear, though. I quote Senator Johnson, who is the chair of the Ethics \nCommittee, who said this last year:\n\n       The two-tiered ethics process that would be created by this \n     amendment would undoubtedly slow consideration of ethics \n     complaints, create more doubt about the process, and make our \n     colleagues and the public less confident in our ability to \n     address these issues. . . .[The proposal would leave] open \n     the possibility that Members will be forced to live under the \n     cloud of an investigation as a result of every accusation \n     brought before the Office of Public Integrity, regardless of \n     its merit--regardless of its merit. Such a situation would \n     only interject more partisanship into the ethics procession \n     and create a blunt tool for extreme partisan groups to make \n     politically based attacks.\n\n  Despite the defeat of the proposal last year, it makes sense for the \nRules Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee to hold hearings \non ways to strengthen enforcement of the ethics rules. I can assure my \ncolleagues that worthwhile proposals which emerge from these two \ncommittees will receive meaningful consideration by the full Senate. I \nhave spoken about this in detail, in fact, in my last conversation with \nSenator Lieberman this morning.\n  There are other pending amendments that have nothing to do with \nethics and lobbying reform. The line-item veto is a good example. It \nhas no place in this bill. I have great respect for Senator Judd Gregg \nfrom New Hampshire. He is a wonderful man and a great Senator. But on \nthis bill is not the place to bring this up. No matter how strongly you \nfeel on this, you should not bring up line-item veto. Should we be \ndebating what is going on in Iraq on this bill? We should not, even \nthough some people believe strongly that we should. But the line-item \nveto is no different from debating Iraq in this bill. They have no \nplace in this bill, just as there is no place for campaign finance \nreform in this bill. We are trying to do serious, sound ethics and \nlobbying earmark reform, and that is what we are doing.\n\n  Workable mechanisms for fiscal discipline are certainly important. I \nhope Senators Conrad and Gregg take a look at this line-item veto \nissue, which I personally don't support. But whether I support it or \nnot, it should not be a part of this bill, and I hope they would take \nthis up in the budgeting process along with the pay-go rules which I \nthink are so important. This bill is about ethics and lobbying reform, \nnot budgeting.\n  Let's focus on what we need to do to move forward on the ethics and \nlobbying reform. We need to adopt the Durbin and DeMint amendments on \nearmark disclosure. We need to invoke cloture on my gift and travel \namendment and then adopt that amendment. Then we need to invoke cloture \non the substitute and debate the various germane amendments that will \nbe pending during the 30-hour postcloture period.\n  This is a glidepath to finishing the ethics bill this week so we can \nmove to other vital matters: the minimum wage, the President's new Iraq \nproposal, funding the Government, fixing the Medicare prescription drug \nplan, expending opportunities for lifesaving stem cell research, pay-go \nrules, and other important issues.\n  Ethics reform is the first step in convincing the American people \nthat we, Democrats and Republicans, are hard at work on their behalf. \nIt seems so important that we complete this legislation and move on to \nthe other matters that are so important. But this is something we need \nto do to help the American people feel better about their Congress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have introduced an amendment on this \nbill which has to do with the appointment of U.S. attorneys. This is \nalso the subject of the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction, and since \nthe Attorney General himself will be before that committee on Thursday, \nand I will be asking him some questions, I speak today in morning \nbusiness on what I know so much about this situation.\n  Recently, it came to my attention that the Department of Justice has \nasked several U.S. attorneys from around the country to resign their \npositions--some by the end of this month--prior to the end of their \nterms not based on any allegation of misconduct. In other words, they \nare forced resignations.\n  I have also heard that the Attorney General plans to appoint interim \nreplacements and potentially avoid Senate confirmation by leaving an \ninterim U.S. attorney in place for the remainder of the Bush \nadministration.\n  How does this happen? The Department sought and essentially was given \nnew authority under a little known provision in the PATRIOT Act \nReauthorization to appoint interim appointments who are not subject to \nSenate confirmation and who could remain in place for the remainder of \nthe Bush administration.\n  To date, I know of at least seven U.S. attorneys forced to resign \nwithout cause, without any allegations of misconduct. These include two \nfrom my home State, San Diego and San Francisco, as well as U.S. \nattorneys from New Mexico, Nevada, Arkansas, Texas, Washington and \nArizona.\n  In California, press reports indicate that Carol Lam, U.S. attorney \nfor San Diego, has been asked to leave her position, as has Kevin Ryan \nof San Francisco. The public response has been shock. Peter Nunez, who \nserved as the San Diego U.S. attorney from 1982 to 1988, has said:\n\n       [This] is like nothing I've ever seen in my 35-plus years.\n\n  He went on to say that while the President has the authority to fire \na U.S. attorney for any reason, it is ``extremely rare'' unless there \nis an allegation of misconduct.\n  To my knowledge, there are no allegations of misconduct having to do \nwith Carol Lam. She is a distinguished former judge. Rather, the only \nexplanation I have seen are concerns that were expressed about \nprioritizing public corruption cases over smuggling and gun cases.\n  The most well-known case involves a U.S. attorney in Arkansas. \nSenators\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nPryor and Lincoln have raised significant concerns about how ``Bud'' \nCummins was asked to resign and in his place the administration \nappointed their top lawyer in charge of political opposition research, \nTim Griffin. I have been told Mr. Griffin is quite young, 37, and \nSenators Pryor and Lincoln have expressed concerns about press reports \nthat have indicated Mr. Griffin has been a political operative for the \nRNC.\n  While the administration has confirmed that 5 to 10 U.S. attorneys \nhave been asked to leave, I have not been given specific details about \nwhy these individuals were asked to leave. Around the country, though, \nU.S. attorneys are bringing many of the most important and complex \ncases being prosecuted. They are responsible for taking the lead on \npublic corruption cases and many of the antiterrorist efforts in the \ncountry. As a matter of fact, we just had the head of the FBI, Bob \nMueller, come before the Judiciary Committee at our oversight hearing \nand tell us how they have dropped the priority of violent crime \nprosecution and, instead, are taking up public corruption cases; ergo, \nit only follows that the U.S. attorneys would be prosecuting public \ncorruption cases.\n  As a matter of fact, the rumor has it--and this is only rumor--that \nU.S. Attorney Lam, who carried out the prosecution of the Duke \nCunningham case, has other cases pending whereby, rumor has it, Members \nof Congress have been subpoenaed. I have also been told that this \ninterrupts the flow of the prosecution of these cases, to have the \npresent U.S. attorney be forced to resign by the end of this month.\n  Now, U.S. attorneys play a vital role in combating traditional crimes \nsuch as narcotics trafficking, bank robbery, guns, violence, \nenvironmental crimes, civil rights, and fraud, as well as taking the \nlead on prosecuting computer hacking, Internet fraud, and intellectual \nproperty theft, accounting and securities fraud, and computer chip \ntheft.\n  How did all of this happen? This is an interesting story. Apparently, \nwhen Congress reauthorized the PATRIOT Act last year, a provision was \nincluded that modified the statute that determines how long interim \nappointments are made. The PATRIOT Act Reauthorization changed the law \nto allow interim appointments to serve indefinitely rather than for a \nlimited 120 days. Prior to the PATRIOT Act Reauthorization and the 1986 \nlaw, when a vacancy arose, the court nominated an interim U.S. attorney \nuntil the Senate confirmed a Presidential nominee. The PATRIOT Act \nReauthorization in 2006 removed the 120-day limit on that appointment, \nso now the Attorney General can nominate someone who goes in without \nany confirmation hearing by this Senate and serve as U.S. attorney for \nthe remainder of the President's term in office. This is a way, simply \nstated, of avoiding a Senate confirmation of a U.S. attorney.\n  The rationale to give the authority to the court has been that since \ndistrict court judges are also subject to Senate confirmation and are \nnot political positions, there is greater likelihood that their choice \nof who should serve as an interim U.S. attorney would be chosen based \non merit and not manipulated for political reasons. To me, this makes \ngood sense.\n  Finally, by having the district court make the appointments, and not \nthe Attorney General, the process provides an incentive for the \nadministration to move quickly to appoint a replacement and to work in \ncooperation with the Senate to get the best qualified candidate \nconfirmed.\n\n  I strongly believe we should return this power to district courts to \nappoint interim U.S. attorneys. That is why last week, Senator Leahy, \nthe incoming Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, and I filed a bill that would do just that. \nOur bill simply restores the statute to what it once was and gives the \nauthority to appoint interim U.S. attorneys back to the district court \nwhere the vacancy arises.\n  I could press this issue on this bill. However, I do not want to do \nso because I have been saying I want to keep this bill as clean as \npossible, that it is restricted to the items that are the purpose of \nthe bill, not elections or any other such things. I ought to stick to \nmy own statement.\n  Clearly, the President has the authority to choose who he wants \nworking in his administration and to choose who should replace an \nindividual when there is a vacancy. But the U.S. attorneys' job is too \nimportant for there to be unnecessary disruptions, or, worse, any \nappearance of undue influence. At a time when we are talking about \ntoughening the consequences for public corruption, we should change the \nlaw to ensure that our top prosecutors who are taking on these cases \nare free from interference or the appearance of impropriety. This is an \nimportant change to the law. Again, I will question the Attorney \nGeneral Thursday about it when he is before the Judiciary Committee for \nan oversight hearing.\n  I am particularly concerned because of the inference in all of this \nthat is drawn to manipulation in the lineup of cases to be prosecuted \nby a U.S. attorney. In the San Diego case, at the very least, we have \npeople from the FBI indicating that Carol Lam has not only been a \nstraight shooter but a very good prosecutor. Therefore, it is \nsurprising to me to see that she would be, in effect, forced out, \nwithout cause. This would go for any other U.S. attorney among the \nseven who are on that list.\n  We have something we need to look into, that we need to exercise our \noversight on, and I believe very strongly we should change the law back \nto where a Federal judge makes this appointment on an interim basis \nsubject to regular order, whereby the President nominates and the \nSenate confirms a replacement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S550-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I was proud to join my friend and \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, in offering an amendment \nthat would simply place in the Senate bill the very sensible language \nregarding earmarks that the House of Representatives has already \nincluded. Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are rightly proud of the \nvery clear definition of earmarks they have included in that \nlegislation that will help to identify spending measures and highlight \nthem so we can have the kind of debate and sort of public scrutiny we \nshould expect and, indeed, welcome, into the appropriations and \nlegislative process.\n  I was a little bit surprised, however, to find the resistance that \nwas voiced last week, but I understand now that has all been worked out \nand that a second-degree amendment will be offered by Senator Durbin as \na collaborative effort and a demonstration of bipartisan cooperation on \nsomething where there ought to be bipartisan cooperation, certainly on \nthe matter of ethics, that will provide for greater transparency and \nincreases public availability of earmark-related information.\n  This is good news for all who wish to see greater fiscal \nresponsibility and accountability. Increased transparency for earmarks \nis something we ought to embrace and it ought to create in us the \nability to discern much better than we have been what kind of spending \nis in the general welfare of the American people and why that kind of \nspending is absolutely necessary.\n  Of course, there are those--and I am one of them--who think the \nFederal Government spends way too much taxpayer money. Our Government \nwas founded as a limited Government with delegated powers. But over the \nlast 220 or so years of our Nation's history, it has been a history of \nthe Federal Government gradually ``filling the field'' to the detriment \nof State and local government and of the individual freedom by \ntaxpayers, voters, and citizens.\n  While I applaud amendment No. 26, I think we need to do even more. We \ncan add greater sunshine and clarity on the earmark process by adopting \nan amendment which I offered last week as well. The current bill \nrequires that all future legislation include a list of earmarks as well \nas the names of the Senators who have requested them. My amendment \nwould add what may seem like a minor addition but one that would \nrequire that the budgetary impact for each earmark also be included, as \nwell as a requirement that the total number of earmarks and their total \nbudgetary impact be identified and disclosed.\n  What happens now is that it takes some time for the staff of this \nbody to compile the information contained in bills, and literally we \nare passing appropriations bills chock-full of earmarks, and we do not \nhave a clue, because we will not have had a chance to read it and \nconsider it in advance, what the total sum of those earmarks is and how \nthey impact the budget. Perhaps the top line itself is disclosed but \nnot how that money is actually broken down and spent.\n  Oftentimes, bills are hundreds of pages long, with earmarks buried in \nthem. It is not uncommon for appropriations, particularly Omnibus \nappropriations bills, to go into the thousands-of-pages or more in \nnumber. Of course, often this is at the end of a legislative period, \nand there are hours, maybe, or even only minutes to review them.\n  The goal of my amendment is that when we consider legislation, we \nhave a summary document showing the details, including the costs, of \nearmarks in legislation--and this is the novelty--before we consider \nthe legislation, before we actually vote on it, not after we have \nalready voted and it is too late to do anything about it but before. It \nserves the very important purpose of added transparency and, indeed, \nthe accountability that goes along with it.\n  I would assume those who have asked for earmarks to be included are \nproud of them. They feel like they are meritorious. They feel like they \ncan be defended. Well, unfortunately, the very process by which those \nearmarks are added defeats that kind of transparency and \naccountability, which is why I believe we need this additional step.\n  Furthermore, if we create, by adoption of this amendment, a fixed \nbaseline from which we can proceed in the future to allow the American \npublic, as well as our staff, to analyze more thoroughly these \nearmarks, I think we would have created at least a knowledge base that \nwill allow us to make better decisions going forward.\n  Consider that the Congressional Research Service each year conducts a \nstudy to identify the earmarks in each bill. Through that study, one \ncan see that both the total number of earmarks and the total dollar \nvalue of those earmarks--surprise, surprise--have grown significantly \nover the last decade.\n  For example, the total number of earmarks increased almost fourfold \nfrom 1994 to 2005. Furthermore, the total cost of those earmarks \nincreased by a factor of 100 percent. And the numbers appear to be even \nhigher for 2006.\n  Let me list some of the earmarks that have been included. And we will \nstart with 2007, to give you a flavor of what I am talking about, and \nthe reason why there ought to be greater transparency.\n  Now, I am not suggesting we limit earmarks. I am considering we ought \nto make them transparent and obvious. And then I think the benefits of \nopen Government and the kind of scrutiny that will follow will have the \nbeneficial\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\nimpact I think we would all hope for and certainly my constituents \nwould hope for, when they worry that we are spending money for \ninappropriate purposes and in too large amounts, to their detriment.\n  For example, in January 2007--excuse me. This must have been in last \nyear's appropriations bill--an earmark for $725,000 for the Please \nTouch Museum. I am not sure what the Please Touch Museum is, but I \nthink it would be beneficial for the sponsor of that earmark to be \nidentified, and it would be beneficial for it to be described how that \npromotes the general welfare of the American people and why it is \njustified, taking that $725,000 out of the pockets of taxpayers and \nputting it in the treasury of the Please Touch Museum.\n  Then there is the $250,000 appropriations for the Country Music Hall \nof Fame. I happen to be a country music fan, but even I would wonder \nhow that promotes the general welfare, to take money out of the \ntaxpayer's pocket and put it in the treasury of the Country Music Hall \nof Fame. I think it bears some scrutiny, some explanation. Maybe there \nis an explanation, but I have to be honest, I cannot think of one now \nthat would justify transferring the money from the taxpayer's pocket \nand justifying a Federal appropriation for the Country Music Hall of \nFame.\n  And just so the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is not left out, there is a \n$200,000 earmark for that; then the Aviation Hall of Fame, $200,000; \nthe Grammy Foundation, $150,000; the Coca-Cola Space Science Center for \n$150,000; $150,000 for a single traffic light in Briarcliff Manor, NY. \nI am not sure why that is a Federal responsibility. In fact, I would \nthink by its description it is not; it is a local responsibility. That \ncost ought to be borne by the local taxpayer, not the Federal taxpayer \nthrough the earmark process--here again, something that cries out for \ngreater accountability through greater transparency.\n  Then there is the $100,000 earmark for the International Storytelling \nCenter. I am not sure why the Federal taxpayer should have to pay for \nthat. It may be a meritorious expenditure, but maybe through private \ncharity. Maybe corporations would like to contribute some money to \nsupport this worthwhile local initiative. Maybe local taxpayers could \njustify the expenditure, maybe State taxpayers, but why should the \nFederal taxpayer, why should my constituents in Texas have to pay a \n$100,000 earmark for the International Storytelling Center in some \nother State?\n  Then there is $500,000 for the Montana Sheep Institute.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will not belabor the point. But I think you get my \nflavor. I am not going to even talk much about the $50 million for an \nindoor rain forest that was the subject of a Federal earmark. And then \nagain, there are examples anybody can find on the Internet, published \nby Citizens Against Government Waste, examples from what they call the \n``Congressional Pig Book.'' I do not have to tell you why they call it \nthat.\n  But the point is, things have gotten terribly out of whack here in \nWashington when we, as elected representatives of our constituents, of \nthe American people, take it upon ourselves to spend their money on \ninappropriate subjects, or maybe you say there is some justification \nfor these topics. But I think it is easy to see why it is inappropriate \nthat we spend the Federal taxpayer dollar on some of these topics.\n  Here again, my amendment does not limit these earmarks because I \nbelieve there will be a self-corrective mechanism through greater \ntransparency and the accountability that comes with it. That is why I \nso strongly support the efforts that have been undertaken here on a \nbipartisan basis to bring greater transparency to the earmark process, \nbecause I think it is a problem that can literally fix itself. When \npeople begin to ask the kinds of questions I am asking, when the public \nbegins to shine the bright light of day on some of these special \ninterest earmarks, which have been literally hidden from Members of the \nCongress until after they have voted on them and published only later \nby the Congressional Research Service, after they have done a survey of \nthe burgeoning number of earmarks for these kinds of interests, I think \nthis is a problem that can correct itself.\n  So, Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the bill managers \nand the opportunity to speak once again on this important topic. I \nthink getting this information to Members of Congress early before we \nvote would be very helpful and provide a baseline of the number of \nearmarks that can be analyzed so we can go forward and explain why that \nnumber should go up if, in fact, we think it should go up, or if you \nare like me, if you think the number should go down, establish what the \nfacts are so we have a baseline of information with which to explain \nour position.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me begin by applauding Senator \nReid, Senator McConnell, and all of those who are responsible for \nadvancing this important ethics reform bill. There is no question but \nthat the confidence of the American people in the Congress is now at an \nalmost alltime low. There is no question there have been ethical abuses \nin Congress in recent years. And there is no question but that we \nshould support the strongest ethics reform possible.\n  Members of Congress do not need free lunches from lobbyists. Members \nof Congress do not need free tickets to ball games. And they do not \nneed huge discounts for flights on corporate jets. Congress does need \ntransparency in earmarks and holds, and we do need a new policy \nregarding the revolving door by which a Member one year is writing a \npiece of legislation and the next year finds himself or herself working \nfor the company that benefited from the legislation he or she wrote. In \nother words, we need to pass the strongest ethics reform bill possible. \nBut in passing this legislation, we need to understand this is not the \nend of our work but, rather, it is just the beginning, and much more \nneeds to be done.\n  Today in the United States of America, the middle class is shrinking, \npoverty is increasing, and the gap between the rich and the poor is \ngrowing wider. In fact, the people at the top, the very wealthiest \npeople in our country, have never, ever had it so good since the 1920s. \nThe sad truth is that Congress, especially over the last 6 years, has \nnot only failed to respond to this crisis, to the decline of the middle \nclass, but in many ways Congress has made the situation even worse.\n  Time and time again, this Congress has chosen to ignore the needs of \nordinary Americans and, instead, has acted on behalf of the interests \nof the wealthiest and most powerful people in our country. In fact, \nmuch of the legislation that has come to the floor of the House and the \nSenate in recent years has clearly come at the behest of multimillion-\ndollar corporate interests. This has included a Medicare part D \nprescription drug bill that, while costing the taxpayers of this \ncountry a huge amount of money, in fact provides a relatively weak \nbenefit for our seniors.\n  Included in this bill, as I think seniors all over this country are \nbeginning to understand, is a very large doughnut hole in which they \nare going to have to pay 100 percent of the cost of their prescription \ndrugs.\n  Also, included in that bill is language which prevents the Government \nfrom negotiating with the drug companies for lower prices for the \nAmerican people. We pay today the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs, and yet the Government is prevented from \nnegotiating for lower prices. Meanwhile, despite strong majority \nsupport in the House and the Senate, Congress has failed to pass \nlegislation widely supported by the American people that would allow \nfor the reimportation of safe, affordable prescription drugs from well-\nregulated countries such as Canada and from Europe that would provide \nhuge discounts to Americans of all ages.\n  At the same time, while there is more and more concern in our country \nand throughout the world about the danger of global warming and what it \nwill mean for our planet and for our children and our grandchildren, \nCongress has failed to adequately fund energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy. But somehow Congress did manage to fund an energy \nbill that includes billions and billions of dollars in tax giveaways \nand subsidies to the largest oil companies in America, companies that \nare enjoying recordbreaking profits, as well as tax breaks and \nsubsidies to other big-energy interests.\n  Most American workers now know that our current trade policies have \nfailed and that they have failed miserably. During the last 5 years we \nhave lost some 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs, and we are now \non the cusp of losing millions of good-paying, white-collar information \ntechnology jobs. In my own State of Vermont, not a major manufacturing \ncenter, we have lost 20 percent of our manufacturing jobs in the last 5 \nyears alone, and we just learned the other day that another 175 jobs in \nMiddlebury, VT, are going to be lost because of global competition. Yet \ndespite a $700 billion trade deficit and the loss of millions of good-\npaying jobs, Congress refuses to fundamentally change our trade \npolicies, a change that is desperately needed.\n  I know some people like to talk about ``special interests,'' but the \ntruth is that special interests, as I understand them, in fact, are \ncorporate and monied interests. What do we mean when we talk about \nspecial interests? Are we talking about millions of American working \nfamilies who are struggling to keep their heads above water \neconomically? Are they a ``special interest''? I don't think they are. \nAre we talking about the children of America, 18 percent of whom are \nliving in poverty? Are they a ``special interest''? Not to my mind. Are \nwe talking about millions of seniors who want nothing more than to live \nout their retirement years with some form of economic security and \ndignity? Are they ``special interests''? I don't believe they are.\n  The challenge we face is to rein in the influence and the power that \nlobbyists and their large corporate clients have over the Congress. The \nproblem is not that the children of America have too much power. It is \nnot that working people have too much power. The problem is that big-\nmoney interests, to a very significant degree, dominate what goes on in \nWashington, DC.\n  The lobbying reform legislation that we are considering is a very \nimportant step forward in addressing that issue. I thank Senators Reid, \nFeinstein, Lieberman, Feingold, Obama, and all of those on both sides \nof the aisle who have worked hard on this issue for their leadership on \nlobbying reform so that we can begin to restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people in Congress. But we must keep in mind that while we are \neliminating the $20 lunches and the club-level tickets to local \nsporting events, this bill does not address what is an even more \npressing issue; namely, the $10,000 campaign contributions that come \nfrom corporate PACs. We have a fundamental problem which literally \nthreatens our democratic form of government, and that is that Senators \nand Members of the House and their challengers are forced to raise \nmillions and millions and millions of dollars in order to run a winning \ncampaign.\n  In terms of campaign contributions, let's be very clear. Despite what \nanyone may have heard, corporate interests are king. They run the show. \nFrom 1998 to 2005, for example, drug companies spent more on lobbying \nthan any other industry--$900 million, according to the nonpartisan \nCenter for Responsive Politics. They donated a total of $89.9 million \nin the same period to Federal candidates and party committees.\n  We hear a lot about ``labor money'' and about ``big labor.'' But, in \nfact, corporate interests give more than 10 times as much to candidates \nthan do labor unions. In the 2006 cycle, according to the Center for \nResponsive Politics, labor gave less than $50 million. That is a lot of \nmoney, $50 million. But corporate interests gave well over $525 \nmillion--$50 million/$525 million, 10 times as much. That disparity may \nwell explain why the needs of working Americans all too often take a \nback seat to corporate interests in the Congress. But, more \nimportantly, it tells us why we need real campaign finance reform so \nthat the needs of all Americans are heard rather than just those who \ncan afford to make huge campaign contributions.\n\n  To strengthen our democracy we need reforms on a number of fronts. We \ncertainly need to pass this lobbying reform bill, but we also need very \nstrong campaign finance reform. My own view is that we need to move \ntoward public funding of elections. We also need\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\nmedia reform to stem the growing concentration of ownership among \ntelevision, radio, and newspaper companies with the result that what \nAmericans see, hear, and read is increasingly controlled by fewer and \nfewer media conglomerates. Most importantly, in my view, if we are \ngoing to change the balance of power, if ordinary Americans are going \nto get their day in Washington, DC, we need a revival of a grassroots \ndemocratic movement from one end of this country to the other, where \nordinary people begin to stand up and say: Washington, DC, pay \nattention to my needs rather than just the needs of large corporate \ninterests.\n  I understand that the legislation before us today relates only to \nissues around lobbying reform and that many of the other critical \nissues I have laid out will be considered at a later time. That is why \nI have offered the amendment we have before us today. The amendment \nwill provide this body with some of the information it will need when \nwe address campaign finance reform at a later date.\n  Specifically, this amendment requires the Commission to Strengthen \nConfidence in Congress, created by the underlying legislation, to \nreport on the aggregate amount of campaign contributions given by \ncertain identified corporate interests 24 months prior to and within 6 \nmonths after the passage of four specified pieces of legislation. These \nfour pieces of legislation are the Medicare Part D Program, the \nbankruptcy reform bill, the Energy bill, and the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  The goal of this report is to begin to throw some light on the volume \nof corporate contributions that are showered on Congress when \nlegislation important to multinationals comes before the Congress. As a \nresult, this report will focus on the amounts given and the identity of \nthe givers.\n  It is our obligation to return control of the Congress to the \nAmerican people. I look forward to helping make that happen with the \nethics reform bill we are now considering and the many other equally \ncritical reforms that voters across this great Nation told us they \nwanted this past November.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that these amendments now be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have listened with interest to the \nSenator from Vermont. I have a few quick reactions. As we get closer to \nhis amendment, I will perhaps be more specific about some of them. \nComments about the revolving door situation, I must confess I am a \nlittle less than overwhelmed by the arguments about the revolving door \nbecause I have been there. I served in the executive branch in the \n1960s, left on New Year's Eve of 1969, and took up my new duties as a \nlobbyist on January 1, 1970. In those days there were no restrictions \nwith respect to a revolving door, and I was immediately called by \npeople who wanted my services with respect to the agency I had just \nleft. They paid well. I accepted their contracts, and I went back to \nsee my old friends back in the Department of Transportation.\n  It came as somewhat of a shock to me that no one wanted to talk to \nme. Now that I was no longer a member of the Secretary's Office, now \nthat I no longer had direct access to the Secretary to discuss things \nimportant to the administration, now that I was an outsider, my friends \nwere happy to see me for lunch, they were happy to talk about my \nfamily, but I could no longer do them any good within the Department. I \nwas no longer a power within the Department. I was an outsider, and \nthey were happy to get me out of their offices as quickly as they \ncould.\n  I discovered firsthand that the idea of the revolving door is vastly \noverrated. I was like any other lobbyist. I had to make my points on \nthe basis of the validity of the arguments I was making and not because \nat one time I had been in the Department with them. We get carried away \nwith\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\nthis because the media talks about how terrible is the revolving door. \nI am willing to let a reasonable period of time pass, but I think many \nof these arguments go beyond what reality has been to me.\n  I heard the Senator from Vermont talk about publicly funded \ncampaigns. I will make this observation: We have the largest poll taken \nin the United States every year on April 15. Every year, every American \ntaxpayer is given the opportunity to set aside just $3 of taxes he \nalready owes--this is not additional money; this is $3 of the money he \nalready owes--to be placed in the Presidential fund to fund \nPresidential campaigns.\n  Ninety percent of the taxpayers who have the opportunity to put $3 \ninto a Federal fund for education vote no. That is not by accident. You \nhave to check the box one way or the other. Ninety percent vote, no, \nthey don't want to do that. I am not sure we should be talking about \nthat as a great idea.\n  Finally, the business that is in the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont that says we must disclose corporate contributions 24 months \nprior to and 6 months after the passage of certain pieces of \nlegislation neglects the fact that corporate contributions are illegal, \nand they have been since 1902 in the days of Franklin Roosevelt. What \nthe press calls ``corporate contributions''--the press misunderstands--\nare PAC contributions. I was around Washington when we had the \nWatergate situation and I remember the rhetoric in these halls when the \ncreation of political action committees was hailed as the basic reform \nthat would clean up campaign contributions, because people make \ncontributions to PACs; corporations do not. Individuals make the money \navailable to PACs; corporations do not.\n  Corporate contributions are illegal. These are individual \ncontributions put together by a political action committee and then \ngiven in the name of the political action committee from the private \nfunds of private individuals. This was hailed as a reform. This was \nhailed as the way to clean things up. Because the media doesn't \nunderstand that, because the people in the media don't realize that a \ncorporate name attached to a political action committee does not mean \nthese are corporate funds, most of my constituents now think, as the \nSenator from Vermont has suggested, that this is corporate money. I \nhave to patiently explain to them once again this is not corporate \nmoney. I could give you an example from one of my colleagues here. He \nhas in his State a very large processing plant that produces products \nthat are sold under the label of Kraft Foods. He is very popular in the \ntown where this big plant is. Employees in that particular town come to \nhim and say: We would like to make campaign contributions to you; how \ndo we do it? He tells them: One way is you give me the money yourself. \nAnother way is you can direct your contribution to the PAC at the plant \nthat produces Kraft Foods to go to me. So the people who run the PAC at \nKraft Foods come to this Senator and say here are the contributions \nthat are directed to come to you and we are happy to transfer them \nthrough to you. The media gets hold of it and discovers that Kraft \nFoods is owned by a tobacco company, and the next thing you know, this \nSenator is being attacked in the press for taking campaign money from \ntobacco companies. He says: Wait a minute, these are individual \ncontributions from my constituents funneled through the place where \nthey work that has nothing whatever to do with tobacco.\n  Try explaining that to the New York Times. No, the editorials roll \ndown that he is taking tobacco money, that he is in the pocket of \nspecial interests. Finally, the Senator said: I told them don't give me \nanymore money. It is too much trouble to try to explain the truth in \nthis situation with the overwhelming amount of media publicity about \ncorporations corrupting politicians.\n  I made the comment before and I will make it again: I have discovered \nin my 14 years here that there is no such thing as repetition in the \nSenate. You say the same thing over and over again as if it is \nbrandnew. You cannot corrupt the Senator unless the Senator himself is \ncorrupt. And if the Senator himself is corrupt, he or she will find a \nway around the rules no matter how we write them.\n  I am strongly for this bill. I think the transparency part of it, the \ndisclosure part, is exactly what we need. But after 40 years of being \ninvolved with Washington, and living through the Watergate experience, \nliving through the scandals, whether it is Abramoff or Duke Cunningham, \nor the other Members of the House who went to jail in years gone by, \nwhose names I don't remember but whose circumstances I still recall, or \nwhether it is the Congressman with whom I worked as a lobbyist who went \nto jail because one of my fellow lobbyists gave him a $100,000 bribe, \nthe fundamental fact remains that you cannot corrupt a Senator or a \nCongressman unless that Senator or Congressman is himself or herself \nbasically corrupt.\n  We can write all of the rules we want, but if a Member of this body \nhas the instincts of corruption in his soul, he will find a way around \nthe rules. We should not kid ourselves that we are doing something that \nis going to clean up everything, because if we get a corrupt Member, \nthe corrupt Member will still act in a corrupt way and you will have \nanother Duke Cunningham-type scandal 5 or 10 years from now and, \nunfortunately, the reaction here is, hey, that proves we need to change \nthe rules.\n  As I have said, this is the only place I know where, when somebody \nbreaks the rules, the first instinct is to change the rules instead of \ncontinuing to enforce them, recognizing that even without what we are \ntalking about here, even without the legislation that is proposed, Duke \nCunningham is in jail, and recognizing that even without the kinds of \nstrict changes we are talking about, Jack Abramoff is in jail. These \nwere corrupt individuals who found their way around existing \nlegislation, and trying to solve that problem by additional legislation \nmay very well turn out to be an ineffective effort.\n  With that, I see my friend from South Carolina on his feet seeking \nrecognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I want to speak in favor of the Durbin \namendment No. 44, which is a slightly modified version of my amendment \nNo. 11 that was endorsed by a majority of Senators last Thursday on a \n51-to-46 vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 44 offered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. The Durbin amendment is a product of a bipartisan \nagreement that I reached last week with the majority leader and the \nSenator from Illinois. The Durbin amendment contains bipartisan \nlanguage that would require disclosure for all earmarks, including \nthose directed toward Federal projects and those contained in report \nlanguage. It also strengthens Internet disclosure so that bills shall \nnot be in order unless their reports include a list of earmarks, \nlimited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits, which are posted on \nthe Internet in a searchable format at least 48 hours before \nconsideration.\n  In addition, it is our understanding that if a spending bill is \nreported long before its consideration, the list of earmarks will \naccompany any committee reports for those bills.\n  The Durbin amendment slightly modifies the definition of a limited \ntax benefit to ``any revenue provision'' that provides a benefit to ``a \nparticular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries.'' This is \nsimilar to the definition used in the legislative line-item veto \namendment.\n  I thank the majority leader and the Senator from Illinois for working \nwith me on this important issue. The purpose of the bill before us is \nto address the culture of corruption in Washington, and it cannot be a \nserious proposal unless we are completely transparent with the way we \nspend American tax dollars.\n  This bipartisan agreement helps achieve that goal. We will be voting \ntoday at 5:30 on the Durbin amendment and I encourage all of my \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to support it. Following that \nvote, we will vote on my amendment as modified by the Durbin amendment. \nI encourage my colleagues to support it as well.\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 70\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 70.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 70.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit an earmark from being included in the classified \nportion of a report accompanying a measure unless the measure includes \n   a general program description, funding level, and the name of the \n                        sponsor of that earmark)\n\n       On page 7, after line 6, insert the following:\n       ``4. It shall not be in order to consider any bill, \n     resolution, or conference report that contains an earmark \n     included in any classified portion of a report accompanying \n     the measure unless the bill, resolution, or conference report \n     includes to the greatest extent practicable, consistent with \n     the need to protect national security (including intelligence \n     sources and methods), in unclassified language, a general \n     program description, funding level, and the name of the \n     sponsor of that earmark.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this amendment is presented by \nmyself and Senator Rockefeller, chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \nIt aims to bring the same goals of accountability and transparency of \nearmark reform to the most opaque of earmarks, and those are classified \nones. The amendment prohibits any bill authorization or appropriation \nfrom containing an earmark in the classified portion of that bill or \naccompanying a report, unless there is unclassified language that \ndescribes in general terms the nature of the earmark. The amount of the \nearmark is disclosed and the sponsor of the earmark is identified.\n  We have cleared this with Senator Rockefeller and also, I believe, \nwith Senator Bond, who requested a change that we have made.\n  This amendment would provide the public with the assurance that the \nclassified parts of the defense and intelligence budgets--which are \nindeed large--are subjected to the same scrutiny and openness as \neverything else. The need for the amendment was made clear by the \nactions of former Congressman Duke Cunningham. According to a report by \nthe House Intelligence Committee, Cunningham was able to enact a \nstaggering $70 million to $80 million in classified earmarks over a 5-\nyear period. These earmarks benefited his business partners and were \nnot known to most Members of the Congress or the public.\n  The Washington Post, in a November 2006 editorial, pointed out:\n\n       Until the last decade or so, earmarks weren't permitted to \n     intelligence bills because of the absence of public scrutiny.\n\n  The Post also notes that Cunningham's earmarks could be the tip of \nthe iceberg in terms of classified pork and corruption.\n  Under this amendment, the public can be assured that this cannot \nhappen. In saying these words, I say them as a member of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence; I say them with the knowledge that \nthese earmarks can be very large; I say them with the knowledge that \nthis budget, which is known as a ``black budget'' and is considered by \nthe Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations to be very difficult to get \nat, even by those of us who serve on both intelligence and defense \nappropriations. Senator Bond and I are in the process of suggesting a \nprocedure to the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee, as \nwell as the leadership, that might bring greater intelligence staff \nwork to bear on the classified part that relates to intelligence of the \ndefense bill.\n  This amendment is a very simple amendment. It simply says make as \nclear as possible, without jeopardizing national security, what the \nearmark is and provide transparency as to who is requesting the \nearmark. I don't think that is too much to ask. I do not believe it is \ngoing to in any way, shape, or form disrupt or change anything other \nthan bring the light of day to classified earmarks.\n\n  I am prepared to ask for the yeas and nays. I ask the ranking member \nif he has looked at this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have looked at this amendment, and I \nhave no particular problem with it. I would think we could pass it by \nvoice vote, but as a courtesy to Senator Bond and the Intelligence \nCommittee, we have asked them to confirm that the understanding which \nthe Senator from California has is, indeed, correct. I have no reason \nto doubt her word on this matter, but the earlier comment to us was we \nwant to be sure that the fix has been made. She assures us it has been. \nBut as a courtesy to them, I have asked my staff to check with them. \nWhen that word comes back, which I expect to be positive, I will be \nwilling to move ahead with a voice vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I have no problem with trust but \nverify. I am happy to cease and desist at this time and wait and see. I \nthank the ranking member. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I urge--and I think this is my fourth \nurgent importuning of my colleagues--to please come to the floor with \ntheir amendments. The floor is open now. At 5:30 p.m. we will have a \nvote on two amendments and a cloture vote on a third amendment. I ask \nthem to please come to the floor and press their cause now because the \nweek is going on. It is Tuesday. We all heard the majority leader \nsaying this morning that we could finish this bill as early as \nWednesday evening or as late as Saturday. I know we would all want to \nsee it done on the former date.\n  Hopefully, Members will come to the floor. It is my understanding \nthere are some 60 amendments in the line. If a Senator does not want \nhis or her amendment to proceed further, please so advise us so we can \neliminate it from the list.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have heard from the minority on the \nIntelligence Committee, and they verify what Senator Feinstein has \nsaid; that is, that the corrections which they suggested which she has \naccepted are, in fact, in the bill. I am prepared to go to a vote on \nthe bill at this point, and I will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member. I call up \namendment No. 70.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 70.\n  The amendment (No. 70) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I can call up three amendments at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 63, 64, and 76 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendments Nos. 63, 64, and \n76.\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nThey are at the desk, and I ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I withhold further discussion of these \nparticular amendments until a later time.\n  Now I will move on to talking about a very major vote coming up in \nthe Senate later today.\n  This evening the Senate will cast a very important vote. The result \nwill go a long way toward deciding whether the gift rule changes before \nus meet the high standards for reform set by the American people in the \nmost recent elections in November. I am referring to the motion to \ninvoke cloture on Reid amendment No. 4, which contains very important \nprovisions imposing and strengthening restrictions on gifts, travel, \nand corporate jets.\n  I take a few minutes to explain why I believe the Reid amendment is \nso crucial.\n  In 1995, after another watershed election, the Senate adopted major \nrule changes, which came to be known as ``the gift ban.'' Prior to that \ntime, there were virtually no limits on the gifts or trips that \nSenators could accept. Scandalous tabloid TV exposes showed some of the \nmost egregious vacation extravaganzas that some Senators enjoyed at the \nexpense of others, and after an election in which numerous incumbents \nwere defeated and majority control of both Houses shifted, the Senate \nfinally, in 1995, took action.\n  People forget because the 1995 rules were a major departure from what \nhad gone before, but they contained exceptions and loopholes that, \nwhile they might have seemed reasonable at the time, began to cause \nproblems in the years that followed. For example, as I said, before \n1995, there were virtually no limits on the gifts that Senators could \naccept. I was astonished when I came here as a new senator in 1995 to \nsee the things that were being offered to Senators. I could not quite \nbelieve some of the things being offered. The 1995 gift ban was \nactually not a ban at all; instead, we just put a limit on gifts--$50 \nper gift, and $100 per year from a single source.\n  Similarly, the 1995 rules prohibited the worst excesses under the \nprevious anything goes attitude about privately funded travel--golf and \nski vacations paid for and attended by lobbyists, what were called \n``purely recreational trips.'' But it still allowed factfinding and \nofficially connected trips of up to 4 days in length, or 7 days to a \nforeign destination.\n\n  Not surprisingly, and consistent with the new rules, after 1995, as \nbefore, much of the gifts and travel offered to Senators and staff came \nfrom lobbyists and groups that lobby. Sure, constituents offer us T-\nshirts or baseball caps or home State products, and the rules allow \nthat. But not too many constituents making a trip to Washington with \ntheir kids are offering to take a Senator or staffer out to a $49 \ndinner or to buy tickets for them to the Kennedy Center or a Wizards \ngame.\n  Although there are exceptions, most of the invitations to go to \nconferences or on factfinding trips also come from lobbying \norganizations, groups with a point of view that they want to share with \na Senator or staffer in comfortable, relaxed surroundings, with ample \nfood and drink provided.\n  The American people, and many of my colleagues as well, have come to \nview these gifts and trips from those who want to influence us, which \nare now perfectly legal under our rules, as unseemly. And of course, \nthere have been people who have played fast and loose with the rules. \nThe $100 annual limit is hardly ever discussed. Tickets to skyboxes are \nsometimes valued at $49.99. A different person picks up the tab at \nregular lunches or a ``personal friendship'' is developed where one \nfriend always seems to pay. And fact-finding trips to Scotland have \nturned out to be golf adventures.\n  Now last year the Senate made a half-hearted effort in the direction \nof cleaning up this problem, but it fell short. It passed a lobbyist \ngift ban but didn't cover groups that retain or employ lobbyists. It \npassed new disclosure and Ethics Committee approval requirements for \nprivately funded trips but did nothing to change the underlying \nstandard of what kinds of trips can be taken. On these two key issues, \nthe Senate failed the test of real reform. And in any event, no changes \nto the rules went into effect because the bill died after it left the \nSenate.\n\n  The public showed its displeasure with these practices and the \nexcesses and lawbreaking in the November elections. Watershed elections \noccurred. Many new Members and new leaders arrived early this month. To \ntheir credit, Speaker Pelosi in the House and Majority Leader Reid made \nethics reform a top priority for the new Congress--and the first \npriority in the Senate. But they did something even more important. \nThey put the power of their offices behind tough and comprehensive \nreform, a strong brew of gift and travel changes, not the weak tea that \nwas before us last year.\n  Let me be very clear. While the underlying Reid-McConnell substitute \nincludes some important provisions to improve the flawed bill the \nSenate passed last year, it doesn't make the necessary changes to the \ngift and travel rules. Only if Reid amendment No. 4 is adopted will \nthat job be complete. Senator Reid follows the lead of the House to \nreally ban gifts from lobbyists, instead of letting groups that lobby \ncontinue to buy gifts. And he imposes new restrictions on lobbyist \nfunded travel that should reduce, if not eliminate, the excesses that \nhave become commonplace under the 1995 rules.\n  Senator Reid took a bold step as well by agreeing to include in his \namendment changes to the reimbursement rules that apply when Senators \nfly on corporate jets. I am very pleased that this change in particular \nhas been included because it was brought to the attention of the Senate \nin an ethics reform bill I introduced in July 2005. It will rid us of \none of the most obvious ethical fictions in the current rules, and in \nthe campaign laws--that flying on a corporate jet is just worth the \ncost of a first class ticket on a commercial airline.\n\n  To his credit, Senator Reid has been flexible in crafting the final \nversion of these new corporate jet rules. He included important \ndisclosure requirements that the Senator from Arizona and I have been \nseeking for some time. He made clear at the request of the Senator from \nOklahoma, that Members who fly their own planes are not affected by \nthese new rules. And he included a provision I suggested to address the \nconcern raised by the Senator from Alaska and others that their \nofficial travel budgets might need to be supplemented because of the \nparticularly complicated logistics of travel in their large and rural \nStates.\n  My colleagues, the vote on Reid amendment No. 4 will tell the \nAmerican people if we are serious about reform or just trying to get \naway with doing the least we can. The changes in Senator Reid's \namendment are absolutely critical to sending the message that the days \nof lobbyist access and influence based on the perks and privileges they \noffer us, the meals they buy,\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\nthe tickets they provide, the trips they arrange and their clients \nfinance, are over.\n  Lobbyists play an important, and indeed a constitutionally protected, \nrole in the legislative process. But the Constitution protects the \nrights of our citizens to petition their government, it does not \nguarantee that lobbyists hired by those citizens can try to influence \nelected representatives by taking them out to dinner. All this \namendment is saying is that if you want to meet with a lobbyist over \ndinner, go right ahead--but pay your own way. And if you do not want to \npay, then have the meeting in your office. That is the rule the \nWisconsin legislature has had for decades. That is the rule my staff \nand I have followed since I came to the Senate in 1993. That is the \nrule the U.S. Senate should support today. I urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of cloture on Reid amendment No. 4.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 56 now be the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this amendment prohibits the wrongful \ninfluencing of a private entity's employment decisions and/or practices \nin exchange for political access or favors.\n  As we all know from the recent activity in this body, Reid-McConnell, \nS. 1, is an ethics reform bill, I think a critically important bill for \nthis body and\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nfor the country. One of the things we want to make sure happens in that \nbill is that we provide all the protections possible to give confidence \nto the American people that what is happening in Washington speaks to \nsome of their concerns. This amendment speaks to that by providing \ncriminal penalties punishable, in this case, by a fine or imprisonment \nfor up to 15 years for anyone who would engage in the practice of \nwrongfully influencing a private entity's employment decisions and/or \npractices, as I said before, in exchange for political access or \nfavors.\n  Also, one of the penalties that is contemplated in this amendment is \nto disqualify an individual from holding public office--any office--if \nthey engage in that activity. What we are talking about is activity \nthat has gone under the umbrella of the name of the K Street Project \nwhich has been written about extensively in the public press for \nseveral years now, and what we are talking about there, in particular, \nI believe, is an effort to have a corrupting influence, in my judgment, \non a couple of important areas of activity in Washington--first, a \ncorrupting influence on hiring decisions in the private sector in \nWashington, a corrupting influence on political fundraising which we \nknow has all of the challenges that those of us in Washington who care \nabout doing it the right way have concerns about, and certainly the \nactivities of the K Street Project or any other similar effort, any \nother similar practice in Washington also has a corrupt influence on \nthe priorities of the Government of the United States. That is why this \namendment is so important.\n  It is long overdue. It is high time to end this corruption, to end \nthis practice which for too long has been a part of the culture of \ncorruption in Washington. I believe this amendment will strengthen S. \n1, it will strengthen any effort to provide, as the main bill \ncontemplates, both transparency and accountability, and I do believe \nthis amendment will speak directly to that issue. There is broad \nbipartisan support for this amendment, as there is for the Reid-\nMcConnell bill.\n  I also appreciate the fact that as a new Member--and, Mr. President, \nI include you in this as well as someone who cares very deeply, as you \ndo, about the question of ethics and ethics reform--the bill we are \ntalking about in the Senate was arrived at through a bipartisan effort, \nand I think it is important this amendment, which deals with the K \nStreet Project or any other similar effort in Washington, also be a \nbipartisan effort by people in both parties, on both sides of the aisle \nto make sure we can once and for all tear out by the roots the corrupt \npractices that, unfortunately, became known as the K Street Project.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to speak. I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before the Senator does that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. CASEY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I indicate to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania that I strongly support his amendment. My \nhope is we will be able to accept it without a vote. I have spoken with \nthe ranking member, and I believe he is vetting it and hopefully we \nwill be able to do that shortly.\n  I thank the Senator very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 30\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, last week, I was very pleased to join \nwith the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, in offering an \namendment to this bill to create an Office of Public Integrity. The \nAmerican people view the way we enforce ethics requirements as an \ninherently conflicted process. We are our own advisers, our own \ninvestigators, our own prosecutors, our own judges, our own juries, and \neven though some of our finest Members serve on our Ethics Committee, \nthey cannot escape that perception, they cannot escape the process, nor \ncan they convince the public that the process works to ensure an \nindependent, impartial investigation of allegations brought against \nMembers of Congress.\n  Last March, Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and myself offered an \namendment designed to restore the public's confidence in our ethics \nprocess by creating a new Senate Office of Public Integrity. Although \nthat amendment failed, I hope our colleagues will take another look at \nthe rationale for this office. I hope our colleagues have looked at the \nelection results in which the public clearly stated its concern over \nallegations of corruption. The adoption of our amendment is the single \nmost important step we could take to help restore the public's \nconfidence in the integrity of the decisions we make.\n  I am not saying the amendment the Senator from Connecticut and the \nSenator from Arizona and I have proposed is perfect. We are very open \nto working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have \nsuggestions for how to improve our amendment. We incorporated a lot of \nthose suggestions into the proposal we brought before the full Senate \nlast March.\n  I wanted to point out some basic information about this office. \nFirst, it would be headed by a Director jointly appointed by the \nmajority and the minority leaders of the Senate. So those who fear that \nsomehow this Director and this office would be partisan should look at \nthat provision that requires a joint appointment by the Democratic and \nthe Republican leaders. We preserve a very important and strong role \nfor the Ethics Committee, and I believe that, combined, these two \nentities can help restore public confidence in the independence and \nimpartiality of ethics oversight and enforcement.\n  I want to take a moment to underline this point about the role of the \nEthics Committee. It would be the Ethics Committee that decides if a \ncomplaint were frivolous, the Ethics Committee that would decide \nwhether to enforce a subpoena, the Ethics Committee that would \ndetermine when and whether investigatory materials are made public. I \nthink there is a lot of misunderstanding that somehow this office would \noperate completely divorced from the Ethics Committee and on automatic \npilot. It would be the Ethics Committee that would continue to provide \nadvice, both informally and through advisory opinions. It would be the \nEthics Committee, not the Director of the Senate Office of Public \nIntegrity, who would have sole discretion on what is reported publicly \nif the committee overrules a decision of the office.\n  At bottom, our amendment creates an independent, transparent process \nfor initiating and conducting investigations of possible ethical and \nother violations. I think this is important. We haven't had the \nproblems on this side of the Congress that have troubled our colleagues \non the House side, but I think we still need to act to put into place a \nprocess that would guarantee to the public an impartial and independent \ninvestigation of allegations--not of the final judgment, not of the \nremedies or punishment that is found by the Ethics Committee to be \nappropriate but the investigative stage. I suggest that not only would \nthis help restore public confidence in the process, but it would also \nbe helpful to Members because if an independent office concludes there \nis no merit to allegations lodged against Members of Congress, the \npublic is much more likely to accept that conclusion than if it is made \nby other Members of the same body who serve with us each day.\n  I know some of our colleagues are not comfortable generally with the \nconcept of an independent office with any investigatory powers. But I \ndon't believe we are creating some sort of monster, some sort of out-\nof-control special prosecutor because we impose on the process the \ndiscipline and the authority, the ultimate authority of the Ethics \nCommittee. But I do believe we would be creating a process that would \nhelp restore the badly tarnished view the public has of our ability to \ninvestigate ourselves.\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\n  I respect and I honor the constitutional role that says we sit in \njudgment of our peers, our colleagues, in both bodies. I am not talking \nabout disturbing that role in any way. Instead, what I am saying is it \nwould help restore public confidence, when serious allegations are \nlodged against a Member of Congress, if we were to create this \nindependent investigative office. There are many safeguards and checks \nand balances we have carefully built into the amendment that the \nSenator from Connecticut and I have brought before this body. I urge \nour colleagues to actually read the amendment and to take a look at it \nclosely. If there are particular concerns, I ask that they work with us \nto improve our amendment. But what is not acceptable to me is for this \namendment not to receive a vote by this body. The Members are familiar \nwith it. I believe it is time for us to go on the record.\n  I don't think that shoveling off this amendment in the hope that it \nwill come up at some future date is the way to proceed. I think our \namendment is well crafted and well balanced. I believe it would make a \nmajor difference in the process and help to restore the public's \nconfidence in the whole ethics system. I believe it is carefully \ncrafted so that it does not diminish the very important role of our \nEthics Committee, a role I respect and honor, but this amendment would \nhelp accomplish the goal of building the public's trust.\n  Why is this so important? Because if the public does not trust our \nethics system, it will not trust the decisions we are making on vital \nissues--the issues that shape the future of this country. The American \npeople deserve to know that our decisions are not tainted by outside \nundue influence. They deserve to know we are putting the interests of \nthe American people and our constituents above any other interests.\n  I have often said, and I will repeat it, that I respect the important \nrole lobbyists play in the process. They provide us with useful \ninformation, whether they are representing a children's advocacy group, \nthe business community, a labor organization, or a public interest \nassociation. That input is important to us as long as it aids but does \nnot dictate our decisions. It is important that the process be \ntransparent.\n  There is much in this bill, which we worked very hard on in the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last year, that \nimproves the transparency of the process, but we need to add the \nenforcement piece. We need to make sure not only that we ban \ninappropriate practices, not only that we have full and more accessible \ndisclosure, but we need the enforcement piece as well. That is what my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut as well as the Senators from \nArizona and Illinois have proposed, and I believe it is the missing \npiece that will make already good legislation an excellent bill.\n  Most of all, it is important that we go on record, that we have an \nopportunity for a vote because, after all, that is part of the process, \ntoo: ensuring that Members express their views and that it is done in a \nforthright manner. I hope very much we will have an opportunity to have \na rollcall vote on this important amendment.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with the new chairman of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on this issue, as \non every issue on which I have worked with the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to particularly thank the \nSenator from Maine, the previous chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, under whose leadership this bill was \nfashioned, along with myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Obama, who \nhas now joined us as an original cosponsor. We have continued this \nbattle. We lost last year, but we think this is an important provision, \nand sometimes you have to fight for something you think is right until \nyou can convince a majority to join with you.\n  Senator Collins has stated the case very well. The underlying bill \nhere, S. 1, and some of the amendments that have been filed to it \nrepresent a significant step forward in the way we in Congress will \nregulate our own ethics and provide for disclosure and oversight of the \nbehavior of those who lobby us.\n  This underlying bill is not a perfect bill, but it is a very strong \nbill. Ultimately the test of it will be its credibility. This is \ncomparable to other laws that we pass--for example Federal criminal \nlaw. We pass some good laws, but ultimately we depend on the \nindependence of the investigative and prosecutorial system and the \nindependence of the judges who adjudicate the cases brought before them \nnot only so justice is done, but also that the system of justice we \nhave created enjoys the respect and trust of the people of this \ncountry.\n  Here is the situation in this case. We have a tough, underlying bill \nwith substantial reforms to congressional ethics and lobbying, but \nthere is no change in the enforcement mechanism for implementing the \nbroader reforms that would be adopted under the underlying bill. That \nis what we propose to do with this amendment number 30, establish an \nOffice of Public Integrity. I will get to it in a moment, but I would \nalso like to echo an appeal that the Senator from Maine made.\n  Unfortunately, I saw respectfully, in the wisdom of the \nParliamentarian, the ruling has come down that this amendment would not \nbe germane post-cloture. We have tried to convince the Parliamentarian \notherwise. We have not succeeded. That is a given. We respect it. There \nis a process that sometimes reaches a conclusion in judgment with which \nwe don't agree, but the process is so independent and reliable that we \naccept it nonetheless. What that means, obviously, is that unless we \nare able to bring this amendment, to create an Office of Public \nIntegrity, to a vote prior to a cloture vote on the overall bill--which \nwe presume will be tomorrow--we will not have a chance to bring it to a \nvote.\n  We have been told that unanimous consent--which is necessary to set \naside the pending amendment and bring this up--will not be granted to \nthis amendment. I urge our leaders and others to please reconsider \nthat. We know--Senator Collins, Senator Obama, Senator McCain, and I,--\nthat we are still fighting upstream to get the necessary votes we need \nto agree to this. But I think it is important that we have the debate, \nthat we have the vote, that we build support.\n  There are many new Members, and I don't presume to know how they \nwould vote, and I know the new Members have gone through the process at \nhome and they know the extent to which our constituents--Democratic, \nRepublican, Independent--are unhappy with a lot of the way we do \nbusiness. They believe there is too much partisanship and, of course, \ntheir views were affected by the scandals of the last few years.\n  When you think about it, it has been a difficult time for Congress. \nOf course, obviously, almost all Members of Congress conduct themselves \nin an ethical way, but we all suffer, and the institution suffers, when \nsome Members do not conduct themselves in an ethical way. Look back \nover the last 4 or 5 years. In 2002, the majority leader in the House \nwas indicted for conspiring to illegally funnel corporate money into \nState campaigns, a violation of State campaign laws. Another Member of \nCongress went to jail for exchanging earmarks for bribes. The FBI \nraided the office of a third Member in a probe of possible illicit \nactivity. Lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty and went to jail for \nwire fraud and conspiracy, and the investigations into his activities \nrevealed what can only be characterized as the most sleazy, unethical, \nultimately illegal behavior by Mr. Abramoff, his associates, and \nindividuals in both the legislative and executive branches of \nGovernment.\n  One Member pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements \nregarding political favors given to Abramoff in exchange for gifts. A \nformer Deputy Chief of Staff for a Congressman pleaded guilty to \nconspiracy and corruption charges. A former official at the General \nServices Administration in the Office of Management and Budget was \nconvicted of lying to various officials at GSA in an attempt to cover \nup favorable treatment he gave to Mr. Abramoff.\n  And just as the news of many of these scandals was winding down, the \nNation was shaken again last fall by the news\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\nof Congressman Foley's improper behavior. So who can blame the American \npeople for having lost a lot of their confidence in Congress? As we \nleft town last October for the election break, Congress's public \napproval ratings were hovering in the teens. To put any doubts to rest, \nI think the American people sent a message on election day that they \nwanted a change in Washington. Some of the exit polls were stunning \nbecause they showed that more voters identified corruption in \nWashington as influencing their votes in last fall's election than any \nother issue, including, much to my surprise, the war in Iraq.\n  America voted for us to clean up our act. That is what the underlying \nbill, S. 1, will do. But it will not do it as well as it should if we \ndo not also reform the system by which these rules and laws are \nenforced. That is exactly what this bill does.\n  The legislation before us pledges to the American people that we are \ngoing to put the public interest above our own self-interest. We are \nsaying no to gifts and travel from lobbyists. We are demanding greater \ndisclosure from lobbyists about their activities. We are going to slow \nthe revolving door between Congress and the lobbying firms of K Street. \nThe bill before us is one of the strongest reform measures I have seen \nin the Senate. I am proud to support it. But, again, it needs an \nequally strong enforcement mechanism.\n  Last month, before the ink was dry on the House Ethics Committee \nreport on the allegations of a coverup of Congressman Foley's behavior, \nthe press and a lot of the people dismissed it as a half-hearted job, a \nkind of ``inside the Congress'' going-easy report. I do not accept that \nconclusion, but the fact is, when you have Members judging Members \nalong the whole way of the process, that is where a lot of the people \nare going to inevitably end up.\n\n  I know many of my colleagues in the Senate will say the House has a \nproblem, not the Senate. I would say a couple of things to that. First, \nwe all suffer when any Member of Congress acts unethically and Congress \nseems not to be responding independently and aggressively. Who is to \nsay the process we have for judging our own ethical problems will not \nsomeday soon also be seen by the public as having a problem. The public \ndoes not care whether the scandal occurred in the House or the Senate. \nTo the public, Congress is Congress. We all swim together or we all \nsink together.\n  The fact is, under the status quo of enforcement in the Senate, the \nEthics Committee, composed of Members of the Senate, investigate, \nrecommend, and decide on judgment. We need to break that and create an \nindependent part of the process, which is exactly what our amendment \nwould do, to conduct the investigation and recommend an action.\n  There has been a lot of concern among Members about this amendment. I \nurge them to take a look at the details. I spoke with one Member \nearlier today who said he was concerned that an irresponsible ethical \ncomplaint would be filed with the independent Office of Public \nIntegrity in the middle of a campaign or before--but particularly \nduring the middle of a campaign--would be used in a 30-second \ncommercial against an incumbent.\n  Of course, that can happen now if somebody files a complaint with the \nEthics Committee. But, in fact, I think the proposal we have made is \naimed at an independent investigation but protecting against exactly \nthat kind of abuse.\n  Let me go through the process, briefly, to reassure Members. A \ncomplaint may be filed with the Public Integrity Office by a Member of \nCongress, an outside complainant or the Office itself at its own \ninitiative. No complaint may be accepted against a Member within 60 \ndays of an election involving that Member. So we are trying to separate \nthis from a campaign caper.\n  Within 30 days of filing, the director must make an initial \ndetermination as to whether to dismiss the case or whether there are \nsufficient grounds for conducting an investigation. During that time, \nthe Member who is the subject of the complaint may challenge the \ncomplaint. The director may dismiss a complaint that fails to state a \nviolation, lacks credible evidence of a violation or relates to a \nviolation that is inadvertent, technical or otherwise of a de minimis \nnature.\n  I urge my colleagues to particularly listen to this.\n\n       The Director may refer a case that has been dismissed to \n     the Ethics Committee for the Ethics Committee to determine if \n     the complaint is frivolous. If the Ethics Committee \n     determines that a complaint is frivolous, the committee may \n     notify the Director not to accept any future complaint filed \n     by that same person and the complainant may be required to \n     pay for the costs of the office resulting from the complaint.\n\n  This is meant to be independent, but it is also meant to be fair and \nto protect Members from the political abuse of the process we are \ncreating. There is not publicity on this until some judgment is made, \nso that the prospects for misuse in a political context, in my opinion, \nare actually less under this proposal of ours than they are in the \ncurrent system.\n  This Office of Public Integrity assures the American people that each \nethics case is examined by this independent entity. But the Ethics \nCommittee would in no way lose its authority to be the ultimate judge \nof whether a violation has occurred because that is the authority it \nhas, pursuant to the Constitutional provision that Members of each \nChamber shall regulate their own behavior.\n  It is an interesting fact that the Ethics Committee itself has \noccasionally retained independent counsel to investigate ethics \ncomplaints that come before it. This, in part, I know, is a reflection \nof the committee's concern that it doesn't have sufficient staff to \nhandle all the investigations that come before it. But I think it is \nalso a reflection of a judgment that motivates this amendment--that \nthere are times when a charge is made against a Senator before a \ncommittee of his peers or her peers, Senators, and to establish real \ncredibility for the investigation the Ethics Committee itself has \nbrought in an independent investigator. We are saying that makes good \nsense, and that is exactly what our amendment would do on an ongoing \nbasis.\n  Finally, I wish to note that at the suggestion of our friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, we are assigning, under this \namendment, to this Office of Public Integrity, the role of recommending \nto the Ethics Committee the approval or disapproval of privately funded \ntravel by Members and staff. The underlying bill restricts privately \nfunded travel that may be accepted by Members of Congress and contains \na new pre-approval process for privately funded travel. Giving this \nresponsibility to this Office of Public Integrity, independent as it \nis, I think will help assure the American people that travel requests \nby Members of the Senate will be scrutinized independently by this \nindependent office.\n  I will conclude, noting that the time is coming to go to the \ndiscussion of the three pending amendments. This proposal for an Office \nof Public Integrity is entirely consistent with the Constitution's \nmandate that each House of Congress determines its own rules and \nsanctions its own members. It is a proposal consistent with the \npractice of the Ethics Committee of bringing in outside counsel on \noccasion to assist in its work. It is 100 percent consistent with the \nmessage the American people sent in November: for Congress to conduct \nitself with honor and dignity, in a fashion that earns their trust.\n  This is a sensible, strong effort to assure the people who are good \nenough to send us to Washington that we are not only adopting reforms \nin our lobbying regulations and laws and our ethics regulations and \nlaws, but we are taking strong action to make sure those reforms are \nwell enforced, as they should and must be if we are to restore the \npublic's confidence in our work. This is an important amendment. It \ndeserves a vote. I appeal to my colleagues and leaders to give it that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time between \n4:30 and 5:30 shall be evenly divided between and controlled by the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the previous \nquorum call and remaining quorum calls before the vote at 5:30 be \nequally divided against the time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at 5:30 the Senate will be voting on my \nsecond-degree amendment to an amendment offered by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, Mr. DeMint. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nworking with Senator Reid and myself to craft a strong provision to \ndeal with earmark reform.\n  One of the concerns many had about the underlying DeMint earmark \nreform was that we did not think the language was strong enough when it \ncame to tax provisions. There were provisions in appropriations bills \nwhich direct money to entities. They can be private entities or public \nentities, they could be State governments, local governments, any \nnumber of different types of governmental units, as well as private \nentities.\n  For example, I have directed money in the Defense appropriations bill \nto two firms in Illinois that are doing breakthrough research on a \nvariety of things of importance to the Department of Defense, so the \nactual firms were named. That is the nature of an appropriations \nearmark. I, in my practice in the office, have been as transparent as \npossible. There is a race to put out a press release as soon as it is \ndone because I take great pride in what we support.\n  What we are trying to do is to put into the rules of the Senate and \nthe control of legislation in the Senate more transparency, more \naccountability, so there is no question, so we avoid any abuse such as \nled to some of the more embarrassing episodes in the last Congress \nresulting in corruption charges against lobbyists and Members of \nCongress.\n  The initial intent of Senator DeMint in his amendment was positive, \nto move toward more appropriations earmarks disclosure, but we felt \nthat his language, when it came to tax provisions, needed to be \nstrengthened.\n  Of course, one can benefit a company by sending money for research. \nOne can also benefit a company by giving them a break in the Tax Code. \nBoth are of value to the company. They should be treated the same when \nit comes to disclosure, transparency, and accountability.\n  The purpose of my second-degree amendment was to strengthen the \nlanguage of the earmark disclosure when it comes to that. We broadened \nthe definition of what is known as a limited tax benefit. If we were to \nprovide a cut in the tax rate for all Americans in certain income \ncategories, that does not have a particular impact on an individual or \na company. That is a general tax benefit. When we deal with limited tax \nbenefits, they can be written in a way when they benefit one specific \nentity, one specific company, or a few, a handful, we want those tax \nearmarks to be treated with the same disclosure requirements as the \nearmarks in appropriations.\n  The DeMint amendment defined a limited tax benefit as a revenue-\nlosing provision that provides tax benefits to 10 or fewer \nbeneficiaries or contains eligibility criteria that are not the same \nfor other potential beneficiaries. That is his original language.\n  I have thought that the number 10 was the problematic element in his \napproach. I don't know where the number 10 came from. I think it might \nhave been in an earlier House version, but I think the language we \nreplace it with makes more sense.\n  We define ``limited tax benefit'' as any revenue provision that \nprovides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to a \nparticular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries. Our \ndefinition is more expansive, would cover more tax earmarks, would \nrequire more disclosure, more transparency, more accountability. I \nthink that was the goal of Senator DeMint's amendment.\n  It is my understanding that he is going to accept my second-degree \namendment which is going to tighten this language when it comes to tax \nearmarks.\n  Second, the Durbin amendment requires the earmark disclosure \ninformation be placed on the Internet in a searchable format for at \nleast 48 hours before consideration of the bills, resolutions, or \nreports that contain the earmarks. The DeMint amendment did not have a \nsimilar provision. In the world of the Internet, we know that posting \nthis information 48 hours before the bill can be considered so that the \nearmarks are known to all who care to look is the best way to make sure \nthere is transparency. So we have added this 48-hour disclosure \nprovision before the consideration of a bill, resolution, or report \nthat contains either an appropriations or a tax earmark. In that way, \nwe have expanded the availability of information for those who follow \nthe proceedings of the Senate.\n\n  There is more to be done. Senator Harkin of Iowa is not in the Senate \nnow, but he pointed out an element of the underlying bill that is \nproblematic when it comes to language on this tax benefit provision. \nSenator Harkin is right. Paragraph B in this bill is subject to \nmisinterpretation. He has suggested at some point--before the vote or \nafter--we have a colloquy to make it clear what our intent would be. I \nam going to join him in that. I am hoping we can either clean up this \nparagraph B by way of amendment in the Senate, if not in conference. We \ndo not want any ambiguity when it comes to the applicability of this \nprovision as it relates to limited tax benefits.\n  I have discussed this with Senator DeMint, and we will see if we can \nget this done in the Senate. If not, I hope we can address it in the \nconference committee. We will be working with the Committee on Finance, \nwhich is our Senate committee responsible for tax provisions, to make \nsure they understand what our intention will be and take any advice \nthey have to offer that will help us come up with better language.\n  I am pleased with this bipartisan solution to the concerns that \nseveral Senators had with the original DeMint earmark amendment. If the \nsecond-degree amendment is agreed to, we will have a positive vote in \npassing this amendment. I believe it reflects the intent of all on both \nsides of the aisle to make sure there is more disclosure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois if there is any additional time I might utilize?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the time has \nbeen equally divided prior to voting at 5:30. I have used a portion of \nit here, and I ask the Parliamentarian how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I, of course, yield all that time to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator for \nhis characteristic courtesy.\n  James Madison reminds us, in Federalist No. 37, that:\n\n       The genius of republican liberty seems to demand . . . not \n     only that all power should be derived from the people, but \n     that those intrusted with it should be kept in dependence on \n     the people. . . .\n\n  Let me say that again. James Madison says, in Federalist No. 37, that \n``The genius of republican liberty seems to demand . . . not only that \nall power should be derived from the people, but that those intrusted \nwith it''--meaning that power--``should be kept in dependence on the \npeople. . . .''\n  To ensure that this quotation I have just stated by James Madison is \nso, it is the representatives of the people in Congress--including \nRobert C. Byrd and all other Senators here--who are entrusted with the \npower of the purse.\n  Now, listen to that. To ensure that this is so, it is the \nrepresentatives of the people in Congress who are entrusted with the \npower of the purse.\n  ``This power,'' Madison writes, in Federalist No. 58, ``may, in fact, \nbe regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any \nconstitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for \nobtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect \nevery just and salutary measure.''\n  We are Senators, the people's representatives. We are here to look \nafter the interests of the people of our States. In many cases, they \nare not well-to-do people. They cannot just pick up a phone and call \nthe White\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\nHouse. And, too often, the Federal bureaucracy is an inaccessible \nmorass. In time of need--in drought or flood, when a bridge is near \ncollapse, when safe drinking water is not available, when health care \nservices are endangered, when a community is struggling, when worker \nsafety is threatened--the people call on their representatives in \nCongress.\n  Many times, we are the only ones who are willing to listen. Get that. \nMany times, we are the only ones who are willing to listen, and the \nonly ones--hear me, again--who are willing to help. We, the people's \nrepresentatives, are armed by the Constitution with the power of the \npurse to ensure that the Federal Government is responsive to their--the \npeople's--needs.\n  And so when I speak about congressional earmarks, I speak about a \nsubject that broaches the most serious of constitutional questions: \nWho--hear me--who shall control expenditures from the public \ntreasuries, the unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch \ndowntown--I do not speak ill of them; they are responsible people--but \nI say, the unaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch or the \nrepresentatives of the people?\n  Let me say that again. We, here in the Senate, are armed by the \nConstitution with the power of the purse--in this body and the other \nbody--to ensure that the Federal Government is responsive to their--the \npeople's--needs.\n  And so when I speak about congressional earmarks, I speak about a \nsubject that broaches the most serious of constitutional questions: Who \nshall control expenditures from the public treasuries, the \nunaccountable bureaucrats in the executive branch or the elected \nrepresentatives of the people in the legislative branch?\n  Earmarks are arguably the most criticized and the least understood of \ncongressional practices. I know it is easy to attack these \ncongressional practices. Many of the most vocal critics do not \nunderstand the purpose of the earmarks they criticize, nor do they have \nany appreciation of their uses or benefits in the communities that \nreceive them.\n  Let me say that again. Earmarks--hear me, everybody; those from the \nStates, I know they are always listening--earmarks are arguably the \nmost criticized and the least understood of congressional practices. \nMany of the most vocal critics do not understand the purpose of the \nearmarks they criticize, nor do they have any appreciation of their \nuses, meaning the uses of earmarks, or benefits in the communities that \nreceive these earmarks.\n  Many people do not know that earmarks are not specific to \nappropriations bills. For instance, earmarks can be found in revenue \nbills as tax benefits for narrowly defined constituencies. Earmarks can \nbe found in authorization bills that are wholly separate from the \nappropriations process. Hear me now. Earmarks can be found--yes; \nwhere?--in the President's budget requests. How about that? Earmarks \ncan be found in the President's budget requests, and sometimes as part \nof the budget reconciliation process.\n  There is no law, no rule, no universal standard that even defines \nwhat an earmark is. And so I leave the determination about the \npropriety and need for an earmark, not with the political pundits or \nthe so-called watchdog groups or the news media or the unelected \nbureaucrats downtown, but where that determination rightfully belongs, \nwhere it rightfully belongs under the Constitution, with the people, \nwith the people of the United States.\n  So hear me--hear me, everyone East, West, South, and North--when I \nsay there is nothing inherently wrong with an earmark. It is an \nexplicit direction from the Congress--the people's elected \nrepresentatives; the Congress--about how the Federal Government should \nspend the people's money--your money out there in the hills and \nmountains and prairies and the plains and valleys of this country. I \nsay again, it is an explicit direction--talking about earmarks--from \nthe Congress about how the Federal Government should spend your money, \nthe people's money.\n  It is absolutely consistent with the Framers' intentions. Dispute me, \nif you like. Challenge me, if you like, and challenge the Constitution \nof the United States. It is codified in Article I of the Constitution, \ngiving the power of the purse to the representatives of the people.\n  We, the representatives of the people, have an obligation to be good \nstewards of the public treasury and to prevent imprudent expenditures. \nThat is our duty. We have an obligation to guard against the corruption \nof any public officials who would sell their soul and the trust of \ntheir constituency in order to profit from an official act. That also \nis our duty, and one not to be taken lightly. But let no person suggest \nthat the Congress errs in using an earmark to designate how the \npeople's money should be spent.\n  Let me say that again. Let no person suggest that the Congress errs \nin using an earmark to designate how the people's money--your money out \nthere, your money; hear me, the people's money--should be spent. That \nis equally our constitutional duty. It does not belong to the \nPresident. It does not belong to the unelected bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch. It belongs to the people through their elected \nrepresentatives here in Congress.\n  Well intentioned though they may be, the civil servants making budget \ndecisions in the executive agencies and offices of the Federal \nGovernment do not understand the communities that we--you and I, Mr. \nPresident, all of us here--represent.\n  They do not meet with the constituencies. They do not know our \nStates. They do not know our people. They do not see what we see.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The majority's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as long as I require, \nand it won't be too long.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would say to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia through the Chair that we have 30 minutes on \nour side, and I have two speakers. I know Senator McCain and Senator \nDeMint wish to speak. I am not sure how long that will take. Does the \nSenator have an idea how much longer he will need, 5 minutes, 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will try to finish in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to yield for an additional 10 minutes to \nthe other side.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my generous and considerate friend.\n  The process may not be flawless, but if public monies are spent \nunwisely or wastefully, at least the people have the means to know \nabout it. Both the House and Senate in open session must agree on an \nearmark, and the president has an opportunity to veto the measure that \ncarries it. There is a record of debate, and a record of how each \nMember of Congress votes. A controversial item is available for all to \nsee and judge if not before, then certainly after it is enacted. \nUltimately, Senators will have to defend their votes on the floor of \nthe Senate, or respond to the inquiries of the media, or stand before \nthe electorate and their constituency. The representatives of the \npeople in Congress are held accountable.\n  If the Congress does not specify how funds are to be spent, then the \ndecision falls to the executive branch--the so-called ``experts'' at \nbureaucratic agencies to determine the priorities of this Nation. In \nsuch cases, the American people may never know who is responsible for a \nspending decision. The American people never know how a spending \ndecision is made. They may never hear anything about it. In the \nexecutive bureaucracy, there is far less accountability to the people.\n  We ought to prefer that spending decisions be made in an open and \npublic forum of debate, rather than ensconced within the hidden and \nunaccountable agencies of the executive branch. The fact that \ncontroversial earmarks are being openly debated, and that several \ncontroversial earmarks were put before the voters last November, \nsuggests that the system works. Those entrusted with power are being \nheld accountable to the people.\n  So I say to Senators that we are treading some dangerous \nconstitutional grounds with this bombast against earmarks. I support, \nas I always have, making the budget and appropriations process more \ntransparent, but let their be no mistake that the misguided cries to do \naway with earmarks has constitutional ramifications\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nabout who controls the power of the purse. The White House recognizes \nthis. The President is asking the Congress to reduce congressional \nearmarks, leaving more spending decisions to the White House and \nexecutive branch. The President is asking for fewer limitations and \nmore flexibility in how the executive branch spends the people's money. \nThe President is even taking advantage of the current political \nenvironment to ask for a line-item veto--God help us--a wholly \nunconstitutional grant of power invalidated once before by the Supreme \nCourt. If so-called earmark reforms happen too quickly and with too \nlittle thought to the constitutional ramifications, it could mark the \nbeginnings of a dangerous aggrandizement of the executive in the \nlegislative process, and I am not for that. I am not willing to go \nalong with it.\n  In this rush to label earmarks as the source of our budgetary woes, \nand calls to expand the budgetary authorities of the President, we--\nMembers of the Senate--should remember why deficits have soared to \nunprecedented levels. Senators will recall that the president has not \nexercised his current constitutional authorities. He has not vetoed a \nsingle spending or revenue bill. He has not submitted a single \nrescission proposal under the Budget Act.\n  What has wrought these ominous budget deficits are the \nadministration's grossly flawed and impossible budget assumptions. In \n2001, the President inherited a $5.6 trillion, 10-year surplus. After 1 \nyear operating under his fiscal policies, that surplus disappeared. We \nwent from a surplus in the fiscal year 2001 of $128 billion to a \ndeficit in the fiscal year 2002 of $158 billion, followed by the three \nlargest deficits in our Nation's history in the fiscal years 2003, \n2004, and 2005. The administration's excessive tax cuts added $3 \ntrillion in budget deficits. The war in Iraq, which I voted against, \nhas required the Congress to appropriate $379 billion, and another $100 \nbillion request will arrive from the President next month. Rather than \ndealing with these fiscal failures, too many would rather propagate the \nspecious argument that enlarging the president's role in the budget \nprocess and doing away with congressional earmarks will magically \nreduce these foreboding and menacing deficits. It absolutely will not.\n  Often, critics of congressional earmarks assert that earmarks, by \ndefinition, are wasteful spending. In the 1969 Agriculture \nAppropriations bill, Congress earmarked funds for a new program to \nprovide critical nutrition to low-income women, infants and children. \nThis program, which is now known as the WIC program, has since provided \nnutritional assistance to over 150 million women, infants and children, \na critical contribution to the health of the nation. Is that wasteful \nspending? Is that wasteful spending?\n  In the 1969 and 1970, Congress earmarked $25 million for a children's \nhospital in Washington, DC, even overcoming a Presidential veto. That \nfunding resulted in the construction of what is known as the Children's \nNational Medical Center. The hospital has become a national and \ninternational leader in neonatal and pediatric care. Since the hospital \nopened, over 5 million children have received health care. Last year, \nChildren's Hospital treated over 340,000 young patients, and performed \nover 10,000 surgeries, saving and improving the lives of thousands of \nyoung children. Is that wasteful spending?\n  In 1983, Congress earmarked funds for a new emergency food and \nshelter program. In 2005 alone, the program served 35 million meals and \nprovided 1.3 million nights of lodging to the homeless. Is that \nwasteful spending?\n  In 1987, Congress earmarked funds for the mapping of the human gene. \nThis project became known as the Human Genome Project. This research \nhas lead to completely new strategies for disease prevention and \ntreatment. The Human Genome Project has led to discoveries of dramatic \nnew methods of identifying and treating breast, ovarian, and colon \ncancers, saving many, many lives. Is this wasteful spending?\n  In 1988 and 1995, Congress earmarked funds for the development of \nunmanned aerial vehicles. These efforts produced the Predator and the \nGlobal Hawk, two of the most effective assets that have been used in \nthe global war on terror. Is this wasteful spending?\n  No. Each of these earmarks was initiated by Congress and produced \nlasting gains for the American people.\n  There is no question that the earmarking process has grown to \nexcessive levels in recent years. From 1994 to 2006, the funding that \nhas been earmarked has nearly tripled. That is why I have joined with \nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Obey in calling for a 1-year \nmoratorium on earmarks in the fiscal year 2007 joint funding resolution \nthat will be before the Senate next month. That moratorium will give \nthe Congress the time it needs to approve legislation that adds \ntransparency to the process of earmarking funds.\n  I support transparency and debate in the congressional budget and \nappropriations process. I support the provisions included in the ethics \nbill now pending before the Senate that would provide a more \naccountable, above-board, and transparent process by requiring earmarks \nfor non-Federal entities in all of their legislative forms--as \nauthorizing measures, as appropriations measures, as revenue measures--\nto be disclosed--yes, let's have it out in the open--along with their \nsponsors and essential government purpose, prior to their consideration \nby the Senate. If the sponsor is Robert C. Byrd, let him show himself. \nTaxpayers, of West Virginia and the Nation ought to know how and why \nspending decisions are made. That is why it is essential to ensure that \nthese spending decisions remain in the Congress.\n  In past years, the Congress routinely failed to consider the annual \nappropriations bills in a timely manner. When they were considered, \nthey too often took the form of massive omnibus bills that were forced \nupon the Senate without the opportunity to amend--take it or leave it. \nSuch practices encouraged the kinds of earmarking practices that have \nbeen criticized in recent months. As chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I, Robert C. Byrd, will endeavor to do all \nthat I can to have the annual appropriations bills considered in a \ntimely manner. When the fiscal year 2008 spending bills are brought to \nthe floor, I will do all that I can to allow the Senate to work its \nwill, and to open the spending decisions of the Congress to the \nAmerican people.\n  Senators take an oath to preserve and protect the Constitution. \nEliminating waste and abuse in the Federal budget process is important, \nbut protecting the character and design of the Constitution is \nabsolutely essential. Let's not lose our heads and subsequently the \nsafeguards of our rights and liberties as American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah controls the remainder \nof the time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Illinois \nhas an action he wishes to take. I yield to him at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 41\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may call up amendment No. 41 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a supplement to what I already \nthink is an excellent bill that has been presented by the two leaders \nto try to improve our processes and provide more transparency and \naccountability in how lobbyists interact and how we conduct ourselves \nin an ethical fashion.\n  To make it very plain, this amendment simply says that all registered \nFederal lobbyists would have to disclose not only the contributions \nthey make but also the contributions they have solicited and bundled. \nIt applies only to registered lobbyists. It has strong support on a \nbipartisan and bicameral basis. I hope we can have this amendment \nagreed to.

Mr. President, last year, Washington was \nrocked by the Abramoff scandal and other misdeeds. With the underlying \nbill, Congress has shown it is taking seriously its responsibility to \nthe American people its responsibility to set rules for behavior by \nMembers and staff that aren't just words on a page in a dusty ethics \nmanual.\n  I applaud the effort that has gone into ethics reform. It has been a \ngood debate. There is one point that I discussed last year--- as early \nas the Rules Committee markup--- that I feel needs to again be part of \nthe debate this year. Last year I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment to make many of the reforms we have considered throughout \nthis ethics debate apply to all branches of government. I am pleased \nthat this sense of the Senate was accepted and is included in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Today I have filed and proposed amendment No. 71, which builds on the \nprinciple behind this sense of the Senate that the standards employed \nin this bill should be the minimum standards that guide the other \nbranches of Government. The revolving door isn't just on the front of \nthe U.S. Capitol. It spins freely in the executive branch--in every \nFederal agency in Washington.\n  My amendment has three parts:\n\n       The first provision says the gift and travel bans of this \n     bill should be the minimum standards employed by the \n     executive and judicial branches. The second provision extends \n     the Senate's 1-year ban on lobbying by former staff to the \n     executive branch. The third provision extends the Senate's \n     negotiating of future employment provisions to the executive \n     branch as well.\n\n  I believe in disclosure, transparency and restoring integrity to our \ngovernment. The question here isn't whether reforms are needed, they \nare. But we need to make sure we are implementing the right reforms. \nAny reforms need to apply to all branches of government if we are to \nbegin the process of rebuilding trust between the government and the \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I think the underlying bill is incomplete without my \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about \na couple of amendments on which we are getting ready to vote. One is \nmine, and one is an amendment to my amendment by Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking unanimous consent to \nspeak? There is an order presently to vote at this time. Is the Senator \nseeking unanimous consent?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes. I ask unanimous consent to speak. I apologize, Mr. \nPresident. I am getting ahead of myself today. I thank the \nParliamentarian. Am I free to speak at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 44, as modified and 11\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we are getting ready to vote on a couple \nof amendments. One is Senator Durbin's which I believe improves the \nunderlying amendment, which is my amendment No. 11. I thank Senator \nReid and Senator Durbin and a number of Members on the Democratic side \nwho worked with us to perfect this amendment in a way that will be good \nfor the country and will be much more transparent in how we do \nbusiness. I have asked to be a cosponsor of Senator Durbin's amendment, \nwhich will come up before mine. I again encourage all my Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues to support Senator Durbin's amendment, as well as \nthe underlying amendment.\n  I remind my colleagues, I think these two amendments focus on the \nmost egregious problem with this whole idea of ethics and lobbying \nreform. It makes all of the earmarks, all of the designated spending--\nsome folks refer to this as specific favors for interest groups--\neverything we do to designate funds in a particular direction, it just \nrequires us to disclose these, to disclose them in a way that the \nAmerican people can see, can find them on the Internet, and can \ndetermine for themselves if this is a good way to spend their \ntaxpayers' dollars. We believe, as I think the American people do, that \nif it is clear what we are doing while we are doing it and who is doing \nit, it will, first of all, limit unnecessary earmarks and unnecessary \nFederal spending, but it will also create a lot more accountability for \nthis designated spending which we do attach to bills.\n  I thank my Democratic colleagues for working constructively with us. \nWe made progress and created a better bill. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to vote for both of the amendments tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          limited tax benefits\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am concerned about a possible \nmisunderstanding of the intent of the language in the proposed Senate \nrule XLIV concerning earmarks. My specific concern goes to the \ndefinition in the proposal concerning ``limited tax benefits.'' The \ndefinition contains two parts. The first is a two-part test that \nprovides that limited tax benefit is one that ``provides a Federal tax \ndeduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to a particular beneficiary \nor limited group of beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986, and (B) contain eligibility criteria that are uniform in \napplication with respect to potential beneficiaries of such \nprovision''. The key here is the word ``and'' after 1986. The second \npart simply provides that if this test is not\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\nmet, that only a tax that benefits a single entity is a ``limited tax \nbenefit.''\n  I am told that there are some who might define ``potential \nbeneficiaries'' to only include a variation in the treatment of the \nclass covered by the amendment. This would not be logical. My \nperception, prior to our voting, is that the intent of those two words \n``potential beneficiaries'' means a category or class of taxpayers \nimpacted by the tax provision. In other words, if the Senate was \nconsidering the modification of the alternative minimum tax to not \ninclude a specific tax provision in the code as counting as income \nunder the AMT, that would not be considered a limited tax benefit, \nbecause it would impact all of the potential beneficiaries equally. On \nthe other hand, if one was considering a provision that went into the \ncode and said that we should not count that class of income as AMT \nincome as applied to X or Y, that would not be treating everyone in the \nclass the same. In the latter case, we would be triggering subsection \n``B,'' because there was not uniform treatment of all potential \nbeneficiaries of the break. And accordingly, if the number impacted in \nthe second case was a ``limited group of beneficiaries,'' it would be \nconsidered a limited tax benefit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe that the Senator from Iowa has \nraised an important point. we need to clarify how the amendment applies \nto targeted tax benefits. We would like the language of the amendment \nto capture a wide variety of situations where a small number of \ntaxpayers receive special treatment. I hope that we can work with \nSenator DeMint, the Senate Finance Committee, and any other interested \nSenators to make appropriate changes to this amendment during \nconference, if not sooner, so that the language is clear and the \noutcome increases transparency and accountability.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the DeMint \namendment as amended by the Durbin amendment.\n  Last week, I voted to table the original DeMint amendment because it \nwould have stricken earmark reform language in the Reid-McConnell \nbipartisan substitute and replaced it with provisions which contain, \namong other things, a definition of earmarked tax benefits which is \nweaker than the Reid-McConnell language.\n  The DeMint amendment would have defined a tax benefit as an earmark \nonly if it benefits 10 or fewer beneficiaries. This would have left \nopen a loophole for earmarks which were aimed at benefiting very small \ngroups of people, even as few as 11. It would have been relatively easy \nto circumvent the DeMint language and the intent of the tax earmark \nlanguage in the bill.\n  The Durbin second-degree amendment which has been adopted removes the \nlimitation of ``10 or fewer beneficiaries'' from the DeMint amendment \nand defines a ``limited tax benefit'' as ``any revenue provision that \nprovides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to a \nparticular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries''. This is \nstronger language--a limited group can be far more than 10.\n  The Durbin second-degree amendment also requires that the earmark \ndisclosure information be placed on the internet in searchable format \nfor at least 48 hours before consideration of the bills containing \nearmarks. The DeMint amendment did not previously have a similar \nprovision.\n  In summary, the Durbin language has improved this amendment which \nwill now increase the transparency of earmarks contained in conference \nreport language, as well as include disclosure of tax provisions that \nbenefit limited groups of beneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This Web site is to \nbe accessible to the public at no cost and contains information such as \nthe entity receiving the award, the amount, and the purpose.\n  Senate amendment No. 37, that has been offered by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Thune, builds upon the Federal Funding \nAccountability and Transparency Act by requiring entities that receive \nFederal funding to publicly disclose those funds, disclose that \nentity's political advocacy, and the amount spent on its political \nadvocacy. Under this amendment, political advocacy includes influencing \nlegislation, involvement in political campaigns, litigation with the \nFederal Government, and supporting other entities that engage in these \ntypes of political advocacy. In his remarks upon offering Senate \namendment No. 37, the Senator from South Dakota stated that his \namendment will shed further light on organizations that receive Federal \nfunding that are at the same time also involved in advocacy on Federal \nissues. I could not agree more that the transparency required in this \namendment is necessary and that this is something the American people \nwould like to see happen.\n  For the past two Congresses, I have been the chairman of the U.S. \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee. In that role, I \ndesignated grants management at the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, as one of the priority oversight areas of the committee. I began \nthis oversight by conducting a committee hearing where representatives \nfrom the EPA, EPA inspector general, the Government Accountability \nOffice, and a private organization called Taxpayers for Common Sense \ntestified to severe deficiencies in grants management at EPA for at \nleast the past 10 years and regardless of Presidential administration. \nIn fact, the EPA inspector general's testimony at that hearing focused \non a nonprofit Federal grant recipient that had received close to $5 \nmillion over 5 years in violation of the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The \nEPA has had a particularly bad habit of awarding large grants to \nspecial interest and partisan groups and, in many cases, with little \noversight. However, this is a problem that can plague all Federal \nagencies and departments.\n  Since the beginning of this oversight, EPA has taken a number of \npositive steps, and I would like to focus on one of those positive \ndevelopments. I suggested in May 2004 that to increase transparency in \ngrant awards, the EPA should develop a publicly accessible, no-cost Web \nsite with information on EPA's grants and recipients. I suggested this \nWeb site cover future grant recipients as well as grants awarded over \nthe past 10 years. I also provided some examples of useful information \nto include on the Web site such as the grant recipient's name, agency \ngrant number, Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number, the type \nof recipient--governmental entity, nonprofit, eductional institution, \nforeign recipient, etc.--the grant project location, beginning and \nending project dates of grants, the amount of the grant, the total cost \nof the project or cumulative amount of grants for the particular \nproject, the grant description or purpose, the grant's expected \noutcome, the approving office or program within the agency, and the \nagency project officer and awarding officers' contact information.\n\n  Since that time, EPA has created this new Web site with the most \npublicly available information ever provided on EPA grants and \nrecipients. The EPA's grant awards database may be easily found on the \nEPA's Web site and has been available since 2004.\n  I believe that placing this information on the World Wide Web for \nanyone to access has greatly increased the transparency of the grants \nprocess within the EPA and has required EPA to be more accountable for \nthe types of grants, recipients, and oversight of the grants awarded. \nLikewise, I believe that placing information on the World Wide Web \nconcerning the political, lobbying, and litigation activity of regular \nrecipients of Federal funds provides needed transparency that I believe \nthe American people may be surprised to see and may provide a tool for \nappropriate Federal agencies to use to ensure that Federal dollars are \nnot being misused for political purposes.\n  In many cases, when the Federal Government awards a grant to a \nprivate organization, it is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization. The \nInternal Revenue Service has classified these organizations as section \n501(c)(3) charitable organizations after that section of the Internal \nRevenue Code. However, I have delivered remarks concerning the \npolitical activities of recipients of Federal funds or their closely \naffiliated organizations. Some of these 501(c)(3) organizations that \nregularly receive Federal funds are often closely affiliated with \ncorresponding section 501(c)(4) and 527 organizations and political \naction committees all highly involved in lobbying and political \nactivities every year and in each election cycle. Although this article \nis dated, one of the best articles that describes this tangled web of \npolitical financing and advocacy was a Washington Post article from \nSeptember 27, 2004, which I\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\nwill request to have printed in its entirety at the conclusion of my \nremarks. This article contains a quote from a former Federal Election \nCommission official stating:\n\n       In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, evidence \n     is mounting that money is slithering through on other routes \n     as organizations maintain various accounts, tripping over \n     each other, shifting money between 501(c)(3)'s, (c)(4)'s, and \n     527's. . . . It's big money, and the pendulum has swung too \n     far in their direction.\n\n  While I understand that Senate amendment No. 37 does not reach into \nthis tangled web of political and lobbying financing to separate \nFederal funding from private dollars, this amendment does make publicly \navailable on a single Web site information on recipients of Federal \nawards and a description of the political and lobbying activities in \nwhich those organizations have been involved. This kind of disclosure \nhas begun the process of applying transparency and reform to grants \nmanagement at the EPA and I believe will also direct needed public \nattention on the political and lobbying activities of organizations \nthat regularly receive taxpayer funding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 27, 2004]\n\n  New Routes for Money To Sway Voters--501c Groups Escape Disclosure \n                                 Rules\n\n              (By Thomas B. Edsall and James V. Grimaldi)\n\n       In recent months, ads mocking Democratic presidential \n     nominee John F. Kerry have been surfacing in battleground \n     states and on national cable channels, paid for by a group \n     called Citizens United.\n       In one television commercial playing off the MasterCard \n     ``Priceless'' ads, the announcer describes Kerry's $75 \n     haircuts, $250 designer shirts and $30 million worth of \n     summer and winter homes. As a picture of Kerry and Sen. \n     Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) appears on screen, the announcer \n     concludes: ``Another rich, liberal elitist from Massachusetts \n     who claims he's a man of the people. Priceless.''\n       The spot, more hard-edged than the ads run by the official \n     Bush-Cheney '04 campaign, is in the same provocative vein as \n     the controversial Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads that have \n     dominated much of the campaign since late August. There is \n     one major difference, however: The Swift Boat group must \n     disclose who is paying for its ads; Citizens United does not \n     have to tell anybody where it got its money or how it is \n     spent.\n       Neither does Project Vote, a group run by former Ohio \n     Democratic Party chairman David J. Leland that hopes to \n     register 1.15 million new voters in black, Hispanic and poor \n     white communities. Nor do two major voter registration and \n     turnout projects called ``I Vote Values'' and ``The Battle \n     for Marriage,'' backed by some of the largest organizations \n     on the religious right that are coordinating a drive to \n     register millions of evangelical Christians.\n       Unlike the campaigns of President Bush and Kerry, the two \n     major parties, political action committees and the Swift Boat \n     Veterans--one of the ``527'' advocacy groups that have become \n     part of the 2004 campaign lexicon--Citizens United and \n     Project Vote operate under the radar of regulation and public \n     disclosure in what campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado of \n     the Brookings Institution and Colby College described as ``a \n     real black hole.''\n       Known as 501c groups, for a statute in the tax code, these \n     tax-exempt advocacy and charitable organizations are conduits \n     for a steady stream of secretive cash flowing into the \n     election, in many respects unaffected by the McCain-Feingold \n     legislation enacted in 2002. Unlike other political groups, \n     501c organizations are not governed by the Federal Election \n     Commission but by the Internal Revenue Service, which in a \n     complex set of regulations delineates a range of allowable \n     activities that are subject to minimal disclosure long after \n     Election Day.\n       A 501c (3) group can register voters, and donations to it \n     are tax deductible, but it is prohibited from engaging in \n     partisan or electioneering work. A 501c (4), (5) or (6) group \n     can be involved in elections, but the cost of doing so must \n     be less than one-half the group's total budget. Public \n     Citizen, in a report last week titled ``The New Stealth \n     PACs,'' contended that many of the politically active 501c \n     (4) groups regularly spend more than half their budgets on \n     political activities in violation of IRS rules.\n       IRS rules also stipulate that electioneering by 501c (4), \n     (5) and (6) groups cannot be ``express advocacy''--that is, \n     telling people to vote for or against specific candidates. \n     But such groups can run ads that address public issues such \n     as immigration or taxes and that refer to the stands of \n     candidates in ways that help or hurt them.\n       In the 2004 campaign, these legal distinctions have \n     translated into two specific roles for these groups. One is \n     to mobilize voters for Election Day. The other is to \n     articulate criticism and orchestrate attacks that \n     candidates and their parties may not want to launch \n     themselves. That is the role assumed by Citizens United, \n     whose president, David N. Bossie, is no stranger to \n     hardball conservative politics.\n       Asked whether he would provide the names of his donors, \n     Bossie said, ``No, we follow the rules that are in place for \n     501c groups.''\n       The rapid emergence of 501c and 527 groups in this election \n     cycle is a direct consequence of the changes in political \n     spending brought about by McCain-Feingold. The groups have \n     essentially emerged to do what the law prevents parties from \n     doing: They raise and spend unlimited contributions of ``soft \n     money'' from corporations, unions and wealthy donors to \n     influence federal elections.\n       Kent Cooper, who has watched the intricate ways money gets \n     into the political system, first as chief of public records \n     at the FEC and now as co-founder of PoliticalMoneyLine, said \n     there is a growing need for more stringent regulation of 501c \n     groups.\n       In the wake of the ban on party-raised soft money, Cooper \n     said, evidence is mounting that money ``is slithering through \n     on other routes,'' as organizations ``maintain various \n     accounts, tripping over each other, shifting money between \n     501c (3)s, c (4)s and 527s. . . . It's big money, and the \n     pendulum has swung too far in their direction.''\n       Until 2000, neither 527s nor 501c organizations were \n     required to list donors or account for expenditures. Sen. \n     John McCain (R-Ariz.), angered at smears aimed at his \n     presidential campaign by a 527 group, succeeded that year in \n     passing legislation requiring the IRS to report the spending \n     activities of 527s throughout the election cycle. That left \n     the 501c organizations as the only groups with virtually no \n     disclosure requirements.\n       To arrive at a total expenditure figure for 501c groups is \n     impossible, given their nondisclosure requirements. But, \n     based on interviews and an examination of available records, \n     it seems likely their total spending will be from $70 million \n     to $100 million this election cycle, with expenditures by \n     pro-Republican and pro-Democratic groups roughly equal.\n       There are huge unknowns, however. For example, the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform, a 501c (6) \n     business organization, has an annual budget of more than $40 \n     million. The National Rifle Association, a 501c (4), has a \n     budget of more than $200 million, which the group's chief \n     executive, Wayne LaPierre Jr., can tap to increase voter \n     turnout among not only its 4 million members but also the 14 \n     percent of the electorate that has a ``very favorable'' view \n     of the NRA.\n       Equally difficult to track is the burst of money going to \n     the network of hundreds of generally liberal and pro-\n     Democratic turnout operations, including Project Vote, the \n     NAACP Voter Education Fund and USAction, none of which \n     discloses its contributors.\n       Some board members, consultants, lawyers and staff members \n     of many of these nonpartisan 501c organizations are, in fact, \n     active partisans, separately working for campaigns, political \n     parties and groups.\n       Perhaps no one better illustrates the host of interlocking \n     roles than Carl Pope, one of the most influential operatives \n     on the Democratic side in the 2004 election. As executive \n     director of the Sierra Club, a major 501c (4) environmental \n     lobby, Pope also controls the Sierra Club Voter Education \n     Fund, a 527. The Voter Education Fund 527 has raised $3.4 \n     million this election cycle, with $2.4 million of that amount \n     coming from the Sierra Club. A third group, the Sierra Club \n     PAC, has since 1980 given $3.9 million to Democratic \n     candidates and $173,602 to GOP candidates.\n       These activities just touch the surface of Pope's political \n     involvement. In 2002-03, Pope helped found two major 527 \n     groups: America Votes, which has raised $1.9 million to \n     coordinate the election activities of 32 liberal groups, and \n     America Coming Together (ACT), which has a goal of raising \n     more than $100 million to mobilize voters to cast ballots \n     against Bush. Finally, Pope is treasurer of a new 501c (3) \n     foundation, America's Families United, which reportedly has \n     $15 million to distribute to voter mobilization groups.\n       ``I am in this as deeply as I am,'' Pope said, ``because I \n     think this country is in real peril.''\n       Although the McCain-Feingold law was generally a boon for \n     501c groups, one provision has tightened restrictions on the \n     way they spend their money. The law's ban on the use of \n     corporate and union funds to finance issue ads in the final \n     60 days before the general election has prompted such \n     conservative groups as Americans for Job Security and the 60 \n     Plus Association to move away from radio and television \n     advertising and toward voter mobilization and non-broadcast \n     advocacy, primarily through direct mail, newspaper ads and \n     the Internet.\n       Although corporate-backed tax-exempt groups are struggling \n     to comply with McCain-Feingold, liberal, pro-Democratic \n     charitable and tax-exempt organizations are concentrating \n     much of their time, money and effort on voter registration \n     and turnout. These activities do not fall under the 60-day \n     broadcasting ban and can be structured as nonpartisan work \n     eligible for tax-deductible support.\n       For many groups doing voter mobilization, it is crucial to \n     have a 501c (3) group to tap into what has become a \n     multimillion-dollar commitment by a host of liberal \n     foundations and wealthy individuals to increase turnout among \n     minorities and poor people.\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\n       Among the foundations investing substantially in voter \n     registration and turnout programs likely to benefit Democrats \n     are the Proteus Fund, which, in addition to direct grants, \n     set up the Voter Engagement Donor Network in 2003 as an \n     information service to 130 other foundations and individual \n     donors; the Pew Charitable Trusts; and America's Families \n     United, which was created in 2003 to channel about $15 \n     million to voter registration and turnout groups. Most of \n     these foundations voluntarily identify the groups to which \n     they make grants on their Web sites.\n       One of the best-funded organizations is Project Vote, a \n     501c (3) group that has an $18 million fundraising goal and \n     had raised, as of early September, $13.2 million in tax-\n     deductible contributions. Similar work in registering and \n     turning out urban voters, especially minorities, is being \n     conducted by USAction Education Fund, the 501c (3) arm of \n     USAction. Board members for America's Families United include \n     not only Pope, but also Dennis Rivera, president of New York \n     Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union and a \n     major figure in Democratic politics, and William Lynch Jr., \n     who served as board secretary until he recently became deputy \n     manager of the Kerry campaign.\n       The close connection between partisan activists and 501c \n     groups is equally clear among conservative groups. Benjamin \n     L. Ginsberg has been a lawyer for the Bush campaign, the \n     Republican National Committee, Progress for America and the \n     Swift Boat Veterans (both 527s) and Americans for Job \n     Security, a 501c (4). Ginsberg was forced to resign as chief \n     outside counsel to the Bush campaign during a controversy \n     over his simultaneous involvement with the Swift Boat group. \n     But he is one of the few activists whose involvement in \n     multiple groups has come under scrutiny.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

LYONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is fortuitous for the Presiding Officer \nto be presiding because I know of his background, and I am speaking \ntoday of a man who just passed away in Illinois who is a great friend \nof mine. His name is Tom Lyons, a former State senator and chairman of \nthe Democratic Party of Cook County. If you have ever attended an Irish \nwake--and I bet you have--there is a passionate combination of sadness \nand celebration.\n  In Chicago, such a wake is being held for a good and courageous man.\n  Thomas G. Lyons died last Friday at the age of 75 after a months-long \nstruggle against serious illness.\n  Mr. Lyons served for the last 17 years as chairman of the Cook County \nDemocratic Party. That was only one small chapter in an otherwise long, \ninteresting and amazing life story.\n  As a young man, he served as an Army Ranger and a Chicago police \nofficer.\n  In 1957, he earned a law degree and spent the next several years \nworking first in the Cook County assessor's office, and then in the \nIllinois Attorneys General office.\n  In 1964, a time of great change, Tom Lyons was elected to represent \nnorthwest Chicago in the Illinois General Assembly.\n  The following year, he was tapped to serve in the leadership of a \nState commission studying the need for a new Illinois State \nconstitution. He later served as vice president of the convention that \ndrafted Illinois's current State constitution.\n  The preamble to that document lays out a series of high and noble \naims of government. It reads, and I quote:\n\n       We, the people of the state of Illinois--grateful to \n     Almighty God for the civil, political and religious liberty \n     which He has permitted us to enjoy and seeking his blessings \n     upon our endeavors--in order to provide for the health, \n     safety and welfare of the people; maintain a representative \n     and orderly government; eliminate poverty and inequality; \n     assure legal, social and economic justice; provide \n     opportunity for the fullest development of the individual; \n     insure domestic tranquility; provide for the common defense; \n     and secure the blessings of freedom and liberty for ourselves \n     and our posterity--do ordain and establish this constitution \n     for the state of Illinois.\n\n  Those same high and noble goals--``to provide for the health, safety \nand welfare of the people; . . . eliminate poverty and inequality; . . \n. assure legal, social and economic justice; . . . and secure the \nblessings of freedom and liberty for ourselves and our posterity''--\nwere the standards to which Tom Lyons held himself in his public \nservice.\n  A story in Sunday's Chicago Sun Times last Sunday says a lot about \nthe kind of man he was.\n  In the 1950s, Tom Lyons was a young soldier on his way to Fort \nBenning, GA. It was his first trip to the South.\n  As he walked through a bus station, he was shocked to see one \nrestroom for Whites and another for Blacks. His family said he decided \nto take a stand--and used the ``colored'' bathroom.\n  His son Frank said:\n\n       He got into it with the local law enforcement. But he \n     wanted to make a statement. It's who he was as a person.\n\n  His family and friends say it was that willingness to stand up for \neveryone--no matter their race, class or status--that best embodies Mr. \nLyons' legacy.\n  It was also that willingness to treat everyone equally, with dignity, \nwhich nearly cost Tom Lyons his political career four decades ago.\n  In 1963, the year before Tom Lyons was elected to the Illinois State \nSenate, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance banning \nrestrictive covenants and other discriminatory real estate practices \nthat were used to maintain racial segregation in Chicago. But the \nordinance was routinely ignored.\n  In January 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. moved to what he called \na ``slum apartment'' on the West Side of Chicago. That summer, he held \na series of ``open housing'' marches in all-White neighborhoods in the \ncity and suburbs. The demonstrations produced a furor and focused \nnational and international attention on the problem of housing \ndiscrimination, not just in Chicago, but in America.\n  By fall, the issue of housing discrimination became the most volatile \nissue of the campaign. It helped defeat one of the most courageous men \nwho ever served in this Senate, a man Dr. King called ``the greatest of \nall senators,'' my mentor, Paul Douglas.\n  Family and friends warned Tom Lyons that his support for a State fair \nhousing law that year could cost him his seat in the General Assembly. \nBut he voted for the bill anyway--and lost his re-election bid.\n  Having lost, he didn't give up. He won his seat back 4 years later.\n  Chicago politics is famously rough and tumble, but Tom Lyons was \nfamous for trying to calm tempers and soothe old wounds by gathering \npeople around the piano to sing great old songs and World War II \nballads. He loved politics, not because of what it could do for him but \nwhat it allowed him to do for others. That is why his wake this evening \nwill be filled with sadness and with celebration and why Tom Lyons will \nalso be missed in Chicago and throughout our State.\n  As a young attorney serving in the Illinois State Legislature as \nparliamentarian for 14 years, I came to know a lot of State senators. \nThere remain many fine men and women who serve in that body. I was \nlearning my earliest chapters of Illinois politics as I watched them in \naction.\n  I remember Tom Lyons, a good legislator, conscientious man, a man of \nprinciple, with a great sense of humor, who would put an arm around \nyour shoulder and say: Let's go have a beer and sing a song. He was \njust that kind of guy. His life was a good life, a life of public \nservice and a life of giving to many others. I was lucky to be one of \nhis friends and lucky to be one of the beneficiaries of his good will.\n  I ask the Members of the Senate to join me in extending our \ncondolences to Tom's wife Ruth; their sons, Thomas and Frank; their \ndaughters, Alexandra and Rachel; and Tom's eight grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S571-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S571-S572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERDICTION OF DRUG SUPPLY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I just returned from a trip to\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nHaiti and to the Bahamas. I met with the governments of each of those \nnations on a variety of topics, not the least of which was the \ninterdiction of the drugs. We increasingly see drugs coming out of \nColombia, going into Venezuela and being transported by air out of \nVenezuela--including from remote parts of southern Venezuela as well as \nnorthern Venezuela. They then fly to destinations where the cocaine is \ndropped and repackaged into smaller packages to be shipped, destined \nfor Europe and the United States.\n  The increase in the number of flights from 2003 to 2006 is \nincredible. A map showing lines that indicate the number of flights--\nthey are solid going from Venezuela to the Dominican Republic and to \nHaiti. The flights have increased enormously, while at the same time \nthe number of drugs transported by sea has diminished. Our Coast Guard \nis out there. I was with the Coast Guard. They have been fairly \nsuccessful in interdicting at sea. So as a result, the drug smugglers \nare using small airplanes flying from Venezuela to the island of \nHispaniola, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where they are sending \nthe drugs to be shipped on to additional destinations.\n  I spoke at length with President Preval, the President of Haiti, \nabout this problem. President Preval made reference to a 1998 agreement \nin which the Government of Haiti and the United States pledged to \ncooperate and, indeed, that cooperation has occurred. And it has \noccurred on those shipments coming by sea.\n  But the Government of the United States cannot interdict an airplane \nunless we shoot them down, and we are not going to do that. So when \nthese flights come into Haiti or the Dominican Republic they either \nland or drop their cargo of cocaine. That is where the local \ngovernment, the local authorities, have to be able and willing to make \nthe arrest. Of course this is difficult, in a country such as Haiti \nthat can hardly keep its head above water, as it is trying to with a \nnew government. I must say, that certainly has my support and I believe \nthat President Preval is doing a good job, and is making some progress.\n  In addition, I spoke at length with the Prime Minister and with the \ndirector general of the Haitian National Police. I am very impressed \nwith Director General Andresol. He is an impressive fellow. He has set \nout a plan to vet all 7,000 members of the Haitian National Police, and \nhe started the vetting process with the top person--himself. He has \nstarted the vetting of the police, and he is going to continue to try \nto get out the graft and corruption. If he is successful, then I \nbelieve you will see that the Haitian National Police have the ability \nto make the arrest when drugs are dropped or transshipped through \nHaiti. I hope the same thing is going to be done in the Dominican \nRepublic.\n  Now, in the midst of all this, further to the north, as you get into \nthe Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos, we have been enormously \nsuccessful since the late 1980s in the interdiction of the drugs. The \nDEA, working with other law enforcement agencies, working with the \nCoast Guard, working with the Defense Department, and working with the \ngovernments of the countries--and the one that I particularly \nconcentrated on this time after Haiti was the Bahamas--they have been \nvery successful. They have helicopters stationed in the area, the Coast \nGuard at Andros Island in the Bahamas. The Army stationed helicopters \nat Greater Exuma Island, next to the town of Georgetown in the middle \nof the Bahamas, and at the southern end of the Bahamas where a the \nCoast Guard has another station with helicopters.\n  Well, the Army, being strapped for helicopters, announced the plan \nthat it was going to remove the helicopters. So we went to work. Our \nAmbassador to the Bahamas, John Rood, brought it to my attention. \nSeveral other Members of Congress got involved, and as a result of this \nan interagency meeting occurred in which it was agreed that although \nthe Army would pull the helicopters out probably by this October, they \nwould still pay for the station for the next 5 years. And we worked it \nout to get new helicopters that would be transferred to DEA--the Drug \nEnforcement Administration. Therefore all of that area of the Bahamas \nin the middle, between Andros to the north and to the west, the island \nof Exuma in the middle, and further south the to the Coast Guard \nhelicopters--all of that area in the middle would not be blind.\n  On Sunday I went out there and flew with both the Army and the Coast \nGuard to see their operation and to be briefed on the details. I was \nbriefed on a live chase that occurred at the time, as well as visiting \nsome of our troops. And I will just tell you what patriotic Americans \nthese are. They are down there for 4 months without their families. \nThey had just gotten home after a year's deployment in Iraq. They are \ngoing to be able to go back home in another month and be at home for 2, \n3 months, and then they are going back to Iraq. This is the kind of \ndedication that we have in our Armed Forces.\n  Well, fortunately, it looks as if we are going to be able to retain \nnew helicopters for this operation so that we will not be blind. But it \nis going to mean the continued cooperation between the Government of \nthe Bahamas and the United States, building on a history of \nconsiderable cooperation. It also means that we need continued, \nincreased progress with President Preval of Haiti and President \nFernandez of the Dominican Republic.\n  Haiti has so many needs. Haiti has desperate needs in health care, \ndesperate needs in infrastructure, desperate needs in education. One \nlittle thing we did in a step in the right direction--and many Senators \nhere cosponsored the bill--I along with them--is called the HOPE \nlegislation. It will allow textiles from outside to be brought into \nHaiti, where then value is added by making them into garments. It is \nestimated that 30,000 jobs will be provided. That is out of hundreds of \nthousands of people who do not have jobs. But it is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I want to give credit to former Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, who was \nthe sponsor of a bill called HERO and also the sponsor of the \nlegislation that passed called HOPE. He has a heart for Haiti and has \nbeen there many times. So the fruits of his long labors and the fruits \nof the labors of others of us in this Chamber have finally come to \nfruition to give them another ray of hope.\n  I am impressed with President Preval. I do believe that he is honest \nand on the right course. I am also a realist and recognize that there \nis corruption all around him in his Government. That is one of the main \nchores that he has in rooting out corruption, so that he can get that \nGovernment on the right path, so that they can start restoring some of \nthe services to a people in desperate need. The Haitian people are \nremarkable. They are so ingenious and industrious and entrepreneurial, \nwith a positive, optimistic outlook. They have just been shackled under \nyears of exceptional poverty.\n  So, finally, the United States stepped forward with the HOPE \nlegislation. Finally, the United States is getting increased \ncooperation from the now Government of Haiti, and it is exceptionally \nimportant in the future that cooperation continues. It is so important \nnot only because of Haiti, but it is important because it is our \nchildren who are on the receiving end of all of the drugs coming out of \nSouth America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S572-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S572-S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, on Martin Luther King Day, we celebrated \na man and honored his legacy. It is an opportunity to recognize the \nmovement he inspired and carry it forward with renewed energy. I \nconsider his work and his words, striving to give them both new life.\n  ``The arc of the moral universe is long,'' King said, ``but it bends \ntowards justice.'' As a national community, we must never rest in the \npursuit of that justice. We must always demand that our community \nleaders and elected officials pursue their work with compassion and \nintegrity. This year, as we commemorate Dr. King's bold vision and \ngreat spirit, our Nation stands at a critical point along that arc.\n  The American people called for a new direction and a new tone in \nWashington, DC. They put the politics of polarization aside and asked \ntheir representatives in Washington to focus instead on the issues that \nmatter most. Too many hard-working Americans are struggling just to get \nby today. It is time to expand opportunity for all and ensure everyone \nhas a real shot at the American dream.\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n  The best guarantee of a good, secure job in today's increasingly \ncompetitive world is a quality education. But not everyone has that \nopportunity. I know what it is like to have a tough time affording \ncollege: With the help of Federal Pell grants, I was the first in my \nfamily to graduate from college. Today, a college education costs a \nsmall fortune, yet it is harder than ever to find help.\n  Since 2001, tuition has increased by over 30 percent at the average \n4-year public school. Over the same period, family incomes have \nincreased less than 6 percent. As the cost of college continues to rise \nand family incomes stagnate, more and more students are qualifying for \nPell grants and other Federal student aid programs. We can't let a \ncollege education become a privilege just for the wealthy. We must \nensure that families and students can afford college, regardless of \ntheir financial resources.\n  That is why in the Senate, I am fighting to increase the maximum Pell \ngrant to $5,100--an amount that actually keeps pace with costs. That is \nalso why, on the first day of the 110th session of Congress earlier \nthis month, I introduced legislation to permanently increase the amount \nthat families can save annually for college and take as a tax \ndeduction.\n  On the same day, in that same spirit, I introduced other legislation \nto encourage employees to set aside money for their education costs and \nto encourage employers to provide matching funds through lifelong \nlearning accounts. It is about investing in a more competitive America, \na growing economy, and our common future. We are creating a better \nworld for our businesses, our State, and most importantly our workers.\n  The policies we choose to support reflect our priorities as a nation. \nWhen the middle-class gets squeezed from every side, it may be easiest \nto relent, accept the status quo, or give in to frustration. But we \nhave a responsibility to fight back and to fight for something better. \nThat is what Martin Luther King may have called infinite hope. We can \nhonor King by coming together and making that promise a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S573-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CRAIG C.

Mello of \nthe University of Massachusetts Medical School for his revolutionary \ndiscovery of the gene-silencing process called RNA interference.\n  RNAi, as it is called, is a fundamental mechanism for controlling the \nflow of genetic information. Dr. Mello's discovery is universally \nconsidered to be one of the most significant biomedical discoveries of \nthe past decade, and it has opened up extraordinary opportunities for \nthe development of new therapies for cancer, heart disease, illnesses, \nand many other conditions.\n  Dr. Mello is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the \nBlais University Chair in Molecular Medicine at UMass Medical School. \nHis research and its international recognition by the Nobel Committee \nhave brought great honor and pride to our city, Commonwealth, and \nNation.\n  Dr. Mello received his B.S. from Brown University in 1982 and his \nPh.D. from Harvard University in 1990. He served as a postdoctoral \nfellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA, \nand joined the faculty of UMass in 1994.\n  I join Dr. Mello's many friends and colleagues in congratulating him \nfor his landmark discovery, and I wish him well in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S573-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM K. PHILLIPS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize William K. \nPhillips, the longtime Director for the Small Business Administration's \nNew Hampshire district office. Since 1981, Bill has led the agency \nthrough economic booms and slumps while demonstrating a sharp \ncommitment to the business community in this state. On March 2 of this \nyear, Bill will be retiring. His leadership will be missed, and I want \nto offer him my deepest thanks for not only the advice he has given me \nthroughout the years but for everything he has done to make this State \na better place to live.\n  Because of his unique professional resume, there are few people in \nthe region who better understand the critical role small businesses \nplay in a healthy economy and who know what entrepreneurs need to \nexpand and thrive. Bill founded Benchmark Industries, a leader in \nresistance welding technology. He worked as senior vice-president of \nthe Bank of New Hampshire, was the president of the former Londonderry \nBank and Trust, and served on the board of directors of First NH Banks, \nwhich is now Citizens Bank of New Hampshire.\n  For the past two and half decades, Bill has been directing the SBA's \noperations in New Hampshire. It was in this role he made his name as a \nchampion for small businesses. His dedication was most obvious during \nthe banking and real estate crisis our State experienced during the \nearly 1990s. Fortunately, Bill and his team at the SBA were here to \nmeet this difficult challenge. Using their expertise and resources, the \nNew Hampshire SBA under Bill Phillips relieved much of the anxiety \nbusiness and homeowners were feeling and helped the State recover. New \nHampshire today is a great place to work and start a company, and Bill \ncan certainly feel proud of his role in strengthening our state's \nexcellent reputation.\n  The definition of a vibrant economy goes beyond just a bunch of \nnumbers and figures on a graph. What it really means is that people are \nworking, improving the communities in which they live, building wealth, \nproviding a better quality of life for their families and, in some \ncases, realizing life long dreams. Bill has been successful because he \nknows this and has always remembered that people, not statistics, are \nwhat matter. His experience and insights have served him well in the \nposition of district director but, more importantly, they have \nbenefitted New Hampshire. There are many businesses here, both small \nand large, which can be described as success stories because Bill took \nan interest in their future. Thank you, Bill. You have earned a long \nand healthy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S573-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S573-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S573-5", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 287.

A resolution adopted by the Aurora Township Board of \n     Trustees approving the election canvass results from a recent \n     referendum; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n       POM-7. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to \n     increasing funding to dredge Michigan's deep-draft Great \n     Lakes ports and waterways; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 288\n\n       Whereas, Michigan is home to 40 deep-draft commercial ports \n     on the Great Lakes, more than the other seven Great Lakes \n     states combined; and\n       Whereas, in a typical year, these ports will handle in \n     excess of 90 million tons of cargo, representing more than 50 \n     percent of all the cargo moving on the Lakes, and the \n     equivalent of 10 tons for each Michigan resident. The ports \n     of Calcite, Cedarville, Drummond Island, Port Inland, and \n     Presque Isle typically ship nearly 70 percent of the \n     limestone moving on the Great Lakes. The ports of Marquette \n     and Escanaba account for more than 20 percent of the Lakes' \n     iron ore trade. The ports of Alpena and Charlevoix are the \n     primary source of cement carried on the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, this waterborne commerce generates tens of \n     thousands of family-sustaining jobs in Michigan and supports \n     the state economy. For example, Michigan's steel and \n     construction industries depend on Great Lakes shipping to \n     deliver efficiently millions of tons of raw materials they \n     need each year; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Department of Transportation is promoting \n     Short Sea Shipping--commercial waterborne transportation \n     along the inland and coastal waterways--as a means of easing \n     congestion on the nation's crowded highways and railbeds; and\n       Whereas, compared to other transportation modes, waterborne \n     commerce provides environmental benefits, including fuel \n     savings and fewer emissions. In addition, the efficiencies of \n     waterborne commerce enable Michigan utilities to use cleaner-\n     burning low-sulfur coal loaded in Wisconsin and shipped on \n     the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Michigan's deep-draft Great Lakes ports and \n     waterways are long overdue for needed dredging to deepen \n     them. For example, while currently under way, it had been 23 \n     years since the Saginaw River turning basin was last dredged; \n     and\n       Whereas, Michigan's economy is not reaping the full \n     benefits of Great Lakes shipping due to the lack of necessary \n     dredging. Ships cannot carry full loads and offer customers \n     the best freight rates. The largest vessels delivering low-\n     sulfur coal to Michigan are leaving behind as much as 4,500 \n     tons each trip. Shortfalls in deliveries of iron ore, \n     limestone, cement, and other cargos hamper Michigan \n     employers' ability to compete; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' budget for \n     dredging Great Lakes ports and waterways has been inadequate \n     for decades. This is true even though cargo is assessed a \n     federal tax to fund dredging and the Harbor Maintenance Trust \n     Fund has a surplus of nearly $2 billion; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to increase federal funding for dredging \n     Michigan's Great Lakes deep-draft ports and waterways, using \n     surplus monies from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That we urge Congress to direct the U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers to clear the backlog of dredging projects \n     at Michigan's ports and waterways and to then maintain those \n     harbors and channels to project depth in the future; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-8. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to \n     federal funding for the barriers designed to protect the \n     Great Lakes from Asian carp; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 313\n\n       Whereas, Two species of Asian carp are on the verge of \n     invading the Great Lakes. Silver carp and bighead carp have \n     advanced up the Mississippi River since they escaped from \n     Arkansas fish farms in the early 1980s, and now have been \n     identified as close as 50 miles to Lake Michigan in the \n     Illinois River near Chicago; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp pose a significant risk to the ecology \n     and economy of the Great Lakes region. Asian carp can grow as \n     large as 100 pounds and are voracious feeders. They would \n     compete with native fish and could become a dominant species \n     in the Great Lakes, threatening the Great Lakes' $4 billion \n     commercial and recreational fishery. In addition, silver carp \n     can jump up to 10 feet out of the water when disturbed, \n     posing a risk to recreational boaters. In several states, \n     leaping carp have injured boaters; and\n       Whereas, Asian carp are the latest in a long line of exotic \n     species to threaten the Great Lakes. Past invasions of the \n     Great Lakes by exotic species like zebra and quagga mussels \n     and sea lampreys have severely affected the Great Lakes. It \n     is estimated that over $40 million per year is spent to \n     control these two exotic species. Scientists project that \n     Asian carp could have a similar impact on the Great Lakes; \n     and\n       Whereas, The United States Army Corps of Engineers operates \n     a temporary demonstration barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and \n     Ship Canal to prevent the movement of Asian carp into the \n     Great Lakes. In addition, the Army Corps and the state of \n     Illinois are constructing a permanent electrical barrier to \n     replace the temporary barrier; and\n       Whereas, Over $12 million has been spent to date on \n     construction and operation of the electrical barriers. To \n     help match federal funding, the state of Michigan has \n     contributed nearly $70,000 toward the completion of the \n     permanent electrical barrier; and\n       Whereas, Current funding is insufficient to complete \n     construction of the permanent barrier and only covers \n     operation of the temporary barrier through the first half of \n     fiscal year 2007. In addition, there is no funding to \n     renovate the temporary barrier as a permanent backup to the \n     new barrier; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to approve full \n     federal funding to complete construction and ensure permanent \n     operation and maintenance of both electrical barriers in the \n     Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to protect the Great Lakes \n     from Asian carp; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan Congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, December 12, 2006.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-9. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to refraining from taxing \n     rebuilding grants from the state's Road Home program; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana taxpayers have spent countless hours \n     coping with paperwork and bureaucracy that has inconvenienced \n     them since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated southern \n     Louisiana last year; and\n       Whereas, the grants themselves are not taxable, but the \n     Internal Revenue Service says grant recipients who claimed a \n     storm-related casualty loss would have to consider all or \n     part of the grant as income; and\n       Whereas, the average Road Home grant is sixty-five thousand \n     dollars; therefore, some recipients would find themselves \n     bumped up to higher tax brackets and would likely have a \n     higher federal income tax liability; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Department of Revenue has determined \n     that grants would not constitute income for state purposes: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress and the Internal \n     Revenue Service to take such actions as are necessary to \n     refrain from taxing rebuilding grants from the state's Road \n     Home program; and be it further\n       Resolved that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America, to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, \n     and to each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n       POM-10. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to enacting legislation to amend the definition of \n     ``physician'' in the Medicaid Program to include podiatric \n     physicians; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 248\n\n       Whereas, The Medicare system has long recognized doctors of \n     podiatric medicine as physicians in federal law. However, the \n     provisions of Title XIX that establish the country's Medicaid \n     program do not include podiatric physicians in the definition \n     of ``physician''; and\n       Whereas, There is legislation pending in the Congress, H.R. \n     699 and S. 440, to require that podiatry services are covered \n     by Medicaid. Enactment of this measure would guarantee access \n     to quality foot and ankle care for Medicaid patients; and\n       Whereas, Podiatric physicians play an important role in the \n     recognition of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, as well \n     as recognition and treatment of peripheral neuropathy, a \n     frequent cause of diabetic foot wounds that can lead to \n     amputations if left untreated; and\n       Whereas, Under the current provisions, Medicaid patients \n     may be prevented from seeking care from a podiatric physician \n     because these services are not covered as ``physician \n     services.'' This policy puts many people at risk, especially \n     diabetic patients; and\n       Whereas, Quality foot care increases mobility, prevents \n     amputations, improves quality of life, and avoids numerous \n     unnecessary costs. Clearly, including podiatric services \n     under the Medicaid program is a prudent step to take; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to amend the definition of ``physician'' in the \n     Medicaid program to include podiatric physicians; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-11. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to enacting the Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit \n     Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 266\n\n       Whereas, hearing is clearly one of our most essential \n     senses. It is often taken for granted, unfortunately, until \n     the time one begins to experience hearing loss. At this point \n     it is too late to reverese the damage. Hearing aids are the \n     ready solution to the problems associated with hearing loss, \n     but the costs associated with good quality equipment is \n     expensive, is not always covered by one's insurance or \n     Medicaid, and is too often foregone for more immediate needs. \n     A federal tax credit would provide immediate and necessary \n     relief for tens of thousands; and\n       Whereas, indeed, it has been estimated that hearing aids \n     would help ninety-five percent of those suffering from \n     hearing loss. Only twenty-two percent of the population, \n     however, currently uses a hearing device, because the average \n     out-of-pocket costs associated with hearing aids is over \n     $2,800. Thousands upon thousands of individuals and family \n     members are impacted by these soaring costs. It is estimated \n     that close to 2 million people are affected by untreated \n     hearing loss; and\n       Whereas, in Michigan, legislation was enacted in 1978 to \n     exempt hearing aids from the state sales tax. This initiative \n     was a clear recognition of the importance of cost savings to \n     those in need of hearing aids. The Congress should follow \n     this stellar example and enact similar tax incentives in the \n     U.S. Tax Code; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we hereby \n     memoralize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Hearing Aid Assistance Tax Credit Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-12. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the adoption of the \n     Constitution Restoration Act of 2005; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 33\n\n       Whereas, on Monday, June 27, 2005, the United States \n     Supreme Court in two razor-thin majorities of 5-4 in Van \n     Orden v. Perry (Texas) and ACLU v. McCreary County \n     (Kentucky), concluded that it is consistent with the First \n     Amendment to display the Ten Commandments in an outdoor \n     public square in Texas, but not on the courthouse walls of \n     two counties in Kentucky; and\n       Whereas, American citizens are concerned that the court has \n     produced two opposite results involving the same Ten \n     Commandments, leading to the conclusion that, based on the \n     Kentucky decision, the Ten Commandments may be displayed in a \n     county courthouse provided it is not backed by a belief in \n     God; and\n       Whereas, Supreme Justice Scalia emphasized the importance \n     of the Ten Commandments when he stated in the Kentucky case, \n     ``The three most popular religions in the United States, \n     Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, which combined account for \n     97.7% of all believers, are monotheistic. All of them, \n     moreover, believe that the Ten Commandments were given by God \n     to Moses and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Chief Justice Rehnquist in the Texas case referred \n     to the duplicity of the United States Supreme Court in \n     telling local governments in America that they may not \n     display the Ten Commandments in public buildings in their \n     communities while at the same time allowing these same Ten \n     Commandments to be presented on these specific\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\n     places on the building housing the United States Supreme \n     Court stating, ``Since 1935, Moses has stood holding two \n     tablets that reveal portions of the Ten Commandments written \n     in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the south frieze. \n     Representations of the Ten Commandments adorn the metal \n     gates lining the north and south sides of the courtroom as \n     well as the doors leading into the courtroom. Moses also \n     sits on the exterior east facade of the building holding \n     the Ten Commandments tablets''; and\n       Whereas, a recent poll by the First Amendment Center \n     revealed that seventy percent of Americans would have no \n     objection to posting the Ten Commandments in government \n     buildings, and eighty-five percent would approve if the Ten \n     Commandments were included as one document among many \n     historical documents when displayed in public buildings; and\n       Whereas, the First Amendment of the United States \n     Constitution, which provides in part that ``Congress shall \n     make no law respecting an establishment of religion'', is a \n     specific and unequivocal instruction to only the United \n     States Congress, and the United States Constitution makes no \n     restriction on the ability of states to acknowledge God, the \n     Supreme Ruler of the Universe; and\n       Whereas, the United States District Court Southern District \n     of Indiana on November 30, 2005, entered a final judgment and \n     permanent injunction ordering the speaker of the Indiana \n     House of Representatives not to permit sectarian prayers as \n     part of the official proceedings of the House; and\n       Whereas, the federal judiciary has violated one of the most \n     sacred provisions of the United States Constitution providing \n     for three branches of government and the separation of powers \n     of those branches by overstepping its authority and dictating \n     the activities of the inner workings of the legislative \n     branch of government; and\n       Whereas, the federal judiciary has overstepped its \n     constitutional boundaries and ruled against the \n     acknowledgment of God as the sovereign source of law, \n     liberty, and government by local and state officers and other \n     state institutions, including state schools; and\n       Whereas, there is concern that recent decisions of the \n     court will be used by litigants in an effort to remove God \n     from the public square in America, including public buildings \n     and public parks; and\n       Whereas, there is concern that the federal judiciary will \n     continue to attempt to micromanage the internal workings of \n     the legislative as well as executive branches of government; \n     and\n       Whereas, there is pending before the 1st Session of the \n     109th Congress the Constitution Restoration Act of 2005, \n     which will limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts and \n     preserve the right to acknowledge God to the states and to \n     the people and resolve the issue of improper judicial \n     intervention in matters relating to the acknowledgment of \n     God: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to adopt S520 and HR 1070, \n     the Constitution Restoration Act of 2005 and, in doing so, \n     protecting the ability of the people of Louisiana to display \n     the Ten Commandments in public places, to express their faith \n     in public, to retain God in the Pledge of Allegiance, and to \n     retain ``In God We Trust'' as our national motto, and to use \n     Article III, Section 2.2 of the United States Constitution to \n     except these areas from the jurisdiction of the United States \n     Supreme Court; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the administrator of the General Services, \n     Washington, D.C., to the secretary of the United States \n     Senate and the clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana \n     delegation to the United States Congress and presiding \n     officer of each house of each state legislature in the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-13.

A bill to reauthorize Amtrak, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, together with my good friend--the new \nMinority Whip--Senator Trent Lott I rise to introduce S. 294, the \nPassenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007.\n  After several gloomy years, the future of America's passenger \nrailroad is bright. This legislation will provide the necessary \nresources to bring Amtrak up to speed as a real alternative to taking a \nplane or driving a car.\n  As we did in the past, we have joined forces to strengthen Amtrak and \nintercity passenger rail services for all Americans. But today, we \nintroduce an updated version of last Congress's Amtrak reauthorization \nand passenger rail expansion bill. S. 1516, the Passenger Rail \nInvestment and Improvement (PRIIA) Act of 2005.\n  I co-authored this legislation with Senator Lott, then Chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee's Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee, so that we could finally provide Amtrak with the funding \nand support it needs to thrive. The Commerce Committee favorably \nreported this bill, and Senator Lott and I added it to last Congress's \nBudget Reconciliation package, where it was adopted by an overwhelming \nvote of 93 to 6. Despite the bipartisan support, the House failed to \nact, so Amtrak was left without a necessary reauthorization.\n  Now, in the new Congress, I am the chair of the Commerce Committee's \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee. Working with \nSenator Lott, and our bipartisan group of cosponsors, we are going to \nget our Amtrak bill through the Senate. This time, I believe the House \nwill be ready, willing, and able to match our efforts, so that we can \nsend a bill to the President for his signature.\n  Every year, Amtrak is forced to fight for Federal funding--funding \nthat has been insufficient at best. But as air and highway congestion \ncontinue to worsen, and concerns over our dependence on foreign oil \nremain, we must expand the capacity and improve the quality of our \npassenger rail system.\n  One needs only to look to Europe and Asia to see the benefits that a \nmodern\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\npassenger rail system can bring to a nation. Germany, which invested \nnine billion dollars in its rail system 2003 alone, has a modern, high-\nspeed rail system that reduces pollution, eases congestion and improves \nmobility for all of its citizens. The benefits of their world class \nsystem are obvious to anyone who travels there. We need the same world \nclass system in our country.\n  The era of the free and easy interstate and quick, hassle-free \nflights has come and gone, and time for us to make real investments in \nour passenger rail system has come. If we do not invest in Amtrak now, \nI fear for our country's economy and quality of life over the coming \nyears. We simply cannot afford to rely solely on air travel or \nautomobiles if we are going to keep this country moving.\n  The terror and tragedy we experienced on 9/11 taught us that we \ncannot rely solely on our aviation system. Last fall, Hurricane Katrina \nhighlighted the role that passenger rail could play in evacuating \nresidents who do not own automobiles. Hurricane Rita demonstrated the \nlimits of our highway system, as evacuees' vehicles crawled to a stop \nin bumper-to-bumper traffic. Each one of these disasters reminded us \nthat our Nation needs Amtrak and better train service to provide \noptions for the traveling public--in good times and in bad.\n  The bill we introduce today is the most comprehensive reauthorization \nof Amtrak ever attempted by this body. We have worked with Amtrak, \nfreight railroads, the States and rail labor to draft strong and \ncomprehensive legislation.\n  Our bill authorizes nearly $12 billion in Federal support to expand \npartnerships for passenger rail with the States, improve the Northeast \nCorridor and provide real rail security for the Nation. Additionally, \nSenator Lott and I filed an amendment today to this bill which would \nadd $7.8 billion in bonding authority for States and Amtrak to develop \nrail infrastructure. This bonding authority would augment the \nappropriated funds authorized by this bill and provide Amtrak and the \nStates with a reliable, multi-year source of capital for major \nprojects. We look forward to working with the Finance Committee to \nconsider this proposal.\n  Our bill also requires significant reforms of Amtrak: The system's \nsupporters and detractors alike agree that it is time to reauthorize \nthe Corporation so that Amtrak has congressional guidance on how to \nproceed with important reform initiatives needed to improve service, \ngrow revenues, and cut costs.\n  People in New Jersey rely on Amtrak and want to be sure that the \nsystem will be there for them in the future. With this plan, it will.\n  Last year, 93 Senators voted for this plan. I ask that my colleagues, \nonce again, join Senator Lott and myself in supporting this important \nbill that will bring America's passenger rail system into the 21st \nCentury.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 294\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In making \n     its determination or carrying out such an investigation, the \n     Board shall obtain information from all parties involved and \n     identify reasonable measures and make recommendations to \n     improve the service, quality, and on-time performance of the \n     train.\n       ``(2) Problems caused by host rail carrier.--If the Board \n     determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum \n     standards investigated under paragraph (1) are attributable \n     to a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to Amtrak \n     over freight transportation as required under subsection (c), \n     the Board may award damages against the host rail carrier, \n     including prescribing such other relief to Amtrak as it \n     determines to be reasonable and appropriate pursuant to \n     paragraph (3) of this subsection.\n       ``(3) Damages and relief.--In awarding damages and \n     prescribing other relief under this subsection the Board \n     shall consider such factors as--\n       ``(A) the extent to which Amtrak suffers financial loss as \n     a result of host rail carrier delays or failure to achieve \n     minimum standards; and\n       ``(B) what reasonable measures would adequately deter \n     future actions which may reasonably be expected to be likely \n     to result in delays to Amtrak on the route involved.\n       ``(4) Use of damages.--The Board shall, as it deems \n     appropriate, remit the damages awarded under this subsection \n     to Amtrak or to an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity \n     passenger rail service. Such damages shall be used for \n     capital or operating expenditures on the routes over which \n     delays or failures to achieve minimum standards were the \n     result of a rail carrier's failure to provide preference to \n     Amtrak over freight transportation as determined in \n     accordance with paragraph (2).''.\n       (b) Change of Reference.--Section 24308 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Interstate Commerce Commission'' in \n     subsection (a)(2)(A) and inserting ``Surface Transportation \n     Board'';\n       (2) by striking ``Commission'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``Board'';\n       (3) by striking ``Secretary of Transportation'' in \n     subsection (c) and inserting ``Board''; and\n       (4) by striking ``Secretary'' the last 3 places it appears \n     in subsection (c) and each place it appears in subsections \n     (d) and (e) and inserting ``Board''.\n\n     SEC. 210.

Mr. President, I just want to take a few moments to talk \nabout Amtrak and inter-city passenger rail.\n  In the last Congress, I worked with Senators Stevens, Inouye, and \nLautenberg--and other members of the Commerce Committee--to develop S. \n1516, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act.\n  Last year during the Senate's consideration of the reconciliation \nbill I offered an amendment to add the text of S. 1516. The amendment \npassed by a vote of 93 to 6. So I know there is widespread support for \nthis legislation.\n  Today we are introducing the same bipartisan legislation in hopes of \ngaining the same level of support as we did in the last Congress.\n  The bill was developed with input from the Administration, the \nDepartment of Transportation's Inspector General, States, Amtrak Board \nmembers, and many others.\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\n  The bill makes a number of important reforms to Amtrak, and has three \nmajor themes: Amtrak Reform and Accountability; cost cutting; and, \ncreating funding options for States.\n  By increasing executive branch oversight over Amtrak, this bill \nensures that the taxpayers' money is used more effectively. Under its \npast President, David Gunn, Amtrak has made some improvements in its \nmanagement. However, much remains to be done. Amtrak must be run more \nlike a business. This bill requires Amtrak to develop better financial \nsystems and to evaluate its operations objectively. It forces Amtrak to \nimprove the efficiency of long distance train service. The bill reduces \nAmtrak's operating subsidy by 40 percent by 2011 by requiring Amtrak to \nuse its funding more effectively,\n  The bill promotes a greater role for the private sector by allowing \nprivate companies to bid on operating Amtrak routes.\n  The bill also creates a new rail capital grant program that States \ncan use to start new inter-city passenger rail service. This will be \nthe first time that States will have a Federal program they can use for \npassenger rail, putting intercity passenger rail on a similar footing \nto highways, transit, and airports, all of which have Federal \nassistance programs for infrastructure. States won't have to rely only \non Amtrak for intercity passenger rail service.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to get this bipartisan legislation signed into law this year\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 295. A bill to establish a servitude and emancipation archival \nresearch clearinghouse in the National Archives; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nServitude and Emancipation Archival Research Clearing House, SEARCH, \nAct of 2007, a bill that will establish a national database consisting \nof historic records of servitude and emancipation in the United States \nto assist African Americans in researching their genealogy. \nAdditionally, Congressman Elijah Cummings is reintroducing a companion \nto this bill on the House side because we both believe in its \nimportance.\n  It is a very human instinct for people to want to understand who they \nare from the lenses of who are their ancestors and where are they from. \nThis is the very reason I stand before you today to reintroduce this \npiece of very important legislation. Unfortunately, African Americans \nwho attempt to trace their genealogy encounter huge hurdles in \nreclaiming the usual documentary history that allows most Americans to \npiece together their heritage. W.E.B. Dubois once said that, ``There is \nin this world no such force as the force of a person determined to \nrise, for the human soul cannot be permanently chained.'' The Servitude \nand Emancipation Archival Research ClearingHouse, SEARCH, Act of 2007 \ngives African Americans the tools they need to rise above the unique \nchallenges and hardships they face in order to trace their genealogy. \nThe SEARCH Act establishes a national database within the National \nArchives and Records Administration, NARA, housing various documents \nthat would assist those in search of a history that, because of \nslavery, is almost impossible to find in the most ordinary registers \nand census records.\n  Traditionally, someone researching their genealogy would try looking \nup wills and land deeds; however, enslaved African Americans were \nprohibited from owning property. In fact, African Americans, must \nfrequently rely on the records of slave owners--most of which are in \nprivate hands--in hope that they had kept records containing birth and \ndeath information. Even if records do exist, many African Americans in \nthe past did not have formal last names, thus compounding the \ndifficulty of tracing their lives. The omission of surnames also \nprecludes use of the most popular and major source of genealogical \nresearch, the United States Census. Furthermore, letters, diaries, and \nother first-person records used by most genealogical researchers are \nscarcely available for slaves, owing to the fact that they could not \nlegally learn to read or write.\n  Even after the Emancipation Proclamation was given in 1865, we would \nthink that African Americans could begin using traditional genealogical \nrecords like voter registrations and school records. However, African \nAmericans did not immediately begin to participate in many of the \nprivileges of citizenship, including voting and attending school. \nDiscrimination meant that African Americans were barred from sitting on \njuries or owning businesses. Segregation meant segregated \nneighborhoods, schools, churches, clubs, and fraternal organizations, \nand thus segregated societies maintained segregated records. For \nexample, some telephone directories in South Carolina did not include \nAfrican Americans in the regular alphabetical listing, but rather at \nthe end of the book. An African American must maneuver these \ndistinctive nuances in order to conduct proper genealogical research. \nIn my own State of Louisiana, descendants of the 9th Cavalry Regiment \nand 25th Infantry Regiment, known as the Buffalo Soldiers, would have \nto know to look in the index of United States Colored Troops since \nthere is no mention of them in the index of State Military Regiments.\n  Abraham Lincoln said, ``a man who cares nothing about his past can \ncare little about his future.'' By providing $5 million for the \nNational Historical Publications and Records Commission to establish \nand maintain a national database, the SEARCH Act has the potential to \nsignificantly reduce the time and painstaking efforts of those African \nAmericans who truly care about their American past to contribute to the \nAmerican future. This bill also seeks to authorize $5 million for \nStates, colleges, and universities to preserve, catalogue, and index \nrecords locally.\n  In a democracy, records matter. The mission of NARA is to ensure that \nanyone can have access to the records that matter to them. The SEARCH \nAct of 2007 seeks to fulfill that mission by helping African Americans \nnavigate genealogical research sources and negotiate the unique \nchallenges that confront them in this process. No longer should any \nAmerican have to wait to learn information, which in itself can offer \nsuch freedom.\n  I don't believe there is a more appropriate time than now to pass \nthis piece of legislation, on the day before we honor the legacy of a \nman who spent his life as an advocate of freedom, Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Dr. King once said, ``Our lives begin to end the day we \nbecome silent about things that matter.'' Mr. President, this piece of \nlegislation does matter and I ask my colleagues to join me in passing \nthe SEARCH Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 298. A bill to provide incentives for renewable energy production, \nto increase fuel economy standards for automobiles, and to provide tax \nincentives for renewable energy production; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a significant \nbill to improve energy efficiency in this Nation and reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  The bill I am introducing will promote the development of additional \nforms of renewable energy and also pave the way for improved fuel \nconsumption by vehicles. I rise to introduce the Renewable Energy, Fuel \nReduction, and Economic Stabilization and Enhancement Act of 2007, or \nthe REFRESH Act, for short.\n  I consider this a balanced measure, a companion to a bill introduced \nrecently by Alaska's Senior Senator Ted Stevens who proposed to raise \nthe fuel efficiency of automobiles to 40 miles per gallon within a \ndecade, a bill I am proud to be a cosponsor of. This bill will promote \nalternative energy by providing grants and tax credits to promote \ndevelopment of geothermal power, all forms of ocean energy and small \nhydro electric development.\n  The bill also seeks to reduce American fossil fuel consumption by \nnearly 5 million barrels of oil a day by 2025 by not only supporting an \nincrease in the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency Standard, CAFE, for \nautomobiles, as\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nproposed by Senator Stevens, but by also requiring a study of whether \nto mandate that a CAFE standard to be imposed on commercial trucks. The \nbill also requires an improvement in the efficiency of replacement \ntires for all passenger cars, provides grants to States and local \ncommunities to encourage a reduction in traffic congestion by helping \nStates to set up telecommuting and flexible-work programs to keep \nmotorists off roadways during rush hours, and extends and removes a cap \non tax credits to encourage the purchase of hybrid and advanced fuel \nefficient lean-burn vehicles. The bill also authorizes $100 million in \nadditional research assistance for plug-in hybrid and battery storage \ntechnology development.\n  The bill also includes a truth in advertising provision requiring \nthat the CAFE standards for vehicles be based on the actual fuel \neconomy that the vehicles will achieve under real-world driving \nconditions, where acceleration, the use of air conditioning and stop \nand go driving is considered rather than on a three-decades old testing \nformula.\n  The bill will reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel usage \nby about 530 million metric tons in the United States by 2025--a 7 \npercent cut over what emissions otherwise are predicted to be that \nyear. Coming from Alaska where there is no question but that warming \ntemperatures have been in place in recent years, it only makes sense \nthat we take common sense steps now to improve fuel efficiency, to \npromote the development of a wider range of alternative energy \ntechnologies and to encourage Americans to buy more fuel efficient \nvehicles, as long as their ability to drive safe and affordable \nvehicles of their own choosing is protected.\n  This bill is a careful balance of steps we can take to reduce fuel \nusage and thus greenhouse gas emissions, but also of provisions that \nare economic for Americans to undertake, and will pay for themselves in \nreduced fuel costs, sometimes in very short order. It will be good \ninsurance for the environment, but also good for the pocketbooks of \nAmericans.\n  Americans understand that we are in a current warming trend. Just \nthis week, our government reported that 2006 was the warmest year \nworldwide in over a century. There are dozens of examples of the \neffects on the environment that the warming climate of the past three \ndecades has caused. While I believe the ultimate cause of the climate \nchange we are seeing is not yet certain, it is our responsibility to \ntake affordable steps now to reduce fuel consumption, increase the use \nof alternative, non-fossil-fuel technologies, and to reduce carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.\n  This bill, paired with previous legislation by my colleague Senator \nTed Stevens that specifically raises the CAFE standard by 2017, S. 183, \nwill require automobile makers, if it is technologically feasible, to \nimprove fuel efficiency. I am proud to be a supporter of that measure. \nThe two bills will have a host of policy and economic advantages. They \nwill make us less dependent on imported oil, improving our national \nsecurity and reducing the money we spend overseas to buy imported crude \noil. And they will produce more jobs in America through the development \nof new alternative-fuel industries.\n  The bill I introduce today, for example, will require all tire \nmanufacturers to make and sell only low, rolling, resistance tires for \nreplacement tire purposes within five years--the same tires found on \nnew cars today. The tires, while they will add on average $20 to the \ncost of a set of two replacement tires, will improve fuel efficiency by \n1.5 to 4.5 percent. Thus if the price of gasoline is only $2 a gallon, \ndrivers will save from $87 to $260 a year in fuel costs per year, the \nchange saving the typical driver money within the first year, according \nto estimates by the National Commission on Energy Policy that \nrecommended the change in a 2005 report.\n  The bill also will require the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (NHTSA) to study the savings that would result and the \ncosts of imposing a CAFE standard on commercial trucks, a key \nrequirement before Congress can actually impose such a standard. \nCommercial trucks consume between 1.5 and 2 million barrels of oil a \nday in fuel. According to estimates by the Department of Energy's 21st \nCentury Truck Program and by Argonne National Laboratory, fuel economy \nfor tractor-trailers should be able to improve by 30 to 60 percent by \n2015 through use of a CAFE standard. While such improvements might \nincrease the cost of a tractor-trailer by $7,000 at time of purchase, \nit would save some $11,000 in fuel costs over the life of the vehicle, \nachieving payback for the typical truck owner in less than three years. \nImposing such a CAFE on trucks was proposed by the Energy Security \nLeadership Council in a report just last month.\n  The $50 million in grants to reduce traffic congestion could pay for \nthemselves nearly immediately, since the National Commission on Energy \nPolicy estimated that American motorists consume between 65,000 and \n260,000 barrels of oil a day in wasted fuel because of urban traffic \ncongestion, costing the Nation up to $13 million a day at current fuel \nprices.\n  And the tax credit provisions, making all forms of ocean energy: \nwave, current, tidal and thermal, and small hydro electric power \nqualified to receive the Federal Production Tax Credit that currently \nreduces the cost of wind, solar and biomass energy by 1.9 cents per \nkilowatt hour generated, would help to increase renewable energy \nproduction nationwide. Geothermal energy is already covered by the PTC, \nas are wind, solar and biomass projects.\n  Congress two years ago in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which I \nhelped formulate, provided both grant and the tax assistance to \nencourage the development of wind, solar and biomass energy. But when \nyou consider that large portions of the country, including 70 percent \nof Alaska, may contain geothermal resources, that there are thousands \nof lakes and small rivers and creeks that can power small-scale hydro \nelectric development without requiring dams or affecting fisheries or \nthe environment in the least, and that thousands of miles of U.S. \ncoastlines and river systems can generate electricity from emerging \nocean energy systems, it only makes sense to expand the scope of \nFederal assistance to encourage wider development and use of these \nother renewable technologies.\n  The Electric Power Research Institute has estimated that wave energy \noff U.S. coasts alone could conservatively generate 252 million \nmegawatt hours of electricity, 6.5 percent of all energy now produced \nin America. Alaska has nearly 80 coastal and river communities that \ncould benefit greatly by development of ocean energy systems. To \nfacilitate ocean and geothermal development, the bill authorizes $100 \nmillion in Federal research and development grant assistance to both \ntypes of development.\n  This bill is not a cure all for all of our energy woes. I recently \nco-sponsored legislation by Senators Jim Bunning and Barack Obama that \nwill provide additional incentives to develop fuel from coal and that \nwill encourage the sequestration of carbon from coal processed in fuel-\nto-liquid plants. I will support additional assistance to promote wind, \nsolar and biomass alternative energy development. I have supported and \nwill continue to support development of the next generation of nuclear \npower that can produce energy without any greenhouse gas emissions. And \nI will continue to support research and development of biofuels, such \nas ethanol, especially celluosic ethanol, and of development of \nhydrogen-fueled vehicles and fuel distribution systems for the new \nfuels.\n  I also will support production of more domestic energy from \nconventional sources, whether it be more oil and natural gas from the \nground onshore and from under some of our seas offshore where it can be \ndone in an environmentally friendly way, or more novel forms of fossil \nfuels, be they from oil shales, oil sands, coal or from gas hydrate \ndeposits. In my view we need to do everything we can to find economic \nforms of the energy we will need during the remainder of the 21st \nCentury.\n  This bill only represents one piece of a balanced plan to improve \nthis Nation's energy outlook. But it is an important piece. This bill \nhas the ability to restore and refresh our environment\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\nby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It will encourage development of \nmore renewable energy. We can't afford not to find the funds to pay for \nits provisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 298\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Bureau of \nReclamation to carry out the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species \nConservation Program in the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senators \nEnsign, Feinstein and Reid to introduce the Lower Colorado River Multi-\nSpecies Conservation Program Act. This bipartisan legislation is \ndesigned to protect and maintain wildlife habitat on the lower Colorado \nRiver and to provide assurances to the affected water and power \nagencies of Arizona, California, and Nevada that their river operations \nmay continue upon compliance with the underlying program. This bill is \nnearly identical to legislation I introduced late last year with \nSenators Ensign, Feinstein, and Reid.\n  The Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program, \notherwise known as the MSCP, is a comprehensive, cooperative effort \namong 50 Federal and non-Federal entities in Arizona, California, and \nNevada whose purposes are to 1. protect the lower Colorado River \nenvironment while ensuring the certainty of existing river water and \npower operations; 2. protect threatened endangered wildlife under the \nEndangered Species Act; and 3. prevent the listing of additional \nspecies on the lower Colorado River.\n  To accomplish these goals, the MSCP will create more than 8,100 acres \nof riparian, marsh, and backwater habitat and implement additional \nmeasures to protect 26 endangered, threatened and sensitive species. \nThe program covers approximately 400 miles, including the full-pool \nelevations of Lake Mead to the United States-Mexico Southerly \nInternational Boundary.\n  The program costs will be spread over 50 years, and split 50-50 \nbetween the Federal Government and the non-Federal entities covered by \nMSCP. Arizona and Nevada will each bear 25 percent of the non-Federal \ncosts and California will bear 50 percent of the non-federal costs.\n  Although implementation of the program began in April 2005 under the \nU.S. Department of the Interior's existing authority, legislation is \nneeded to protect the substantial financial commitments that the non-\nFederal parties are making to species protection . To that end, the \nbill 1. expressly authorizes appropriations to cover the Federal share \nof the program costs; 2. directs the Secretary of the Interior to \nmanage and implement the MSCP in accordance with the underlying program \ndocuments; and 3. provides a waiver of sovereign immunity to allow the \nnon-Federal parties to enforce, if necessary, the underlying program \ndocuments. The waiver, however, does not allow an action to be brought \nagainst the United States for money damages.\n  Late in 2006, the House Committee on Resources, Subcommittee on Water \nand Power held a comprehensive field hearing in Arizona on the MSCP \nAct. The hearing highlighted the significance of the program to \nColorado River users in Arizona, California, and Nevada and \ndemonstrated the strong support for the legislation. Unfortunately, \nCongress adjourned before it could take action on the bill. We hope for \nits swift passage in the 110th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 301. A bill to provide higher education assistance for \nnontraditional students, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmeet the needs of non-traditional college students. If enacted, The \nNon-Traditional Student Success Act would expand services that promote \nretention and graduation for non-traditional students.\n  The number of non-traditional students has been increasing \ndramatically on college campuses all across America. These students \nface unique challenges to completing their degree that include \naffording their education, balancing work, school, and family \nresponsibilities, overcoming inadequate academic preparation, and \nnavigating the college environment. Unfortunately, many of our current \nhigher education policies make it harder, not easier for these students \nto complete their degree.\n  In fact, among students seeking a bachelor's degree, nearly half of \nnon-traditional students leave college within the first 3 years before \ncompleting their studies, compared with 12 percent of traditional \nstudents. Similarly, among those seeking an associate's degree, 62 \npercent of non-traditional students left without any degree, compared \nwith 19 percent of traditional students. This trend has a \ndisproportionate impact on minority communities especially when \nconsidering over 80 percent of both black and Hispanic undergraduate \nstudents are non-traditional in some way. This trend must end if we are \nto ensure that all students are awarded an equal opportunity to compete \nfor jobs in today's marketplace.\n  We must take a step forward with a positive agenda in the 110th \nCongress to ensure that all students are able to successfully acquire a \ncollege education as doing so is essential to our economic prosperity. \nThat is why I have introduced the Non-Traditional Student Success Act.\n  The Non-Traditional Student Success Act will tear down the financial \nbarriers many non-traditional students face when financing their \ncollege education. By allowing students access to their Federal Pell \ngrants year-round while increasing the maximum Pell grant award to \n$12,600 over the next 5 years, this bill will not only help students \npay for college but also allow them the opportunity to complete \nprograms more quickly. This legislation also creates a pilot program to \nprovide more financial aid--grants and loans--to students enrolled in a \ndegree program less than half-time.\n  This legislation will also expand services that promote retention and \ngraduation for non-traditional students. The Non-Traditional Student \nSuccess Act will increase funding for Student Support Service programs, \nGEAR-UP, mentoring, tutoring and other services to help non-traditional \nstudents succeed. While spending for remediation among U.S. colleges \nand universities approaches the $1 billion mark, this bill create \nincentives for institutions to customize their courses to help students \nmore successfully complete remedial work and graduate into academic \nprograms.\n  I am happy to report that two of the provisions from the previously \nintroduced Nontraditional Student Success Act were enacted into law \nthrough the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. These provisions, expanding \nthe use of Pell grants for less than half-time students and a provision \nto reduce the work penalty for independent students, will provide more \noptions to non-traditional students in financing their college \neducation.\n  The fact is, three out of four undergraduate students--75 percent--\nare non-traditional in some way. My bill will increase access to a \nhigher education and improve the graduate rates for the millions of \nnon-traditional students.\n  The start of a new Congress brings an opportunity to provide critical \nchanges in higher education and offer assistance to non-traditional \nstudents. This proposal is endorsed by the Commission on Independent \nColleges and Universities, The Center for Law and Social Policy, Career \nColleges Association, and the American Association of Community \nColleges.\n  I am hopeful that my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nwill join in support of this bill and move this legislation to the \nfloor without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 304. A bill to establish a commission to develop legislation \ndesigned to reform tax policy and entitlement benefit programs and to \nensure a sound fiscal future for the United States, and\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, a fiscal crisis looms on the horizon. \nAs the Nation's demographic tide begins to shift, a fiscal tidal wave \nthreatens to overwhelm our economy if we do not act now. Our \nirresponsible fiscal policies have created a grave situation that more \nand more people--Republicans and Democrats--are coming to recognize. We \ncan no longer sit back and hope things will work themselves out. A \npotential national disaster threatens to devastate our way of life, and \nwe have a moral responsibility to do something about it.\n  In the simplest of terms, the Federal Government continues to spend \nmore than it brings in. But, running the credit card for today's needs \nand leaving the bill for future generations should not be the policy of \nthis Congress.\n  An historical perspective helps to highlight the gravity of our \ncurrent situation.\n  The Fiscal Year 2006 budget deficit was $248 billion--the seventh \nlargest deficit in our Nation's history. However, if we don't include \nthe money we're borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund, the \nFiscal Year 2006 budget deficit was $434 billion.\n  I arrived in Washington in 1999, and in the 8 short years since, our \nnational debt has increased by over 50 percent from $5.6 trillion to a \nstaggering $8.6 trillion. It represents 67 percent of the GDP--the \nworst number in 50 years. This means that each man, woman, and child in \nthe United States owes $29,000 of the Federal Government's debt.\n  And yet, these numbers pale in comparison with the budget problems \nlooming in our future as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire less \nthan a year from now, on January 1, 2008. Our long-term fiscal \nimbalance is $50 trillion. That's hard to even grasp, but it translates \ninto $440,000 of future government debt for every American household--\nup from a mere $175,000 per household just 6 years ago.\n  If we do not sharply curb entitlement spending, the continual growth \nof these programs--especially in healthcare--will crowd out all our \nother spending obligations and collide with historic, long-term level \nof taxes. To put it in perspective, balancing the budget without \nreforming entitlement programs will require raising taxes to European \nlevels. And, that would cripple our ingenuity and economy.\n  So, what must be done?\n  Congress must view our tax code, entitlement programs, and budget \nprocess as the three components--or pillars--of the nation's fiscal \nfoundation, and not as separate entities. Each is intricately linked to \nthe other two pillars. We must reform all three areas to raise the \nnecessary revenue to ensure effective and responsible behavior by \nCongress and federal agencies, to keep our obligations to future \ngenerations, and to keep our nation strong.\n  First, we need fundamental tax reform to help make the tax code \nsimple, fair, transparent, and economically efficient. According to the \nPresident's tax panel and the Mack-Breaux report, only 13 percent of \ntaxpayers file without the help of either a tax preparer or computer \nsoftware program--a function of the complexity of the system. Since \nenacting the Tax Reform Act of 1986--legislation intended to simplify \nthe filing process for taxpayers--15,000 additions have been made to \nthe Internal Revenue Code.\n  We cannot consider tax reform, however, without reforming our growing \nentitlement programs. Our already massive debt will spike yet higher as \nentitlements such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid witness a \nsurge of beneficiaries in the form of retiring Baby Boomers. This \nmounting debt will soon become a burden our children cannot bear, \ndragging down our standard of living and our standing in the world.\n  Finally, we must restore the third pillar of our fiscal foundation--\nthe budget process. Together we can streamline the system to help lock \nin long term tax and entitlement reforms. In the past, every major \ndeficit reduction package has included a series of budget process \nreforms and enforcement mechanisms designed to prevent Congress from \nundoing tough choices in future years. By transforming the budget \nprocess, we can fight back against the all-too-common practice of \ngaming the system.\n  While some of our colleagues claim we need tax reform, others claim \nwe need entitlement reform. The bill I am introducing today, however, \nis the only bill that does it all--because you can't reform one without \nthe other, or it's doomed to fail.\n  The Securing America's Future Economy Commission Act establishes a \nnational, bipartisan commission to examine these broken systems and to \npresent solutions to place the nation on a fiscally sustainable course \nand ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations.\n  The Commission will be comprised of 16 voting members--an equal \nnumber of members from each party, with some seats reserved for sitting \nmembers of Congress. The Treasury Secretary and the OMB Director will \nbe members, and the other 14 will be appointed by congressional \nleaders.\n  The Commission will hold town hall meetings throughout the country to \ndetermine the scope of the problem and consider possible policy \noptions. The Commission will present a report--and, if a three-fourths \nmajority of the Commission agrees, they will present actual legislation \nto Congress.\n  The administration and Congress will each have 90 days to review the \nproposal and develop an alternative package of reforms if they believe \nit's necessary. The most important point is that this legislation uses \na fast-track procedure to guarantee a vote in Congress on the \nCommission's legislation and the congressional and presidential \nalternatives.\n  Outside groups across the political spectrum have shown support for \nour efforts, as have business executives--who view our efforts as an \neconomic necessity--and religious leaders--who view our efforts as a \nmoral necessity. And, when you look at the numbers, it is clear why. We \nhave a moral obligation to improve the fiscal health of our Nation. \nOtherwise, our children and grandchildren are going to celebrate \nAmerica's past and the good old days, rather than the future and the \ngood new days.\n  Restoring our Nation's fiscal health will require hard, bipartisan \nwork and tough decisions. That work, however, must begin immediately. \nWe cannot afford to put it off any longer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 305. A bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to make \nit unlawful for a packer to own, feed, or control livestock intended \nfor slaughter; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Congress will be working on a rewrite of \nthe current farm bill during the 110th Congress and I will be looking \nfor ways to improve the economic condition of America's farmers. \nHowever, one of the many shortcomings of the 2002 farm bill is that it \nfailed to protect family farmers and independent livestock producers \nfrom vertical integration in the livestock industry. This is one reason \nwhy I voted against the final conference report.\n  Over the years, family farmers from across Iowa have contacted me to \nexpress their fears about the threat they feel from concentration in \nthe livestock industry. They fear that if the trend toward increased \nconcentration continues, they may be unable to compete effectively and \nwill not be able to get a fair price for their livestock in the \nmarketplace.\n  The bill I am introducing would prevent meat packers from assuming \ncomplete control of the meat supply by preventing packers from owning \nlivestock.\n  This bill would make it unlawful for a packer to own or feed \nlivestock intended for slaughter. Single pack entities and packs too \nsmall to participate in the Mandatory Price Reporting program would be \nexcluded from the limitation. In addition, farmer cooperatives in which \nthe members own, feed, or control the livestock themselves would be \nexempt under this new bill.\n  This is a similar version I successfully offered on the floor during \nthe debate on the 2002 farm bill.\n  It's important for our colleagues to remember that family farmers \nultimately derive their income from the agricultural marketplace, not \nthe farm bill. Family farmers have unfortunately been in a position of \nweakness\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nin selling their product to large processors and in buying their inputs \nfrom large suppliers.\n  Today, the position of the family farmer has become weaker as \nconsolidation in agribusiness has reached all time highs. Farmers have \nfewer buyers and suppliers than ever before. The result is an \nincreasing loss of family farms and the smallest farm share of the \nconsumer dollar in history.\n  One hundred years ago, this Nation reacted appropriately to citizen \nconcerns about large, powerful companies by establishing rules \nconstraining such businesses when they achieved a level of market power \nthat harmed, or risked harming, the public interest, trade and \ncommerce. The United States Congress enacted the first competition laws \nin the world to make commerce more free and fair. These competition \nlaws include the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Federal Trade Commission Act \nand Packers & Stockyards Act.\n  Since that time, many countries in the world have followed this U.S. \nexample to constrain undue market power in their domestic economies.\n  Unfortunately, competition policy has been severely weakened in this \ncountry, especially in agriculture, due to Federal case law, \nunderfunded enforcement, and unfounded reliance on efficiency claims. \nThe result has been a significant degradation of the domestic \nagricultural market infrastructure. The current situation reflects a \ntremendous mis-allocation of resources across the food chain. Congress \nmust strengthen competition policy within the farm sector to reclaim a \nproperly operating marketplace.\n  While this legislation does not accomplish all that we need to do in \nthis area, it's an important first step toward remedying the biggest \nproblem facing farmers today, the problem of concentration.\n  Thank you Mr. President; I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit an escalation in United States military \nforces in Iraq without prior authorization by Congress; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week President Bush announced a plan to \nescalate U.S. military involvement in Iraq, the continuation of his \nfailed policy in Iraq. I am strongly opposed to this course.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation today that will prohibit \nthe number of troops in Iraq from exceeding the current force levels \nwithout an explicit authorization from Congress. As of January 16, \n2007, United States Central Command reports 130,500 American service-\nmembers operating within the borders of Iraq.\n  It is my hope that Congress can begin debate on my proposal and \nothers that may be forthcoming before the week is out. It is imperative \nthat we in Congress act swiftly on this crucial issue.\n  Let's be very clear, my bill does not prohibit additional funding for \nAmerican troops who are currently in harms way. I will continue to do \neverything that I can to support our troops so long as they are \nstationed in Iraq. My bill would prohibit President Bush from \nincreasing the number of U.S. service-members in Iraq without prior \nauthorization from Congress.\n  The President's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement is a \ntrue disservice to American troops who have shown nothing but \nprofessionalism and courage, and who should not be asked to risk their \nlives to become cannon fodder in a civil war rife with ethnic \ncleansing.\n  Moreover, I do not believe that the authorization provided by \nCongress in 2002 gives the President unlimited authority to send \nadditional troops to Iraq for a mission which is completely different \nfrom the one the President himself articulated in March 2002, shortly \nafter committing U.S. forces to Iraq. On March 22, 2002, the President \nof the United States said that our goal in invading Iraq was ``to \ndisarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's \nsupport for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.''\n  We all now know that there were no weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq to be disarmed. So we can no longer justify an additional troop \npresence on the grounds of WMDs. Saddam Hussein is no longer in a \nposition to support terrorism, or anything else for that matter. As for \nfreeing the Iraqi people--Iraq's dictator is dead and the Iraqi people \nhave duly elected their own leaders to govern them.\n  Nothing in the 2002 resolution, or in the President's articulation of \nhis goals for Iraq prior to that resolution suggested that the United \nStates would, could, or should be engaged in trying to referee a civil \nwar.\n  So Congress is confronted with two choices--do nothing; or respond \ndecisively in opposition to staying the course--a course that is sure \nto produce an even more violent, less stable political and security \nclimate in Iraq.\n  To me, that choice is clear. Leadership demands that those of us who \nthink the President is on the wrong track, not simply stand up and say \nso, but act to stop this escalation from going forward.\n  I know that enacting legislation to stop the President from the \ncourse he has chosen will not be easy. But that doesn't mean that the \nCongress shouldn't debate it and vote on it--that is exactly what the \nAmerican people sent us to Congress to do.\n  We have arrived at a moment of choice. The President and this \nAdministration have chosen escalation--more bloodshed, more chaos, and \nmore violence. If the President wants to escalate our military \ncommitment to Iraq, and if the President wants to send more troops into \nthe center of a civil war, then the President must make that case to \nthe United States Congress and let the full Congress vote on the merits \nof such a plan.\n  The President has stated that he believes that as Commander-in-Chief \nhe has the authority to order troops to Iraq in the face of \nCongressional opposition. We are a Nation of laws. The President is not \nabove those laws. If Congress passes legislation to limit the \ndeployment of troops to Iraq, the President will no longer have the \nluxury of ignoring the views of the Congress, a co-equal branch of \ngovernment. And the time for a blank check is over.\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Reed, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 309. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of \ncarbon dioxide, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Global Warming \nPollution Reduction Act of 2007. There are many critically important \nissues that we face, including education, health care, the growing and \ninexcusable economic inequality in this country, and the situation in \nIraq. Among these issues has to be the threat faced by the earth itself \ndue to global warming and that is why this legislation is the first \nbill that I am introducing as a U.S. Senator.\n  The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the full text of which I \nask be included in the Record following my remarks, was initially \nintroduced last year by the Senator whose seat I currently hold, \nSenator Jim Jeffords. Jim's leadership in offering a forwardthinking \nglobal warming bill is known by all in this chamber and I am honored to \ncontinue his efforts by introducing this tremendously-important \nlegislation today.\n  This bill, is being cosponsored by many of my esteemed colleagues and \nI would like to recognize them this morning: Senator Boxer, chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee; the Senior Senator from the \ngreat state of Vermont, Mr. Leahy; both Senators from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg and Mr. Menendez; Senators Reed and Whitehouse, both from \nRhode Island; the Senate delegation from the State of Hawaii, Senators \nInouye and Akaka; and Senator Feingold of Wisconsin and Senator Kennedy \nof Massachusetts. I appreciate the support of these colleagues in \nfocusing attention on the most important environmental issue of our \ntime and urge my other colleagues to join in this effort.\n  I am also proud that the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act has \nthe support of numerous national groups, including the Earth Day \nNetwork, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Environmental & Energy \nStudy Institute, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of \nConservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Environmental \nTrust, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, \nUnion of Concerned Scientists, and US PIRG.\n  The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act is based on the scientific \nevidence and consensus that global warming poses a significant threat \nto the United States and the world. In fact, with our national \nsecurity, our economy, our public health and welfare, and our global \nenvironment at stake, we must do nothing short of taking bold action. \nTo that end, I am proud that last week the Vermont state legislature \nbegan 3 weeks of hearings on global warming. Like Americans across the \ncountry, they want action to fight global warming and they wish their \nFederal Government would step up and provide leadership commensurate \nwith the magnitude of the threat. Well, Mr President this bill answers \nthose pleas for leadership.\n  Grassroots support for action on global warming is clear. Over 300 \nmayors have committed their cities to meeting the standards described \nin the Kyoto Protocol. In fact, with over 54 million citizens \nrepresented, the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement provides \nclear evidence that everyday citizens--unlike some large corporations \nwho have continually misrepresented the science of global warming--want \nto see movement on this issue. Additionally, a group of northeast \nStates, including Maine, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, New \nJersey, New York, and Vermont, have already implemented a regional \neffort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other northeastern \nStates, such as Maryland and Massachusetts, are likely to join this \ngroup soon. And, we all know that the State of California has \nrecognized the need to act on global warming and is moving forward with \na tremendous program.\n  Despite the increasing calls for action, for years, the Bush \nadministration has turned a deaf ear as the scientific community warned \nus of the problem of global warming and the disastrous impact it will \nhave on our planet. Sadly, many of these predictions are now becoming a \nreality.\n  Global concentrations of greenhouse gases are incredibly high. In \nfact, the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has risen to \n378 parts per million--a level unseen during anytime over the past \n400,000 years. Additionally, on a global scale, 8 of the 10 years \nbetween 1996 and the end of 2005 are among the warmest 10 years on \nrecord and experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration have just logged 2006 as the hottest year on record for \nthe U.S. Also, the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests \nthat the majority of the ice caps of the Arctic Ocean will melt by the \nsummer of 2040--decades earlier than previously expected. And, the \nsituation has become so dramatic that the Department of the Interior \nrecently suggested listing polar bears on the endangered species list \nbecause their habitat is quite literally disappearing. We are also told \nto expect changes in agriculture and water systems, new threats to our \nhealth, and more extreme weather patterns including more intense \nhurricanes. All of this is due to global warming caused by the carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released into our \natmosphere when we burn fossil fuels.\n  The good news is that we know how to stop continued global warming--\nwe simply need the political will to make it happen. The time is now \nfor bold action that will move our country away from fossil fuels such \nas coal, gas, and oil towards efficient, sustainable energy sources \nlike wind, solar, bio-mass and hydrogen. The bill I introduce today \nrecognizes the urgency of our circumstances and sets targets for \nreduction of U.S. emissions to help stabilize global atmospheric \nconcentrations of greenhouse gases below 450 parts per million, a \ncritical level as recognized by leading climate scientists. More \nspecifically, this legislation calls for an 80 percent decrease--\ncompared to 1990 levels--in global warming pollutants by 2050 by \nenacting a combination of mandatory reduction targets and incentives \nthat will help develop clean alternative energies.\n  The concept is simple. By putting our minds to it, we can usher in a \nnew era of nonpolluting, renewable energy sources. And, what makes this \nproposal even more exciting is its potential to reshape our economy and \nmake the United States a leader in clean and efficient energy \ntechnologies--creating millions of good paying jobs in the process.\n\n  In fact, it is a lack of bold vision that will financially cost us. \nIn October of 2006, Sir Nicholas Stern, a former chief economist of the \nWorld Bank, turned the old economic arguments against taking action on \nclimate change on their head. In a report to the British government, he \nwrites that bold action to combat the threat of global warming will in \nfact save industrial nations money and that inaction could cost between \n5 to 20 percent of global gross domestic product. Speaking to the issue \nin no uncertain terms, the report states, ``If no action is taken we \nwill be faced with the kind of downturn that has not been seen since \nthe great depression and the two world wars.''\n  To be quite frank, the time for talk is over. It is time for action \nand introduction of this bill signals my commitment to pushing for such \naction.\n  While I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jeffords' full statement \nfrom last year on this important bill be included following my remarks, \nI want to read two excerpts from those remarks:\n\n       Global warming is real and it is already happening. Its \n     effects are being felt across the globe and the longer we \n     delay, the more severe these effects will be.\n\n  He went on to say,\n\n       In my final year in the Senate, I have often asked myself, \n     ``What lasting actions can I take to make the world a better \n     place?'' I hope that by proposing real action on climate \n     change, and passing the torch to a new generation of those \n     committed to protecting the environment, that I can help make \n     a difference for us all.\n\n  I couldn't be more honored to carry on Senator Jeffords' vision on \nbehalf of Vermonters and all Americans.\n  In closing, a country that represents only 6 percent of the world's \npopulation but produces 25 percent of its\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions, the United States has a moral obligation to \nlead the way toward reducing these emissions. For the sake of our \nchildren and grandchildren, we must meet that obligation. This \nlegislation will put us on the right path to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Statement of Senator Jeffords, July 20, 2006\n\n       Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Global Warming \n     Pollution Reduction Act of 2006.\n       One of the most important issues facing mankind is the \n     problem of global warming. Global warming is real and it is \n     already happening. Its effects are being felt across the \n     globe and the longer we delay, the more severe these effects \n     will be. The broad consensus within the scientific community \n     is that global warming has begun, is largely the result of \n     human activity, and is accelerating. Atmospheric greenhouse \n     gas concentrations have risen to 378 parts per million, \n     nearly one third above pre-industrial levels and higher than \n     at any time during the past 400,000 years. Projections \n     indicate that stabilizing concentrations at 450 parts per \n     million would still mean a temperature increase of two to \n     four degrees Fahrenheit. Such warming will result in more \n     extreme weather, increased flooding and drought, disruption \n     of agricultural and water systems, threats to human health \n     and loss of sensitive species and ecosystems.\n       In order to prevent and minimize these effects, we must \n     take global actions to address this issue as soon as \n     possible. We owe that to ourselves and to future generations.\n       The overwhelming majority of Americans support taking some \n     form of action on climate change. I am today introducing the \n     Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, which I believe \n     responds to that call. I believe this is the most far \n     reaching and forward thinking climate change bill ever \n     introduced. It sets a goal of an 80% reduction in global \n     warming pollutants by 2050. It provides a roadmap for actions \n     that we will need to take over the next few decades to combat \n     global warming. I believe that if this bill were passed, it \n     would put us on the path to potentially solving the global \n     warming problem. If it were passed, we would reshape our \n     economy to become more energy independent, cleaner and more \n     economically competitive. If it were passed, we would have a \n     chance of avoiding some of the worst and most dangerous \n     effects of global warming. If it were passed, we would be in \n     a position to negotiate with other countries as part of the \n     global solution.\n       Some will say that this bill imposes requirements that ask \n     too much of industry. Some will say that this bill contains \n     requirements that we cannot easily meet. I say first of all \n     that the costs of inaction vastly outweigh the costs of \n     action, and that we have a responsibility to future \n     generations not to leave the earth far worse off than when we \n     found it--with a fundamentally altered climate system. \n     Temperature changes, sea level rise, hurricanes, floods and \n     droughts can affect food production, national security, the \n     spread of disease and the survival of endangered species. \n     These are not things to trifle with on the basis of industry \n     cost estimates, which have frequently been overstated.\n       But perhaps more importantly, we can act to reduce global \n     warming. We can reduce emissions to 1990 levels between now \n     and 2020 through a reduction of just 2 percent per year. \n     Energy efficiency alone could play a major part in reaching \n     reductions and new technologies can help as well. Moreover, \n     additional deployment of existing renewable energy sources, \n     including bio-fuels, can also help substantially. If we were \n     to take the actions suggested in this bill, we would find \n     that we would enhance our energy independence, and we would \n     become a world leader in clean energy technologies. American \n     innovation can position us as the world leader in clean \n     technologies.\n       In my final year in the Senate, I have often asked myself \n     ``What lasting actions can I take to make the world a better \n     place?'' I hope that by proposing real action on climate \n     change, and passing the torch to a new generation of those \n     committed to protecting the environment, that I can help make \n     a difference for us all. Global warming is upon us now. The \n     question is, can we take action now, before it is too late?\n       We know what we need to do, we know how much we must \n     reduce, and we have the technology to do so. The question for \n     this body is, do we have the political will? Can we overcome \n     our fears and insecurity and act decisively to combat global \n     warming? That is the opportunity and challenge of the coming \n     years, which my bill on global warming seeks to address. I \n     urge my colleagues to join me in the quest for a better, \n     safer world that is free of the enormous threat posed by \n     dangerous global warming. I urge my colleagues to support \n     this important piece of legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 309\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 30\n\n       Whereas there is a scientific consensus, as established by \n     the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed \n     by the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued \n     buildup of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \n     threatens the stability of the global climate;\n       Whereas there are significant long-term risks to the \n     economy and the environment of the United States from the \n     temperature increases and climatic disruptions that are \n     projected to result from increased greenhouse gas \n     concentrations;\n       Whereas the potential impacts of global climate change, \n     including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and \n     abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions \n     and instability in regions affected\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n     and, therefore, have implications for the national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       Whereas the United States has the largest economy in the \n     world and is also the largest emitter of greenhouse gases;\n       Whereas the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States \n     are projected to continue to rise;\n       Whereas the greenhouse gas emissions of developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of the United States and other developed countries;\n       Whereas reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels \n     necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the \n     introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-\n     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no \n     emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage \n     of greenhouse gases;\n       Whereas the development and sale of climate-friendly \n     technologies in the United States and internationally present \n     economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas climate-friendly technologies can improve air \n     quality by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and \n     mobile sources and can enhance energy security by reducing \n     reliance on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and \n     reducing the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure;\n       Whereas other industrialized countries are undertaking \n     measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides \n     the industries in those countries with a competitive \n     advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly \n     technologies;\n       Whereas efforts to limit emissions growth in developing \n     countries in a manner that is consistent with the development \n     needs of those countries could establish significant markets \n     for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to \n     international efforts to address climate change;\n       Whereas the United States Climate Change Science Program \n     launched by President George W. Bush concluded in April 2006 \n     that there is no longer a discrepancy between the rates of \n     global average temperature increase observed at the Earth's \n     surface and in the atmosphere, strengthening the scientific \n     evidence that human activity contributes significantly to \n     global temperature increases;\n       Whereas President Bush, in the State of the Union Address \n     given in January 2006, called on the United States to reduce \n     its ``addiction'' to oil and focus its attention on \n     developing cleaner, renewable, and sustainable energy \n     sources;\n       Whereas President Bush has launched the Asia-Pacific \n     Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to cooperatively \n     develop new and cleaner energy technologies and promote their \n     use in fast-developing nations like India and China;\n       Whereas the national security of the United States will \n     increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic, \n     military, scientific, and economic resources toward solving \n     the problem of the overreliance of the United States and the \n     world on high-carbon energy;\n       Whereas the United States is a party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994 (hereinafter referred \n     to as the ``Convention'');\n       Whereas, at the December 2005 United Nations Climate Change \n     Conference in Montreal, Canada, parties to the Convention, \n     with the concurrence of the United States, initiated a new \n     dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate \n     change;\n       Whereas the Convention sets a long-term objective of \n     stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere \n     at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \n     interference with the climate system;\n       Whereas the Convention establishes that parties bear common \n     but differentiated responsibilities for efforts to achieve \n     the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations;\n       Whereas an effective global effort to address climate \n     change must provide for commitments and action by all \n     countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases, \n     developed and developing alike, and the widely varying \n     circumstances among the developed and developing countries \n     may require that such commitments and action vary; and\n       Whereas the United States has the capability to lead the \n     effort to counter global climate change: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States should act to reduce the health, environmental, \n     economic, and national security risks posed by global climate \n     change and foster sustained economic growth through a new \n     generation of technologies, by--\n       (1) participating in negotiations under the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May \n     9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994, and leading efforts \n     in other international fora, with the objective of securing \n     United States participation in binding agreements that--\n       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security \n     interests of the United States;\n       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that \n     are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the \n     principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;\n       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize \n     the cost of efforts by participating countries; and\n       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global \n     greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (2) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group, the \n     members of which shall be designated by the chairman and \n     ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate, to--\n       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate \n     change; and\n       (B) ensure that the advice and consent function of the \n     Senate is exercised in a manner to facilitate timely \n     consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. President, the climate has changed. It has changed outside \nthese walls: the year just concluded was the warmest on record in the \nUnited States. And the climate has changed in the halls of the Senate, \nwhere the causes and consequences of global warming--and how we should \nrespond--will be a major concern of this new Congress.\n  Outside, the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere has \ngrown from 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution to \n430 parts per million today. We are on a path that could double the \npre-industrial levels of greenhouse gases, threatening an increase of \nas much as 10 degrees in the next century.\n  The physical consequences of global warming are right before our \neyes: the shrinking polar ice cap, retreating glaciers, stronger storms \ndriven by warmer ocean waters, changing growing seasons, animal \nmigration, and rainfall patterns. Future consequences if we continue \nbusiness as usual will include rising sea levels, the spread of \ndiseases, abrupt climate shifts that could shut down the Atlantic cycle \nthat warms Europe, or shrink the Amazon rainforest, which provides \ntwenty percent of the oxygen we breathe.\n  These changes will profoundly alter the assumptions on which the \neconomic, political, and security arrangements of our world have been \nconstructed. Our national borders, our cities, our cultures, are all \nbuilt around patterns of rainfall, arable land, and coastlines that \nwill be redrawn as global warming proceeds. By one estimate, 200 \nmillion people, in the coastal cities of New York, Tokyo, Cairo, and \nLondon, in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh, in the islands of \nthe Pacific and Caribbean, could be permanently displaced by climate \nshifts.\n  Throughout human history, massive population shifts, frustrated \nexpectations, and the collapse of economies, have all led to conflict. \nEven the richest nations, source of the emissions behind global \nwarming, will face huge costs coping with those catastrophes. The \npoorest nations, whose economies have contributed little or nothing to \nthe greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, will be hit the worst, and will \nhave the fewest resources with which to respond. This is a recipe for \nglobal resource wars, and even greater resentment of our wealth by \nthose less fortunate--a new world disorder.\n  Weare failing in our responsibility to steward the riches we have \ninherited. We are bequeathing our children not just a ruined landscape, \nbut a world of conflict as well.\n  This is a classic tragedy of the commons. We have treated our \natmosphere as a costless dump for the waste gases that are the \nbyproduct of our great wealth. There was a time when we could plead \nignorance. That day is past. The science is now clear. There was a time \nwhen we might have claimed the cost of changing our ways was too great. \nThat day is past. We now know the costs of inaction are unacceptably \nhigh. There was a time when we could claim that our actions, in \nisolation, would be ineffective. That day is past. It is now clear that \nour inaction reduces the effectiveness of international efforts to \naddress climate change, and provides an excuse for China, India, \nMexico, Brazil, and the other leading emitters of the future to stay \nwith us on the sidelines.\n\n  Today, I am joining with my friend Senator Dick Lugar to submit this \nresolution, to put the Senate on record in support of a return of the \nUnited States to a leadership role in the international search for \nsolutions to the problem of global warming.\n  Our resolution calls for United States participation in negotiations \nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change--signed \nby the first President Bush--that will protect the economic and \nsecurity interests of the\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nUnited States, and that will commit all nations--developed and \ndeveloping--that are major emitters of greenhouse gases to achieve \nsignificant long-term reductions in those emissions. The resolution \nalso calls for a bipartisan Senate observer group to monitor talks and \nensure that our negotiators bring back agreements that all Americans \ncan support.\n  With the glaring exception of the United States, the major industrial \nnations of the world are proceeding with their commitments, under the \nKyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention, to reduce their greenhouse \ngas emissions an average of seven percent below 1990 levels. The period \nfrom 2008 through 2012 will test their ability to meet those \ncommitments, which were first negotiated in 1997. It is past time for \nus to begin the discussions that can lead to the next steps, beyond the \nKyoto date of 2012. Those next steps must not only include the United \nStates, the leading historical source of greenhouse gases. They must \ninclude those nations who will soon overtake us in that role, those who \nwill be the leading emitters in 2012.\n  The Biden-Lugar Resolution states that the evidence of the human role \nin global warming is clear, that the environmental, economic, and \nsecurity effects will be costly, and that the response must be \ninternational. The resolution recognizes that there are real economic \nbenefits from both reducing the waste and inefficiencies inherent in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and from the markets for new, climate-\nfriendly technologies. Most importantly it puts the Senate on record, \ncalling for the United States to resume its role as leader in the \ninternational effort to address this global threat.\n  I personally believe that the single most important step we can take \nto resume a leadership role in international climate change efforts \nwould be to make real progress toward a domestic emissions reduction \nregime. For too long we have abdicated the responsibility to reduce our \nown emissions, the largest single source of the problem we face today. \nWe have the world's largest economy, with the highest per capita \nemissions. Rather than leading by example, we have retreated from \ninternational negotiations.\n  In this Congress we will see renewed efforts to pass legislation to \ncreate that regime, to reduce our domestic emissions, and to open our \nmany responsible American businesses to both international emissions \ntrading and the new markets for clean technologies in the developing \nworld. Moving toward that goal will be crucial to the effectiveness and \ncredibility of our international efforts.\n  We are all on this planet together. We cannot protect ourselves from \nthe effects of climate change by acting alone--this is a global problem \nthat will require a global solution. To undertake meaningful \nreductions, countries will need to know that their actions will not be \nundercut by ``free riders'' who continue business as usual while they \ncommit to change. To build that trust will require commitments by all \nof the key players, and the institutions to coordinate the actions of \nindependent nations.\n  With this resolution, Senator Lugar and I want to put the Senate on \nrecord in support of a new effort to build that trust, to make those \ncommitments, to participate in a coordinated international effort to \nconfront the real threat of climate change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/16/senate-section/article/S612-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S612-S627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 59.
