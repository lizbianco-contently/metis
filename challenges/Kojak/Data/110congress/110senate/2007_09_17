Mr. President, on this day 220 years ago, in 1787, our \nFounding Fathers gathered at Philadelphia and signed a document that \nremains today our country's moral compass, our Constitution. The \npreamble to that Constitution reads:\n\n       We the people of the United States, in order to form a more \n     perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic \n     tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to \n     ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  No matter how many times we hear that preamble, it touches a chord in \nall of our hearts because that is what this country is all about.\n  The years since that day in Philadelphia, 220 years ago, have not \nbeen a perfect journey. In fact, it has been imperfect on some \noccasions--but more perfect than none. There are times where we have \nstumbled--we can all think of examples of that: slavery, the Civil War, \nthe internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. But each time \nour fidelity to the ideals of justice has been tested, America has \nmoved closer to securing the blessings of liberty.\n  Over the past 6\\1/2\\ years, the Bush administration has challenged \nthat fidelity time and time again. We have suffered through a White \nHouse that values secrecy and disdains the separation of powers. The \nJustice Department served the President rather than the\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\npeople. The pervasive attitude among the administration was that civil \nliberties are a nuisance rather than an inalienable right.\n\n  I spoke to the President's nominee to be Attorney General a short \ntime ago, Judge Mukasey. I told him I admire his willingness to take \nthis job. He has a good background, a good record. We will find out \nwhat happens during the time the hearings take place before the \nJudiciary Committee. But I told him that never in the history of our \ncountry have we had a Justice Department in such a state of disrepair, \nand he realizes that.\n  But as we turn to the Defense authorization bill this week and likely \nthe next, we in Congress have an opportunity to reassert our allegiance \nto the Constitution and the core American values for which it stands, \nvalues that have made America the world's beacon of freedom for more \nthan two centuries.\n  Senators will have a chance to show whether they support the \ninalienable right of habeas corpus, something that is talked about in \nour Constitution--the right to petition a court to review the grounds \nfor a detention. Senators will have an opportunity to review the cost, \nboth fiscally and morally, in maintaining the Guantanamo Bay detention \nfacility, and whether closing it will do more to further the fight \nagainst terrorism and advance America's values, as I believe it would, \nthan keeping it open indefinitely. We hope to debate the \nadministration's use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques and \nwhether we should bring the practices of intelligence agencies under \nthe same rules that our military believes are proper under the Army \nField Manual; in effect, no more torture.\n  The Defense authorization bill is also our next best chance to \ncontinue our efforts to force President Bush to change course in an \nintractable civil war in which we find ourselves involved in Iraq. Last \nweek the President delivered yet another prime-time address to the \nNation on his Iraq policy and once again he announced he has no \nintention to change his failed war plan. He has given neither a \nconvincing rationale to continue the war nor a plan to end it. \nMeanwhile, brave American troops continue to be killed and grievously \nwounded, our Treasury is being depleted at an ever faster rate, the \nIraqi Government has made no progress in political reconciliation, and \nthose responsible for attacking us on \n9/11 grow stronger, as indicated in the latest video from Osama bin \nLaden. Today brings news that the President will not even return our \ntroop presence in Iraq to presurge levels next year, meaning that a \nyear from now we will be dug in even deeper than we were a year ago in \nIraq.\n  The President's speech last week made one thing clear, though: He has \nno intention of changing course. He plans to keep the status quo \nthrough the duration of his administration with the hope that if we \nstick around long enough, something, anything, will start going right; \nand if it doesn't--and there is no sign it will--he will leave it to \nthe next President to clean things up.\n  We could start to change course now. The overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people and the majority of Congress are ready to do just that. \nA majority of Senators has voted to send legislation to the President \nthat will force him to change the mission and begin to bring our troops \nhome, but the Republican leadership so far has not allowed the voice of \nthe majority to be heard. By requiring a 60-vote margin on all Iraq-\nrelated votes, they have repeatedly filibustered the will of the people \nand blocked the new direction our troops deserve. As long as our brave \nsoldiers and marines remain mired in the crossfire of another country's \ncivil war, we can continue fighting to responsibly end this war. We all \nknow it will take the courage of our Republican colleagues to stand up \nto the President. A few have, and I admire and respect them. We know \nstanding up to their President is not easy, but it is the right thing \nto do. It is long past time for those Republicans who expressed \nopposition to this endless war to work with us to find a way to end it; \notherwise, this is not only Bush's war but the war of the Republican \nSenators as well, because we all know there has been little support in \nthe House or the Senate by Republicans to change the direction of the \nwar in Iraq.\n  Next week we will turn our attention back to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, known as SCHIP. This remarkably successful program \nwas enacted a decade ago to fill a crucial gap in insurance, the gap \nbetween the children of families who often have private health \ninsurance and the children of the very low-income families who are \ncovered by Medicaid. But between the two, millions of children whose \nfamilies neither qualify for Medicaid nor can afford private insurance \nwere left uninsured--left without medical attention most of the time. \nToday 6.6 million children have insurance because of this program \nstarted 10 years ago. That is a 35-percent reduction in the number of \nuninsured children of working families. The program has been a \nremarkable success by any means, and a great example of what the State \nand Federal Government can do in a tangible way to make peoples' lives \nbetter.\n  Earlier this summer, an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the \nSenate voted to reauthorize and approve this outstanding program. Next \nweek we will vote on a compromise version between the House and Senate \nand send it to the President's desk. The bill we send to the President \nwill continue the program and provide insurance for millions more \nchildren of working families. For many, it will replace emergency room \ncare with regular checkups; it will mean proper dental care; it will \nmean preventive medicine.\n  Study after study shows that kids enrolled in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program are much more likely to have regular doctor and \ndental care. The report shows that these children report lower rates of \nunmet need for care, the quality of care they receive is far better \nthan it was before, and school performance improves. The plan is \nhelping to close a disparity in care for minority children and it has \nbecome a major source of care for rural children.\n  There is no doubt, no question at all, that the Children's Health \nInsurance Program is good for children, good for families, and it is \ncertainly good for our country. This bill will be the product of real \nbipartisan cooperation.\n  I appreciate very much the work of Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley of the Finance Committee, and the work of Senators Rockefeller \nand Hatch. They have done the right thing for this country.\n  The President, though, has threatened to veto this legislation. This \nis pretty surprising because listen to what he said in the 2004 \nelection campaign, a direct quote:\n\n       In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the government health insurance programs. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  I take the President at his word and expect he will live up to this \npromise. I hope before issuing more threats, he will take a real look \nat what he said before, and the legislation we are sending to him. It \nhas the support of so many Democrats and so many Republicans for a \nreason. It is an example of Government at its best, lending a helping \nhand, providing a safety net to children who need a boost to reach \ntheir full potential. All too often we hear what Government can't do. \nThe Children's Health Insurance Program is a stellar example of what we \ncan do. I am confident the Senate will not be intimidated by the \nPresident's veto threats, especially, I repeat, based on what he told \nus during the reelection campaign of 2004. For the President to do \nanything less would be his not keeping his word. So I hope once again \nwe will vote to pass this legislation with strong bipartisan support.\n  I ask my unanimous consent request also include any statement my \nfriend, the Republican leader, may give.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11536-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the President nominated Judge\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nMichael Mukasey to be our Nation's 81st Attorney General. He has \nimpressive credentials. I look forward to learning more about his \nrecord.\n  In this regard, the Judiciary Committee should promptly hold hearings \non his nomination, carefully examine his record, and vote in a timely \nmanner. For the past several months our Democratic colleagues have told \nus we need to install new leadership at the Justice Department and that \nwe ``can't afford to wait,'' in their words\n  A successful nominee, they have told us, is someone with integrity \nand experience, who respects the rule of law and who can hit the ground \nrunning. The senior Senator from New York has assured us that he and \nhis colleagues would not obstruct or impede someone with these \nqualifications.\n  Judge Mukasey appears to be just such a nominee. He is a former \nFederal prosecutor and Federal judge with extensive experience, \nespecially in terrorism-related matters. He served on the Federal trial \nbench for 19 years, and for the last 6 years of his career he has been \nthe chief judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nNew York.\n  He presided over the 1993 World Trade Center bombing case, in which \nhe was widely respected for his equanimity, intelligence, and deep \nappreciation for the complex legal issues at stake.\n  The prosecutor, Andrew McCarthy, recently wrote a compelling first-\nhand account of Judge Mukasey's conduct in that case for the National \nReview. I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed at the \nclose of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In the article, Mr. McCarthy notes the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, after upholding Judge Mukasey's work, took the highly \nunusual step of praising his handling of the case. Here is what the \ncourt of appeals wrote:\n\n       The trial judge, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, presided \n     with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to \n     the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the \n     jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face of \n     challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial \n     judge.\n\n  Judge Mukasey has earned the deep respect and admiration of the \nlawyers who have appeared before him and of the many other public \nservants who have observed and studied his work. His intelligence, \nexperience, and fairmindedness would seem to make him an ideal \ncandidate to lead the Justice Department.\n  At the very least, these qualities warrant timely and fair \nconsideration of his nomination by the Judiciary Committee. \nUnfortunately, recent press reports, including a Roll Call article from \njust a couple of hours ago, indicate that at least some Democrats on \nthe Judiciary Committee are more interested in dragging out this \nnomination than in installing new leadership at the Justice Department.\n  They have said they might hold Judge Mukasey's nomination hostage in \norder to extract still more administration documents in the U.S. \nattorneys matter.\n  This would be extremely unfortunate. By injecting politics into the \nconfirmation process, committee Democrats would be turning their backs \non earlier public comments that installing new leadership at the \nDepartment was of critical importance. They would be turning their \nbacks on earlier public assurances that they would not obstruct or \nimpede--again their words--a nominee with Judge Mukasey's qualities.\n  Now is the chance for our Democratic colleagues to prove they were \nserious when they cried out for new leadership at the Justice \nDepartment by following Senate precedent, weighing the nominee's \nqualifications, and voting in a timely fashion.\n  I would hope they would not hold him hostage, forgetting the words of \nthe senior Senator from New York, who has told us:\n\n       This Nation needs a new Attorney General and it cannot \n     afford to wait.\n\n  In these times, it is especially important that the Senate act \npromptly. We are at war, and as the distinguished ranking member has \nnoted: Apart from the Defense Department, no department of the \nexecutive branch is more important to defending our Nation than the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  We need to act. Now, I understand that Judge Mukasey will begin his \ncourtesy visits tomorrow with Members of the Senate. I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will be able to meet with him so the Senate can begin \nconsidering his nomination as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Judge Mukasey Would Make a Stellar Attorney General; A Gifted Former \n      Prosecutor and Renowned Jurist Could Be Just the Right Fit.\n\n                        (By Andrew C. McCarthy)\n\n       It is not exaggeration to say that the United States \n     Department of Justice is among the handful of our nation's \n     most important institutions. It is the fulcrum of our rule of \n     law.\n       The department must be above reproach. It must enforce our \n     laws without fear or favor. It must be the place the courts, \n     the Congress and the American people look to without \n     hesitation for the most unflinching recitation of fact and \n     the most reliable construction of law. Creativity is \n     welcome--it is the department's proud boast always to be home \n     for some of the world's most creative legal minds. Defense of \n     executive prerogatives is also essential--for the department \n     is not the servant but the peer of the judges and lawmakers \n     before whom it appears, with its first fidelity to the \n     Constitution. Creativity, however, is not invention, and \n     prerogative is not partisanship.\n       The department must foremost be the Department of Justice. \n     Its emblem is integrity. We can argue about where the law \n     should take us, in what direction it should evolve. We must \n     first, however, be able to know what it is. For that, we must \n     be able to rely without question on the department and its \n     leader, the attorney general.\n       President Bush is about to select a new attorney general at \n     a particularly tempestuous time. In today's Washington, even \n     national security has not been spared from our fulminating \n     politics. In the cross-fire, we need stalwart leadership of \n     incontestable competence and solid mooring in the \n     department's highest traditions. Without it, a growing crisis \n     of confidence will grip not only the courts but field \n     prosecutors across the nation.\n       To address such a crisis, the President is fortunate to \n     have several able candidates. One I know particularly well, \n     though you may not, would instantly restore the department's \n     well-deserved reputation for rectitude, scholarship, vision \n     and sober judgment. He is Michael B. Mukasey.\n       I had the privilege of appearing before Judge Mukasey for \n     nearly three years, from 1993 into 1996, when, as an \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, \n     I led the prosecution of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven \n     other jihadists who had waged a terrorist war against the \n     United States--bombing the World Trade Center, plotting to \n     strike other New York City landmarks (including the United \n     Nations complex, the FBI's lower Manhattan headquarters, U.S. \n     military installations, and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels), \n     and conspiring political assassinations against American and \n     foreign leaders.\n       The case was bellwether for 9/11 and its aftermath, \n     presenting all the complex and, at times, excruciating issues \n     we deal with today: the obscure lines a free society must \n     draw between religious belief and religiously motivated \n     violence, between political dissent and the summons \n     to savagery, between due process for accused criminals \n     with a right to present their defense and the imperative \n     to shield precious intelligence from incorrigible enemies \n     bent on killing us.\n       The trial was probably the most important one ever \n     witnessed by . . . nobody. In an odd quirk of history, our \n     nine-month proceeding began at the same time as, and ended a \n     day before, the infamous O.J. Simpson murder trial. While \n     Americans were riveted to a televised three-ring circus in \n     California, Judge Mukasey, in his meticulous yet decisive \n     way, was demonstrating why our judicial system is the envy of \n     the world: carefully crafting insightful opinions on the \n     proper balance between national security and civil liberties, \n     permitting the government to introduce the full spectrum of \n     its evidence but holding it rigorously to its burden of proof \n     and its ethical obligations; managing a complex litigation \n     over defense access to classified information; and developing \n     jury instructions that became models for future national-\n     security cases.\n       All the defendants were convicted, and the sentencing \n     proceedings, complicated by the need to apply novel federal \n     guidelines to a rarely used, Civil War era charge of \n     seditious conspiracy, ended in the imposition of \n     appropriately lengthy jail terms. No one, however, could \n     contend that the case had not been an exemplar of our system \n     at its best. Indeed, in an unusual encomium, the Second \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, upon scrutinizing and upholding the \n     judge's work, was moved to observe:\n       ``The trial judge, the Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, \n     presided with extraordinary skill and patience, assuring \n     fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and \n     helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement \n     in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured \n     by a trial judge.''\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\n       No one should have been surprised. By the time the Blind \n     Sheikh's trial was assigned to him, Judge Mukasey had already \n     forged a reputation as one of America's top trial judges. (In \n     my mind, he is peerless.) That was so because he was also one \n     of America's most brilliant lawyers. From humble beginnings \n     in the Bronx, he had earned his bachelor's degree at Columbia \n     before graduating from Yale Law School in 1967. As a judge, \n     he tolerated nothing but the best effort from prosecutors \n     because he had, himself, been a top prosecutor. He well \n     understood the enormous power in the hands of young assistant \n     U.S. attorneys, the need to temper it with reason and sound \n     judgment. He grasped implicitly and conveyed by example that \n     the great honor of being a lawyer for the United States \n     Department of Justice is that no one gets, or should expect \n     to get, an award for being honest and forthright. It is a \n     realm where those attributes are assumed.\n       In 1988, Michael Mukasey left a lucrative private law \n     practice when President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the \n     federal bench. He was exactly the credit to his court and his \n     country that the President had anticipated. Quite apart from \n     terrorism matters, he handled thousands of cases, many of \n     them high-stakes affairs, with skill and quiet distinction. \n     In his final years on the bench before returning to private \n     practice, he was the Southern District's chief judge, putting \n     his stamp on the court--especially in the aftermath of the \n     September 11th attacks. Through the sheer force of his \n     persistence and his sense of duty, the court quickly reopened \n     for business despite being just a few blocks away from the \n     carnage. Indeed, it never really closed--Judge Mukasey \n     personally traveled to other venues in the District to ensure \n     that the court's vital processes were available to the \n     countless federal, state and local officials who were working \n     round the clock to investigate and prevent a reprise of the \n     suicide hijackings.\n       Characteristically, the judge ensured that the Justice \n     Department was able to do its vital work in a manner that \n     would withstand scrutiny when the heat of the moment had \n     cooled. Judges, himself included, made themselves available, \n     day and night, to review applications for warrants and other \n     lawful authorization orders--no one would ever claim that in \n     his besieged district, crisis had trumped procedural \n     regularity. And as investigators detained material witnesses \n     and scrambled to determine whether they were mere information \n     sources or actual terror suspects, Judge Mukasey made certain \n     that there was a lawful basis for detention, that detainees \n     were represented by counsel fully apprised of that basis, and \n     that the proceedings were kept on a tight leash--under strict \n     judicial supervision, with detainees promptly released unless \n     there was an independent reason to charge them with crimes.\n       Judge Mukasey's mastery of national security issues, \n     reflecting a unique fitness to lead the Justice Department in \n     this critical moment of our history, continued to manifest \n     itself after 9/11. He deftly handled the enemy-combatant \n     detention of Jose Padilla (recently convicted of terrorism \n     crimes), forcefully endorsing the executive branch's wartime \n     power to protect the United States from an al Qaeda operative \n     dispatched to our homeland to conduct mass-murder attacks, \n     but vindicating the American citizen's constitutional rights \n     to counsel and to challenge his detention without trial \n     through habeas corpus. Later, in accepting the Federal Bar \n     Council's prestigious Learned Hand Medal for excellence in \n     federal jurisprudence, Judge Mukasey spoke eloquently of the \n     need to maintain the Patriot Act's reasonable national \n     security protections. More recently, he has written \n     compellingly as a private citizen with unique insight about \n     the profound challenges radical Islam presents for our \n     judicial system.\n       At this moment in time, the nation would be best served by \n     an attorney general who would bring the department instant \n     credibility with the courts and Congress, provide a needed \n     shot in the arm for prosecutors craving a reminder of the \n     department's proud traditions, and reassure the public of the \n     administration's commitment to the department's high \n     standards. There are precious few people who fit that bill, \n     and of them, Michael Mukasey may be the least well known \n     nationally. But he is as solid as they come. Our country \n     would be well served if he were asked, once again, to answer \n     its call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11538-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, September 17, in this year of Our \nLord, 2007, marks the 220th anniversary of the signing of the \nConstitution of the United States. Praise God.\n  Across the Nation, many students, teachers, and historians are \nspending at least part of their time today reviewing, learning about, \nand, most of all, appreciating the U.S. Constitution.\n  Although not as flashy looking as the American flag on Flag Day, or \nas bedecked in sparklers and fireworks as the celebration of the \nDeclaration of Independence on the Fourth of July, the workhorse that \nis our Constitution truly merits a day of appreciation by all citizens.\n  The Constitution is a living, breathing document, still as full of \npassion, patriotism, jealousy, and intrigue after 220 years as the star \nof any long-running soap opera. Perhaps it is because the Constitution, \nsimilar to soap operas, deals with the relations between human beings \nin society.\n  The Constitution, in its articles and amendments, lays out the roles \nfor its actors: the executive, the legislature, the judiciary, the \nStates, and the rights of individuals.\n  The script is pretty basic: Run a country and ensure the welfare of \nits citizens. But being human, people never seem content with playing \nout their own roles as written. James Madison aptly observed that:\n\n       [T]he essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as \n     it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.\n\n  History is replete with examples of governmental actors who have \nimprovised, seeking to expand their own role and put their name in \nbigger lights at the expense of the other players. Fortunately, history \nis also full of examples in which the grasping star's excesses are \nchecked by the concerted actions of the rest of the cast. It is a \nfascinating read, and well worth one's time. Federal versus States \nrights, the freedoms of individuals versus the need for order in \nsociety, protection from tyranny pitted against a strong executive, \ndeclarations of war and peaceful diplomacy--these are some of the great \nthemes, the high dramas written into the Constitution and played out \nover the course of our Nation's history. Our Founding Fathers truly \nknew what they were doing when they crafted a document that hoped for \nthe best, most noble instincts in men but guarded against the worst.\n\n  As James Madison famously observed, ``If men were angels, no \ngovernment would be necessary.'' At the same time, however, he also \nnoted that ``All men having power ought to be mistrusted,'' so the \nfoundation of all the checks and balances in the Constitution is the \npremise that ``ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'' As a \nresult, the Constitution has found itself in a constantly shifting \npolitical landscape created by the ebb and flow of Executive power, \nlegislative control, judicial counterbalancing, Federal expansion, and \nindividualism. These great themes are all played out in many smaller \nscenes each year, from each nomination through each budget submission, \nauthorization, and appropriations bill, and each Supreme Court case.\n  I have always found this historical drama more stimulating and \nabsorbing than any television reality show. Perhaps it is because the \nconstitutional drama has played such a large role in my own long life. \nIn the 220-year history of this Nation's Constitution, there have been \nonly 1,896 individuals fortunate enough to serve as Senators. I am \nnumber 1,579 out of 1,896. I have served in the Senate for one-quarter \nof the Senate's history--not quite an original cast member but pretty \nclose. Amen. You better believe it.\n  But whether each citizen has an active role in our Constitution drama \nor is merely a spectator, the Constitution\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\nplays a large role in the life of every citizen. I encourage everyone, \nevery citizen to read the Constitution--read the Constitution--read the \nConstitution and to read the Federalist Papers as well as other \nwritings by our Founding Fathers. Read deeply in history; with all thy \nvolumes vast hath but one page. Read deeply in history and biography, \nand read the newspapers and follow what is happening in Washington.\n  Do not believe everything you see, do not believe everything you \nhear, but view it through the prism of the Constitution--the \nConstitution--the Constitution. Be your own Supreme Court and decide if \nthe arguments put forth by the White House, the Congress, the press, \nand the pundits are in accordance with the Constitution and with the \nintent of the immortal Framers. Then and only then will you become the \nmost valuable of all things: a true defender of liberty, an informed \ncitizen.\n  Mr. President, I close with a poem--a great poem--by Henry Wadsworth \nLongfellow entitled ``O Ship of State.'' Our Constitution is our ship, \nthe heart and soul of our Nation, and the stalwart vessel that will \ncarry our Nation's liberty into the future. Long, long, long may it \nlive.\n\n     O Ship of State,\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shared the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock,\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes are all with thee.\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee--are all with thee!\n\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11539-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11539-S11540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DC VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on a hot September afternoon in 1787, \n55 men put away their quills after 4 months of hard work in the \nPennsylvania statehouse. The U.S. Constitution was finally finished. \nOne of the delegates read it aloud, and then the oldest man in the room \nrose to speak.\n  Benjamin Franklin had seen a lot in his 81 years. Now, pointing to an \nimage of the Sun that was painted onto the back of a chair in the \nconvention hall, he saw something else. That Sun, he said, was rising. \nIt was a hopeful metaphor which was meant to put the nervous delegates \nat ease. When Franklin finished speaking, everyone left the stuffy \nconvention hall and retired to a local tavern for dinner. And then they \nall went home.\n  Two hundred twenty years later to the day, we remember the courage \nand the wisdom of those 55. And we recommit ourselves to the task of \nupholding and defending the wise and durable document they wrote. As a \npolitical document, the U.S. Constitution is without equal in the \nhistory of man. And as its political children, we consider it an honor \nand a sacred duty to defend it. Doing so today does not involve the \nrisk to life and property that it did back then. But it does require a \nconstant vigilance against anything that would erode it, especially \nfrom within the government itself. And this is why I rise.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia does his country a great \nservice every time he reminds us of the value and the binding nature of \nthe Constitution. It was he who designated by law 3 years ago that \nSeptember 17 should be recognized and celebrated as Constitution Day. \nAnd so I think it is rather fitting that I should fulfill my duty this \nweek as a guardian of that document by voting against a motion to \nproceed to a bill that constitutes, in my view, a fundamental assault \nagainst it.\n  The bill itself would grant congressional representation to residents \nof the District of Columbia. And let me make something very clear to my \ncolleagues, to the citizens of my State, and to the rest of the country \nfrom the outset: my opposition should in no way be interpreted as \nopposition to the enfranchisement of any constitutionally eligible \nAmerican. As the lead Senate Republican cosponsor of the Help America \nVote Act, my commitment to the franchise rights of Americans should be \nclear to everyone in this Chamber.\n  I have long fought for making it easier to vote and harder to cheat. \nThe right to vote is fundamental, and I will fight any attempt to \ndilute or impede that right.\n  My opposition to this bill rests instead on a single all-important \nfact: it is clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional. It contravenes \nwhat the Framers wrote, what they intended, what the courts have always \nheld, and the way Congress has always acted in the past. And to vote \nfor it would violate our oath of office, in which we solemnly swear to \nsupport and defend the Constitution. If the residents of the District \nare to get a member for themselves, they have a remedy: amend the \nConstitution. But the Members of this body derive their authority from \nthe Constitution. We are its servants and guardians. And we have no \nauthority to change it on our own.\n  Amending the Constitution would not be necessary, of course, if the \nframers had intended the District to be treated as a State for purposes \nof representation. But they clearly did not. As article 1, section 2, \nstates:\n\n       The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members \n     chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.\n\n  That is not ambiguous. Every resident of a State, therefore, is \nentitled under the Constitution to congressional representation. Yet no \nsimilar representation is accorded to the residents of areas that are \nnot so designated. One of these areas, in particular, is mentioned \nexplicitly later on in the same article.\n  In article 1, section 8, the so-called District clause, the Framers \ngave Congress power over a new Federal district and any other Federal \nlands purchased by the Federal Government. Article 1, section 8 states:\n\n       Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes over \n     such District as may, by cession of particular states, and \n     the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of Government of \n     the United States and to exercise like authority over all \n     places purchased by the consent of the legislature . . .\n\n  The Framers clearly envisioned the Federal city as a separate entity \nfrom the States, as an entity they themselves would control. James \nMadison, the Constitution's primary author, explained why in Federalist \n43. The seat of government couldn't be in one of the states, he said, \nbecause of the potential benefits that would accrue to that State, \neither material or in reputation, as a result of that distinction.\n  Moreover, lawmakers themselves should not be dependent on the good \nfavor of any one State or its residents to carry out their business. A \nthird reason, perhaps even more relevant in a time of terrorist \nthreats, is that the District's independence would allow it to relocate \nif need be.\n  So the Framers spelled it out explicitly in the original text. They \nalso explained what they meant. The District of Columbia has been many \nthings: a Federal enclave, a Federal city, even, under President \nJohnson, a Federal agency. But the District of Columbia has never been \na State. And for this reason, according to the Constitution, it does \nnot get congressional representation.\n  This is not a novel interpretation of the text. The historical record \nis full of proof that Congress and the courts have always interpreted \nthe Constitution as denying congressional representation to residents \nof the Federal district. When Congress decided to change the way \nsenators are elected in the early 1900s, they did it the right way, \nthrough the amendment process. And consistent with article 1, section \n2, this amendment understands as eligible for representation only those \nAmericans who reside in a State.\n  Half a century later, in 1961, the 23rd amendment was ratified, \ngranting residents of the District the right to vote in Presidential \nelections. It states:\n\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\n\n       The District constituting the seat of government of the \n     United States shall appoint in such manner as the Congress \n     may direct . . .\n\n  Let me stop right there. The District, you will notice, is referred \nto here yet again not as a State but as, in the words of the amendment, \n``the seat of government.'' It continues:\n\n       A number of electors of President and Vice President equal \n     to the whole number of senators and representatives in \n     Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a \n     state . . .\n\n  The language here could not be more explicit: to which the District \nwould be entitled, meaning of course that it is not entitled, and if it \nwere a State, meaning, or course, that it is not a State.\n  Remember the words of article I, section 2:\n\n       The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members \n     chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.\n\n  This an old debate. It is as old as the Constitution itself. The \nFramers were fully aware of the implications of article I, section 2 \nfor the residents of the Federal district. Indeed, one of its original \nauthors, Alexander Hamilton, tried but failed to include congressional \nrepresentation for residents of the Capital city. The rejection of this \nproposal by the delegates of the Constitutional Convention clearly \nshows they knew what they were denying residents of the Federal city.\n  And again, in the late seventies, Congress passed and the President \nsigned a constitutional amendment giving the District congressional \nrepresentation. After only 16 States ratified it, it failed. Professor \nJonathan Turley of the George Washington Law School gave a valuable \nhistory lesson on this issue to the House Judiciary Committee. I \ncommend to my colleagues his testimony on H.R. 1433 on March 14, 2007.\n  Over the years, many other ideas for securing representation for \nresidents of the District have been proposed. Some have proposed what's \nknown as semi-retrocession, or counting District residents as citizens \nof Maryland for voting purposes. Another idea was full retrocession, \nwhich would simply transfer most of the District to Maryland, just as \nthe western half of the original Federal city was transferred back to \nVirginia before the Civil War. I will let others argue the relative \nmerits of these other remedies. But let me say it again: the remedy we \nare currently considering is no remedy at all, according to \nConstitution. The only way to change the Constitution is to amend it.\n  The process for doing so is clear. We have done it 27 times. Article \nV states:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, \n     or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of \n     the several states, shall call a convention for proposing \n     amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all \n     intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several \n     states . . .\n\n  A two-thirds vote in both Houses, ratified by three-fourths of the \nStates. That is the remedy. That is the method the Framers outlined. \nThat is the one we have used every other time we have needed to amend. \nAny other method to change the Constitution would be, by definition, \nunconstitutional, which is of course out of the question. The only real \nquestion here is whether giving residents of the Federal district the \nright to vote is a constitutional issue at all. If it isn't, we could \nconfer the right by statute, on our own. If it is, we can't. And in my \nview, there's no question in looking at the words, the intent of the \nwriters, and the traditional interpretation of the courts and the \nCongress.\n  I welcome this debate, because it clarifies the meaning of the \nConstitution and our lack of authority to change its meaning on our \nown. If there is a problem, we have a remedy. It may not be the remedy \nwe want. It may not be quick. But it is the remedy we have got. And it \nis proven to be the most durable one over the years. Indeed, if we were \nto vote in favor of this bill today, the constitutional tangle we would \nfind ourselves in would throw every subsequent vote decided by the new \nMembers into serious jeopardy.\n  A Presidential election decided by one or two electoral votes would \nbe nearly impossible to resolve. Better to grant this right on the \nbedrock of an amendment, as we have always done in the past, beyond the \nreach of litigators.\n  If we want to give the residents representation, then we should begin \nthe amendment process. But we cannot, we must not, circumvent the \nConstitution by arrogating powers to ourselves that it does not give us \nitself. To do so would be to undermine the law from which all others in \nthis nation derive, the one Lincoln once referred to as the only \nsafeguard of our liberties.\n  The purpose of the Constitution is to limit, not expand powers. We \nmust always be careful in tampering with that principle. This is the \nwisdom of the amendment process. Despite the clearly good intentions of \nthe authors of this bill, let's not turn away from a principle that has \nserved us well in remedying injustice in the past.\n  The question here is not the end we seek, but the means by which it \nis achieved. And any other means than the one outlined in the \nConstitution would be by definition unconstitutional.\n  Let's do what we have always done and follow the Constitution to \nachieve our good ends. Otherwise, the achievement itself would be \nunconstitutional. And the supreme law cannot be at war with itself.\n  The Framers have spoken, prior congresses have spoken, the citizens \nof the United States have spoken. Now it is time for us, on this \nConstitution Day, to see the text, listen to these voices, and vote, as \nwe have all sworn, ``to support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America.'' Then we will be able to say with Franklin \nthat the Sun, which lights the way for all of our work in this Chamber, \ncontinues even today to rise.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to address two topics quickly, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I first wish to speak to the President's announcement this morning \nthat he is going to ask the Senate to confirm Judge Michael Mukasey as \nthe new Attorney General for the United States. I had an occasion to \nmeet with Judge Mukasey this morning, and I have been reading \nthroughout the last several months a great deal of what he has written, \nparticularly on matters of national security and intelligence \ngathering. I find him to be very thoughtful and a highly qualified \nperson for this position.\n  I simply wish to make the point to my colleagues that I am looking \nforward to this confirmation process, first as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee and then as a matter before the full body.\n  I think my colleagues will find Judge Mukasey not only highly \nqualified, being a graduate of Columbia and Yale Law School, but also \nsomeone who has an extraordinarily fine reputation on the bench and \nbar.\n  After practicing law and serving as a U.S. assistant attorney, Judge \nMukasey, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, served 18 distinguished \nyears on the Federal bench in New York as chief of the New York \ndivision. During that period of time, he acquired a reputation of the \nhighest order, someone who is tough but fair, someone who is highly \nrespected by his peers and the litigants who appeared before him and, \nas I said, who has presided over some of the most difficult and high-\nprofile cases to come before the bench, particularly in matters dealing \nwith terrorism.\n  I am looking forward to the confirmation process. I note that Members \non both sides of the aisle have expressed concern that many of the \npositions in the Attorney General's Office have been vacant. I believe \nnow there\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\nare 9 out of 15 high-level positions in the Department of Justice \nvacant, including the position of Attorney General. It is clear that we \nneed to get the nominee dealt with as soon as possible.\n  The average time for confirming an Attorney General is 3\\1/2\\ weeks, \nand I am hopeful we can use our time wisely to confirm Judge Mukasey \nwithin that period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11541-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the other topic I wish to address is the \nsubject of the week, the Defense authorization bill, and especially as \nit relates to the issue of the current ongoing military activity in \nIraq. I wish to briefly respond to a couple of comments that have been \nsaid recently, particularly comments by General Petraeus and the \nremarks the President made to us last week.\n  It seems to me the President said something very important to all of \nAmerica when he said the success of the surge in Iraq today offers us \nan opportunity to be united as we have not had for some time. There are \npeople who want us to leave as soon as we can from Iraq. There are \npeople who want us to stay and complete the mission. And what the \nPresident said was, regardless of which of these general positions you \nhave supported, there is an opportunity now for us to get together \nbecause the reality is that as long as this mission does continue to \nsucceed, we can withdraw more and more troops which, obviously, we \nwould all wish to do. So I hope as time goes on and this surge \ncontinues to succeed, we will have the opportunity to continue to \nwithdraw American troops.\n  I also wish to respond to a couple of comments made about the mission \nin Iraq because there has been some criticism of the mission and a \nsuggestion that we should change the mission. I wish to make a couple \nof points.\n  First, one thing we do not want to do is change the mission by \nredefining that mission in the Senate based upon what kind of a mission \ncould get 60 votes in the Senate as opposed to what kind of a mission \nmakes sense militarily on the ground. Yet one of our colleagues has \neven made that point, saying that the mission should be defined to \nwhatever will get 60 votes. That is the wrong thing to do.\n  The mission should be to secure Iraq, to have a stable country that \ncan be on our side in the war against terror, that has a chance to do \nwhat the civilian government there needs to do, and to be secure enough \nto enable us to withdraw our troops so Iraqi troops can take over. That \nis the mission.\n  As the security is being established there, the mission can gradually \nevolve less to providing security, as that is turned over to Iraqi \ntroops, and more to the continuation of the training of Iraqi troops \nand focusing on the mission of getting al-Qaida. That clearly is our \nNo. 1 goal there.\n  But for those who say we can do that with a severely diminished \nnumber of troops, General Petraeus himself commented on that point and \nsaid you need the combination of troops that we have there today and in \nfairly large numbers to perform the counterterrorism mission; that it \nis not simply something you can say we are going to change the mission \nto one of counterterrorism only and expect you can perform that with \njust special operations troops.\n  As he said:\n\n       To do counterterrorism requires conventional as well as all \n     types of special operations forces, and intelligence, \n     surveillance and reconnaissance assets. If the goal is to \n     take away sanctuary from al-Qaeda, Gen. Petraeus said, ``that \n     is something that is not just done by counterterrorist forces \n     per se but . . . by conventional forces as well.''\n\n  The point is, those who talk about redefining the mission should be \nunder no illusion that can be done with a different mix of forces than \nwe have right now. It is one of the reasons we are being successful \nagainst al-Qaida because we do have the kind of full conventional \nforces at our disposal that enables us to succeed in that effort.\n\n  It will be very dangerous, indeed, for the Senate to define a \ndifferent mission based on how many votes it could get in the Senate \nrather than what is necessary on the ground, or, No. 2, to restrict the \nkind of troops that are available to perform that mission to those that \nwould not succeed. As General Petraeus has pointed out, we need the \nkind of troops we have there today in order to succeed in the mission \nwe have there.\n  Finally, the whole question of whether we are going to be in Iraq for \na long time, there are some who criticize the prospect of a \nrelationship between the Iraqi Government and the United States \nGovernment, as the President discussed in his speech. But the reality \nis, as he pointed out, the Iraqi leaders have asked for that \nrelationship, and it should be one that we actually support. We need to \nhave a good, strong relationship with another country in the Middle \nEast, a country that can be on our side in the war against the \nterrorists, that refuses to give sanctuary to the terrorists, and can \nbe a buffer against a nuclear-armed Iran, a fastidious Syria, and \nothers in the region, and whose interests are identical to ours.\n  This is one reason why it bothers me not in the least that Iraqi \nleaders would ask to us have an enduring, ongoing relation even after \nwe have pulled out many of our troops, to the point that we may have \ntroops in Iraq for a long time. We have had troops in Germany now for \nover 60 years, and we have had troops in Korea for over 50 years. There \nmay be a point in having U.S. troops in the region and even in the \ncountry of Iraq.\n  Our hope--and I am sure this is shared by all of us on both sides of \nthe aisle in this body--is that as the troop surge continues to \nsucceed, we can draw down the number of those troops to a point that it \nis not a strain on the U.S. military and the danger to the troops there \nis greatly diminished. Clearly, this is the way we seek to resolve our \ninvolvement in Iraq.\n  I hope the President's message, that this offers us an opportunity to \nbe united rather than divided, in fact, comes to pass, because not only \nwould that benefit the people of Iraq, it would help sustain our \nnational security interests and help to bring our country together \npolitically over this most difficult issue as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11541-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1585, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2008 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Nelson of Nebraska (for Levin) amendment No. 2011, in the \n     nature of a substitute.\n       Levin amendment No. 2087 (to amendment No. 2011), to \n     provide for a reduction and transition of United States \n     forces in Iraq.\n       Reed amendment No. 2088 (to amendment No. 2087), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Dodd (for Levin) amendment No. 2274 (to the language \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 2011), to provide \n     for a reduction and transition of United States forces in \n     Iraq.\n       Levin amendment No. 2275 (to amendment No. 2274), to \n     provide for a reduction and transition of United States \n     forces in Iraq.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today returns to \nthe consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 2008. This bill contains important benefits for our men and women \nin uniform, including pay raises, targeted bonuses and special pays, \nand benefits. It also includes funding and authorities needed to \nprovide our troops the equipment and support they will need.\n  Prompt Senate action on this bill will send an important message. \nRegardless of our position on the war in Iraq, we all support our men \nand women in uniform. The bill was approved by the Armed Services \nCommittee on a unanimous 25-to-0 vote, and it is my hope it will \nreceive a similarly strong endorsement from the full Senate.\n  We have a lot of hard work ahead of us before that can happen. As of \ntoday,\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\nmore than 300 amendments have been filed. We are working hard to clear \nas many of these amendments as possible, but some amendments will \ninevitably require votes. Where that is the case, I hope my colleagues \nwill work with us to develop appropriate time agreements that protect \nthe interests of everybody involved while expediting consideration of \nthe bill.\n  Congress has enacted a Defense Authorization Act every year for more \nthan 40 years. I hope we will build on that record and show our strong \nsupport for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines by working \ntogether to pass this bill.\n  On a procedural note, I understand the President signed the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2007 into law on Friday. In \naccordance with the new rules, I am placing into the Record a \ncertification that each congressionally directed item in this bill and \nthe accompanying report has been identified through lists identifying \nthe names of the Senator or Senators requesting the item and that this \ninformation has been available on the committee's Web site for more \nthan 48 hours.\n  In addition, the committee is in the process of collecting a \ncertification from each such Senator that neither the Senator nor the \nSenator's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the item, and, \nagain, that is consistent with the requirements of the Senate rules \nnow. In accordance with the requirements of the new rules, we will make \nthese certifications available for public inspection on our Web site as \nsoon as practicable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy certification of compliance with the requirements of the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Certification of Compliance With the Requirements of the Honest \n               Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007\n\n                                               September 17, 2007.\n       I hereby certify that--\n       (1) each congressionally directed spending item, limited \n     tax benefit, and limited tariff benefit, if any, in the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, as \n     reported by the Committee on Armed Services, has been \n     identified through lists, charts, or other similar means \n     including the name of each Senator who submitted a request to \n     the committee for each item so identified; and\n       (2) the information described in paragraph (1) has been \n     available on the website of the Committee on Armed Services \n     in a searchable format for more than 48 hours.\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are open to amendments. If Senators want \nto come to the floor now and offer amendments, it will be required we \nset aside a pending amendment. We are hoping to get unanimous consent \nto do that. We expect we will be able to get unanimous consent to do \nthat. So Senators who have amendments, if they will come to the floor \nand discuss and describe their amendments, we will be able to hopefully \nmake some progress, and then at a later time this afternoon hopefully \nmake those amendments in order by a unanimous consent agreement to \nwithdraw the pending second-degree amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2022\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize it is not possible, because \nagreement has not yet been reached, to set aside the pending \nlegislation to bring up the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act as an \namendment. As the managers of the bill are not on the floor, I \ncertainly will not take advantage of that and do it. So let me speak \nabout it.\n  I now am speaking on the National Defense Authorization Act. At an \nappropriate time, I will bring up amendment No. 2022. I will tell you \nwhy I will do this.\n  Last year, Congress committed an historic mistake by suspending the \nGreat Writ of habeas corpus--not just for those confined at Guantanamo \nBay but for millions of legal residents in the United States. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee's hearing in May on this bill illustrated \nthe broad agreement among representatives from diverse political \nbeliefs and backgrounds that the mistake committed in the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 must be corrected. The Habeas Corpus \nRestoration Act of 2007, S.185, the bill on which this amendment is \nbased, has 30 cosponsors. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported it on \na bipartisan basis. I hope Senators will review the committee report on \nthis measure.\n  Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last year's Military \nCommissions Act. Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World \nWar II, the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear, \nand it was a stain on America's reputation in the world. This is a time \nof testing. Future generations will look back to examine the choices we \nmade during a time when security was too often invoked as a watchword \nto convince us to slacken our defense of liberty and the rule of law.\n  The Great Writ of habeas corpus is the legal process that guarantees \nan opportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of power by the \nGovernment. The Military Commissions Act rolled back these protections \nby eliminating that right, permanently, for any noncitizen labeled an \nenemy combatant. In fact, a detainee does not have to be found to be an \nenemy combatant; it is enough for the Government to say someone is \n``awaiting'' determination of that status--something detainees cannot \neven contest when they are held in jail.\n  The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond the few hundred \ndetainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay, and it includes an \nestimated 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States \ntoday. These are people who work and pay taxes, people who abide by our \nlaws and should be entitled to fair treatment. It is, after all, the \nAmerican way. It is what we brag about when we go to their countries. \nBut under this law, any of these people can be detained, forever, \nwithout any ability to challenge their detention in court.\n  This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American.\n  Top conservative thinkers, evangelical activists, and prominent \nmembers of the Latino community have all spoken out on the need to \nrestore these basic American rights. GEN Colin Powell, like many \nleading former military and diplomatic officials, has spoken of the \nimportance of these habeas rights. He asked, ``Isn't that what our \nsystem's all about?''\n  Perhaps most powerful for me was the testimony of RADM Donald Guter, \nwho was working in his office in the Pentagon as Judge Advocate General \nof the Navy on September 11, 2001, and saw firsthand the effects of \nterrorism. His credibility is unimpeachable when he says that denying \nhabeas rights to detainees endangers our troops and undermines our \nmilitary efforts.\n  Admiral Guter testified:\n\n       As we limit the rights of human beings, even those of the \n     enemy, we become more like the enemy. That makes us weaker \n     and imperils our valiant troops, serving not just in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, but around the globe.\n\n  He was right. Whether you are an individual soldier, or a great \nnation, it is difficult to defend the higher ground by taking the lower \nroad. The world knows what our enemies stand for. The world also knows \nwhat this country has tried to stand for and live up to in--the best of \ntimes, and the worst of times.\n  Now, as we work to reauthorize the many programs that compose our \nvaliant armed forces, it is the right time to heed the advice of so \nmany of our top military lawyers who tell us that eliminating basic \nlegal rights undermines our fighting men and women; it does not make \nthem stronger.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Specter and acknowledge his strong \nand consistent leadership on this issue. Senator Specter and I came to \nthis\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\nfloor to offer this amendment back on July 10, when this bill was \ninitially being considered, and thereafter. I hope all Senators will \nnow join with us in restoring basic American values and the rule of \nlaw, while making our Nation stronger.\n  It is from strength that America should defend our values and our way \nof life. It is from the strength of our freedoms, our Constitution, and \nthe rule of law that we shall prevail. I hope all in the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, will join us in standing up for a stronger \nAmerica, for the America we believe in, and support the Habeas Corpus \nRestoration Act of 2007.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2174, as Modified; 2175; 2168; 2108; 2015; 2050; 2120; \n2056; 2147; 2047; 2117; 2190; 2199; 2203; 2201; 2200; 2112; 2099; 2212; \n  2222; 2230, as Modified; 2234, as Modified; 2272; 2220; 2276; 2257; \n2281; 2250; 2254; 2268; 2292; 2305; 2216; 2309; 2308; 2310; 2617; 2313; \n 2863; 2282; 2210; 2291; 2096; 2315; 2176; 2326; 2263; 2294; 2277, as \n                Modified; and 2862 to Amendment No. 2011\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send a series of amendments to the desk \nwhich have been cleared by myself and Senator Warner. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate consider those amendments en bloc, the \namendments be agreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid \non the table. Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have any statements \nrelating to any of these individual amendments printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection. As a matter of fact, we have worked out in \na very satisfactory way each of these amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

We are \n     working on this, but I believe that the threat is outrunning \n     our response.''.\n       (4) Existing programs intended to secure, monitor, and \n     reduce nuclear stockpiles, redirect nuclear scientists, and \n     interdict nuclear smuggling have made substantial progress, \n     but additional efforts are needed to reduce the threat of \n     nuclear terrorism as much as possible.\n       (5) Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has \n     said that a nuclear terror attack ``would not only cause \n     widespread death and destruction, but would stagger the world \n     economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire \n     poverty''.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) \n     reaffirms the need to combat by all means, in accordance with \n     the Charter of the United Nations, threats to international \n     peace and security caused by terrorist acts, and directs all \n     countries, in accordance with their national procedures, to \n     adopt and enforce effective laws that prohibit any non-state \n     actor from manufacturing, acquiring, possessing, developing, \n     transporting, transferring, or using nuclear, chemical, or \n     biological weapons and their means of delivery, in particular \n     for terrorist purposes, and to prohibit attempts to engage in \n     any of the foregoing activities, participate in them as an \n     accomplice, or assist or finance them.\n       (7) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei, has said that it is a ``race \n     against time'' to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear \n     weapon.\n       (8) The International Atomic Energy Agency plays a vital \n     role in coordinating efforts to protect nuclear materials and \n     to combat nuclear smuggling.\n       (9) Legislation sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar, Senator \n     Pete Domenici, and former Senator Sam Nunn has resulted in \n     groundbreaking programs to secure nuclear weapons and \n     materials and to help ensure that such weapons and materials \n     do not fall into the hands of terrorists.\n\n     SEC. 3133. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR \n                   TERRORISM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should make the prevention of a nuclear \n     terrorist attack on the United States of the highest \n     priority;\n       (2) the President should accelerate programs, requesting \n     additional funding as appropriate, to prevent nuclear \n     terrorism, including combating nuclear smuggling, securing \n     and accounting for nuclear weapons, and eliminating, \n     removing, or securing and accounting for formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material wherever such \n     quantities may be;\n       (3) the United States, together with the international \n     community, should take a comprehensive approach to reducing \n     the danger of nuclear terrorism, including by making \n     additional efforts to identify and eliminate terrorist groups \n     that aim to acquire nuclear weapons, to ensure that nuclear \n     weapons worldwide are secure and accounted for and that \n     formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material \n     worldwide are eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted \n     for to a degree sufficient to defeat the threat that \n     terrorists and criminals have shown they can pose, and to \n     increase the ability to find and stop terrorist efforts to \n     manufacture nuclear explosives or to transport nuclear \n     explosives and materials anywhere in the world;\n       (4) within such a comprehensive approach, a high priority \n     must be placed on ensuring that all nuclear weapons worldwide \n     are secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities \n     of strategic special nuclear material worldwide are \n     eliminated, removed, or secure and accounted for; and\n       (5) the International Atomic Energy Agency should be funded \n     appropriately to fulfill its role in coordinating \n     international efforts to protect nuclear material and to \n     combat nuclear smuggling.\n\n     SEC. 3134. MINIMUM SECURITY STANDARD FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND \n                   FORMULA QUANTITIES OF STRATEGIC SPECIAL NUCLEAR \n                   MATERIAL.\n\n       (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to work \n     with the international community to take all possible steps \n     to ensure that all nuclear weapons around the world are \n     secure and accounted for and that all formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material are eliminated, removed, \n     or secure and accounted for to a level sufficient to defeat \n     the threats posed by terrorists and criminals.\n       (b) International Nuclear Security Standard.--In \n     furtherance of the policy described in subsection (a), and \n     consistent with the requirement for ``appropriate effective'' \n     physical protection contained in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1540 (2004), as well as the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and the Convention on the Physical \n     Protection of Nuclear Material, the President, in \n     consultation with relevant Federal departments and agencies, \n     shall seek the broadest possible international agreement on a \n     global standard for nuclear security that--\n       (1) ensures that nuclear weapons and formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material are secure and accounted \n     for to a sufficient level to defeat the threats posed by \n     terrorists and criminals;\n       (2) takes into account the limitations of equipment and \n     human performance; and\n       (3) includes steps to provide confidence that the needed \n     measures have in fact been implemented.\n       (c) International Efforts.--In furtherance of the policy \n     described in subsection (a), the President, in consultation \n     with relevant Federal departments and agencies, shall--\n       (1) work with other countries and the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency to assist as appropriate, and if necessary, \n     work to convince, the governments of any and all countries in \n     possession of nuclear weapons or formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material to ensure that security is \n     upgraded to meet the standard described in subsection (b) as \n     rapidly as possible and in a manner that--\n       (A) accounts for the nature of the terrorist and criminal \n     threat in each such country; and\n       (B) ensures that any measures to which the United States \n     and any such country agree are sustained after United States \n     and other international assistance ends;\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\n       (2) ensure that United States financial and technical \n     assistance is available as appropriate to countries for which \n     the provision of such assistance would accelerate the \n     implementation of, or improve the effectiveness of, such \n     security upgrades; and\n       (3) work with the governments of other countries to ensure \n     that effective nuclear security rules, accompanied by \n     effective regulation and enforcement, are put in place to \n     govern all nuclear weapons and formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material around the world.\n\n     SEC. 3135. ANNUAL REPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than September 1 of each year, \n     the President, in consultation with relevant Federal \n     departments and agencies, shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the security of nuclear weapons, formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material, radiological materials, \n     and related equipment worldwide.\n       (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) A section on the programs for the security and \n     accounting of nuclear weapons and the elimination, removal, \n     and security and accounting of formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material and radiological \n     materials, established under section 3132(b) of the Ronald W. \n     Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2005 (50 U.S.C. 2569(b)), which shall include the following:\n       (A) A survey of the facilities and sites worldwide that \n     contain nuclear weapons or related equipment, formula \n     quantities of strategic special nuclear material, or \n     radiological materials.\n       (B) A list of such facilities and sites determined to be of \n     the highest priority for security and accounting of nuclear \n     weapons and related equipment, or the elimination, removal, \n     or security and accounting of formula quantities of strategic \n     special nuclear material and radiological materials, taking \n     into account risk of theft from such facilities and sites, \n     and organized by level of priority.\n       (C) A prioritized diplomatic and technical plan, including \n     measurable milestones, metrics, estimated timetables, and \n     estimated costs of implementation, on the following:\n       (i) The security and accounting of nuclear weapons and \n     related equipment and the elimination, removal, or security \n     and accounting of formula quantities of strategic special \n     nuclear material and radiological materials at such \n     facilities and sites worldwide.\n       (ii) Ensuring that security upgrades and accounting reforms \n     implemented at such facilities and sites worldwide using the \n     financial and technical assistance of the United States are \n     effectively sustained after such assistance ends.\n       (iii) The role that international agencies and the \n     international community have committed to play, together with \n     a plan for securing contributions.\n       (D) An assessment of the progress made in implementing the \n     plan described in subparagraph (C), including a description \n     of the efforts of foreign governments to secure and account \n     for nuclear weapons and related equipment and to eliminate, \n     remove, or secure and account for formula quantities of \n     strategic special nuclear material and radiological \n     materials.\n       (2) A section on efforts to establish and implement the \n     international nuclear security standard described in section \n     3134(b) and related policies.\n       (c) Form.--The report may be submitted in classified form \n     but shall include a detailed unclassified summary.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2230, as modified\n\n       Strike section 1215 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1215. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF \n                   THAILAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Thailand is an important strategic ally and economic \n     partner of the United States.\n       (2) The United States strongly supports the prompt \n     restoration of democratic rule in Thailand.\n       (3) While it is in the interest of the United States to \n     have a robust defense relationship with Thailand, it is \n     appropriate that the United States has curtailed certain \n     military-to-military cooperation and assistance programs \n     until democratic rule has been restored in Thailand.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Thailand should continue on the path to restore \n     democratic rule as quickly as possible, and should hold free \n     and fair national elections as soon as possible and no later \n     than December 2007; and\n       (2) once Thailand has fully reestablished democratic rule, \n     it will be both possible and desirable for the United States \n     to reinstate a full program of military assistance to the \n     Government of Thailand, including programs such as \n     International Military Education and Training (IMET) and \n     Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that were appropriately \n     suspended following the military coup in Thailand in \n     September 2006.\n       (c) Limitation.--No funds authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act may be obligated or expended to provide direct \n     assistance to the Government of Thailand to initiate new \n     military assistance activities until 15 days after the \n     Secretary of Defense notifies the Committees on Armed \n     Services and Foreign Relations of the Senate and the \n     Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs of the House \n     of Representatives of the intent of the Secretary to carry \n     out such new types of military assistance activities with \n     Thailand.\n       (d) Exception.--The limitation in subsection (c) shall not \n     apply with respect to funds as follows:\n       (1) Amounts authorized to be appropriated for Overseas \n     Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid.\n       (2) Amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated by this \n     Act and available for humanitarian or emergency assistance \n     for other nations.\n       (e) New Military Assistance Activities Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``new military assistance activities'' \n     means military assistance activities that have not been \n     undertaken between the United States and Thailand during \n     fiscal year 2007.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2234, as modified\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title III, the following:\n\n     SEC. 358.

The policy also outlines a strategy \n     for meeting those requirements along with metrics for \n     measuring progress.\n       (2) On September 13, 2006, the Department of Defense hosted \n     a biobased product showcase and educational event which \n     underscores the importance and seriousness with which the \n     Department is implementing its green procurement program.\n       (3) On January 24, 2007, President Bush signed Executive \n     Order 13423: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and \n     Transportation Management, which contains the requirement \n     that Federal agencies procure biobased and environmentally \n     preferable products and services.\n       (4) Although the Department of Defense continues to work to \n     become a leading advocate of green procurement, there is \n     concern that there is not a procurement application or \n     process in place at the Department that supports compliance \n     analysis.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Department of Defense should establish a system to \n     document and track the use of environmentally preferable \n     products and services.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report on its plan to increase the usage of \n     environmentally friendly products that minimize potential \n     impacts to human health and the environment at all Department \n     of Defense facilities inside and outside the United States, \n     including through the direct purchase of products and the \n     purchase of products by facility maintenance contractors.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2257\n\n     (Purpose: To provide that the study on the national security \ninteragency system shall focus on improving interagency cooperation in \n    post-conflict contingency relief and reconstruction operations)\n\n         At the end of section 1043, insert the following:\n       (f) Focus on Improving Interagency Cooperation in Post-\n     Conflict Contingency Relief and Reconstruction Operations.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) The interagency coordination and integration of the \n     United States Government for the planning and execution of \n     overseas post-conflict contingency relief and reconstruction \n     operations requires reform.\n       (B) Recent operations, most notably in Iraq, lacked the \n     necessary consistent and effective interagency coordination \n     and integration in planning and execution.\n       (C) Although the unique circumstances associated with the \n     Iraq reconstruction effort are partly responsible for this \n     weak coordination, existing structural weaknesses within the \n     planning and execution processes for such operations indicate \n     that the problems encountered in the Iraq program could recur \n     in future operations unless action is taken to reform and \n     improve interdepartmental integration in planning and \n     execution.\n       (D) The agencies involved in the Iraq program have \n     attempted to adapt to the relentless demands of the \n     reconstruction effort, but more substantive and permanent \n     reforms are required for the United States Government to be \n     optimally prepared for future operations.\n       (E) The fresh body of evidence developed from the Iraq \n     relief and reconstruction experience provides a good basis \n     and timely opportunity to pursue meaningful improvements \n     within and among the departments charged with managing the \n     planning and execution of such operations.\n       (F) The success achieved in departmental integration of \n     overseas conflict management through the Goldwater-Nichols \n     Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Public Law \n     99-433; 100 Stat. 992) provides precedent for Congress to \n     consider legislation designed to promote increased \n     cooperation and integration among the primary Federal \n     departments and agencies charged with managing post-conflict \n     contingency reconstruction and relief operations.\n       (2) Inclusion in study.--The study conducted under \n     subsection (a) shall include the following elements:\n       (A) A synthesis of past studies evaluating the successes \n     and failures of previous interagency efforts at planning and \n     executing post-conflict contingency relief and reconstruction \n     operations, including relief and reconstruction operations in \n     Iraq.\n       (B) An analysis of the division of duties, \n     responsibilities, and functions among executive branch \n     agencies for such operations and recommendations for \n     administrative and regulatory changes to enhance integration.\n       (C) Recommendations for legislation that would improve \n     interagency cooperation and integration and the efficiency of \n     the United States Government in the planning and execution of \n     such operations.\n       (D) Recommendations for improvements in congressional, \n     executive, and other oversight structures and procedures that \n     would enhance accountability within such operations.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2281\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the control of the brown tree snake)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 314. REPORT ON CONTROL OF THE BROWN TREE SNAKE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), an invasive \n     species, is found in significant numbers on military \n     installations and in other areas on Guam, and constitutes a \n     serious threat to the ecology of Guam.\n       (2) If introduced into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States, \n     the brown tree snake would pose an immediate and serious \n     economic and ecological threat.\n       (3) The most probable vector for the introduction of the \n     brown tree snake into Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United States is \n     the movement from Guam of military aircraft, personnel, and \n     cargo, including the household goods of military personnel.\n       (4) It is probable that the movement of military aircraft, \n     personnel, and cargo, including the household goods of \n     military personnel, from Guam to Hawaii, the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands, or the continental United \n     States will increase significantly coincident with the \n     increase in the number of military units and personnel \n     stationed on Guam,\n       (5) Current policies, programs, procedures, and dedicated \n     resources of the Department of Defense and of other \n     departments and agencies of the United States may not be \n     sufficient to adequately address the increasing threat of the \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report on the \n     following:\n       (1) The actions currently being taken (including the \n     resources being made available) by the Department of Defense \n     to control, and to develop new or existing techniques to \n     control, the brown tree snake on Guam and to ensure that the \n     brown tree snake is not introduced into Hawaii, the \n     Commonwealth of\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\n     the Northern Mariana Island, or the continental United States \n     as a result of the movement from Guam of military aircraft, \n     personnel, and cargo, including the household goods of \n     military personnel.\n       (2) Current plans for enhanced future actions, policies, \n     and procedures and increased levels of resources in order to \n     ensure that the projected increase of military personnel \n     stationed on Guam does not increase the threat of \n     introduction of the brown tree snake from Guam into Hawaii, \n     the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the \n     continental United States.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2250\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a review of licensed mental health counselors, \n social workers, and marriage and family therapists under the TRICARE \n                                program)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 703.

The assessment shall examine requirements in \n     the areas of education, training, examination, continuing \n     education, and ethical standards, and shall include an \n     evaluation of the extent to which States, through their scope \n     of practice, either implicitly or explicitly authorize \n     members of such profession to diagnose and treat mental \n     illnesses.\n       (3) An analysis of the requirements for clinical experience \n     in such profession to be recognized under regulations for the \n     TRICARE program, and recommendations, if any, for \n     standardization or adjustment of such requirements with those \n     of the other professions.\n       (4) An assessment of the extent to which practitioners \n     under such profession are authorized to practice \n     independently under other Federal programs (such as the \n     Medicare program, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \n     Indian Health Service, Head Start, and the Federal Employee \n     Health Benefits Program), and a review the relationship, if \n     any, between recognition of such profession under the \n     Medicare program and independent practice authority for such \n     profession under the TRICARE program.\n       (5) An assessment of the extent to which practitioners \n     under such profession are authorized to practice \n     independently under private insurance plans. The assessment \n     shall identify the States having laws requiring private \n     insurers to cover, or offer coverage of, the services of \n     members of such profession, and shall identify the \n     conditions, if any, that are placed on coverage of \n     practitioners under such profession by insurance plans and \n     how frequently these types of conditions are used by \n     insurers.\n       (6) An historical review of the regulations issued by the \n     Department of Defense regarding which members of such \n     profession are recognized as providers under the TRICARE \n     program as independent practitioners, and an examination of \n     the recognition by the Department of third party \n     certification for members of such profession.\n       (c) Providers Studied.--It the sense of Congress that the \n     study required by subsection (a) should focus only on those \n     practitioners of each health care profession referred to in \n     subsection (a)(1) who are permitted to practice under \n     regulations for the TRICARE program as specified in section \n     119.6 of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (d) Clinical Capabilities Studies.--The study required by \n     subsection (a) shall include a review of outcome studies and \n     of the literature regarding the comparative quality and \n     effectiveness of care provided by practitioners within each \n     of the health care professions referred to in subsection \n     (a)(1), and provide an independent review of the findings.\n       (e) Recommendations for TRICARE Independent Practice \n     Authority.--The recommendations provided under subsection \n     (a)(2) shall include specific recommendation (whether \n     positive or negative) regarding modifications of current \n     policy for the TRICARE program with respect to allowing \n     members of each of the health care professions referred to in \n     subsection (a)(1) to practice independently under the TRICARE \n     program, including recommendations regarding possible \n     revision of requirements for recognition of practitioners \n     under each such profession.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report on the review required by subsection \n     (a).\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2254\n\n (Purpose: To require a Department of Defense Inspector General report \n      on physical security of Department of Defense installations)\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 358.

CONTINUITY OF DEPOT OPERATIONS TO RESET COMBAT \n                   EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES IN SUPPORT OF WARS IN \n                   IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Armed Forces, particularly the Army \n     and the Marine Corps, are currently engaged in a tremendous \n     effort to reset equipment that was damaged and worn in combat \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (2) The implementing guidance from the Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics related to \n     the decisions of the 2005 Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission (BRAC) to transfer depot functions \n     appears not to differentiate between external supply \n     functions and in-process storage functions related to the \n     performance of depot maintenance.\n       (3) Given the fact that up to 80 percent of the parts \n     involved in the vehicle reset process are reclaimed and \n     refurbished, the transfer of this inherently internal depot \n     maintenance function to the Defense Logistics Agency could \n     severely disrupt production throughput, generate increased \n     costs, and negatively impact Army and Marine Corps equipment \n     reset efforts.\n       (4) The goal of the Department of Defense, the Defense \n     Logistics Agency, and the 2005 Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission is the reengineering of businesses \n     processes in order to achieve higher efficiency and cost \n     savings.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than June 1, 2008, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the challenges of implementing the \n     transfer of depot functions and the impacts on production, \n     including parts reclamation and refurbishment.\n       (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     describe--\n       (A) the sufficiency of the business plan to transfer depot \n     functions to accommodate a timely and efficient transfer \n     without the disruption of depot production;\n       (B) a description of the completeness of the business plan \n     in addressing part reclamation and refurbishment;\n       (C) the estimated cost of the implementation and what \n     savings are likely be achieved;\n       (D) the impact of the transfer on the Defense Logistics \n     Agency and depot hourly rates due to the loss of budgetary \n     control of the depot commander over overtime pay for in-\n     process parts supply personnel, and any other relevant rate-\n     related factors;\n       (E) the number of personnel positions affected;\n       (F) the sufficiency of the business plan to ensure the \n     responsiveness and availability of Defense Logistics supply \n     personnel to meet depot throughput needs, including potential \n     impact on depot turnaround time; and\n       (G) the impact of Defense Logistics personnel being outside \n     the chain of command of the depot commander in terms of \n     overtime scheduling and meeting surge requirements.\n       (3) Government accountability office assessment.--Not later \n     than September 30, 2008, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall review the report submitted under \n     paragraph (1) and submit to the congressional defense \n     committees an independent assessment of the matters addressed \n     in such report, as requested by the Chairman of the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the House of Representatives.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2305\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on counternarcotics assistance for the \n                          Government of Haiti)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1012.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ACTIONS \n                   TO ADDRESS ENCROACHMENT OF MILITARY \n                   INSTALLATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--In light of the initial report of the \n     Department of Defense submitted pursuant to section 2684a(g) \n     of title 10, United States Code, and of the RAND Corporation \n     report entitled ``The Thin Green Line: An Assessment of DoD's \n     Readiness and Environmental Protection Initiative to Buffer \n     Installation Encroachment'', Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Development and loss of habitat in the vicinity of, or \n     in areas ecologically related to, military installations, \n     ranges, and airspace pose a continuing and significant threat \n     to the readiness of the Armed Forces.\n       (2) The Range Sustainability Program (RSP) of the \n     Department of Defense, and in particular the Readiness and \n     Environmental Protection Initiative (REPI) involving \n     agreements pursuant to section 2684a of title 10, United \n     States Code, have been effective in addressing this threat to \n     readiness with regard to a number of important installations, \n     ranges, and airspace.\n       (3) The opportunities to take effective action to protect \n     installations, ranges, and airspace from encroachment is in \n     many cases transient, and delay in taking action will result \n     in either higher costs or permanent loss of the opportunity \n     effectively to address encroachment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Department of Defense should--\n       (1) develop additional policy guidance on the further \n     implementation of the Range and Environmental Protection \n     Initiative (REPI), to include additional emphasis on \n     protecting biodiversity and on further refining procedures;\n       (2) give greater emphasis to effective cooperation and \n     collaboration on matters of mutual concern with other Federal \n     agencies charged with managing Federal land;\n       (3) ensure that each military department takes full \n     advantage of the authorities provided by section 2684a of \n     title 10, United States Code, in addressing encroachment \n     adversely affecting, or threatening to adversely affect, the \n     installations, ranges, and military airspace of the \n     department;

Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, \n     the Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, \n     the Medical College of Georgia, and local health care \n     providers under the TRICARE program.\n       (2) Medical staff from the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army \n     Medical Center and the Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center have been meeting weekly to discuss future \n     patient cases for the Active Duty Rehabilitation Unit (ADRU) \n     within the Uptown Department of Veterans Affairs facility. \n     The Active Duty Rehabilitation Unit, along with the \n     Polytrauma Centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     provide rehabilitation for members of the Armed Forces on \n     active duty.\n       (3) Since 2004, 1,037 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \n     marines have received rehabilitation services at the Active \n     Duty Rehabilitation Unit, 32 percent of whom served in \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n       (4) The Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center and the \n     Augusta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center have \n     combined their neurosurgery programs and have coordinated on \n     critical brain injury and psychiatric care.\n       (5) The Department of Defense, the Army, and the Army \n     Medical Command have recognized the need for expanded \n     behavioral health care services for members of the Armed \n     Forces returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom. These services are currently being provided \n     by the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Department of Defense should encourage continuing \n     collaboration between the Army and the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs in treating America's wounded warriors and, when \n     appropriate and available, provide additional support and \n     resources for the development of such collaborations, \n     including the current collaboration between the Active Duty \n     Rehabilitation Unit at the Augusta Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center, Georgia, and the behavioral health \n     care services program at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army \n     Medical Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 2282\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a National Guard yellow ribbon reintegration \n                                program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 683.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the \npackage of amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                          Admendment No. 2268\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are engaged in one of the longest \nconflicts in American history, and the need for qualified nurses in \nmilitary medical facilities is increasing. Tragic stories of injured \nveterans returning from war and heart-wrenching images on television \nremind us that the military needs qualified nurses. Unfortunately, the \nmilitary faces the same difficulty recruiting and retaining nurses that \ncivilian medical facilities are facing.\n  Neither the Army nor the Air Force has met nurse recruitment goals \nsince the 1990s. In 2004, the Navy Nurse Corps fell 32 percent below \nits recruitment target, while the Air Force missed its nurse \nrecruitment target by 30 percent. At a Senate appropriations hearing \nearlier this year, Nurse Corps leaders pointed to a serious shortage of \nmilitary nurses. The Army, Navy, and Air Force each have a 10-percent \nshortage of nurses, with shortages reaching nearly 40 percent in some \ncritical specialties.\n  Civilian hospitals face similar challenges. According to the American \nCollege of Healthcare Executives, 72 percent of hospitals experienced a \nnursing shortage in 2004. The shortage is growing. The U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services, HHS, found that in 2000 this country was \n110,000 nurses short of the number, both civilian and\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nmilitary, necessary to adequately provide quality health care. By 2005, \nthe shortage had doubled to 219,000. By 2020, we will be more than 1 \nmillion nurses short of what we need for quality health care. This will \ncreate a problem for military health care as well as the Nation at \nlarge.\n  To avoid the vast shortage HHS is projecting, we have to improve the \nnumber of nurses graduating and entering the workforce each year. If we \nonly were to replace the nurses who are retiring, we would need to \nincrease student enrollment at nursing schools by 40 percent. But the \nbaseline demand for nurses, however, continues to rise, while the \nsupply falls. If we increased the number of graduates from nursing \nschool by 90 percent by 2020, we would still fall short of the number \nneeded for quality care.\n  One of the major factors contributing to the nursing shortage is the \nshortage of teachers at schools of nursing. Last year, nursing colleges \nacross the Nation denied admission to over 40,000 qualified applicants \nbecause there were not enough faculty members to teach the students. \nLast year, approximately 2,000 qualified student applicants were \nrejected from Illinois nursing schools because there were not enough \nteachers.\n  And the shortage does not discriminate between rural or urban areas, \ncity or countryside, large or small schools. For example, in 2006, the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, consistently recognized as one of \nthe top ten nursing programs in the United States, was sixth in total \nNIH research and research training dollars, and in 2004, it was ranked \neighth out of 142 schools of nursing by U.S. News & World Report. \nHowever, despite the nationwide prestige, the school turned away more \nthan 500 qualified applicants last year. Northern Illinois University, \na smaller school in DeKalb, IL, was forced to reject 233 qualified \napplicants as a result of a shortage of teachers and financial \nresources.\n  The American Association of Colleges of Nursing surveyed more than \n400 schools of nursing last year. Seventy-one percent of the schools \nreported vacancies on their faculty. An additional 15 percent said they \nwere fully staffed but still needed more faculty to handle the number \nof students who want to be trained.\n  Statistics paint a bleak picture for the availability of nursing \nfaculty now and into the future. The median age of a doctorally \nprepared nursing faculty member is 52 years old. The average age of \nretirement for faculty at schools of nursing is 62.5 years. It is \nexpected that 200 to 300 doctorally prepared faculty will be eligible \nfor retirement each year from 2005 through 2012 , drastically reducing \nthe number of available faculty--even though more than 1 million \nreplacement nurses will be needed. The military recruits nurses from \nthe same source as doctors and hospitals: civilian nursing schools. \nUnless we address the lack of faculty, the shortage of nurses will only \nworsen.\n  In 1994, the Department of Defense established a program called \nTroops to Teachers, which serves the dual purpose of helping relieve \nthe shortages of math, science, and special education teachers in high-\npoverty schools while assisting military personnel in making successful \ntransitions to second careers in teaching. As of January 2004, more \nthan 6,000 former soldiers have been hired as teachers through the \nTroops to Teachers Program, and an additional 6,700 are now qualified \nteachers and looking for placements.\n  My amendment will set up a pilot program called Troops to Nurse \nTeachers to make it easier for military nurses, retiring nurses, or \nthose leaving the military to pursue a career teaching the future nurse \nworkforce. I am proud to have the support of my colleagues: Senators \nInouye, Inhofe, Obama, Menendez, Biden, Mikulski, Dole, Reed, \nLieberman, and Collins. I thank the leadership of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Chairman Levin, Senator Warner, for their support \nand willingness to accept the amendment.\n  The Troops to Nurse Teachers Program seeks to address the nursing \nshortage in the different branches of the military while tapping into \nthe existing wealth of knowledge and expertise of military nurses to \nhelp address the nationwide shortage of nurses.\n  The goals of the Troops to Nurse Teachers program are two fold. \nFirst, the program intends to increase the number of nurse faculty \nmembers so nursing schools can expand enrollment and alleviate the \nongoing shortage both in the civilian and military sectors. Second, the \nTroops to Nurse Teachers Program is meant to help military personnel \nmake successful transitions to second careers in teaching, similar to \nTroops to Teachers. The program would achieve these goals by offering \nincentives to nurses transi-\ntioning from the military to become full-time nurse faculty members, \nwhile providing the military a new recruitment tool and advertising \nagent.\n  The Troops to Nurse Teachers Program will provide transitional \nassistance for servicemembers who already hold a master's or Ph.D. in \nnursing or a related field and are qualified to teach. Eligible \nservicemembers can receive career placement assistance, transitional \nstipends, and educational training from accredited schools of nursing \nto expedite their transition. Troops to Nurse Teachers will also \nestablish a pilot scholarship program for officers of the Armed Forces \nwho have been involved in nursing during their military service to help \nthem obtain the education needed to become nurse educators. Tuition, \nstipends, and financing for other educational expenses would be \nprovided. Recipients of scholarships must commit to teaching at an \naccredited school of nursing for 3 years in exchange for the \neducational support they receive.\n  In addition, the Troops to Nurse Teachers Program will provide active \nmilitary nurses the opportunity to complete a 2-year tour of duty at a \ncivilian nursing school to train the next generation of nurses. In \nexchange, the nurse officer will commit to additional time in the \nmilitary or the College of Nursing will provide scholarships for \nnursing students that commit to enlisting in the military.\n  We have the support of over 20 nursing organizations, including the \nfollowing: American Association of Colleges of Nursing, American \nOrganization of Nurse Executives, American Nurses Association, Academy \nof Medical-Surgical Nurses, American Academy of Ambulatory Care \nNursing, American College of Nurse Practitioners, American Association \nof Nurse Anesthetists, American Health Care Association, American \nSociety of PeriAnesthesia Nurses, Association of Women's Health, \nObstetric, and Neonatal Nurses, American Association of Occupational \nHealth Nurses, Inc., American Radiological Nurses Association, \nAssociation of Perioperative Registered Nurses, Emergency Nurses \nAssociation, National Black Nurses Association, National Council of \nState Boards of Nursing, National Gerontological Nursing Association, \nNational League for Nursing, National Nursing Centers Consortium, \nNational Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties, Oncology Nursing \nSociety, Society of Urologic Nurses & Associates.\n  In addition, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, both Personnel \nand Recruitment and Health Affairs, are in support of the amendment. We \nhave also worked hard to secure the support and incorporate important \nfeedback from the Nurse Corps of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and \nAir Force.\n  We must increase the number of teachers preparing tomorrow's nursing \nworkforce. With the aging of the baby boom generation and the long-term \nneeds of our growing number of wounded veterans, the military and \ncivilian health care systems will need qualified nurses more than ever. \nThe Troops to Nurse Teachers Program will help to alleviate the \nshortage of nurse faculty and ultimately help make more nurses \navailable for both civilian and military medical facilities.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2087, 2088, 2274, and 2275 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that we do have \nthese two first-degree amendments side by side for purposes of the \ndebate, and at this time there are no time agreements.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Leahy has already debated this \namendment. I assume he would want to debate this further, but that \nwould, of course, be up to him. But this was the amendment Senator \nLeahy was debating earlier this afternoon. Now that it is pending, it \nis open to debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have discussed this with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, who is here on the floor for purposes of that debate. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and Senator Warner. Let \nme read a portion of a letter from the Department of Justice first, and \nI will include it for the Record at the conclusion of its reading. This \nletter is addressed to Chairman Pat Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. \nIt begins by saying--it is dated June 6 of this year.\n\n       This letter presents the views of the Department of Justice \n     on S. 185, the ``Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007,'' as \n     introduced in the U.S. Senate. If enacted, S. 185 would \n     remove the habeas corpus restrictions included in the \n     ``Military Commissions Act of 2006.''\n\n  After a full and open debate, a bipartisan majority of Congress \npassed the MCA just last fall. The MCA's restrictions on habeas corpus \ncodified important and constitutional limits on captured enemies' \naccess to our courts. The DC Circuit upheld MCA's habeas restrictions \nin--the name of the case is Boumediene v. Bush--I will omit the \ncitation--decided in 2007.\n\n       The provision of S. 185 that seeks to remove these \n     important limits ignores their history and their role in \n     protecting our Nation's security. As the Supreme Court \n     recognized in Johnson v. Eisentrager, a 1950 case, the \n     extension of habeas corpus to alien combatants captured \n     abroad ``would hamper the war effort and bring aid and \n     comfort to the enemy,'' and the Constitution requires no such \n     thing. The United States already provides alien enemy \n     combatants detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with an \n     unprecedented degree of process, which includes judicial \n     review of decisions regarding their detention before the \n     Federal appeals court in Washington, DC. Repealing the MCA's \n     limitations on habeas would simply burden our courts with \n     duplicative and unnecessary litigation. For this reason, and \n     because repeal of the MCA's habeas provisions would delay and \n     disrupt the vital work of bringing enemy combatants to \n     justice, the President's senior advisors would recommend that \n     he veto S. 185 if the bill is presented to him for signature.\n\n  There is more of the letter, but I will submit it for the Record at \nthis point.\n  I note that the amendment offered by Senator Leahy is virtually the \nsame, if not the same, as the bill introduced. I am presuming that the \nPresident's senior advisers would, as a result, also recommend a veto \nof the bill if it included this provision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   June 6, 2007.  \n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the \n     Department of Justice on S. 185, the ``Habeas Corpus \n     Restoration Act of 2007,'' as introduced in the United States \n     Senate. If enacted, S. 185 would remove the habeas corpus \n     restrictions included in the ``Military Commissions Act of \n     2006'' (``MCA'').\n       After a full and open debate, a bipartisan majority of \n     Congress passed the MCA just last fall. The MCA's \n     restrictions on habeas corpus codified important and \n     constitutional limits on captured enemies' access to our \n     courts. The D.C. Circuit upheld the MCA's habeas restrictions \n     in Boumediene v. Bush, 476 F.3d 981 (D.C. Cir. 2007), cert. \n     denied, 127 S. Ct. 1478 (2007). The provision of S. 185 that \n     seeks to remove these important limits ignores their history \n     and their role in protecting our Nation's security. As the \n     Supreme Court recognized in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. \n     763 (1950), the extension of habeas corpus to alien \n     combatants captured abroad ``would hamper the war effort and \n     bring aid and comfort to the enemy,'' id. at 779, and the \n     Constitution requires no such thing, see id. at 780-81. The \n     United States already provides alien enemy combatants \n     detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with an unprecedented \n     degree of process, which includes judicial review of \n     decisions regarding their detention before the Federal \n     appeals court in Washington, D.C. Repealing the MCA's \n     limitations on habeas would simply burden our courts with \n     duplicative and unnecessary litigation. For this reason, and \n     because repeal of the MCA's habeas provisions would delay and \n     disrupt the vital work of bringing enemy combatants to \n     justice, the President's senior advisors would recommend that \n     he veto S. 185 if the bill is presented to him for signature.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. If we may be \n     of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. \n     The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that there \n     is no objection to this letter from the perspective of the \n     Administration's program and that enactment of S. 185 would \n     not be in accord with the President's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n  Mr. KYL. Now, the Defense authorization bill is extraordinarily \nimportant to our troops. To add a totally extraneous provision amending \na different bill to the Defense authorization bill, especially one \nwhich carries the suggestion of a Presidential veto, would be the \nheight of irresponsibility on the part of the Senate. The substantive \narguments of the Department of Justice with respect to habeas are \ncorrect, and the Senate should not, therefore, seek to amend another \nstatute in the Defense authorization bill, thus inviting a veto of the \nbill.\n  Related to the habeas corpus provision is the amendment that is now \npending offered by Senator Graham of\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\nSouth Carolina. That amendment would strike a provision of the Defense \nauthorization bill--section 1023--that also relates to the subject of \ntreatment of detainees. Unfortunately, the way the committee bill was \nwritten, the bill that is before us right now, if we retain that \nlanguage and we don't strike it, as the Graham amendment would do, we \nwould essentially be returning to a law enforcement approach to \nterrorists that, frankly, failed us before 9/11 and obviously does not \nwork in the post-9/11 context. We can't deal with all of the enemy \ncombatants as criminal defendants. These people who are picked up on \nthe battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan cannot be dealt with in the \nsame way as criminal defendants in our court system. Senator Graham's \namendment would strike these harmful provisions of the bill.\n  I wish to begin by reminding my colleagues of the evil nature of \nthese terrorists and then go through the three particular parts of this \nprovision that require removal.\n  First, a requirement that al-Qaida terrorists held in Iraq and \nAfghanistan be given lawyers--I mean, just imagine that; second, the \nauthorization to demand discovery and compel testimony from \nservicemembers; and third, the requirement that al-Qaida and Taliban \ndetainees be provided access to classified evidence. To state these \nthree provisions of the bill is to recognize immediately why it is so \nharmful that they be included in this bill and why they need to be \nstricken, but focus for just a moment on the people we are talking \nabout held at Guantanamo Bay and picked up in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  At least 30 of the detainees released already from Guantanamo Bay \nhave since returned to waging war against the United States and our \nallies. Of course, the provisions of section 21 are all designed to \neffectuate the release of some of these prisoners--some of these \ndetainees. So 30 have already been released because we no longer deemed \nthem to be a threat to the United States or our forces, but after their \nrelease, 12 of the released detainees have been killed in battle by \nU.S. forces or--well, by U.S. forces; others have been captured. In \nother words, we released them, they went right back to the battlefield, \n12 of them have been killed in battle, others have been recaptured, 2 \nreleased detainees became regional commanders for Taliban forces, and 1 \nattacked U.S. and allies' soldiers in Afghanistan, killing 3 Afghan \nsoldiers.\n  One released detainee killed an Afghan judge. One released detainee \nled a terrorist attack on a hotel in Pakistan and a kidnapping raid \nthat resulted in the death of a Chinese civilian, and this former \ndetainee recently told Pakistani journalists that he planned to ``fight \nAmerica and its allies until the very end.''\n  Even under the procedures today, which give due process to these \ndetainees and allow them to be released if we can no longer demonstrate \nthey are a threat to U.S. forces--even under these provisions, at least \n30 of the detainees have gone right back to the battlefield and are \nattacking us and our forces.\n  The provisions of section 1023 would make it very difficult, if not \nimpossible, for the United States to detain committed terrorists such \nas this, people who have been captured while waging war against us. No \nnation in the history of armed conflict has imposed the kinds of limits \nthis bill would impose on its ability to detain enemy war prisoners. \nWar prisoners released in the middle of an ongoing conflict, such as \nmembers of al-Qaida, will return to waging war. That is the whole point \nof prisoners of war. In the war you capture people and hold them so \nthey cannot return to the battlefield to kill your troops. We have \nalready seen this happen 30 times with the detainees released from \nGuantanamo, as I said.\n  If section 1023 were to be enacted, we could expect more civilians \nand Afghans and Iraqis will be killed, and it may be inevitable that \neven our own soldiers will be killed by such released terrorists. This \nis a price our Nation should not be forced to bear.\n  I mentioned three specific general problems with section 1023. The \nfirst has to do with a requirement of the bill that al-Qaida terrorists \nwho are held in Iraq and Afghanistan must be provided with lawyers. I \ncannot imagine that the details of this were known to the members of \nthe committee when they put it into the bill. This could never be \nexecuted. It would require the release of the detainees; either they \nget lawyers or they have to be released. And here is why. The Defense \nbill requires that counsel be provided and trials be conducted for all \nunlawful enemy combatants held by the United States, including, for \nexample, al-Qaida members captured and detained in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, if they are held for 2 years. We hold approximately 800 \nprisoners in Afghanistan and tens of thousands in Iraq. None are lawful \ncombatants; all would arguably be entitled to a lawyer and a trial \nunder this bill. This procedure would at least require a military \njudge, a prosecutor, and a defense attorney, as well as other legal \nprofessionals.\n  This scheme is totally unrealistic. The entire Army JAG Corps only \nconsists of about 1,500 officers, and each is busy with their current \nduties. Moreover, under the bill, each detainee would be permitted to \nretain private or volunteer counsel. Our agreements with the Iraqi \nGovernment bar the United States from transferring Iraqi detainees out \nof Iraq. As a result, the bill would require the United States to \ntrain, transport, house, and protect potentially thousands, or tens of \nthousands, of private lawyers in the middle of a war zone during \nongoing hostilities. That is impossible.\n  Think about this in the context of other conflicts, not just in Iraq \nor Afghanistan. In the context of World War II, anybody hearing this \nwould think it is nuts. But the bill before us literally requires us to \nprovide attorneys to these captured detainees in Iraq--tens of \nthousands of them. This proposal would likely force the United States \nto release thousands of these enemy combatants in Iraq, as I said, \nbecause there is no way you could provide all of the lawyers to them. \nObviously, that would further jeopardize our military. By requiring a \ntrial for each detainee, this provision would also require U.S. \nsoldiers to offer statements to criminal investigators, needing later \nto prove their case after they captured someone. In other words, unlike \ntoday, when you are on the battlefield and you capture somebody and you \nhold them because they are a threat, but you are not putting them on \ntrial, now you are going to put them on trial and you have to have the \nkind of evidence that would stand up in court. You have watched the TV \nshows with the clever defense lawyers. You know about, ``I object, Your \nHonor; that is not relevant,'' or ``that is hearsay.'' On the \nbattlefield, who walks around with lawyers making sure Miranda rights \nare read and evidence is collected and statements are taken that will \nhold up in court when they are later tried? And they would need to \ncarry evidence kits and cameras, means of identifying the person later \non. Two years after you capture someone, the defense lawyer could say: \nIs that the person you captured? And if he says, ``Well, those guys all \nkind of looked alike to me when they were shooting at me, so I cannot \nbe sure,'' well, the case will get thrown out of court. Or was there a \nchain of custody of the evidence? You would have to do that with the \nevidence taken on the battlefield or it would be thrown out in court. \nThey would need to spend hours after each trial writing after-action \nreports, which would need to be reviewed by commanders. Valuable time, \nin other words, would be taken from combat operations and soldiers' \nrest whenever they capture somebody on the battlefield.\n  A horrible precedent would be set for the future. Aside from the war \nin Iraq, this provision would make fighting a major war in the future \nsimply impossible. In World War II, we detained over 2 million enemy \nprisoners of war. It would have been impossible for the United States \nto have conducted a trial and provided counsel to 2 million captured \nenemy combatants. The bottom line, with respect to this provision, \nsection 1023, the requirement of counsel for these detainees held in \nIraq and Afghanistan, is that it would be impossible to implement. It \nis patently absurd and, as a result, it should be stricken.\n  The second point is authorizing al-Qaida detainees to demand \ndiscovery and compel testimony from American soldiers. I alluded to \nthat a second ago. The underlying bill would actually authorize \nunlawful enemy combatants, including al-Qaida detainees in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, to demand discovery\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\nand compel testimony from witnesses, just as we do in our criminal \ncourts in the United States. These witnesses would all be the U.S. \nsoldiers who captured the prisoner. Under the bill, an American soldier \ncould literally be recalled from his unit at the whim of an al-Qaida \nterrorist in order to be cross-examined by him, or his lawyer, or a \njudge.\n\n  Newspaper columnist Stuart Taylor describes the questions such a \nright would raise:\n\n       Should a Marine sergeant be pulled out of combat in \n     Afghanistan to testify at a detention hearing about when, \n     where, how, and why he had captured the detainee? What if the \n     northern alliance or some other ally made the capture? Should \n     the military be ordered to deliver high-level al-Qaida \n     prisoners to be cross-examined by other detainees and their \n     lawyers?\n\n  It goes on and on. The questions abound. As the Supreme Court itself \nobserved in Johnson v. Eisenstrager, which is the law on this subject:\n\n       It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering \n     of a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is \n     ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his \n     own civil court and divert his efforts and attention from the \n     military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.\n\n  This is the U.S. Supreme Court talking not long after World War II, \nwhen a question similar to this arose, and a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt says it ``would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering \nof a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to \nreduce to submission to call him into account in his own civil court \nand divert his efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad \nto the legal defensive at home.''\n  It would be difficult to conceive of a process that would be more \ninsulting to our soldiers.\n  In addition, many al-Qaida members captured in Afghanistan were \ncaptured by special operators whose identities are kept secret for \nobvious reasons. This would force them to reveal themselves to al-Qaida \nmembers and expose themselves, or simply forgo the prosecution of the \nindividual, which is obviously more likely to happen. You simply could \nnot do all of this, so you would have to forgo the prosecution and \nrelease the prisoner.\n  Clearly, Americans should not be subject to subpoena by al-Qaida. \nThink about that. That brings me to the last point--the requirement \nthat al-Qaida and Taliban detainees be provided with access to \nclassified evidence. You would have to give the enemy your classified \nevidence, the sources and methods of your intelligence operations, in \norder to prosecute them, which is what would be required by the bill.\n  Here is the exact language. The bill requires that detainees be \nprovided with ``a sufficiently specific substitute of classified \nevidence'' and that detainees' private lawyers be given access to all \nrelevant classified evidence.\n  When this bill was brought up in the Senate, some Members questioned \nwhether this bill requires us to share classified information with al-\nQaida detainees and their lawyers. I will direct this to specific pages \nand lines of the bill to show what it does.\n  On page 305, lines 16 through 21, the bill expressly provides that \n``the detainee'' must be provided--I am quoting now--access to a \n``sufficiently specific'' summary of ``the classified evidence that is \nsubmitted against the detainee.'' This language appears to mirror the \nClassified Information Procedures Act rules that apply to the use of \nclassified information in Federal courts. Like CIPA, these procedures \ngive a detainee a right to the substance of classified evidence. The \nGovernment might be able to redact some names or other information, but \nonly if it still gives the detainee the substance of the evidence. And \nif the United States is not willing to compromise the evidence in this \nway, it cannot use the evidence.\n  Similarly, at page 305, line 5, the bill expressly requires that \nunder its provisions, ``counsel for the detainee is provided access to \nthe relevant classified evidence.'' I don't know how you can be any \nmore specific than that. His lawyer gets to see relevant classified \nevidence.\n  Foreign and domestic intelligence agencies are already very hesitant \nto divulge classified evidence to the CSRT hearings we already conduct. \nThese are part of the internal and nonadversarial military process \ntoday. Intelligence agencies will inevitably refuse to provide \nsensitive evidence to detainees and their lawyers. They will not risk \ncompromising such information for the sake of detaining one individual \nterrorist.\n  In addition, the United States already has tenuous relations with \nsome of the foreign governments, particularly in the Middle East, that \nhave been our best sources of information about groups such as al-\nQaida. If we give detainees a legal right to access such information, \nthese foreign governments would simply, I presume, shut off all further \nsupply of information to the United States. Why would they do \notherwise? They don't want to expose their own sources, compromise \ntheir evidence, or expose even the fact that they have cooperated with \nthe United States. By exposing our cooperation with these governments, \nthe bill perversely applies a sort of ``stop snitching'' policy toward \nour Middle Eastern allies, which is likely to be as ruthlessly \neffective as when applied to criminal street gangs to potential \nwitnesses to a crime in the United States.\n  Some of our best information is gained from foreign intelligence \nservices who, like us, are trying to find out everything they can about \nthese terrorists. Once they know we have to turn the information they \ngave us over to the terrorists, they are going to stop cooperating with \nus.\n\n  The argument I presented--that sharing classified evidence with al-\nQaida detainees and their lawyers would badly damage America's efforts \nin the war with al-Qaida--was recently reinforced by several \ndeclarations that were recently introduced in the ongoing Bismullah \nlitigation. These declarations were filed by the Director of National \nIntelligence, the Director of the CIA, and by the Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, our three top intelligence agencies. \nTogether, these statements confirm that sharing classified information \nwith detainees and their lawyers would not only inevitably lead to \nleaks of sensitive information, but that it would violate American \nintelligence agencies' agreements with foreign governments and with \nconfidential human sources--violations that would inevitably undermine \nthese organizations and individuals' willingness to cooperate with the \nUnited States in the future.\n  The final point is that we already know, from hard experience, that \nproviding classified and other sensitive information to al-Qaida \nmembers is a bad idea. During the 1995 Federal prosecution in New York \nof the ``blind sheikh,'' Omar Rahman, prosecutors turned over the names \nof 200 unindicted coconspirators to the defense. They were required to \ndo so under the civilian criminal justice system of discovery rules, \nwhich require that large amounts of evidence be turned over to the \ndefense. The judge warned the defense that the information could only \nbe used to prepare for trial and not for other purposes. Nevertheless, \nwithin 10 days of being turned over to the defense, the information \nfound its way to Sudan and into the hands of Osama bin Laden. As the \ndistrict judge who presided over the case said, ``That list was in \ndowntown Khartoum within 10 days, and bin Laden was aware within 10 \ndays that the Government was on his trail.''\n  That is what happens when you provide classified information in this \ncontext.\n  In another case tried in the civilian criminal justice system, \ntestimony about the use of cell phones tipped off terrorists as to how \nthe Government was monitoring their networks. According to the judge, \n``There was a piece of innocuous testimony about the delivery of a \nbattery for a cell phone.'' This testimony alerted terrorists to the \nGovernment surveillance and, as a result, their communication network \nshut down within days and intelligence was lost to the Government \nforever--intelligence that might have prevented who knows what.\n\n  This particular section of the bill, 1023, repeats the mistakes of \nthe past. Treating the war with al-Qaida similar to a criminal justice \ninvestigation would force the United States to choose between \ncompromising information that could be used to prevent further \nterrorist attacks on one hand and on the other letting captured \nterrorists go free. As I said before, this is not a choice our Nation \nshould be required to make.\n  Let me read a couple of the quotations I alluded to earlier from the\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, GEN Michael Hayden, \nrelative to the damage that would be caused by requiring this \nclassified information to be turned over to the defendant or his \nlawyers:\n\n       . . . [M]uch of the information that is potentially \n     discoverable was provided to the CIA by foreign intelligence \n     services or discloses the specific assistance provided by the \n     CIA's global partners in the global war on terror. If the CIA \n     is compelled to comply with the Court's decision, the CIA \n     will be obligated to inform its foreign liaison partners that \n     a court order requires that the CIA provide this information \n     to the Court and detainee counsel. There is a high \n     probability that certainly liaison services will decrease \n     their cooperation with the CIA because of the extent that \n     their information has become enmeshed in U.S. legal \n     proceedings. . . .\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       [S]ome information discoverable under the Court's decision \n     originated with, or pertains to, clandestine human \n     intelligence sources. These individuals provide information \n     or assistance to the CIA only upon the condition of absolute \n     and lasting secrecy. Revealing this information--even to the \n     Court or to cleared counsel--would expressly violate these \n     agreements, and would irreparably harm the CIA's ability to \n     utilize current sources and to recruit sources in the future. \n     . . .\n\n  Let me read one other comment from General Hayden, the Director of \nthe CIA:\n\n        . . . With over 300 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, it \n     appears that compliance with the Court's decision will \n     require disclosure to several hundred--perhaps more than one \n     thousand--private attorneys who are not employees of the U.S. \n     Government and who are not trained in handling classified \n     information. With so many untrained individuals allowed \n     access to such sensitive information, I believe that \n     unauthorized disclosures, even if inadvertent, are not only \n     probable, but inevitable. The regulations controlling access \n     to classified information recognize that limiting the number \n     of people with access is a necessary step in safeguarding \n     sensitive information. The Court's decision would eviscerate \n     the U.S. Government's carefully conceived plan to keep its \n     most highly sensitive information compartmentalized and would \n     increase the likelihood of public disclosure.\n\n  I quote a comment from Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, in his affidavit to the court in the case I \nmentioned:\n\n       Disseminating human source information could reasonably \n     lead to the disclosure of their identities because often the \n     information provided by human sources is singular in nature.\n\n  In other words, he is the only person who knows about it, so when the \ninformation is divulged, then the other side knows exactly where it \ncame from.\n  Back to Director Mueller:\n\n       The disclosure of singular information could endanger the \n     life of the source or his/her family or friends, or cause the \n     source to suffer physical or economic harm or ostracism \n     within the community. These consequences, and the inability \n     of the FBI to protect the identities of its human sources, \n     would make it exceptionally more difficult for the FBI and \n     other U.S. intelligence agencies to recruit human sources in \n     the future.\n\n  These are the kinds of irreparable harm that would result if the \nlanguage of section 1023 remains in the bill. Not my words, but \nDirector Mueller of the FBI, General Hayden, the Director of the CIA, \nand now I quote from the Director of National Intelligence, Michael \nMcConnell. Admiral McConnell had this to say:\n\n        . . . [T]he Intelligence Community has many sources of \n     information that must be protected. For example, much of the \n     information at issue was provided by foreign intelligence \n     services or would reveal the specific assistance provided by \n     foreign partners in the global war on terror. Certain liaison \n     services will likely decrease their cooperation with the U.S. \n     Government if their information is caught up in U.S. court \n     proceedings.\n\n  One final comment.\n\n        . . . Human sources also provide the Intelligence \n     Community with critical information, but only upon the \n     condition of absolute secrecy. Revealing this information \n     would violate the sources of confidentiality we provide these \n     sources and would likely result in their minimizing or \n     ceasing altogether their cooperation. Such a disclosure would \n     harm the Intelligence Community's ability to retain current \n     sources and recruit new ones, and if we cannot recruit and \n     retain sources, the Intelligence Community simply cannot \n     conduct its business.\n\n  That is the point of Senator Graham's amendment to strike these \nprovisions from the bill. They would irreparably harm our intelligence \ncollection capability, which is the first defense against these \nterrorists. That is why the Graham amendment striking section 1023 \nshould be adopted.\n  We have already bent over backward to provide the detainees at \nGuantanamo the ability to contest their detention and to have their \ndetention reviewed and eventually even have it reviewed in the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and before that the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This is a very fair system, more fair than has ever been provided by \nany other nation in any other circumstance and more than our \nConstitution requires. So we are treating the people we capture in a \nvery fair way.\n  What we cannot do is to take those same kinds of protections and \napply them anywhere we capture someone in the foreign theater. And as I \nsaid before, never in the history of warfare have they been subjected \nto the criminal justice system of our country. To take that system and \ntry to transport it to the fields of Afghanistan and Iraq would \nobviously not only be breaking precedent but is a horrible idea for all \nthe reasons I indicated.\n  I ask my colleagues to give careful attention to the dangerous return \nto the pre-9/11 notion that these terrorists are, after all, only \ncommon criminals and we have to treat them that way. They have made no \nsecret that they are actually at war with us, and we ignore this point \nat our peril.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Statement of Administration Policy on \nthis bill says the President will be advised to veto the bill if \nsection 1023 remains in the bill and refer again to a similar statement \nfrom the Department of Justice with respect to the habeas corpus \nprovisions that would be added to the bill in the amendment of Senator \nLeahy.\n  I hope my colleagues will take all of this information into account \nwhen they consider voting on these amendments in this very important \nDefense authorization bill which we need to pass and the President will \nwant to sign so we can do what is necessary to support our troops whom \nwe have sent into harm's way.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Graham amendment to strike \nsection 1023 and not to support the additional habeas corpus rights to \nterrorists who attack our troops.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first, I want to commend Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner for their leadership on this legislation. It is not news \nthat they do a good job. They do it consistently year in and year out. \nThis may be one of the last Defense authorization bills in which \nSenator Warner is involved, having made his announcement about his \ndecision to retire from the Senate. He has another year, next year, on \nthe Defense authorization bill. I already sense the notion of missing \nhim here. While he is not in the Chamber this evening, I commend \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin for the fine work they do year in and \nyear out on this very important issue.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Specter-\nLeahy-Dodd amendment to restore the writ of habeas corpus for \nindividuals held in U.S. custody. I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of this amendment and a cosponsor of the underlying bill from \nwhich it draws its strength, S. 185, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act, \nalso introduced by Senators Specter and Leahy.\n  For over 700 years, the legal system has recognized the importance of \nhabeas corpus, the right of an individual to question the legality of \nhis or her detention.\n  The Military Commissions Act is perhaps the most disappointing and \ndangerous piece of legislation passed in the more than quarter-century \nI have been a Member of this body. Among its many troublesome \nprovisions, the act eliminated habeas corpus for those individuals held \nby our Government as enemy combatants. By stripping these individuals \nof the right to petition the Government, we have undermined our \nNation's longstanding commitment to the rule of law and human rights. \nAdvocates of this provision argued that stripping away this fundamental \nright was necessary to protect our Nation's security. That is totally \nfalse, in my view. We can both effectively prosecute terrorists and \nremain true to our values. In fact, if we do otherwise, I strongly \nsuggest that we jeopardize our security.\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\n  I stand on the floor of the Senate seeking to undo what Congress did \nlast year when it summarily stripped habeas corpus rights with the \nenactment of the Military Commissions Act. Were our Founding Fathers \nalive today, I believe they would be seriously dismayed to realize how \nfar our country has strayed from the values enshrined in our \nConstitution with the adoption of this measure.\n  Stripping of habeas corpus rights is just one of a number of \negregious provisions included in the Military Commissions Act. That is \nwhy earlier this year I introduced S. 576, the Restoring the \nConstitution Act, to address these errors.\n  In addition to restoring habeas corpus rights, S. 576 would also \nrequire the United States to live up to its Geneva Convention \nobligations, provide detainees access to attorneys for trials, make \ninadmissible trial evidence gained through torture or coercion, empower \nmilitary judges to exclude hearsay evidence they deem to be unreliable, \nand provide for the expedited judicial review of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 to determine the constitutionality of all of \nits provisions.\n  The Restoring the Constitution Act would undo the most damaging and \nunconstitutional aspects of the Military Commissions Act while \nproviding the U.S. military a greater ability to bring our enemies to \njustice through military commissions.\n  I take a back seat to no one when it comes to defending our Nation's \nsecurity. Let me be clear, I believe military commissions in very \nlimited circumstances may be very effective in bringing combatants to \njustice. However, I see no reason why procedures based on the well-\nestablished, Uniform Military Code of Justice should be abandoned.\n  But there is a right way and a wrong way to win the fight we are in. \nProcedures that adhere to immediate bedrock legal principles, such as \nhabeas corpus, abide by the Geneva Conventions, and exclude hearsay \nevidence or evidence obtained through torture, to name but a few, do \nnot make us weaker. Quite the contrary. They demonstrate that no \nterrorist can destroy our way of life and our fundamental values that \nhave guided our Nation for over two centuries.\n  During the debate on the Military Commissions Act last year, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Leahy, and I offered an amendment that would have \nretained the writ of habeas corpus. Unfortunately, our amendment was \nrejected by this body.\n  On September 28, 2006, I voted against the Military Commissions Act. \nSadly, I was in the minority in doing so. I was and remain deeply \ndisappointed that the Senate passed this misguided legislation. That \nday was a dark day in the history of this body. On that day, we \nabandoned our commitment not only to human rights, but also to the rule \nof law, commitments that separate us from our enemies, commitments that \nhave been fundamental to American leadership since the end of World War \nII.\n  This issue has special resonance with me because of my father, Thomas \nDodd, who sat in this very body at this very desk, as a member of the \nSenate from Connecticut. Years before, in 1945 and 1946, before \nbecoming a Member of Congress, my father was a prosecutor working \nalongside Justice Robert Jackson at the Nuremberg war crimes trials in \nGermany. There the United States demonstrated to the world its profound \ncommitment to the rule of law, due process, and human rights. Many of \nour allies did not see the need for trials for Nazis held by allied \nforces. Indeed, many of them called for summary executions. The Soviet \nUnion wanted a show trial and then to shoot the defendants at \nNuremberg. Winston Churchill, the former British Prime Minister, also \nadvocated summary execution for the defendants at Nuremberg.\n  The United States, Judge Robert Jackson, Henry Stimson, the \nRepublican Secretary of War under Franklin Roosevelt, Ben Rosen, Robert \nJackson and my father argued, that, no, we were different. The United \nStates was going to demonstrate to the world that civility and the rule \nof law was what was at stake in the war with Germany and Japan and that \nwe would not succumb to the same kind of treatment they gave to their \nvictims.\n  The opening statement made by Robert Jackson at Nuremberg, a \nstatement which I put to memory a long time ago, indicates the \ndifference we brought to this issue. Robert Jackson, speaking of the \nSoviet Union, the British, the French, and the United States, said on \nthat occasion:\n\n       That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung \n     with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit \n     their captive enemies to the judgment of the rule of law is \n     one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid \n     to reason.\n\n  Instead, we gave the Nazis--members of the world's most barbaric \nregime--the protections and the rights of the rule of law.\n  The Nuremberg trials not only brought many of the Nazi war criminals \nto justice--most were executed--but helped to demonstrate to the world \nthe importance of providing even the most heinous of criminals the \nprotections of the rule of law. Doing so makes our Nation incalculably \nstronger, not weaker at all.\n  But I fear Congress has allowed the President to diminish our \nNation's commitment to human rights and the rule of law. We have failed \nto stand up for our most cherished values. We let fear--the fear of \nbeing seen as weak--override our duty to protect the Constitution and \nthe values of our Nation.\n  It is not too late to right the wrong of last year. We will have that \nopportunity in the next day or so. While I am hopeful the Federal \ncourts will strike down many of the provisions of the Military \nCommissions Act, I believe a decision earlier this year by the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia demonstrates the need for \nthe amendment before us today by Senators Leahy, Specter, myself, and \nothers.\n  On February 20, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia upheld the provisions of the Military Commissions Act \neliminating the writ of habeas corpus for enemy combatants. Despite two \nrecent Supreme Court decisions suggesting that habeas rights cannot \nlegislatively be stripped away, the split decision by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia underlines the need for this body \nto proactively act now to unambiguously restore habeas rights.\n  For more than 60 years, the United States has helped to lead the \nworld through its commitment to human rights, democracy, and the rule \nof law. Last year, our Nation lost the moral high ground. This year, \nCongress must reassert to the Nation, the President, and the courts \nthat we recognize the vital role of habeas corpus in our legal system.\n  I believe the Specter-Leahy-Dodd amendment is the first step in \nundoing the terrible damage the Military Commissions Act has done to \nour legal system and our international reputation. I implore my \ncolleagues to begin today to undo the harm done to our Nation's \nreputation by voting to restore habeas rights, which have always been a \ncore element of our jurisprudence, and once again restore the moral \nauthority we captured more than 60 years ago at a place called \nNuremberg. This generation bears no less a responsibility to protect \nthose basic rights that are the foundation of our great Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I was absent from the floor when my \ndistinguished colleague was thoughtful enough to make a few comments \nabout his old friend, but it is deeply appreciated, and I thank my dear \ncolleague very much. We have done many things together, and I have more \nto go.\n  Mr. DODD. You bet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I, too, wanted to echo the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut. I am sure Senator Warner will \nbe recognized many times between now and the time he finally takes his \nlast vote in this Chamber, and as he pointed out, he has a long way to \ngo before that time comes over the course of the next several months. \nBut so many of us respect what he has done over the years as ranking \nmember and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and his work will, \nin fact, be greatly recognized.\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\n  Madam President, I wish to make one quick point in response to what \nthe Senator from Connecticut pointed out, recalling his very famous \nfather, somebody who served in this body and served our Nation well in \nother capacities, including at Nuremberg, and his friend, Justice \nJackson, the same Justice Jackson whom I quoted.\n  The Senator wasn't on the floor, but I quoted Justice Jackson in the \nEisentrager case to point out that nothing could fetter our commanders \nmore than to require habeas corpus rights for the German prisoners of \nwar or the prisoners who were at issue in the Johnson v. Eisentrager \ncase. Justice Jackson himself recognized that the procedures that were \nawarded to the 50-some war criminals at Nuremberg were not the same \nkinds of procedures that were being sought in the Eisentrager case. And \nthe habeas corpus rights that would be granted under the Leahy \namendment are far different from the rights that were granted to the \nNuremberg war crimes defendants.\n  I think one question that would be interesting to ask of the \nproponents of the legislation is, if we simply took the rights that \nwere granted to the war criminals tried at Nuremberg and gave those \nrights to the detainees at issue here, would that be a satisfactory \nresult? I suspect the answer would be no because they are nowhere near \nthe rights that would be included in the amendment that is pending.\n  So to cite Justice Jackson is to refer back to what he said in \nEisentrager and recognize that nothing, according to him--and I agree--\nwould more fetter our commanders and our troops than granting habeas \nrights to prisoners or enemy detainees.\n  Madam President, I might make one further point. I am trying to \nrecall how many defendants there were at Nuremberg. My recollection of \nthe number tried for war crimes is that there were approximately 50. I \nmay be off by a few on that number, but I think my point would still \nremain, which is that it is one thing to try 50 war criminals out of \nover 2 million POWs, and it is quite another to grant all 2 million the \nrights of war criminals. We have tried some of the detainees as the \nequivalent of war criminals in our courts--Padilla is one of them--but \nthat is not to say we should hold the same criminal trials for all of \nthe tens of thousands of detainees being held in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I will yield, yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had the distinct pleasure of visiting Carrollton, AL, \nin Pickens County, where they have a museum to maintain the history of \na large German prisoner of war camp in the United States. The Senator \nmentioned that certain legal rights were accorded 50 or so prisoners. \nBut those were prisoners tried in Nuremberg after the war--after the \nwar--for war crimes.\n  Now, is the Senator aware of any instance in either the German camps \nor other prisoners who may have been held in the United States during \nwartime being provided habeas rights?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is a great question, and the answer is \nthat there have never been, in the history of the world, habeas rights \ngranted to enemy detainees or prisoners of war in order to challenge \nthe fact of their detention by either the United States or by the other \ncountry from which the great writ came--England. They have never been \ngranted. So the answer is there is no precedent whatsoever. That is \nwhy, when colleagues say we want to restore habeas rights, that is an \nincorrect characterization. Enemy combatants and POWs have never had \nhabeas rights to challenge their detention as a matter of being \nprovided by our Constitution. Never has our Constitution been \ninterpreted as requiring those rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to thank Senator Kyl for his \nhard work on these important issues. He is a superb lawyer who is a \nsenior member of the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, and he has \nbeen a member of the Intelligence Committee. He understands these \nissues and, thanklessly, he devotes hours of his time to try to \nresearch and study Supreme Court cases to try to make sure we do the \nright thing here.\n  The most important thing for us to remember is this, and Senator Kyl \njust said it, that the refrain we are hearing about restoring habeas \nrights to prisoners of war, even unlawful combatant detainees, is not \nso. We have not done that, and it is a matter that is quite clear.\n  The origin of the great writ--the writ of habeas corpus--can be \ntraced back to the Magna Carta in the 13th century. It is truly a great \nwrit. It is truly a powerful tool for any person who is being detained \nto demand that someone, somewhere come forward and tell the world why \nthey are being detained. That is what totalitarian and Communist \ngovernments do all the time. These kinds of dictators and Communists \nand Nazis go out and grab people and put them in jail and never charge \nthem, never announce where they are, even. So that is not what we want \nto do here. However, never in the history of the writ's existence has \nan English or American court granted habeas to enemy combatants held \nduring a time of war. As early as 1793, the American courts--1793--\nrecognized that foreign prisoners held by the military during armed \nconflict have no inherent right to judicial review of their detention. \nThey have no inherent right to that. You do have an inherent right by \nwrit of habeas corpus if you qualify and meet the criteria.\n  So that year, in 1793, a district court in Pennsylvania said:\n\n       Courts will not grant a habeas corpus in the case of a \n     prisoner of war because such a decision on this question is \n     in another place being a part of the rights of sovereignty.\n\n  In other words, national power.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States reaffirmed that position in \n1950 in a case called Johnson v. Eisentrager. In that case, the Supreme \nCourt made expressly clear that U.S. constitutional protections do not \napply to aliens who are detained outside the borders. It was the first \ncase to deal with a habeas petition of enemy combatants detained \noutside the borders of the United States since the statute was \noriginally enacted as part or the Judiciary Act of 1789. It is now \ncodified as 28 U.S.C. Section 2241.\n  In that case, German nationals living in China during World War II, \nhaving never lived in the United States, were accused of violating the \nlaws of war. They were tried by a U.S. military tribunal in China, \nconvicted, and sent to Landsberg Prison in Germany, then an occupied \nsector of Germany, to serve their sentences. Some of the convicts, \nincluding Eisentrager, questioned the legality of their trials and \nfiled for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court \nfor the District of Columbia, right here in DC, stating that the \nmilitary's actions violated their rights as guaranteed by several \nportions of the U.S. Constitution, including article III of the fifth \namendment. In denying habeas to these German nationals, the court \nexpressly rejected the argument that enemy combatants detained overseas \nhave a constitutional right to petition U.S. courts for habeas relief, \nnoting that:\n\n       Nothing in the text of our constitution extends such a \n     right.\n\n  It rejected the view that the U.S. Constitution applies to enemy war \nprisoners held abroad. The court claimed:\n\n       No decision of this court supports such a view. None of the \n     learned commentators on our Constitution has ever hinted at \n     it. The practice of every modern government is opposed to it.\n  Where do we keep coming up with this idea that habeas is applicable \nto prisoners of war? I am baffled. The Court explained emphatically \nthat such a constitutional entitlement would hamper the war effort and \nbring aid and comfort to the enemy.\n\n       Habeas proceedings would diminish the prestige of our \n     commanders, not only with enemies but with wavering neutrals. \n     It would be difficult to devise a more effective fettering of \n     a field commander than to allow the very enemies he is \n     ordered to reduce to submission to call him to account in his \n     own civil courts and divert his efforts and attention from \n     the military offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home.\n\n  That is a pretty clear statement. How could it be otherwise? Congress \nauthorizes a state of hostilities. We fund it. The President, as the \nCommander in Chief, the military commanders execute it, and now we have \nit in our heads somehow that the persons\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\nour commanders are charged with reducing to submission have a right to \nsue us.\n  The Court further held--this is in 1950--that the fifth amendment is \ninapplicable to aliens abroad and, in reasoning fully applicable to the \nsuspension clause, explained ``extraterritorial application of organic \nlaw'' to aliens would be inconceivable.\n  Writing for the majority, Justice Jackson, who was referred to by \nSenator Dodd and Senator Kyl--a great Justice on the Court--stated:\n\n       The Constitution does not confer a right of personal \n     security or an immunity from military trial and punishment \n     upon an alien enemy engaged in the hostile service of a \n     government at war with the United States.\n\n  That is pretty plain language, wouldn't you say? I think that is the \nplain language of the Constitution. It does not give them immunity from \nmilitary trial.\n  Even if, as opponents mistakenly argue, this amendment restores a \nstatutory right to habeas, the Supreme Court has also held that \nCongress may freely repeal habeas jurisdiction if it affords an \nadequate and effective substitute or remedy. Essentially, if \nlegislation strips habeas, according to the Supreme Court, the \nsubstitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor \nineffective to test the legality of a person's detention, does not \nconstitute a suspension of the right of habeas corpus. In other words, \nif they provide some fair procedure for even prisoners of war that we \ndecide is consistent with our military efforts and consistent with our \nsense of fairness, that does not confer and give a guaranteed right to \na habeas corpus review.\n  The Military Commission Act of 2006 was drafted with these important \nSupreme Court precedents in mind. After careful negotiation among our \nMembers and careful analysis of the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan \nv. Rumsfeld, Congress went above and beyond what was required by the \nConstitution and the Geneva Conventions to ensure detainees, even \nterrorists, at Guantanamo Bay, had an adequate and effective substitute \nmethod to test the legality of their detention.\n  So we did that. We did not fail to respond. We did that. The MCA \nprovides alien enemy combatants far more legal process than has ever \nbeen afforded by any country in the history of armed conflict.\n  I am not aware of a single country in the history of armed conflict \nthat has provided more rights than our procedures that we have \nestablished under the Military Act that we passed and the President \nsigned into law last October.\n  The Combatant Status Review Tribunal for detainees is more robust \nthan those to which lawful combatants, honorable soldiers in organized \nmilitaries of a foreign nation, are entitled to under the Geneva \nConventions.\n  Let me repeat that and drive home the importance of that concept. The \nGeneva Conventions were decided upon by a group of nations that came \ntogether and thought that during the course of military conflicts, too \nmany things happened that are not justified and are not necessary and \nare damaging to people in ways that could not be justified. We wrote \nthe conventions, the nations did, to try to ameliorate some of the \nproblems in warfare. We said that if you have a lawful combatant, as \npart of the Geneva Conventions, a person who has signed up for his or \nher country, fighting for the country, who wears a uniform, who carries \nhis weapons openly and does not act in a surreptitious manner, does not \nact in a terroristic manner but fight battles according to the laws of \nwar--if captured, must be treated and afforded the protections of the \nGeneva Conventions.\n  That is a good standard of review and protection. Congress passed a \nlaw to provide for the people at Guantanamo, who are not lawful \ncombatants but are unlawful enemy combatants and who have not \nhistorically been considered to have been covered by the Geneva \nConvention. We afforded them privileges that are not required even \nunder the Geneva Conventions on how you handle detainees.\n  Let's talk about our present conflict, the war on terrorism. Former \nAttorney General John Ashcroft has made this point. If you think about \nit, it is worthy of our consideration. John Ashcroft is a great \nbeliever in American liberty, the rights of liberty, a key \ncharacteristic of the American people. But he points out we ought not \nto think about restraints that occur as some sort of a balancing test \nbetween liberty and control and domination. He says, when you engage in \nan action that is designed to protect us, the test should be not a \nbalancing test, but the test should be: Does it improve liberty? In \nother words, if you go to the airport and have to go through one of \nthose checking stations as I did today, the question is: Do you feel \nmore free to fly, having had that inspection occur? Is your liberty to \ntravel, is your liberty to fly safely and securely in an aircraft in \nAmerica, enhanced because you take a couple of minutes to go through \nthat line? Or not?\n  If it is, then that is a protection of liberty. We are indeed in a \ndifferent world than we used to be, when threats fundamentally came \nfrom foreign nations. Now, even a few people with dedicated, malicious \nintent, with modern weapons of mass destruction and death can have \ntremendous impact on us. So what we are trying to do is execute lawful \nactions that improve our liberty, not deny liberty but to enhance \nliberty for all peace-loving and law-abiding American citizens.\n\n  I want to talk about Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. As part of the Judiciary Act \nof 1789, Congress conferred on the Federal courts jurisdiction to hear \npetitions for habeas corpus. Though the language has gone through minor \nchanges since 1789, current law, now codified at 28 U.S.C. section \n2241, is essentially the same grant of habeas corpus as originally \nenacted. The statutory language has never referred specifically to \nenemy combatants because such a grant was understood not to apply to \nthose individuals detained during a time of war. Congress understood \nthat detention of enemy combatants during time of war is strictly a \nmilitary decision, since we do not allow enemy combatants to continue \ntheir war against us through the judiciary, through litigation.\n  Though the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that habeas corpus does \nnot extend to alien enemy combatants detained outside the United \nStates, some argue that Justice O'Connor's plurality decision in Hamdi \nv. Rumsfeld changed this precedent. In that decision, Justice O'Connor \nsaid:\n\n       All agree that, absent suspension, habeas corpus remains \n     available to every individual within the United States.\n\n  Proponents of this amendment that we are debating cite this statement \nby Justice O'Connor as proof that habeas relief is available to all \nthose detained within the United States, regardless of whether they are \nan alien enemy combatant. Let me note that during World War II, there \nwere 425,000 enemy combatants held within the United States, none of \nwho were allowed relief through habeas petitions. Furthermore, reliance \non that statement by Justice O'Connor is wrong, since the question in \nHamdi was whether the executive had the authority to detain a U.S. \ncitizen as an enemy combatant and whether that citizen detainee had \nhabeas rights. Focusing on that narrow issue, the plurality referred \nspecifically to the rights, in their opinion, the plurality opinion, of \ncitizens, eight times in the opinion; and in the holding of the case--\nand the holding of the case is limited to the circumstances of the \ncases itself--Hamdi was, after all, a U.S. citizen.\n  Regardless, some advocates maintain that Justice O'Connor's otherwise \ninconsequential statement, too tenuous to constitute dicta, reversed \nyears of settled precedent and for the first time granted habeas rights \nto illegal enemy combatants detained overseas. That proposition flies \nin the face of the commonsense interpretive rule that one does not hide \nelephants in mouseholes. Had the Hamdi Court intended to extend habeas \nrights to all individuals in the United States, not just citizens, \nincluding suspected foreign terrorists detained outside U.S. territory, \nit most assuredly would have articulated such a consequential ruling \nwith more clarity. But Hamdi did not present that question and the \nCourt did not resolve it. Moreover, as the Court aptly noted, quoting \nEisentrager:\n\n       Such extraterritorial application of organic law would have \n     been so significant an innovation in the practice of \n     government that, if intended or apprehended, it could \n     scarcely have failed to excite contemporary comment.\n\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\n\n  Accordingly, had such a consequential holding been made in \nEisentrager, it would have been met with prolific commentary from the \nlegal community, from other Justices. It would have been an event, but \nthat event did not occur--because it had no such meaning, of course, as \nevidenced by the lack of contemporary discussion. No decision \nsubsequent to Eisentrager has reversed its holding that alien enemy \ncombatants have no right to habeas protections guaranteed to American \ncitizens by the U.S. Constitution.\n  Therefore, its holding remains governing law. Moreover, the issue \nnow, if it ever could have been considered ambiguous, has been \ndefinitively resolved by the same judge who earlier granted Salim Ahmed \nHamdan's habeas petition. Judge James Robertson, of the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, issued an opinion on December 13 in \nwhich he relied, in large part, on Eisentrager to justify his ruling \nthat enemy alien combatants have no constitutional right to habeas \ncorpus.\n  Judge Robertson, appointed to the bench by President Clinton, \ndismissed Hamdan's petition for habeas relief on the grounds that the \nMCA effectively denied his court's jurisdiction to hear the case; \nrecognizing that Congress had removed Hamdan's statutory right to \npetition the D.C. Circuit Court for habeas relief.\n  Judge Robertson also held:\n\n       Hamdan's connection to the United States lacked the \n     geographical and volitional predicates necessary to claim a \n     Constitutional right to habeas corpus.\n\n  Well, then, the Rasul case came along. Proponents of this amendment \nargue that they seek only to restore the right to habeas corpus as \nfound by the Supreme Court in the 2004 case of Rasul v. Bush. Rasul \ntook great pains to emphasize that its extension of habeas to \nGuantanamo Bay was based not on the Constitution, which clearly is a \nhistoric right we talked about on habeas, but it was based on some \nstatute passed by Congress.\n  Some Justices may have wanted to make Rasul a constitutional holding, \nbut there clearly was no majority for such a position. Supreme Court \ncases such as Eisentrager are still the governing law on the \nconstitutional reach of habeas and the Congress's ability to limit its \nstatutory application.\n  These precedents hold that aliens who are either held abroad or held \nhere but who have no substantial connection to this country are not \nentitled to invoke the U.S. Constitution.\n  Rasul was an unprecedented decision which effectively and truthfully \nseemed to fly in the face of all previous Supreme Court and English \ncase law. Several Justices in this case engaged in what I would submit \nto my colleagues is activism.\n  The Court extended the reach of the Federal habeas statute to \nGuantanamo Bay detainees. To my knowledge, this decision was the first \ntime in recorded history that any court of any nation at war held that \nthose whom its military had determined to be enemies had a right of \naccess to its domestic courts and could sue the Commander in Chief to \nchallenge their detention.\n  The Court based its analysis on the phrase, ``within their respective \njurisdictions,'' as used in the Federal habeas statute and various \ndecisions construing that particular provision.\n  Moreover, the Court expressly distinguished between the statutory and \nsuspension clause holdings of Eisentrager and limited its analysis to \nonly the statutory grant of habeas. The Court determined that the \nmeasure of the Guantanamo lease agreement between the United States and \nCuba allows for the jurisdiction of habeas claims since the United \nStates exercises plenary and exclusive jurisdiction over the land on \nwhich the naval base is situated, although it does not have ``ultimate \nauthority.''\n  Furthermore, the majority, I think and others think, mischaracterized \nthe congressional statute as meaning that the writ of habeas corpus \ncould be issued if ``the custodian can be reached by service of \nprocess'' and not the detainee.\n  As Justice Scalia accurately pointed out in his dissent, the \nmajority:\n\n     springs a trap on the executive, subjecting Guantanamo Bay to \n     the oversight of the Federal courts even though it has never \n     before been thought to be within their jurisdictions and thus \n     making it a foolish place to have housed alien wartime \n     detainees.''\n\n  Furthermore, the decision opens a veritable Pandora's Box since it \n``permits an alien captured in a foreign theater of active combat to \nbring a section 2241 petition against the Secretary of Defense.''\n  This case was a clear-cut example of, I believe, Supreme Court \noverreach. They seemed determined to do something about this. They \nwanted to do something about it. Apparently, they did not like it. So \nin straining to grant U.S. courts jurisdiction over terrorists held \noutside the United States, the Supreme Court determined, for the first \ntime in history, that a simple lease agreement brought Guantanamo Bay \nwithin the jurisdiction of the court.\n  Read broadly, the majority opinion could be used to bring U.S. \nmilitary bases and detention facilities across the world within the \njurisdiction of the U.S. courts. Fortunately, in that opinion, Justice \nKennedy did limit the application of the holding to Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba.\n  Congress, however, addressed the issue because, remember, this was \nbased on the Supreme Court's interpretation of a statute Congress \npassed and which Congress changed, not on the Constitution ratified by \nthe American people.\n  So less than a year ago, Congress addressed the issue when it passed \nthe Military Commissions Act, which precluded detainees from \nchallenging their detention through habeas petitions.\n  Now, if the Court relied on the statute as we wrote it before, we can \nchange that statute, and we did. In doing so, Congress adhered to \nSupreme Court precedent and created an effective and adequate \nsubstitute in the form of a Combatant Status Review Tribunals and \nallowing detainees an opportunity to challenge the determinations made \nby the tribunals, even in the district court in the District of \nColumbia.\n  So it set up a Combatant Status Review Tribunal so they can bring and \nmake their argument, and if they do not like the military's \ndetermination on that, they can get to a Federal court. That is not \nhabeas, but it is a pretty good procedure, more than ever has been \ngiven before to prisoners of war. So it seems we finally worked this \nthing out.\n\n  On February 20 of this year, the DC Circuit Court dismissed all \npending habeas cases from the Guantanamo Bay detainees for lack of \njurisdiction. Furthermore, on April 2 of this year, the Supreme Court \ndenied a certiorari petition from the petitioners in Boumediene v. Bush \nand Al Odah v. United States, refusing to review their claims that the \nMilitary Commissions Act--that last year we passed--does not deprive \ncourts of jurisdiction to hear their habeas corpus claims and that it \nwould be unconstitutional to do so, for Congress to pass it. They \nrejected that.\n  The Court did not find it was unconstitutional, what Congress passed, \nand, in fact, found that Congress did what Congress intended to do, \ncreating a substitute appellate process so prisoners could have a \nreview of their detention but not give them the full panoply of habeas \ncorpus rights provided to American citizens.\n  The Supreme Court, however, reversed itself on June 29 of this year \nand agreed to review both the Boumediene and Al Odah cases. This review \ncould very well address the constitutionality of the habeas bars in the \nMilitary Commissions Act, and, much like this amendment, further \nundermine the executive's constitutional authority to detain enemy \ncombatants in a time of war.\n  I hope the Supreme Court will not do that, but they have agreed to \nhear that case and give it one more final review. Certainly, as of this \ndate, the case authority is clear, that the Constitution does not \nprovide habeas protection to noncitizen enemy combatants on foreign \nterritory not part of the United States.\n  I say that because people have come in on several points along the \nway and accused President Bush or the Attorney General or others of \ntaking improper positions.\n  In most instances, the courts have ruled in favor of the executive in \nthese cases, on a few cases they found those procedures not to be \nstatutory or pass muster. But what I will say to you is, in these \ncases, in almost each instance\n\n[[Page S11567]]\n\nthey have reversed previous law. So the executive branch and our \nmilitary was operating under what they had every right to consider to \nbe the settled law of the land.\n  So the Court comes in and changes that law. I do not believe our \nmilitary should be condemned or criticized for taking action they felt, \nand had every right to believe, was legitimate when they took it.\n  Now, it is important to remember that the detainees at Guantanamo Bay \nare the most dangerous people who we have captured on the battlefield \npursuant to executive war-making power. They have been determined to be \n``alien enemy combatants'' and the courts have absolutely no role to \nplay, in my view, in trying to second-guess the wartime decisions made \nby the executive branch, especially where Congress has given their \nstamp of approval to the process. It is not the Supreme Court's role to \nmicromanage this war by making decisions that fall outside the scope of \ncongressional authority.\n  The decisions made by the Supreme Court have long-lasting effect and \nare not easily undone. If we are unhappy with present foreign policy, \nCongress can cut off funds for the war or people can vote the President \nout of office. I would note President Bush was reelected on a promise \nto continue to pursue with vigor the war against terrorism and the war \nin Iraq.\n  Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life and are supposed to \nadjudicate the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress, not to \nlegislate from the bench or to set foreign policy. This setting of \nforeign policy and conducting military operations are powers squarely \nwithin the purview of the executive branch not nine individuals with \nlifetime appointments sitting on a Court with black robes.\n  It is not within the court's jurisdiction to decide on war-making \ndecisions but simply the constitutional power. It is important to note \nthe Justices lack the knowledge, in many cases, to address the matter, \nor have any experience to make these decisions. Have any of them ever \nserved on the frontlines during war, or if they have, have they ever \nserved in a war on terrorism or been a JAG officer or been a company \ncommander, someone who captured enemy prisoners?\n  A Court's opinion or personal views about this are not a matter that \nis impressive to me. We expect them to rule and to find Congress's \nstatutes--we expect them to enforce the Constitution. But just to flip-\nflop around and try to decide that they do not like the way something \nis done at Guantanamo, and to issue an opinion, would be troubling to \nme. Hopefully, we will not get to that.\n  It has to be clear, as I have shown, that if we apprehend enemy \ncombatants in the theater of war, it is within the executive branch's \npower to detain them until the hostilities are over. This is a \nseparation of powers issue, and the courts should recognize that. \nCongress has already addressed what should be done with those detained \nat Guantanamo Bay. Last October, we granted those detainees \nunprecedented rights that have never before been provided to prisoners \ndetained during war.\n  Under the current system that we have provided them, detainees have \nessentially five layers of protection when challenging detention or \ndeterminations made by the Government. All of this is already covered \nby current law. It was never the intent of Congress, however, to endow \nthe statutory guarantee of habeas corpus to alien enemy combatants held \nduring a time of war.\n  So if we proceed with the amendment that is before us, we are not \nrestoring the right of habeas corpus; we are effectively overturning \n800 years of legal authority and precedent in this area. To quote the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I submit that \n800 years of American and English court history certainly constitutes \n``super duper'' precedent.\n  Allowing terrorists to challenge their detention through habeas \npetitions filed in the DC Circuit courts would undermine military \ndecisions made by the Executive and essentially put wartime decisions \nregarding the detention of those apprehended while engaged in \nhostilities toward this country in the hands of judges who are not \nqualified to make the decisions. They are not empowered to make the \ndecisions. This is exactly why the Founders vested the Executive with \nthis type of decisionmaking authority--decisiveness and ability to act \nquickly--and to undermine this power would be to trample on the \nConstitution we are sworn to defend.\n  Voting in favor of this amendment would be undermining the Executive \nauthority in times of war by making it virtually impossible for the \nmilitary to detain dangerous terrorists affiliated with al-Qaida and \nwith the Taliban during the war on terror and allowing Federal judges \nto force the release of detainees whom the military have determined to \nbe extremely dangerous. It is just that simple.\n  I am disappointed the Senate is proceeding forward with this \namendment. I do not believe it is the right thing. It would result in \nan unprecedented grant of constitutional protection to those suspected \nof being terrorists.\n  This further indicates to me that our Congress is not in full \ncomprehension of the seriousness of the war we are engaged in and the \ndetermination of those who are determined to kill us. It shows this \nbody is, frankly, often unable to execute a military operation. We \ncannot get 535 people to execute a military operation and decide who \nought to be detained and who ought not to.\n  The military could go out and conduct a raid, and a firefight could \nbreak out, and eight people be killed and eight people captured. Thirty \nseconds before, they could have killed all 16. Now, if we detain them, \nwe have to bring soldiers from the war field, present evidence of some \nkind, gather evidence to try to justify the detention. We all know \nquite a large number of those who have been released from Guantanamo \nhave reappeared and been captured again on the battlefield trying to \nkill us. That is a fact. We are not making that up.\n  I wish these people in Guantanamo were the kind of people who would \nnot go back to the battle. I wish they were all wrongly held so we \ncould let them go home. But what if their determination is to continue \nto attack American soldiers, and it is your son out there, your \ndaughter out there on the battlefield, and somebody says in the U.S. \nCongress, ``We don't think you have enough evidence to hold them''? \nWhat do we know about what happened?\n  We have given that power to the executive branch to conduct the war. \nThat is who is supposed to be making those decisions. That is who is \nrequired to preserve and protect the security of the American people. I \ndo not think that makes sense. It is not a little matter. It will set a \nprecedent for future times. We are eroding the ability of the \nleadership of this country to execute and carry out a military \noperation, which by its very nature involves death and destruction of \nan enemy.\n  So I have to say to my colleagues, we need to think this issue \nthrough. This may be a political deal now that we can use to beat up \nPresident Bush, but let me say to my colleagues, you had your victory \nin the last election, if not in 2004. We will have a new President \nsoon. We need to get away from this personal and political perspective. \nWe need to be thinking about the long-term history of the United \nStates. We need to be thinking about other wars we may be involved in \nin the future. We need to be asking ourselves: Are we creating a \ncircumstance in which a devious, skillful, malicious enemy can utilize \nour very laws to destroy us, place at risk our own soldiers, place at \nrisk American citizens, place at risk our people serving in military \nbases around the world?\n  Let's be careful about that. We have provided them, by statute last \nyear, a procedure to contest their detention. Large numbers of those \nwho have been detained have already been released, and quite a number \nof those have been recaptured on the battlefield attempting to destroy \nAmerica and what we stand for, attacking our own sons and daughters.\n  I urge my colleagues to be careful. To say we need to restore the \nright of habeas corpus is not correct. We have never provided habeas \ncorpus to enemies of the United States, for heaven's sake. I share \nagain the overall concept that we are in a difficult new world. The \nConstitution provides for reasonable searches and seizures and such \nthings as that.\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\n  Our country is threatened, and our people's liberties are threatened. \nLiberty is important. Freedom is important. We in Congress do not need \nto be curtailing significantly liberty in America. We certainly do not \nneed to be eroding constitutional protections that are provided to \nAmerican citizens. We are not doing that. The Supreme Court has never \nheld the Constitution provides protection in this fashion to enemy \ncombatants. So we are not eroding the Constitution.\n  What we have come up with is a realistic process that will, in the \nend, provide more liberty, more freedom to American citizens than if we \nwere subjected to a system by which we are releasing terrorists again \nand again who are out to kill and destroy us. That is all I would say \non the fundamental question of liberty and freedom and law.\n  Let's get our thinking straight. Let's look at this issue carefully. \nLet's be sure we know that no country has ever provided such \nprotections to enemy combatants. The fact that 50 out of 400,000 German \nprisoners who were tried after the war in Nuremberg had certain legal \nprovisions and rights provided them in no way whatsoever should be \nconstrued to say we provided habeas rights to other prisoners during \nthe course of a war. They were not provided to the 400,000 German \nprisoners held in the United States, that is for sure.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand some effort is being made \nto pursue the amendment offered by Senator Specter, which is very \ntroubling to me because if it were to pass, it would reverse the \nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006 that we passed last September on final \npassage, 65 to 34. Passage of this amendment would result in a veto of \nthe Defense authorization bill by the President of the United States.\n  The first amendment we have up that is being pushed to a vote against \nthe pleas of people on this side would result in a veto of the Defense \nauthorization bill. The second amendment may well raise the same issue, \nI understand. Not only that, we have very controversial amendments that \nare being made filed to this bill and that have been offered for a vote \non this bill which are very controversial and are not related to the \ndefense of America--for example, the hate crimes amendment. People have \ndiffering views on that. They have offered an amendment on hate crimes \non this bill. There is also the amendment on the DREAM Act, which is an \nimmigration amendment that would provide citizenship to people who come \nhere in our education system at a certain age, and even though they are \nillegally in the country, they would be provided in-state tuition and \nstudent loans subsidized by the Federal Government. That is a very \ncontroversial matter too. So that is all going to be put on this piece \nof legislation, apparently.\n  It raises questions in my mind whether there is any serious desire on \nthe part of the Democratic leadership to see the Defense authorization \nbill passed. The bill came out of the Armed Services Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, and it didn't have the reversal of the Military \nCommissions Act of 2006 and the grant of habeas corpus to illegal enemy \ncombatants, noncitizens on foreign soil. It didn't have that or hate \ncrimes or the DREAM Act.\n  I just say to my colleagues that we need to do the right thing for \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardsmen who are serving \nour Nation now. They are in the field this very moment. They are out \nwalking the streets somewhere in Iraq--160,000 of them--executing this \nvery complex and very important and, so far, effective \ncounterinsurgency strategy that was devised by General Petraeus. They \nare living with Iraqi soldiers and Iraqi police and doing the things \nthey were asked to do. This bill has a pay raise for them and wounded \nwarrior language that provides additional care for those who are \nwounded while serving our country. We owe them every single benefit we \nhave to give them. We have military construction to make sure we are \nable to carry through on the BRAC process. It has acquisition reform. \nWe need to do a better job with the money we spend in acquiring new \nweapons systems and aircraft and ships and all the things that go with \nit.\n  I just say to my colleagues, let's remember now that everything is \nnot required to be placed on this bill. If we pass this amendment to \nprovide habeas corpus protection to illegal enemy combatants, not \ncitizens, not on American soil, not required by the Constitution of the \nUnited States, according to decided case authority of Federal courts, \nthat is going to result in a Presidential veto even if it passes. \nHopefully, we won't pass that. Why do we want to do that? We need to be \nspending our time thinking about how we can help those whom we have \nsent into harm's way to execute a policy that has been decided upon by \nthe Congress of the United States. That is what we need to be doing--\nnot creating more and more lawsuits, not engaging in more and more \npolitical flapdoodle and emotional arguments about restoring habeas \ncorpus, when we have never provided habeas to prisoners of war in the \nhistory of the Republic, nor has any other advanced nation provided \nthose kinds of rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to push back from this brink. Let's don't take \naction that could result in the failure of a defense authorization \nbill. It would be the first time we have failed to pass a defense \nauthorization bill since 1961, 46 years ago. Let's don't break that \nrecord while we have soldiers in harm's way serving our national \ninterests, attempting to execute the policies and assignments we have \ngiven to them. Let's don't do that. Let's don't pass a bill that is \ngoing to come back like a ball off of the wall because it will be \nvetoed by the President. What good is that? Why are we obsessed with \nthis? It wasn't passed in the Armed Services Committee, and it doesn't \nneed to be pushed now.\n  I urge my colleagues to become fully aware of the dangerous territory \nwhich we are entering. We are entering a circumstance in which, if we \ncontinue to pursue issues unrelated to the core responsibilities of the \nCongress to deal with the war we are confronting, we will have failed \nin our responsibilities and actually fail to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  In addition, we need to finish up with the Defense bill and go on to \nthe Defense appropriations bill. The fiscal year ends September 30. We \nneed to pass the Defense authorization bill so that we can get to the \nDefense appropriations bill by next week. That needs to move. We do not \nneed to still be arguing over the DREAM Act, arguing over hate crimes, \narguing over providing habeas corpus rights to illegal enemy combatants \nheld somewhere around the world by the American military, a privilege \nthat has never been provided by any nation to people it captures on the \nbattlefield. That is not the right way for us to go. This Congress, if \nit is a responsible Congress, should move forward this week on the \nauthorization bill and do the appropriations bill next week.\n\n  What are the core issues? We have some core issues we ought to debate \nabout the defense of America and our military. Let's stay on those \nissues, not on extraneous issues.\n  There is no doubt that we have heard the report of GEN Jimmy Jones's \ncommission, the Government Accountability Office report the week before \nlast, and then last week we heard from General Petraeus and Ambassador \nCrocker. We need to have time to discuss seriously--and this side has \ncertainly agreed to that and it is contemplated that we will have a \ngenerous time to discuss our commitment in Iraq, what it is, what our \ngoals are, how we can achieve those goals, what the troop levels should \nbe, how they are going to be drawn down, are they being drawn down fast \nenough, and what other issues are relevant. Those are legitimate issues \non which we should spend time.\n  I am very concerned these other issues will be distracting us from \nthose issues, that we will be utilizing time that ought to be on the \ncore issues of\n\n[[Page S11569]]\n\ndefense of this country, and I hope those leaders, particularly our \nDemocratic leadership, are not going to put us in a position where we \nwill not meet our responsibilities.\n  For the past 46 years, we have passed a Defense authorization bill. \nAt the rate we are headed, even if we pass it, it is going to be vetoed \nbecause of amendments wholly unrelated to the Defense of this country. \nWe need to pass a Defense appropriations bill, and we need to get on \nthat quickly because the fiscal year is ending. For my colleagues' \ninformation, we are going to have to do something to continue to fund \ndefense because if we do not pass a Defense authorization bill, the \nfact is that no money can be spent in the whole Department of Defense \nunless we are being attacked. It is very troubling, and it could have \ntremendous disruptive impacts throughout the entirety of our defense \nestablishment.\n  Under the Antideficiency Act, if Congress does not appropriate money, \nthe executive branch cannot spend it. It cannot spend what has not been \nappropriated. That is the Constitution, and that is what the \nAntideficiency Act says. The budget and last year's appropriations end \nSeptember 30. We need to pass a new bill so we can go forward into next \nyear.\n  We have a pretty good bill that came out of committee. There will be \nsome disagreement here, there, and on a few other matters. We will \nbring those up, and good people will disagree. I certainly understand \nthat point. We need to be working on those issues, not being distracted \non matters unrelated to the core of defending America in this time of \nterrorism.\n  I share those thoughts and hopefully our colleagues in the leadership \ncan continue to work and some way we can avoid the end toward which it \nappears we are heading.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I heard one of my friends on the other side \nof the aisle come here this afternoon and talk about why we aren't \ngetting more things done here; why are we doing the Defense \nauthorization bill now; when are we going to do the Defense \nappropriations bill. Maybe they should have thought of that before they \ndid 45 different filibusters here in the Senate. The Republican \nminority has stopped the work of this country. We have fought back with \nthe very slim majority we have.\n  I will remind everyone within the sound of my voice that Senator \nJohnson has been ill. He is back now, thank goodness. He is back. He \novercame a tremendous illness, and he is back with us. My majority was \n50 to 49--that is, the Democratic majority--and we have had to fight, \nthat little majority has had to fight everything that we have done. \nEverything. We had to file cloture on things they agreed with us on, \njust eating up valuable time here in the Senate. I am going to have to \nfile cloture again tonight on another matter. This will be the third \ntime we have worked on the Defense authorization bill. I am not going \nto belabor the point except to say this is the wrong thing to be \ntalking about here: Why aren't we moving more quickly?\n  In spite of all the obstacles--procedural in nature--they have thrown \nup against us, we have done some remarkable things.\n  We passed an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in 10 \nyears.\n  The President was forced to sign, even though he didn't like it--and \nhe said so--the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform in the history \nof this country.\n  We passed the 9/11 Commission recommendations that the President held \nup for years. And those he tried to implement, he got D's and F's on, \nbut they are now law. We have done that.\n  Disaster relief for farmers and ranchers--we have done that for them. \nThey waited years to get that done. Our slim majority was able to get \nthat done.\n  We forced upon the President money to fight the wildfires which swept \nthe West, fires caused by global warming.\n  A budget. We passed a balanced budget. Our majority was 50 to 49, and \nwe passed a budget. The Republicans, with the huge majority they had, \ncouldn't get a budget done. We got one done.\n  So, Mr. President, we have done some really good things here in spite \nof all these obstacles. I haven't mentioned all of them but just given \nan idea of what we have done working really hard. So I repeat: Don't \ncome to the floor and lecture us on not getting things done here.\n  Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to the Specter-\nLeahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on amendment No. 2022, \n     regarding restoration of habeas corpus, top H.R. 1585, the \n     Department of Defense Authorization bill.\n         Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, Carl Levin, Christopher Dodd, \n           Jeff Bingaman, Barack Obama, Robert C. Byrd, Ken \n           Salazar, Debbie Stabenow, Dianne Feinstein, Patrick \n           Leahy, Sheldon Whitehouse, Daniel K. Akaka, Russell D. \n           Feingold, Amy Klobuchar, Bill Nelson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also add to the remarks I just made.\n  In addition to what I outlined earlier, look at what we have done on \nIraq.

Mr. President, earlier today, the President announced his \nintention that he will, at some appropriate time, send the nomination \nof Judge Michael Mukasey to the Hill to be the next Attorney General. \nWhen that nomination arrives, with the appropriate FBI clearance and \nall, the Judiciary Committee will approach consideration of this \nnomination in a serious and deliberate fashion.\n  The administration, of course, took many months in determining that a \nchange in leadership was needed at the Department of Justice. Then \nafter they made the determination they had to change the leadership, \nthe President spent several weeks before making his nomination public. \nIt wasn't until Saturday of this past weekend that I was told by the \npress whom he was going to nominate. Our focus now, of course, will be \non securing the relevant information the committee needs to proceed to \nscheduling fair and thorough hearings, and we will do that.\n  I am not in any way critical of the President for taking so many \nweeks in deciding whom he wanted. In fact, I would compliment him on \nhis decision not to go with some of the names that apparently were \npresented to him. I tried to stress to the President and others at the \nWhite House, with all the problems at the Department of Justice, that \nchoosing a person who would be there solely for political purposes \nwould not be a wise thing to do. I know the President had a number of \nnames that would have fallen into that category, and to his credit, \nthose names that would have created the greatest political problems \nwere rejected.\n\n[[Page S11570]]\n\n  Now, I have also been in discussion with White House officials about \nsome of the committee's outstanding requests, and I let them know that \ncooperation with the White House would be central in determining that \nschedule. In this regard, I wish to compliment the President's counsel, \nMr. Fielding. Mr. Fielding called me yesterday evening. Without going \ninto the details of that conversation, I believe he understands there \nare certain materials that we have requested from the White House--\nrequested for some time now--that will be necessary so that we can \nengage in thorough deliberations. I take him at his word that we will \ntry to work out a way to get us some of those materials. It will make \nit far easier for both Republicans and Democratic members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to ask appropriate questions.\n  This is a big job, being Attorney General. It becomes even bigger \nnow, as the next Attorney General must regain the public trust and \nbegin the process of restoring the Department of Justice to its proper \nmission, and also replacing a very large number of key members of the \nDepartment of Justice who have resigned and whose replacements, \nthemselves, will require confirmation by the Senate. So I am hopeful \nthat once we obtain the information we need, once we have had the \nopportunity to consider this nomination, we will be able to make \nprogress in this regard.\n  As I told the White House last night, I stand ready to work with them \nin the coming weeks to get the material we need, and then once that \nmaterial is available, to find an appropriate time to schedule a \nhearing.\n  I look forward to meeting with Judge Mukasey in the coming days. We \nwill meet briefly tomorrow and then at greater length once his \nbackground check has been completed. I wish to learn more about his \nrecord, but I also wish to learn about his ideas on improving the \nrelationship between Congress and this administration so we can conduct \nmore effective oversight and take the steps toward rebuilding the \nJustice Department to be worthy of its name.\n  In the meantime, I have told Judge Mukasey he will have a lot on his \nplate in the coming days. I complimented him and his family for being \nwilling to be considered for this nomination and urged him, even as \nbusy as he may be, to spend time with his family. I understand he has a \nwonderful family--grandchildren and so forth--and I am sure he will do \nso.\n  I again urge the White House that we do not need to have all kinds of \npress comments about the date for hearings. I think what would be more \nimportant to do would be to work, as we have in the past, will to get \nthe information necessary; and in the fullness of time, we will have an \nappropriate hearing. I will do it--working, of course, with Senator \nSpecter--and, as I think we have demonstrated before, we will have a \nhearing that will make the Senate proud. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats, with the complete record before them, then will be able to \nask all the appropriate questions, the questions of course that the \nAmerican public wants and deserves to have us ask.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11570-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11570-S11571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 2005, President Bush praised the Iraqi \npeople for exercising the Democratic right to vote. He noted that by \nparticipating in free elections, the Iraqi people firmly rejected the \nanti-democratic ideology of the terrorists, and they demonstrated the \nkind of courage that is always the foundation of self-government. \nSimilar to President Bush, I applaud when anyone has the right to vote \nand the right to determine where they will go with that right to vote. \nI wish, though, the President would speak as enthusiastically about \nvoting rights for the American citizens who live literally in his \nbackyard, in the same city where he resides in the White House. It is \ndisappointing that the Bush administration has threatened to veto \nlegislation that would give a vote to the Member of the House of \nRepresentatives from the District of Columbia.\n  I also understand the opponents of this voting rights bill are \nconsidering a filibuster to prevent its passage. In a recent column in \nthe Washington Times, former Maryland Governor Michael Steele and \nformer Congressman J.C. Watts, two Republicans, reminded us that the \nlast time a voting rights bill was filibustered was 50 years ago. I was \nmuch too young to even vote, but I do remember that filibuster. Despite \nSenator Thurmond's record-setting effort, the Senate rightfully passed \nthe Civil Rights Act in 1957. It followed up with the Civil Rights and \nVoting Rights Acts in 1960, 1964 and 1965. I hope the Senate does not \nreturn to the days when it filibustered voting rights, especially for \nits African-American citizens.\n  The city of the District of Columbia has approximately the same \nnumber of people as the State of Vermont. We are the 14th State in the \nUnion. We have had the right to vote, for Senators and Representatives, \nfor over 200 years. The distinguished Presiding Officer, of course, \nrepresents one of the very first States of this Union. In fact, he can \nproudly represent a State whose forefathers did much to design the \nUnited States of America and has provided President after President but \nespecially laid the cornerstone of a great nation. It made it possible \nfor the State of Vermont to be the first State admitted after the \noriginal 13.\n  There is no way I could go back to my State of Vermont and say that \nthe District of Columbia, with almost exactly the same number of \npeople, does not have a voting Member in the House of Representatives. \nBack in my State, they would say we have two Senators, but at least let \nus take this step. Let us vote it up or down. Let's not go back to the \nshameful days of 1957 when such rights were filibustered.\n  We have had hearings on this in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We \nhave heard compelling testimony.\n  This month the Judiciary Committee marked the 50th anniversary of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1957 with a hearing. Congressman John Lewis, a \ncourageous leader during those transformational struggles only decades \nago, gave moving testimony reminding us that ``we in Congress must do \nall we can to inspire a new generation to fulfill the mission of equal \njustice.'' While we are observing this golden anniversary, it is \nfitting that the Senate turn to this important voting rights measure, \nthe District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation to end the unfair \ntreatment of District of Columbia residents and give them full \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives. I thank the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, for bringing this timely issue to the Senate for \nconsideration.\n  In April, the House of Representatives worked in a bipartisan manner \nto pass their version of a voting rights bill for the District of \nColumbia, led by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton. As a young \nlawyer, she worked for civil rights and voting rights around the \ncountry. It is a cruel irony that upon her return to the District of \nColumbia and election to the House of Representatives she does not yet \nhave the right to vote on behalf of the people of the District of \nColumbia who elected her. She is a strong voice in Congress but the \npeople of the District of Columbia deserve a vote, as well.\n  This is not the time for further delay. It is the Senate's turn to do \nwhat is right. The Senate bill would give the District of Columbia \ndelegate a full vote in the House. To attract Republican support, the \nbill offsets that vote for DC by according Utah an additional \nRepresentative in the House, as well. This is an effort to provide \npolitical balance. With it or without it, I support representation for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  I believe that the legislation that we are considering today is \nwithin Congress's powers as provided in the Constitution. I agree with \nCongressman Lewis, Congresswoman Norton and numerous other civil rights \nleaders and constitutional scholars that we should extend the basic \nright of voting representation to the hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans residing in our Nation's Capital. They pay Federal taxes, \ndefend our country in the military and serve on Federal juries. They \nare citizens no less than the citizens of any State. Their votes should \ncount. They should be represented.\n  In May the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this \nlegislation. We heard compelling testimony.\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\nRetired Chief Judge Patricia Wald testified that this legislation is \nconstitutional and highlighted the fact that Congress's greater power \nin accordance with the Constitution to confer full statehood on the \nDistrict certainly contains the lesser power to grant District \nresidents voting rights in the House of Representatives. She also \nreminded us that Congress has exercised this authority in the past \nwithout a rigid adherence to the constitutional text when it granted \nvoting rights to Americans abroad in their last State of residence \nregardless of whether they are citizens of that State, pay taxes to \nthat State, or have any intent to return to that State. Her former \ncolleague on the DC Circuit, Ken Starr, echoed her conclusion that this \nlegislation is constitutional.\n  Congress has repeatedly treated the District of Columbia as a \n``State'' for various purposes. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton \ntestified that although ``the District is not a State,'' the ``Congress \nhas not had the slightest difficulty in treating the District as a \nState, with its laws, its treaties, and for constitutional purposes.'' \nExamples of these actions include a revision of the Judiciary Act of \n1789 that broadened article III diversity jurisdiction to include \ncitizens of the District even though the Constitution only provides \nthat Federal courts may hear cases ``between citizens of different \nStates.'' Congress has also treated the District as a ``State'' for \npurposes of congressional power to regulate commerce ``among the \nseveral States.'' The 16th amendment grants Congress the power to \ndirectly tax incomes ``without apportionment among the several \nStates.'' That constitutional provision has been interpreted also to \napply to residents of the District. In fact, the District of Columbia \npays the second-highest Federal taxes per capita, yet has no vote in \nconnection with how those dollars are spent. The local license plates \nsay a good deal and remind us of our heritage when they say ``Taxation \nwithout Representation.''\n  As I said, in 2005, President Bush praised the Iraqi people for \nexercising their democratic right to vote, and he noted that ``by \nparticipating in free elections, the Iraqi people have firmly rejected \nthe antidemocratic ideology of the terrorists [a]nd they have \ndemonstrated the kind of courage that is always the foundation of self-\ngovernment.'' Unfortunately, the President does not speak so \nenthusiastically about voting rights for the American citizens living \nliterally in his backyard. It is disappointing that the Bush \nadministration has threatened to veto this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11571-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                        MEPI Scholarship Program\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I commend the senior Senators from Vermont \nand New Hampshire for the fine work that they did last week in managing \nH.R. 2764, the fiscal year 2008 State Department, Foreign Operations \nand Related Programs Appropriations Act. Given how busy they were, I \nregret that we did not have a chance to clarify a scholarship program \nfunded in that Act through the Middle East Partnership Initiative, \nMEPI.\n  In Senate Report 110-128, the committee provides $55,000,000 for \nMEPI, and recommends $9,000,000 of those funds for scholarship programs \nfor students from countries with significant Muslim populations at not-\nfor-profit U.S. educational institutions in the Middle East.\n  In prior year foreign aid bills, eligibility criteria for scholarship \nprograms included those students from countries with significant Muslim \npopulations at not-for-profit institutions of basic and higher \neducation in the Middle East which are accredited by an accrediting \nagency recognized by the Secretary of Education, and that are not \ncontrolled by the government of the country in which the institution is \nlocated.\n  Those who manage the MEPI program at the State Department added \nadditional criteria, namely that American schools in the Middle East \nwould be eligible only if U.S. Government dependents were enrolled in \nrespective institutions, and only for students in the seventh through \ntwelfth grades. I would ask the senior Senators from Vermont and New \nHampshire if the State Department consulted with the committee prior to \nestablishing additional criteria for the scholarship program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would say to my colleague from New Hampshire that my \nstaff informs me that they were not consulted by the State Department \non this matter.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would say to my friend from New Hampshire that my staff \ninforms me that they, too, were not consulted on MEPI-added criteria.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I fear that the State Department is severely limiting the \nscope of the scholarship program, including to conflict countries such \nas Lebanon that remain unaccompanied posts for State Department \nemployees. To put that another way, no U.S. Government dependents are \nenrolled in schools in Lebanon. Moreover, I would like to suggest that \nthe committee consider allocating $7 million for scholarships at higher \neducation institutions, and $2 million for secondary schools.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate your bringing these matters to my attention. \nMy staff will request a briefing from the State Department on the \nscholarship program, and if needed, we will seek additional \nclarification during conference on this matter with the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11571-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11571-S11573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Specialist Eric M. Holke\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army SPC \nEric M. Holke, of Riverside, CA.\n  Specialist Holke's father describes him as an avid outdoorsman, a \ncommitted student of history, and someone with a keen eye for the arts. \nFrom a young age, Specialist Holke pursued his hobbies with zeal. His \npassion for the outdoors was matched only by his passion for film, \nwhich he discovered after he took a class on sports photography at Rim \nof the World High School in Lake Arrowhead, CA, where he was a \ngraduate. After high school, he continued his studies in film and \nphotography, and also worked at radio and television stations at San \nBernadino Valley College.\n  Ready for a new challenge, Specialist Holke left San Bernadino Valley \nCollege to join the California Conservation Corps, where he spent the \nnext 2 years backpacking through the wilderness of California. When he \nreturned from this service, he became active in Renaissance fairs, \nwhere his specialty was demonstrating how the German military lived in \nthe 1400s through 1600s, according to Pat Long, a cousin and producer \nof Renaissance fairs. Those who watched his performances remembered \nthem for his passion and his enthusiasm.\n  Specialist Holke enlisted in the Army in 2000 in order to learn new \nskills as well as to save money to return to school. He served with the \n82nd Airborne, like one of his grandfathers, a much-decorated World War \nII veteran. He went to Afghanistan, then to Iraq before being honorably \ndischarged from the Army in 2005. He returned to Riverside, CA, where \nhe became active again with the San Bernadino Valley College, \nperforming re-enactments as well as studying film and business there. \nHe also enlisted in the California National Guard at this time.\n  Specialist Holke and his wife Cassidhe were married in January of \n2007. He was eager to earn his degree in business so he could start a \nnew life in the film industry with his wife and their 16-year-old son, \nSteven.\n  In June of 2007, Specialist Holke began serving his second tour of \nduty in Iraq. He was serving with the 1st Battalion, 160th Infantry, \nCalifornia Army National Guard stationed in Kuwait. On July 15, 2007, \nSpecialist Holke passed away in a noncombat-related incident in Talil. \nAt his funeral, he was posthumously awarded five medals, including the \nBronze Star. He was 31 years old.\n  In addition to his wife Cassidhe and son Steven, both of Riverside, \nCA, he is survived by his mother Monika Holke of Lincoln, NE, and \nfather Jack Holke, of Las Vegas, NV. Today, I join all Americans in \nmourning the loss of a talented soldier, an active outdoorsman, and a \nloving husband, father, and son. He made the ultimate sacrifice through \nhis service to our country. He will be remembered for his hunger for \nadventure. His memory will be honored by future generations of soldiers \nand civilians alike.\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n\n        Explosive Ordinance Disposalman 1st Class Jeffrey Chaney\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to honor Navy Explosive Ordinance \nDisposalman First Class Jeffrey Chaney of Omaha.\n  Petty Officer Chaney was a 1990 graduate from Bellevue West High \nSchool. In 1993, he joined the Navy. His first ambition was to be a \nNavy SEAL; however, due to eyesight problems, he worked instead as a \nrecruiter for the Navy. His success as a recruiter was a direct result \nof his enthusiasm and his dedication to his work, evidenced also by his \nbrother Jim, whom he helped recruit. His sister April describes \ncommitment to his work: ``[He] loved the Navy; he just loved everything \nabout his job. He was always talking about it,'' she said.\n  Before his tour in Iraq, Chaney served in the Secret Service, where \nhe had the opportunity to meet President George H.W. Bush, as well as \nMikhail Gorbachev while he was on security detail at the President's \n80th birthday party. His sister recalls that while that was a momentous \noccasion in his life, his proudest moment was the birth of his daughter \nBrianna, now 14.\n  Chaney was assigned to Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit 11, \nstationed in Whidbey Island, WA. On July 17, 2007, after serving in \nIraq for about 2 months, ED01 Chaney passed away during combat \noperations in Salahuddin Province. He was 35 years old.\n  In addition to his brother and sister, he is survived by his daughter \nBrianna Chaney, 14, of Omaha; his mother Connie Chaney also of Omaha, \nhis father Jim Eckert of Oakland, IA and another brother Jim Eckert, \nalso of Oakland. Today, I join all Americans in mourning the loss of a \ntruly great sailor, proud father, and loving son. His service and his \nsacrifice will be remembered for generations to come.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Jacob Schmuecker\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor Nebraska Army National Guard \nSergeant Jacob Schmuecker of Atkinson, NE.\n  Sergeant Schmuecker was a 1999 graduate of West Holt High School in \nAtkinson, NE, and attended Northeast Community College in Norfolk. He \njoined the Nebraska Army National Guard in 2001, after serving the city \nof Atkinson as a police officer.\n  He and his wife Lisa were married for more than 4 years, and lived in \nNorfolk with their three children; Dylan, 4, Kierstan, 3, and Bryce, 19 \nmonths. Lisa describes her husband as someone who was deeply committed \nto his service, and someone who volunteered for a mission to make the \nworld a safer place for his children. She knows her children will \nremember their father for being a loving husband to her, a dedicated \nfather, and an outstanding soldier.\n  A member of the 755th chemical company based out of O'Neill, NE, \nSergeant Schmuecker had proudly served in the Army National Guard for 6 \nyears. Having previously served in Afghanistan, he was 10 months into \nhis first tour in Iraq when he passed away in Balad, after an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near his armored vehicle. He was \n27 years old.\n  In addition to his wife, Sergeant Schmuecker is survived by his \nparents Rodney and Patricia of Atkinson, and his brother Chris Shepperd \nof Norfolk. Today, I mourn the loss of a true American patriot, a \ndevoted husband, and a loving father of three. He and his family have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice to make our country a safer place to live.\n\n\n                       Corporal Ryan A. Woodward\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Fort \nWayne. Ryan Woodward, 22 years old, was killed on September 8 in Balad, \nIraq, from injuries sustained by small arms fire during combat \noperations near Baghdad. With an optimistic future before him, Ryan \nrisked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our \nhearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  Ryan graduated from Carroll High School in 2003 and joined the Army \nin 2006. It was concern for his country's welfare that drove him to \nenlist as his grandfather and uncle had before him. Ryan was hugely \nproud to follow in their footsteps. Excelling in his service, Ryan was \nawarded the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the Combat \nInfantryman's Badge and the Parachutist's Badge.\n  Ryan was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to A Troop, 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 82nd \nAirborne Division from Fort Bragg, NC. Ryan is survived by his parents \nMichael and Sue Woodward, his sisters Tasha and Brooke, and his brother \nBen. Those who knew him best describe an adventurous young man who \nenjoyed life and cared deeply about his family and friends. He will be \nremembered as a loving son, brother, and friend.\n  Today, I join Ryan's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Ryan, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Ryan was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Ryan will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Ryan's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Ryan's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Ryan A. Woodward in the Record \nof the Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this \njust cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Ryan's can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Ryan.\n\n\n                  Private First Class Shawn D. Hensel\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Logansport. Shawn \nHensel, 20 years old, was killed on August 12 while deployed in West \nBaghdad, Iraq, of injuries sustained from rocket-propelled grenade and \nsmall arms fire. With his entire life before him, Shawn risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Shawn attended Logansport High School, and was known as a class clown \nwho followed his own path instead of the crowd. His teacher, John \nMorgan, said, ``Shawn was his own person. He would do just what he \nwanted to do. He wanted to experience life.'' After receiving his \ngeneral equivalency degree in 2006, Shawn joined the Army. Friends say \nhe knew he wanted to join the military since he was 13 years old.\n  Shawn was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to B Company, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry \nRegiment, 2nd Infantry Division in Fort Lewis, WA. He is survived by \nhis wife Laci N. Harmon, whom he married on December 28, 2006, his \nparents David and Elizabeth Ann Hensel, his sisters Autumn M. Vail and \nAngela R. Hensel, as well as his in-laws and extended family. Shawn \nwill be remembered as a loving husband, son, and brother.\n  Today, I join Shawn's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his\n\n[[Page S11573]]\n\ncourage and strength of character that people will remember when they \nthink of Shawn, a memory that will burn brightly during these \ncontinuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Shawn was known for his daredevil streak, a tough exterior and a \npassion for the outdoors, especially kayaking. Those who knew him best \nwill remember him for the devotion he had to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Shawn will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shawn's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.

This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Shawn's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shawn D. Hensel in the Record \nof the Senate for his service to this country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about this \njust cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that comes \nwith the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Shawn's can find \ncomfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow \nup death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all \nfaces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Shawn.\n\n\n                     Sergeant Nicholas J. Patterson\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier from Rochester. \nNick Patterson, 24 years old, was killed on September 10 in Baghdad, \nIraq, from injuries sustained when his vehicle rolled over returning \nfrom a raid. With an optimistic future before him, Nick risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Nick graduated from Rochester High School in 2001 where he excelled \nin basketball and baseball. His senior year, Nick was the leading \nscorer on the basketball team. He was known for being a star athlete \nthat brought huge energy into sports and a hard-working student. His \nteacher, Linda Brenna, said, ``He had such a great sense of humor and \ncould make a tense moment light.'' Those who knew Nick respected him \nfor his strong work ethic and his humor.\n  Nick was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 82nd \nAirborne Division in Fort Bragg, NC. Nick is survived by his wife Jayme \nSaner Patterson, his 4-year-old son Reilley, and his parents James and \nVirginia Patterson. He will be remembered as a loving husband, father, \nson, and friend.\n  Today, I join Nick's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Nick, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Nick was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Nick will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Nick's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Nick's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Nicholas J.

Mr. President, I was absent for the vote on September 7 \non final passage of the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 due to an \nofficial trip that I took to Iraq with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Had I been in Washington during the vote on final passage, I \nwould have supported this important piece of legislation as I did when \nthe Senate passed its version in July.\n  The rising costs of a college education have significantly increased \nthe financial burden on college students and their families in recent \nyears. The largest increase in higher education aid since the G.I. \nbill, the College Cost Reduction Act will increase student aid to low-\nand middle-income students by $17.4 billion over the next 5 years. It \nalso increases the maximum Pell grant by $500 to $4,810 next year and \nincrementally increases it until it caps at $5,400 in 2012. Further, \nthe bill will help students manage their debt by capping student loan \npayments at 15 percent of their monthly income and reducing the student \nloan interest rate from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. In addition, the \nlegislation will create a pilot program that reduces the amount of \nfederal subsidies paid to student lending institutions and redirects \nthe funds directly to students. The result will save students real \ndollars, save taxpayers money, and inject competition into the loan \nprogram.\n  Increasing the number of college graduates is one of the best \ninvestments that we as a nation can make, and I am proud that this \nCongress has worked to make college a reality for more Americans. The \nimprovements contained in this legislation will expand the options \nstudents have to attend college and pay for higher education for years \nto come. Moreover, it will improve the quality of life for our citizens \nand our economy by preparing our workforce for the demands of an \nincreasingly competitive marketplace.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, too many young people, from all walks of \nlife, are either struggling to pay for college or flatout can't afford \nit. Those who aren't able to incur such steep costs are not only losing \nout on a degree, but setting themselves up to face a lifetime of lost \nopportunities, as study after study shows college graduates are the \nmost attractive candidates for the fastest growing and best paying jobs \nof tomorrow. Greater college access and financial assistance is \ncritical to making the American dream a reality for all. This bill \nstrengthens educational resources for low-income students, giving every \nchild the chance to succeed. It will mark the largest increase in \nstudent aid since the Montgomery GI bill and ensures that college is \nwithin the reach of children all over the country.\n  Today, families in New England with students in a community college \nspend 17 percent of their annual income to cover the cost of college \nfor 1 year, while families nationally spend 13 percent. According to an \nanalysis by the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education released last \nyear, more than two thirds of families in Massachusetts last year still \nrequired approximately $6,300 beyond financial aid to afford a college \neducation. Faced with such a hardship, many Massachusetts students drop \nout, saying the costs are too steep. Those who do complete their \ndegrees are often saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans--\nwhich can take years, often decades, to pay off.\n  The conference report cuts roughly $20 billion from lender subsidies \nand\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\nuses the funds to increase aid to college students and reduce the \ninterest rates they must pay on their loans. It halves interest rates \non subsidized student loans, from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, over 4 \nyears and increases the Pell grant by $1,090 increase in the maximum \nPell grant award over 5 years. It also allows for a flexible repayment \noption and loan forgiveness after 10 years for certain public-sector \nemployees.\n  I am also proud that the conference report included language to fund \nkey Massachusetts Upward Bound programs. Upward Bound provides \nfundamental support and college preparation for low-income students and \nhas a strong record of increasing the rate at which low-income students \ngraduate from institutions of higher learning. Once the President signs \nthis legislation into law, 187 new and existing Upward Bound programs \nthat scored above a 70 in the most recent grant competition will be \nfunded from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2011. As a result, Upward \nBound services will be provided for an additional 12,000 students. I \nwant to congratulate all of the new and refunded Upward Bound programs \nin my State--Holyoke Community College, North Shore Community College, \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Suffolk University and Wheelock \nCollege. Thank you for providing these necessary services to \nMassachusetts students and I urge you to keep up the good work.\n  This legislation is absolutely vital to securing the opportunity of \nhigher education for all and making our country more competitive. I \nthank Senator Kennedy for his hard work and vision and I wholeheartedly \nsupport this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11574-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On the night of September 1, 2007, Josie Smith-Malave, her sister \nJulie Smith, and her friend Emily Durwood, were attacked outside a Long \nIsland bar for being gay. The three women had been at the bar that \nnight, and, as they left, they were followed outside by three women and \nabout nine men. The group of about a dozen young adults began to crowd \naround the three women, shouting antigay slurs, throwing sticks and \ncups at them and spitting on them. The group then began to punch and \nkick the three women. One of the victims suffered a head injury, \nanother suffered a knee injury, and all three were badly bruised as a \nresult of the attack. The attackers fled the scene before police \narrived, but one man was arrested 4 days later for his alleged \ninvolvement in the assault, which included stealing a camera from and \ninjuring one of the women. He is charged with a hate-biased crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11574-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DONNA PAGANO MURRAY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to one of \nthe longest tenured members of my Senate staff, Mrs. Donna Pagano \nMurray. Donna retired from the Senate on September 5, 2007, after 28 \nyears of exceptional service to the citizens of this country and to the \nresidents of the State of Alaska.\n  Donna was born in New York City and studied at Monmouth University \nand the University of Maryland. She served as my executive assistant \nand was responsible for all legislative issues relating to domestic \naviation and transportation security since I entered the Senate in \n2002. She is an expert in Alaska aviation issues and a champion for the \nAge 60 pilot age extension bill. Donna served as my Chief of Staff for \nthe past year, leading a great team working for Alaska.\n  Prior to working for me, she worked for Senator Frank Murkowski for \n12 years. Among other duties in that office, including those I just \nmentioned, she was the principal liaison between his Washington, DC and \nfive state offices.\n  She left the Senate in 1989 and worked at the Department of Commerce \nfor five years during the Administration of former President George \nH.W. Bush. She handled issues such as clean water and air, fisheries \nmanagement, weather services and appropriations issues for the \nDepartment.\n  I also want to mention that during her tenure in the Senate, she \nworked on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Services and the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee. She has volunteered for several \ncampaigns and Inaugural ceremonies as well.\n  Donna started her career as a high school teacher, and is looking \nforward to being a substitute teacher in her post-Senate life. This \nsays a lot about her--that she is returning to the classroom to help \nchildren in this area. Rather than seeking a high-paying private sector \njob, which she certainly is qualified for given her abilities and \nexperiences, she is going to be a substitute school teacher for a local \ndistrict. She represents the real spirit of public service by giving \nback some of her knowledge, wisdom and experience gained from decades \nin government service to the youngsters of this area. I know that the \nstudents will learn a lot from Donna.\n  While I am sorry to lose one of my staff leaders, I am delighted that \nDonna will be able to more fully enjoy time with her husband Danny. \nDanny had a heart transplant last year and I know that they are looking \nforward to spending more time with each other, traveling together and \nenjoying their grandchildren.\n  I will miss Donna's cheerfulness, wonderful smile, straightforward \nmanner, vast knowledge, and her dedication to the Senate. She is a hard \nworker, indeed. It has been a pleasure to have her on my staff. I wish \nher and her husband Danny the very best and know that Alaskans will \nbenefit for decades to come from her efforts to help the State. I also \nknow that future generations will benefit from her return to the \nclassroom.\n  Donna, thank you for your service to Alaska and this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11574-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11574-S11575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT JAMES FAUST\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a revered Utahn \nwho was taken from us a little more than a month ago during our summer \nrecess: President James Esdras Faust, second counselor in the First \nPresidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On \nAugust 10, President Faust peacefully passed away, called home by the \nGod whom he had served for 87 years. He left behind a legacy of faith \nand service, an example to which we should all strive for in our own \nlives.\n  President Faust was a wonderful leader for the LDS Church and a \ntremendous counselor to its President, Gordon B. Hinckley. He was a \ngreat friend and guide to Elaine and me, and our entire family, and to \nmillions of others around the world. He was a person of great \ndimension, wide-ranging abilities, and deeply spiritual capacities. He \nwas the consummate gentleman and treated both Elaine and me with \nkindness unfeigned. We pray that everyone in the Faust family will be \ncomforted in the days and months ahead with peace through their \nmemories of this great man.\n  Beyond his day-to-day duties as a church leader, President Faust led \nopposition to gambling initiatives in Utah, oversaw construction of the \nBYU Jerusalem Center, managed an improved public relations strategy for \nthe church, and enhanced relationships with foreign officials. During \nhis ministry, he saw the Latter-day Saint faith move from primarily one \nof the western United States to a truly worldwide religion.\n  His kindness was not limited to those of his own faith, nor was his \nservice limited to that which he performed inside his church. Before \nPresident Hinckley extended him a call to serve 35 years ago as a \nsenior, full-time\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\nchurch leader, Faust served his country in the military, served his \ncommunity as an attorney, served his State as a legislator, and served \nhis family as a devoted husband and father.\n  A native of a small town in Utah's west desert, Delta, President \nFaust studied at the University of Utah, eventually receiving both a \nbachelor's degree and a law degree. But he interrupted his studies when \nhe was called to his country's defense in World War II, honorably \nserving in the U.S. Army Air Force and earning the rank of first \nlieutenant while opposing the tyranny of the Axis.\n  Beyond his service to America, President Faust also gave 2 years of \nhis youth in service to his church as a missionary in Brazil. He was \none of the first Mormon missionaries to that nation and by sharing his \ntestimony of the Lord gently moved the first pebbles of what has become \na mighty avalanche of faith--today Brazil is home to nearly 1 million \nLatter-day Saints. Later in life, anytime his church service took him \nto Brazil he was extremely happy to be reunited with his friends there. \nIn 1998, Faust was named an honorary citizen of Sao Paulo in honor of \nhis lifelong ties to the city and the nation. Only two other men have \nreceived this recognition--Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama--which \nputs President Faust in very good company.\n  During a short period of leave from the Air Force in the spring of \n1943, President Faust married his high school sweetheart, Ruth Wright, \nin the Salt Lake Temple. The sunrise and the sunset to all his \nhappiness, Ruth walked hand in hand with him for almost 65 years. \nTogether they raised five children: James H. Faust, Janna R. Coombs, \nMarcus G. Faust, Lisa A. Smith, and Robert P. Faust. They were the \nproud grandparents of 25 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.\n  While practicing law, President Faust made time to serve as a member \nof the Utah legislature, an adviser to the American Bar Journal, and as \npresident of the Utah Bar Association. Fellow church leader Elder M. \nRussell Ballard said of Faust that he ``loved America, the state of \nUtah and Salt Lake City.'' He was always examining issues and events \n``for what was right and what needed to be done to see that we were \nworking for the benefit and blessing of the people.''\n  We have lost a friend, we have lost a leader. But we look forward to \na time when we can see his smiling, optimistic face again and hear his \nsoothing, uplifting voice. To President James Esdras Faust the people \nof Utah would like to say, ``Thank you for your time among us. It was \nnot nearly long enough. God be with you, till we meet again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11575-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JIM BILLINGTON\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate Jim Billington on \ntwo decades of service as Librarian of Congress. For 20 years, he has \npresided over this prestigious institution that serves Congress so well \nbut is truly America's national library. It houses documents and \nartifacts that date to the earliest days of our democracy and, at the \nsame time, manages the U.S. Copyright Office that maintains an ongoing \nrecord of America's creative heritage.\n  Jim Billington had a brilliant career in the academic world before \nbeginning his responsibilities at the Library of Congress. He was \nhighly respected at Harvard, at Princeton and, immediately before \nbecoming Librarian of Congress, as director of the Woodrow Wilson \nCenter.\n  Throughout his career, Jim Billington has brought a dynamic integrity \nto the scholarly world. Under his leadership, the Library of Congress \nwas not a dormant collection of books and artifacts. He undertook a new \ninitiative to digitize its collections and make them more accessible \nand more permanent. He also established the Madison Council to bring \noutside support and wise counsel to the Library, and created a center \nfor advanced scholars in the humanities.\n  His tenure as Librarian is noteworthy for his many achievements and \ninnovations, his dedication to the historic role of the Library and its \nunique relationship to Congress, and, most importantly, his \nextraordinary vision of what the Library could become. Through his \nwork, Jim has made unparalleled contributions to enhance the role that \nAmerican culture plays in our national life.\n  On this special anniversary, I commend him for all that he has \naccomplished. I am especially grateful for the support and wise counsel \nhe has given to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. As \nLibrarian of Congress, he has served as a member of the board of \ntrustees for the center for two decades, and has been a source of \nconsistent leadership and guidance throughout that time.\n  All of us in Congress owe Jim Billington an immense debt of gratitude \nfor his outstanding public service, and we look forward to many more \nyears of his leadership. On this 20th anniversary of his becoming \nLibrarian of Congress, I join my colleagues in extending my warmest \ncongratulations and deepest appreciation for his achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11575-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HOWRIGAN FARM\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this \nopportunity to commend longtime friends, Harold and Anne Howrigan and \ntheir sons of Fairfield, VT, whose farm was recently named 2007 Vermont \nDairy Farm of the Year.\n  Harold, his wife Anne and their sons operate two farms comprised of \nmore than 500 head of holstein cattle and some 1,800 acres of cropland \nand forest, including a significant maple sugaring operation. The \nHowrigan farm was selected by University of Vermont Extension and the \nVermont Dairy Industry Association, who described it as an excellent, \nwell managed dairy operation which consistently produces high-quality \nmilk. With some of the farm acreage in the family since the mid 19th \nCentury, the Howrigan family indeed exemplifies a long-term commitment \nto agriculture.\n  As much as he loves the home farm, over the years Harold has spent \nconsiderable time away from the farm serving Vermont agriculture. He \nhas served as president of the Green Mountain Dairy Farmers Federation \nof Cooperatives and as a director with both the Vermont Maple Sugar \nMakers Association and the Vermont Dairy Promotion Council. Harold has \nserved on the St. Albans Cooperative board of directors since 1981 and \nas president from 1988 until stepping down in 2005.\n  At one time or another, Harold was chairperson of the Vermont \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission, chair of the Council of \nNortheast Farmer Cooperatives and chair of the National Dairy Promotion \nand Research Board. He also served on the U.S. Dairy Export Council and \nthe National Milk Producers Federation.\n  With this level of engagement in the interest of dairy farmers and \ntheir industry, it is a tribute to Harold, Anne and their sons to earn \nthis distinguished award. I join my fellow Vermonters in recognizing a \nVermont dairy farm--and family--with its tradition of hard work, common \nsense and love of agriculture as the 2007 Vermont Dairy Farm of the \nYear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11575-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11575-S11576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE GLADSTONE ALL-STAR GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Their \ndetermined and focused efforts throughout the postseason, which began \nin early July with the district tournament in Escanaba, have brought a \nlot of joy and pride to the Gladstone community. I am happy to have \nthis opportunity to recognize this impressive achievement.\n  Gladstone capped a marvelous season with a thrilling come-from-behind \n5-2 victory over an excellent team from Waterford, CT. The game was \ntightly contested throughout and was not decided until the first extra \ninning when Gladstone rallied to score the deciding three runs in the \ntop of the seventh inning to secure a hard fought win. Gladstone \ndisplayed resilience in recovering from a loss the previous day to the \neventual runner-up from Elgin, TX, to record this victory. It takes \npoise, determination, and teamwork to achieve this level of success, \nand I congratulate each member of the team on the way\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\nthey competed throughout the summer. Gladstone now enjoys the \ndistinction of being the third team from Delta County to reach the \nLittle League Softball World Series.\n  Girls Little League Softball, which began in 1974, has provided \ncountless young women an opportunity to compete at a high level. \nThrough the instruction they receive on and off the field, these young \nwomen gain valuable skills that will help them achieve success \nthroughout their lifetime. The 2007 Gladstone All-Star 11-12 year-old \nGirls Softball Team includes Jordan Schwartz, Ashley Hough, Jammie \nBotruff, Heather Sanderson, Jordan Kowalski, Nicole Sharon, Shannon \nWolf, Neena Brockway, Alison Austin, Nikki Barteld, Averi Kanyuh. The \ncoaching staff includes Manager Andrew Schwartz and Assistant Coach \nJohn Nevala.\n  This is a summer these young women will certainly never forget. I \nknow I am joined by their family, friends and supporters, as well as my \ncolleagues in the Senate, in congratulating the entire team on a highly \nsuccessful and memorable season. I look forward to hearing about many \nmore successes from these young ladies in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11576-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CURTIS H. SYKES\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of a \ngreat Arkansan, Curtis H. Sykes, who passed away last week.\n  As a member of the Special Task Force to Study the History and \nContributions of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the U.S. \nCapitol, Mr. Sykes made valuable contributions to the important and \nchallenging work that the task force conducted. As its name indicates, \nthe purpose of the task force is to recognize and preserve the \ncontributions that African Americans made to the construction of the \nCapitol complex. The task force has served as a working memorial to pay \ntribute to those who made an enormous sacrifice to help build the \ngreatest symbol of our Nation's freedom. I was pleased that the task \nforce was developed to include citizen representation, and Curtis Sykes \nwas an integral part of helping us examine those contributions.\n  In addition to his work on the task force, Curtis Sykes was also an \naccomplished historian and respected community leader in Arkansas. Mr. \nSykes served as chairman of the Arkansas Black History Committee since \n1993 and was the first African-American member of the North Little Rock \nHistory Commission. He brought a wealth of experience to the study of \nour great State's history and was an advocate for equality, fairness, \nand justice.\n  Shortly after his graduation from the segregated Scipio A. Jones High \nSchool, located in his hometown of North Little Rock, in 1947, Curtis \nserved our Nation in the U.S. Army from 1950 to 1952. He then pursued a \nlifelong career in education.\n  Prior to retiring in 1985, Curtis worked for 33 years in education as \na teacher, football coach, assistant principal and principal. He was \none of the first African-American principals in the Little Rock school \ndistrict during the 1960s, and after his life in education, he led the \nfight to pass legislation in the Arkansas General Assembly which \nestablished a Black history curriculum in Arkansas schools.\n  He also continued to pursue his passion to help young children learn \nand succeed after retirement through his work in a number of civic and \ncommunity organizations. His activities included offices in the \nArkansas Chapter of the NAACP, the Young YMCA/COPE of Central Arkansas \nand Headstart of Pulaski County.\n  Mr. Sykes earned his bachelor's degree from Arkansas Baptist College \nin Little Rock, Arkansas; a master's from Texas College in Tyler, \nTexas; and his master's in education from Harding University in Searcy, \nAR. In fact, he became the first African American to receive a degree \nfrom Harding in 1962.\n  In addition, Mr. Sykes received a number of honors and awards during \nhis lifetime. He was the recipient of the Salute to Greatness Award \nfrom the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission for his outstanding record \nof community service. He was also recognized by the city of North \nLittle Rock when Mayor Patrick Hays declared a Curtis Sykes Day in 1992 \nto honor his many contributions to the city.\n  Curtis H. Sykes will be greatly missed by communities all across \nArkansas, as well as those he worked with here in Washington, DC. He \nhad an impact on thousands of people from all walks of life, and his \ndeath will leave a void throughout Arkansas.\n  He will not be forgotten, however. The Arkansas History Commission \ncontains the Curtis H. Sykes Collection which includes Scipio High \nyearbooks, past Arkansas Teacher Association journals, and other North \nLittle Rock memorabilia and documents which will enable future \ngenerations to learn about his life and legacy.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, our thoughts and prayers will be with \nfriends and family of the Sykes as they grieve the loss of a true \nArkansas pioneer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11576-2", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING MARY AND BILL KIRCHNER\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I honor two of my constituents on \na very special and rare milestone. Later this month, Mary and Bill \nKirchner of Atlanta will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.\n  Mary and Bill were married on September 28, 1957, in Grosse Pointe, \nMI, bringing together two of that city's longtime families--the \nFitzsimons and the Kirchners. The next 50 years took Mary and Bill from \nMichigan to South Carolina and finally to Georgia, where they have \nlived since 1988.\n  Bill was a homebuilder in Michigan and on Hilton Head Island, SC, and \nlater started his own property rental business on the island. Mary \nstarted her own successful business on Hilton Head called The Welcome \nMat, then switched careers and put her salesmanship to good use selling \nreal estate. When they moved to Atlanta, Mary and Bill decided to try \nan entirely new business venture by opening an antique consignment \nshop. Sixteen years later, Now & Again remains a beautiful and popular \nshop in Buckhead. In fact, my wife Dianne has been a customer. Although \nthey have certainly earned the right to retire, Mary and Bill still run \ntheir shop 6 days a week with the help of a great staff.\n  While their professional lives have been an adventure, Mary and Bill \nmade their biggest life-changing decision early on in their marriage. \nOn a chilly February day in 1964, a nervous Mary and Bill arrived at an \nadoption agency in Michigan hoping to hear that they would be allowed \nto adopt a baby. Instead, the agency asked if Mary and Bill would like \nto go home with 6-month-old twin girls. The shocked couple said yes and \nforever changed the lives of those twins, Sarah and Joan, for the \nbetter.\n  Their daughter Sarah is now married to Stephen Midas and works as a \nstay-at-home mom to four children in Chesapeake, VA, and also does some \nbookkeeping for Mary and Bill's shop. Their daughter Joan and her \ndaughter live in Washington, DC, and Joan has gone from covering \npolitics as an AP reporter in Atlanta to now working for some of those \nsame elected officials she used to cover. I happen to be one of those, \nand Joan now serves on my staff in Washington. I know Mary and Bill are \nvery proud of both their daughters.\n  I join with Joan, Sarah, Stephen and their children--Alex, Ben, Anna, \nJosie and Isabel--in congratulating Mary and Bill Kirchner on reaching \ntheir golden anniversary. Their marriage and their commitment to each \nother is an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11576-3", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11576-S11577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT RELATIVE TO THE STATUS OF EACH OF THE 18 IRAQI BENCHMARKS, AS \n   RECEIVED DURING RECESS OF THE SENATE ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2007--PM 25\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 1314 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' \nCare, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, \n2007 (Public Law 110-28) (the ``Act''), attached is a report that \nassesses the status of each of the 18 Iraqi benchmarks contained in the \nAct and declares whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\nbenchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n  The second of two reports submitted consistent with the Act, it has \nbeen prepared in consultation with the Secretaries of State and \nDefense; the Commander, Multi-National Force-Iraq; the United States \nAmbassador to Iraq; and the Commander, United States Central Command.\n                                                      George W.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas urging Congress to provide drought \n     relief to Texas; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 67\n\n       Whereas, the State of Texas continues to endure substantial \n     economic losses due to a prolonged drought that has crippled \n     the state for nearly two years; the loss of crops and \n     livestock and drought-induced fires have left the state's \n     farmers and ranchers in desperate need of continued federal \n     assistance to offset the losses suffered as a result of this \n     natural disaster; and\n       Whereas, the drought has cost the state nearly $2.5 billion \n     in total crop loss, more than $1 billion of which is \n     attributed to a decrease in the cotton harvest, the state's \n     number one cash crop; in addition, the latest forecasts for \n     2006 show the state's wheat harvest has decreased by more \n     than 60 percent, corn production is down by 26 percent, \n     soybean production has decreased by more than 30 percent, and \n     the state's production of peanuts and sorghum is expected to \n     be down by 40 percent; and\n       Whereas, an estimated $1.6 billion in livestock losses, as \n     well as the rising cost of hay and supplemental feed, have \n     forced any ranchers to sell their cattle earlier than \n     anticipated, which will undoubtedly cause a decrease in the \n     beef supply for several years; all told, the total \n     agricultural loss to the state stands at more than $4 \n     billion; and\n       Whereas, this dire economic impact is shared by the \n     businesses that support the agriculture community, \n     specifically those in rural areas, where projections estimate \n     the loss to be nearly $8 billion; the businesses affected \n     include those that provide equipment or machinery, supplies, \n     feed, and professional services such as veterinarians; and\n       Whereas, adding insult to injury, the drought has resulted \n     in more than 21,000 fires, burning in excess of two million \n     acres between January and November, 2006, and contributing to \n     the loss of 5,000 miles of fence and 5,000 cattle in the \n     Panhandle alone; the fires 1n the northern regions of the \n     state have certainly contributed to the diminution in hay \n     production, and the United States Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) estimates that 77 percent of Texas' hay production was \n     lost during the same period; and\n       Whereas, to alleviate this financial burden, the Texas \n     Department of Agriculture will administer a total of $16.1 \n     million in assistance received from the USDA to eligible \n     livestock producers in 216 drought-stressed counties, but \n     with more than $12 billion in total economic loss as a direct \n     result of the drought, more assistance is needed; the \n     devastation to crops and livestock in the number two \n     agricultural state in the nation has put a financial strain \n     on Texas farmers and ranchers, and it is imperative that the \n     federal government continue to assist the individuals and \n     families that have suffered during this time; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the 80th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     provide further drought relief to Texas; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-203.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging the federal \n     government to meet all of the financial obligations of the GI \n     Bill; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 123\n\n       Whereas, on June 22, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     signed the ``Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944'', better \n     known as the ``GI Bill of Rights''; and\n       Whereas, the bill at first was the subject of intense \n     debate and parliamentary maneuvering, but has since been \n     recognized as one of Congress' most important acts; and\n       Whereas, during the past five decades, the law has made \n     possible the investment of billions of dollars in education \n     and training for millions of veterans, and the nation has in \n     return earned many times that investment in increased taxes \n     and a dramatically changed society; and\n       Whereas, the law also made possible the loan of billions of \n     dollars to purchase homes for millions of veterans and helped \n     to transform the majority of Americans from renters to \n     homeowners; and\n       Whereas, the 1944 GI Bill provided six benefits: education \n     and training; loan guarantees for a home, farm, or business; \n     unemployment pay; job-finding assistance; top priority for \n     building materials for VA hospitals; and military review of \n     dishonorable discharges; the home loan program is the only \n     feature of the original bill that is still in force; and\n       Whereas, the original GI Bill ended in 1956, but subsequent \n     GI Bills have continued the original bill's education and \n     training benefits; the bill currently in effect is the \n     Montgomery GI Bill, which provides benefits for veterans who \n     served after July 1, 1985, and for military reservists; and\n       Whereas, in signing the original GI Bill, President \n     Roosevelt stated that the Bill ``gives emphatic notice to the \n     men and women in our armed forces that the American people do \n     not intend to let them down''; and\n       Whereas, our servicemen and women have sacrificed much for \n     our country, and continued funding of GI Bill benefits is \n     imperative to ensure that they are treated with the respect \n     they deserve: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Fifth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, that we urge \n     the federal government to meet all of the financial \n     obligations of the GI Bill; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to \n     President George W. Bush, federal Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs Jim Nicholson, each member of the Illinois \n     Congressional delegation, and the Director of the Illinois \n     Department of Veterans' Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-205. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to enact H.R. 2927; to the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 89\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 sets tough fuel economy standards \n     without off ramps or loopholes, by requiring separate car and \n     truck standards to meet a total fleet fuel economy between 32 \n     and 35 mpg by 2022--an increase of as much as 40 percent over \n     current fuel economy standards--and requires vehicle fuel\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\n     economy to be increased to the maximum feasible level in the \n     years leading up to 2022; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927, while challenging, will provide \n     automakers more reasonable lead time to implement technology \n     changes in both the near and long term. Model year 2008 \n     vehicles are already available today, and product and \n     manufacturing planning is done through model year 2012. H.R. \n     2927 recognizes the critical need for engineering lead times \n     necessary for manufacturers to make significant changes to \n     their fleets; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 respects consumer choice by protecting \n     the important functional differences between passenger cars \n     and light trucks/SUVs. Last year, 2006, was the sixth year in \n     a row that Americans bought more trucks, minivans, and SUVs \n     than passenger cars because they value attributes such as \n     passenger and cargo load capacity, four-wheel drive, and \n     towing capability that most cars are not designed to provide; \n     and\n       Whereas, While some would like fuel economy increases to be \n     much more aggressive and be implemented with much less lead \n     time, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards must be \n     set at levels and in time frames that do not impose economic \n     harm on the manufacturers, suppliers, dealers, and others in \n     the auto industry; and\n       Whereas, Proponents of unrealistic and unattainable CAFE \n     standards cite Europe's 35 mpg fuel economy, without ever \n     mentioning Europe's $6 per gallon gasoline prices, the high \n     sales of diesel vehicles, the high proportion of Europeans \n     driving manual transmission vehicles (80 percent in Europe \n     vs. 8 percent in the U.S.), the significant differences in \n     the size mix of vehicles, or that trucks and SUVs are \n     virtually nonexistent among Europe households; and\n       Whereas, Proponents of unreasonable CAFE standards claim \n     they will save consumers billions, but they neglect to talk \n     about the upfront costs of such changes to the manufacturers \n     of meeting unduly strict CAFE standards--more than $100 \n     billion, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration--which will lead to vehicle price increases of \n     several thousand dollars; and\n       Whereas, Proponents of unrealistic CAFE standards ignore \n     the potential safety impacts of downsized vehicles on \n     America's highways and overlook the historical role and \n     critical importance of manufacturing plants to our national \n     and economic security. They seem unconcerned about threats to \n     the 7.5 million jobs that are directly and indirectly \n     dependent on a vibrant auto industry in the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2927 is a reasonable bill that balances a \n     number of important public policy concerns. The bill \n     represents a tough but fair compromise that deserves serious \n     consideration and support: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to enact H.R. 2927, which responsibly \n     balances achievable fuel economy increases with important \n     economic and social concerns, including consumer demand; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-206. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress to \n     support funding for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery \n     Program; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 395\n\n       Whereas, the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program \n     (UPARR) is a matching federal grant program administered by \n     the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior; \n     and\n       Whereas, the purpose of the program is to provide funding \n     for the rehabilitation of parks and recreation areas in \n     cities and urban communities; and\n       Whereas, since the establishment of the program in 1978, \n     approximately 1500 individual grants totaling more than \n     $270,000,000 have been made to eligible cities and counties; \n     and\n       Whereas, no funds have been appropriated under UPARR for \n     the past 5 years; and\n       Whereas, urban park development is essential for economic \n     revitalization, environmental stewardship, and public \n     recreation; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Fifth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge \n     the Congress of the United States of America to support \n     funding for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, \n     the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and each \n     member of the Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-207. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     State of California urging Congress to reauthorize and fund \n     the federal Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act of 2000; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 3\n\n       Whereas, from 1908 to 2000, counties in the United States \n     received 25 percent of the revenues generated on national \n     forest lands in lieu of lost tax revenues that could have \n     been generated had these lands remained in private hands; and\n       Whereas, in the 1990s, the volume and value of timber \n     harvested on national forest lands was dramatically reduced, \n     which led Congress to enact the federal Secure Rural Schools \n     and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, which provided \n     a six-year guarantee payment option that was independent of \n     the revenue generated on the national forest lands; and\n       Whereas, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n     Determination Act of 2000, as extended by the United States \n     Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq \n     Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 110-28), \n     will expire on September 30, 2007, which would create a lapse \n     in funding to critical programs in schools and counties \n     across the United States, including California, in the coming \n     years; and\n       Whereas, rural schools are dependent on federal revenue-\n     sharing programs, including federal forest payments, for \n     maintaining vital educational services and programs, and to \n     ensure an equitable education for all students; and\n       Whereas, many of California's county public works programs \n     will be crippled without stable, predictable, long-term \n     funding from the act, causing the local road network to \n     suffer long-term degradation and putting communities at risk \n     for public safety emergencies due to cuts in staffing and \n     operational activities; and\n       Whereas, a number of efforts are being made in both the \n     Untied States House of Representatives and the United States \n     Senate to fully reauthorize the act through 2011, and the \n     Legislature strongly supports these efforts; now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully urges the 110th Congress to \n     reauthorize and fund the federal Secure Rural Schools and \n     Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 to provide a long-\n     term, stable source of funding for schools and counties to \n     maintain vital programs prior to September 30, 2007, to avoid \n     any interruption in county services and school operations; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-208.

Saginaw \n     Bay is one of the most polluted areas in the Great Lakes. \n     Historic and ongoing inputs of excessive nutrients, toxic \n     contaminants, and overabundant sediments exacerbated by low \n     water levels have led to the proliferation of undesirable \n     nuisance plants and algae, degradation of shoreline areas, \n     loss of fishery habitant, and impairment of fish and wildlife \n     populations; and\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\n       Whereas, Saginaw Bay remains a vital resource for about \n     500,000 residents who use its waters and shoreline for \n     recreation, drinking water, and other activities. The public \n     health and safety of these residents and the economic \n     vitality of local communities are threatened by the ongoing \n     environmental problems facing Saginaw Bay. Increased \n     coordination and partnerships with local leaders and citizens \n     directly affected by Saginaw Bay's health are needed to \n     restore the bay and realize its full potential as a vibrant \n     coastal area; and\n       Whereas, the Saginaw Bay Coastal Initiative (SBCI) will \n     support innovative regional approaches for enhancing resource \n     protection, improving environmental quality, and expanding \n     local tourism and economic development within the Saginaw Bay \n     coastal area. With appropriate funding, the initiative will \n     create new partnerships among federal, state, and local \n     groups and enhance local participation and responsibility in \n     resolving environmental and economic challenges and \n     determining the future of Saginaw Bay; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to provide funding for the Saginaw Bay Coastal \n     Initiative; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-210. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas urging Congress to enact legislation to \n     eliminate the 24-month Medicare waiting period for \n     participants in Social Security Disability Insurance; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 35\n\n       Whereas, created in 1965, the federal Medicare program \n     provides health insurance coverage for more than 40 million \n     Americans; although most of those enrolled in Medicare are \n     senior citizens, approximately six million enrollees under \n     the age of 65 have qualified because of permanent and severe \n     disability, such as spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, \n     cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other illness or disorder; \n     and\n       Whereas, despite the physical and financial hardships \n     wrought by these conditions and the fact that Social Security \n     Disability Insurance (SSDI) is designed for individuals with \n     a work history who paid into the social security system \n     before the onset of their disability, federal law mandates a \n     24-month waiting period from the time a disabled individual \n     first receives SSDI benefits to the time Medicare coverage \n     begins; a prerequisite to Medicare, the SSDI program itself \n     delays benefits for five months while the person's disability \n     is determined--effectively creating a 29-month waiting period \n     for Medicare; and\n       Whereas, this restriction affects a significant number of \n     Americans in need; as of January 2002, there were \n     approximately 1.2 million disabled individuals who qualified \n     for SSDI and were awaiting Medicare coverage, many of whom \n     were unemployed because of their disability; consequently, \n     under these conditions, by the time Medicare began, an \n     estimated 77 percent of those individuals would be poor or \n     nearly poor, 45 percent would have incomes below the federal \n     poverty line, and close to 40 percent would be enrolled in \n     state Medicaid programs; and\n       Whereas, furthermore, it has been estimated that as many as \n     one-third of the individuals currently awaiting coverage may \n     be uninsured and likely to incur significant medical care \n     expenses during the two-year waiting period, often with \n     devastating consequences; studies indicate that the uninsured \n     are likely to delay or forgo needed care, leading to \n     worsening health and even premature death, and the American \n     Medical Association has determined that death rates among \n     SSDI recipients are highest in the first 24 months of \n     enrollment; and\n       Whereas, eliminating the 24-month waiting period not only \n     would prevent worsening illness and disability for SSDI \n     beneficiaries, thereby reducing more costly future medical \n     needs and potential long-term reliance on public health care \n     programs, but could also save the Medicaid program as much as \n     $4.3 billion at 2002 program levels, including nearly $1.8 \n     billion in savings to states and $2.5 billion in federal \n     savings that would help offset a substantial portion of the \n     accompanying increase in Medicare expenditures; and\n       Whereas, recognizing the consequences of the waiting period \n     to those suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), \n     or Lou Gehrig's disease, the 106th United States Congress \n     passed H.R. 5661 in 2000 and eliminated the requirement for \n     enrollees diagnosed with the disease; in passing H.R. 5661, \n     the Congress acknowledged the enormous difficulties faced by \n     those diagnosed with severe disabilities and established \n     precedent for the exception to be extended to all the \n     disabled on the Medicare waiting list; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 80th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the United States Congress to enact \n     legislation to eliminate the 24-month Medicare waiting period \n     for participants in Social Security Disability Insurance; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and the president of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and all the members of the Texas delegation to the \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-211.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico expressing its support of the \n     financing of the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     through available federal funds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 3259\n\n       The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), \n     Public Law 105-33, as amended, and known as the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997, provides block grants to states for \n     health care insurance coverage for uninsured children under \n     18 years of age and who fall on or below 200% of the poverty \n     level established by the Federal Government (FPL) or as \n     established by the state governments. The states may provide \n     this coverage by expanding Medicaid benefits, by expanding or \n     creating a children's health insurance program or by a \n     combination of both.\n       In June 1998, the Health Care Finance Administration \n     (HCFA), presently known as the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS), authorized the implementation of the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in Puerto \n     Rico. This new program constitutes an expansion of the \n     Medical Assistance Program (MEDICAID), which originally \n     established the Program for a ten (10) year period, which \n     concludes in August 2007.\n       The Children's Health Insurance Program provides coverage \n     to children between the ages of 0-18 who fall below 200% of \n     the poverty level and not eligible for Medicaid and who do \n     not have private medical insurance because their parents' \n     income does not allow for it.\n       The Children's Health Insurance Program provides preventive \n     service, hospitalization services, medical services, surgical \n     services, mental health services, diagnostic tests, clinical \n     laboratory tests, outpatient rehabilitation services, dental \n     services, pharmacy services and ambulance services. It also \n     offers childcare services from birth to 18 years of age, \n     including vaccinations according to their age. It further \n     provides physical, mental, dental health and nutrition \n     education and counseling. The Medical Assistance Program of \n     the Department of Health of Puerto Rico receives a grant \n     through legislation of the United States Congress that is \n     matched in fifty percent with state funds; from the total \n     funds, an amount of up to 15 percent may be used for the \n     administration of the Program and the remainder is \n     distributed for the payment of direct services to patients.\n       The SCHIP must be reauthorized by the Federal Government on \n     or before September 2007, in order for it to be able to \n     continue operating and providing services to millions of \n     children in the United States, including those of Puerto \n     Rico. It further provides $48.1 million in benefits (a 23% \n     increase since 2006) to low income children who do not meet \n     the Medicaid requirements. Although Puerto Rico does not \n     receive parity, as the other states do, these funds have \n     benefited low income children.\n       The Senate of Puerto Rico recognizes the importance of the \n     SCHIP in Puerto Rico for the welfare of children, for the \n     prevention and treatment of childhood diseases, and for \n     reducing the general costs of health care. It also exhorts \n     the Government of Puerto Rico to use all resources available \n     so that the children of our Island who are under the poverty \n     level may have access to these health services.\n\n\n              BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF PUERTO RICO:\n\n       Section 1.--To express the support of the Senate of Puerto \n     Rico to the financing of the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) through available federal funds, \n     and to exhort the United States Congress to assure an \n     increase in federal funds for the SCHIP, including the \n     territories, as well as Puerto Rico.\n       Section 2.--A copy of this Resolution translated into \n     English, shall be remitted to the President of the United \n     States, to the Leaders of the Minority and Majority in both \n     Chambers of Congress, to the Governor of the Commonwealth of \n     Puerto Rico and to the Resident Commissioner in Washington.\n       Section 3.--This Resolution shall take effect immediately \n     after its approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-214.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     increase efforts to provide assistance in the Darfur region \n     of Sudan; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 59\n\n       Whereas, over the past few years, the government of Sudan \n     and the government-backed militia have carried out a campaign \n     of murder, rape, and terror in the Darfur region. More than \n     1.5 million people are estimated to have been displaced from \n     their homes, while tens of thousands of civilians have been \n     killed or pushed into disease and malnutrition. A 2004 cease-\n     fire agreement has proven ineffective, and the conditions for \n     those who have been displaced can only be described as a \n     nightmare; and\n       Whereas, the United States, the United Nations, the African \n     Union, and other nations and organizations have largely \n     ignored the grave human rights violations and suffering that \n     are taking place. The situation in the Darfur region is \n     acknowledged to be ethnic cleansing and may amount to \n     genocide; and\n       Whereas, while the United States and other countries have \n     tried to bring a halt to the suffering, a greater sense of \n     urgency needs to be brought to these efforts. Our country \n     must do all it can to influence the leadership of the United \n     Nations to increase the number of troops on the ground to \n     protect civilians and to bring pressure on the Sudanese \n     government to halt its illegal and immoral acts. Clearly, the \n     United States must play a leadership role in working with \n     other nations, the United Nations, and the African Union in \n     the effort to bring relief to this region of sorrows: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the United \n     States State Department to increase efforts to halt the \n     violence and to provide humanitarian assistance to the \n     victims of the atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the United \n     States Secretary of State, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-218.

The heartbreaking atrocities being carried out by the \n     Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militia, which were \n     acknowledged to be genocide by the Bush administration in \n     2004, clearly cannot be brought to a halt by diplomatic means \n     or by the weight of criticism from around the world; and\n       Whereas, with each report of tribal massacre, rape, and \n     unspeakable cruelty, the need for effective action grows. \n     Many are reminded of the pressures that were brought to bear \n     upon the South African system of apartheid a generation ago \n     by a rising tide of economic sanctions from the United States \n     and other countries; and\n       Whereas, it is long past time for the United States to put \n     in place formal measures to halt the flow of American dollars \n     to any entity or business that works with the Sudanese \n     government in any capacity other than those that are purely \n     humanitarian or peacekeeping in nature. Government contracts \n     and pension funds must not be going to businesses or entities \n     operating in the Sudan. American businesses dealing with the \n     Sudanese government should disclose their actions. It is a \n     moral imperative that we must make every possible effort to \n     stop the atrocities so that a long-term solution to the \n     region's problems can be found: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to prohibit federal funds from going to any \n     business or entity that works with the Sudanese government in \n     any capacity other than solely humanitarian or peacekeeping \n     efforts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-219.

For FY 2006, funding was only \n     at seventeen and eight-tenths percent (17.8%) of the national \n     average per pupil expenditure, still well below the forty \n     percent (40%) federal contribution commitment; and\n       Whereas, local school districts in Rhode Island and \n     throughout the United States are mandated to meet the \n     spiraling costs of carrying out the provisions of IDEA; and\n       Whereas, the failure of the Congress of the United States \n     to fully fund its original commitment of forty percent (40%) \n     federal funding has placed a severe burden upon local school \n     districts to meet the costs of the federal mandate, resulting \n     in an insufferable burden upon local taxpayers and diversion \n     of funds from other education programs, thus lessening the \n     quality of education; and\n       Whereas, more than thirty years after the enactment of \n     IDEA, it is time that the Congress of the United States \n     appropriate the funds necessary to fully fund its original \n     commitment to provide forty percent (40%) federal funding of \n     the costs incurred carrying out the provisions of IDEA: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That this House of Representatives of the State \n     of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to fulfill the \n     original commitment of the Congress of the United States to \n     provide for forty percent (40%) federal funding to local \n     school districts to carry out the mandates of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit duly certified copies of \n     this resolution to: (1) each member of the Rhode Island \n     delegation in the Congress of the United States; (2) the \n     President of the United States; (3) the President of the \n     Senate in the Congress of the United States; (4) the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United \n     States; (5) the Chairmen of the Health, Education, Labor and \n     Pensions Committees in the Senate in the Congress of the \n     United States; and (6) the Chairmen of the Education and the \n     Workforce Committees in the House of Representatives in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-220.

to the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 622\n\n       Whereas, legislation has been introduced in previous years \n     to provide free mailing privileges for letters and packages \n     to American troops overseas; two bills have been introduced \n     into the 109th Congress--H.R. 923 and H.R. 2874 (H.R. 2874 \n     supersedes H.R. 887, a very similar bill introduced by former \n     Representative Harold Ford on February 17, 2005); and\n       Whereas, H.R. 923, the Mailing Support to Troops Act of \n     2005 (introduced on February 17, 2005 by Representative \n     Fossella, with 71 current cosponsors), in its original form \n     would allow family members of service personnel to mail \n     letters and packages free of charge to active members of the \n     military serving in Afghanistan or Iraq and to servicemen and \n     women hospitalized as a result of disease or injury suffered \n     in Afghanistan or Iraq; mailers would need only to write on \n     the envelope or box, ``Free Matter for Member of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States'', or words to that effect \n     specified by the Postal Service (USPS); mail matter that \n     contains any advertising would specifically be excluded; H.R. \n     923 would authorize appropriations to reimburse USPS for its \n     extra expenses in transporting such mail; H.R. 923 was \n     referred to the Committee on Government Reform; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2874, the Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2005, \n     was introduced by Representative Ford on June 14, 2005, and \n     had 31 cosponsors; it would attempt to make it easier for \n     families and charities to ship letters and packages to \n     soldiers serving in combat zones; soldiers mobilizing for \n     overseas duty would be given an allotment of special stamps \n     (equivalent in value to $150 per calendar quarter) that they \n     can send to their loved ones, or to selected charities, to \n     allow them to send letters and packages without further \n     postage to the service members; there would be a 10-pound \n     limit on packages sent to individuals; the Postal Service \n     would be reimbursed by the Defense Department for providing \n     this service, and Section 3 of the bill would authorize \n     appropriations to the Defense Department for this purpose and \n     for any other expenses it incurs; by putting individual \n     service men and women into the authorization chain for the \n     mail they receive this bill would avoid the problem of \n     subsidizing unsolicited mail to the troops; additionally, by \n     capping the allotment per service member, it would mitigate \n     potential stress on the military postal system; H.R. 2874 was \n     referred to the Committees on Armed Services and Government \n     Reform; and\n       Whereas, on September 29, 2005, the House Committee on \n     Government Reform marked up H.R. 923, and in doing so, \n     accepted an amendment in the nature of a substitute that \n     adopted the core concept, as well as the title, of H.R. 2874; \n     as amended and ordered to be reported by voice vote of the \n     Committee, H.R. 923 requires the Department of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Postal Service, to establish a one-year \n     program under which qualified members of the armed services \n     would receive a monthly voucher that can be redeemed, by \n     their families or friends, to pay the postal expenses of \n     sending one letter or parcel (weighing up to 15 pounds) to \n     the service member; the Department of Defense would reimburse \n     the Postal Service for the postal benefits provided by the \n     vouchers; Committee Chairman Tom Davis said that the \n     substitute language had the approval of Representative \n     Fossella, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Postal \n     Service; the Congressional Budget Office estimated that \n     nearly all of the about 145,000 American service personnel \n     who would be eligible for the postage benefit would take \n     advantage of it, and assigned it a budget cost of $30 million \n     over fiscal years 2006 and 2007; and\n       Whereas, the language of H.R. 923 was added by the House \n     Armed Services Committee as Sections 575, 576 (``Funding''), \n     and 577 (``Duration'') to H.R. 5122, the Sonny Montgomery \n     National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal Year 2007; H.R. \n     5122 was passed by the House on May 11, 2006; on June 22, \n     2006, the Senate substituted its own defense authorization \n     language for the House language and passed H.R. 5122; the \n     Senate version does not contain the postal benefits \n     authorized in the House bill, so whether the language \n     survives is now a matter to be decided by the conference \n     committee; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Fifth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge \n     the Congress of the United States to pass legislation that \n     would allow not-for-profit organizations and family members \n     to mail without charge, twice per month, on the first and \n     15th day of each month, letters and packages to members of \n     the U.S. Armed Services in combat zones; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, \n     the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and each \n     member of the Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-223.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Missouri urging Congress to \n     repeal the REAL ID Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas in May 2005, the United States Congress enacted the \n     REAL ID Act of 2005 as part of the Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and \n     Tsunami Relief Act (PL 109-13), which was signed by President \n     Bush on May 11, 2005, and which becomes effective May 11, \n     2008; and\n       Whereas some of the requirements of the REAL ID Act are \n     that states shall:\n       (1) Issue a driver's license or state identification card \n     in a uniform format, containing uniform information, as \n     prescribed by the federal Department of Homeland Security;\n       (2) Verify the issuance, validity, and completeness of all \n     primary documents used to issue a driver's license, such as \n     those showing that the bearer is a United States citizen or a \n     lawful alien, a lawful refugee, or a person holding a valid \n     visa;\n       (3) Provide for secure storage of all primary documents \n     that are used to issue a federally approved driver's license \n     or state identification card;\n       (4) Provide fraudulent document recognition training to all \n     persons engaged in issuing driver's licenses or state \n     identification cards; and\n       (5) Issue a driver's license or state identification card \n     in a prescribed format if it is a license or card that does \n     not meet the criteria provided for a federally approved \n     license or identification card; and\n       Whereas use of the federal minimum standards for state \n     driver's licenses and state-issued identification cards will \n     be necessary for any type of federally regulated activity for \n     which an identification card must be displayed, including \n     flying in a commercial airplane, making transactions with a \n     federally licensed bank, entering building, or making \n     application for federally supported public assistance \n     benefits, including Social Security; and\n       Whereas some of the intended privacy requirements of the \n     REAL ID Act, such as the use of common machine-readable \n     technology and state maintenance of a database that can be \n     shared with the United States government and agencies of \n     other states, may actually make it more likely that a \n     federally required driver's license or state identification \n     card, or the information about the bearer on which the \n     license or card is based, will be stolen, sold, or otherwise \n     used for purposes that were never intended or that are \n     criminally related than if the REAL ID Act had not been \n     enacted; and\n       Whereas these potential breaches in privacy that could \n     result directly from compliance with the REAL ID Act may \n     violate the right to privacy secured in the Missouri \n     Constitution, for thousands of residents of Missouri; and\n       Whereas the American Association of Motor Vehicle \n     Administrators, the National Governors' Association, and the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures have estimated, in \n     an impact analysis dated September 2006, that the cost to the \n     states to implement the REAL ID Act will be more than $11 \n     billion over 5 years, and it is estimated that the \n     implementation of the REAL ID Act will cost Missouri millions \n     to fully implement the Act, none of such costs being paid for \n     by the federal government; and\n       Whereas for all of these reasons, the American Association \n     of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the National Governors' \n     Association, and the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures, in a letter dated March 17, 2005, to the \n     majority and minority leaders of the United States Senate, \n     opposed the adoption of the REAL ID Act, but the opposition \n     of those groups, and the groups' request that Congress rely \n     on driver's license security provisions already passed by \n     Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004, was largely ignored by Congress; and\n       Whereas the regulations that are to be adopted by the U.S. \n     Department of Homeland Security to implement the requirements \n     of the REAL ID Act have yet to be adopted and, in reality, \n     will probably not become effective until the Spring of 2007, \n     effectively giving the states only one year in which to \n     become familiar with the implementing regulations and comply \n     with those regulations and the requirements of the REAL ID \n     Act; and\n       Whereas the mandate to the states, through federal \n     legislation that provides no funding for its requirements, to \n     issue what is, in effect, a national identification card \n     appears to be an attempt to ``commandeer'' the political \n     machinery of the states and to require the states to be \n     agents of the federal government, in violation of the \n     principles of federalism contained in the Tenth Amendment to \n     the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the United \n     States Supreme Court in New York v. United States, 488 U.S. \n     1041 (1992), United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and \n     Priniz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997):\n       Whereas state legislatures in Georgia, Massachusetts, \n     Montana, New Mexico, New Hampshire, and Washington, have, \n     through legislation or resolutions, opposed the \n     implementation of the REAL ID Act; and\n       Whereas the Missouri General Assembly affirms its \n     abhorrence of and opposition to global terrorism, and affirms \n     its commitment to protecting the civil rights and civil \n     liberties of all Missouri residents and opposes any measures, \n     including the REAL ID Act, that unconstitutionally infringe \n     upon those civil rights and civil liberties: now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the House of Representatives, \n     Ninety-Fourth General Assembly, First Regular Session, the \n     Senate concurring therein, hereby calls on Congress to repeal \n     the REAL ID Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives be instructed to prepare properly inscribed \n     copies of this resolution and be immediately transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States; \n     the President of the United States Senate; the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives; and each member of Congress from \n     the State of Missouri.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-225. A joint resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois supporting the \n     campaign against terrorism; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        Joint Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, the State of Illinois recognizes the Constitution \n     of the United States as our charter of liberty and that the \n     Bill of Rights enshrines the fundamental and inalienable \n     rights of Americans, including the freedoms of privacy and \n     from unreasonable searches; and\n       Whereas, each of Illinois' duly elected public servants has \n     sworn to defend and uphold the United States Constitution and \n     the Constitution of the State of Illinois; and\n       Whereas, the State of Illinois denounces and condemns all \n     acts of terrorism by any entity, wherever the acts occur; and\n       Whereas, terrorist attacks against Americans, such as those \n     that occurred on September 11, 2001, have necessitated the \n     crafting of effective laws to protect citizens of the United \n     States and others from terrorist attacks; and\n       Whereas, any new security measures of federal, state, and \n     local governments should be carefully designed and employed \n     to enhance public safety without infringing on the civil \n     liberties and rights of innocent citizens of Illinois and the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, the federal Real ID Act of 2005 creates a national \n     identification card by requiring uniform information be \n     placed on every state drivers' license, requiring this \n     information to be machine-readable in a standard format and \n     requiring this card for any federal purpose including air \n     travel; and\n       Whereas, Real ID will be a costly unfunded mandate on the \n     State with the National Governors' Association, the National \n     Conference of State Legislators, and the American Association \n     of Motor Vehicle Administrators estimating that Real ID will \n     cost at least $11 billion nationally over the next 5 years; \n     and\n       Whereas, Real ID requires the creation of a massive public \n     sector database containing the drivers' license information \n     on every American, accessible to every state motor vehicle \n     employee and state and federal law enforcement officer; and\n       Whereas, Real ID enables the creation of an additional \n     massive private sector database of drivers' license \n     information gained from scanning the machine-readable \n     information contained on every driver's license; and\n       Whereas, these public and private databases are certain to \n     contain numerous errors and false information, creating \n     significant hardship for Americans attempting to verify their \n     identity in order to fly, open a bank account, or perform any \n     of the numerous functions required to live in the United \n     States today; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Trade Commission estimates that 10 \n     million Americans are victims of identity theft annually and \n     these thieves are increasingly targeting motor vehicle \n     departments, Real ID will enable the crime of identity theft \n     by making the personal information of all Americans including \n     name, date of birth, gender, driver's license or \n     identification card number, digital photograph, address, and \n     signature accessible from tens of thousands of locations; and\n       Whereas, Real ID requires the drivers' licenses to contain \n     actual home addresses in all cases and makes no provision for \n     securing personal information for individuals in potential \n     danger such as undercover police officers and victims of \n     stalking or criminal harassment; and\n       Whereas, Real ID contains no exemption for religion, limits \n     religious liberty, and tramples the beliefs of groups such as \n     the Amish and some Evangelical Christians; and\n       Whereas, Real ID contains onerous record verification and \n     retention provisions that place unreasonable burdens on both \n     state Driver Services offices and on third parties required \n     to verify records; and\n       Whereas, Real ID will likely place enormous burdens on \n     consumers seeking a new driver's license including longer \n     lines, higher costs, increased document requests, and a \n     waiting period; and\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n\n       Whereas, Real ID will put under-resourced motor vehicle \n     administration staff on the front lines of immigration \n     enforcement by forcing them to determine citizenship status, \n     increasing the potential for discrimination based on race and \n     ethnicity, and placing an excessive burden on foreign-born \n     license applicants and motor vehicle staff; and\n       Whereas, Real ID was passed without sufficient deliberation \n     by Congress and never received a hearing by any Congressional \n     committee or any vote solely on its own merits; and\n       Whereas, Real ID eliminated a process of negotiated \n     rulemaking initiated under the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which had convened federal, \n     state, and local policy makers, privacy advocates, and \n     industry experts to solve the problem of misuse in identity \n     documents; and\n       Whereas, more than 600 organizations opposed the passage of \n     Real ID including the American Civil Liberties Union of \n     Illinois; and\n       Whereas, Real ID would provide little security benefit and \n     still leave identification systems open to insider fraud, \n     counterfeit documentation, and database failures: Therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Fifth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, the Senate \n     concurring herein, That the Illinois General Assembly \n     supports the Government of the United States in its campaign \n     against terrorism and affirms the commitment of the United \n     States that the campaign not be waged at the expense of \n     essential civil rights and liberties of citizens of this \n     country that are protected in the United States Constitution \n     and the Bill of Rights; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Illinois General Assembly \n     oppose any portion of the Real ID Act that violates the \n     rights and liberties guaranteed under the Illinois \n     Constitution or the United States Constitution, including the \n     Bill of Rights; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Illinois General Assembly urges the \n     Illinois Congressional delegation in the United States \n     Congress to support measures to repeal the Real ID Act of \n     2005; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be delivered to \n     President George W.

Roosevelt for the vital \n     military contribution and service in every invasion from \n     Normandy to Okinawa, the merchant mariners were excluded from \n     the GI Bill of Rights enacted in 1945, and for 43 years the \n     U.S. government denied them benefits ranging from housing to \n     health care until Congress awarded them veterans' status in \n     1988--too late for 125,000 mariners to benefit, roughly half \n     of those who had served; moreover, these merchant mariners \n     continue to be denied veterans' benefits under the Social \n     Security Act; and\n       Whereas, the Belated Thank You to the Merchant Mariners of \n     World War II Act of 2005 appropriately honors the service of \n     World War II merchant mariners and attempts to rectify the \n     previous denial of financial benefits by providing a monthly \n     monetary benefit, from the U.S. Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, for each Merchant Marine World War II veteran, or \n     surviving spouse, and bestowing veteran status upon them \n     under the Social Security Act, qualifying these brave \n     individuals for Social Security veterans' benefits: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 80th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     support the\n\n[[Page S11585]]\n\n     Belated Thank You to the Merchant Mariners of World War II \n     Act of 2005; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n\n         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2007, \nthe following reports of committees were submitted on September 14, \n2007.\n       By Mr. BYRD (for Mr. Inouye), from the Committee on \n     Appropriations, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       H.R. 3222.

The act would eliminate an inequity in current law \nby allowing all court-martialed U.S. service-members who face \ndismissal, discharge or confinement for a year or more to petition the \nU.S. Supreme Court for discretionary review through a writ of \ncertiorari.\n  The bill is a simple one, and would do the following: It would allow \na writ of certiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces has denied review; and it would allow a \nwrit of certiorari to be filed in any case in which the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces has denied a petition for extraordinary \nrelief.\n  All persons convicted of a crime in U.S. civilian courts today, \nincluding illegal aliens, and regardless of the crime they may have \ncommitted, have an absolute right to petition the U.S. Supreme Court \nfor discretionary review if they lose in the court of appeals. By \ncontrast, however, our men and women in uniform do not share this same \nright as their civilian counterparts. Our military personnel can apply \nto our highest court on direct appeal for a writ of certiorari only if \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces actually conducts a \nreview of their case, or grants a petition for extraordinary relief. \nThat happens only about 10 percent of the time.\n  In other words, the other 90 percent of the time, our U.S. \nservicemembers are precluded from ever seeking or obtaining direct \nreview from the highest court of the country that they fight and die \nfor.\n  A disparity not only exists between our civilian and military court \nsystems. A similar disparity exists even within our military court \nsystem itself. The Government routinely has\n\n[[Page S11589]]\n\nthe opportunity to petition the Supreme Court for review of adverse \ncourt-martial rulings in any case where the charges are severe enough \nto make a punitive discharge possible. But our military personnel do \nnot share these same rights to petition the Supreme Court as their \nopponents, even on the other side of the same case.\n  That is wrong, and this inequity was recently noted by the American \nBar Association. At its annual meeting in August 2006, the ABA House of \nDelegates passed a resolution calling on Congress to fix this long-\nstanding ``disparity in our laws governing procedural due process.''\n  That is perhaps reason enough to fix this problem, but I also must \nnote that this existing disparity has only become more acute now that \nCongress has enacted the Military Commission Act. Section 950g(d) of \nthat law, which Congress passed last September, gives the Supreme Court \nthe ability to review by writ of certiorari any final judgment issued \nby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in an appeal filed \nby terrorists and war criminals who get convicted by U.S. military \ncommissions.\n  So the worst of the worst at Guantanamo will have a right to petition \nour Supreme Court to hear their case. Yet unless we act, those same \nSupreme Court doors will continue to be closed to almost all of our \nU.S. service personnel who would seek direct review in their own \nhighest Court. Even service-members who apprehended those same \nterrorists, or served in judgment on their military commissions, or who \nguard them at Guantanamo, will continue to be treated as second-class \ncitizens, deprived of the opportunity to seek Supreme Court review if \nthey ever need it themselves.\n  Our U.S. service personnel regularly place their lives on the line in \ndefense of American rights. It is simply unacceptable for us to \ncontinue to routinely deprive our men and women in uniform of one of \nthose basic rights, the ability to petition their Nation's highest \ncourt for direct relief, that is given to all convicted persons in our \ncivilian courts, that is given to their prosecutorial adversaries in \nour military courts, and that we have now given even to the terrorists \nwe expect to prosecute as war criminals in our upcoming military \ncommission process.\n  It is time to give equal justice to our U.S. servicemembers. That is \nwhat this act does.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Justice for United \n     States Military Personnel Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n                   THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1259 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``or denied'' after \n     ``granted''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by inserting ``or denied'' after \n     ``granted''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--Section 867a(a) of \n     title 10, United States Code, is amended by striking ``The \n     Supreme Court may not review by a writ of certiorari under \n     this section any action of the Court of Appeals for the Armed \n     Forces in refusing to grant a petition for review.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2053. A bill to amend part A of title I of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to improve elementary and secondary \neducation; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this month millions of American \nschoolchildren are returning to classrooms to begin the new school \nyear, making this a time of hope and possibilities. Students in my \nState of Wisconsin and around the country are meeting new teachers, \ngetting reacquainted with old friends, joining clubs or athletic teams, \nand embarking on the next step in their educational careers. Teachers \nand administrators around the country are starting a new school year \nwith fresh lesson plans and high goals for all the students in their \nschools. And many educators, parents, and school officials are \ncontinuing to work diligently toward the goal of closing the \nachievement gap that continues to exist throughout many communities \nacross the country.\n  These students, teachers, and administrators will also face their \nsixth year under the Federal No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, the \ncenterpiece of President Bush's domestic agenda. NCLB, which is 2001-\n2002 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nESEA, requires that students be tested annually in reading and math, \nand starting this school year, in science. The law is up for \nreauthorization this year and it remains unknown how much change \nstudents, teachers, parents, and administrators can expect as Congress \nworks to reauthorize the law.\n  I voted against No Child Left Behind in 2001 in large part because of \nthe law's new Federal testing mandate. The comments that I heard from \nWisconsinites during the 2001 debate and that I continue to hear 6 \nyears later have been almost universally negative. While Wisconsinites \nsupport holding their schools accountable for results and closing the \nachievement gap, they are concerned about the Federal law's primary \nfocus on standardized testing.\n  Let me make clear at the outset that this country has a long way to \ngo toward ensuring that all students, regardless of their backgrounds, \nhave a chance to get a good education. I remain troubled by the \ninequality in funding and resources provided to our Nation's schools \nand by the persistent segregation that schools around the country, \nincluding those in Wisconsin, continue to face. Moreover, I am deeply \nconcerned that NCLB's testing and sanctions approach has forced some \nschools, particularly those in our inner cities and rural areas, to \nbecome places where students are not taught, but are drilled with \nworkbooks and test-taking strategies, while in wealthy suburban \nschools, these tests do not greatly impact school curriculums rich in \nsocial studies, civics, arts, music, and other important subjects.\n  All levels of government--local, State, and Federal--need to act to \nensure that equal educational opportunities are afforded to every \nstudent in our country.\n  I do not necessarily oppose the use of standardized testing in our \nNation's schools. I agree that some tests are needed to ensure that our \nchildren are keeping pace and that schools, districts, and States are \nheld accountable for closing the persistent achievement gap that \ncontinues to exist among different groups of students, including among \nstudents in Wisconsin. But the Federal one-size-fits-all testing-and-\npunishment approach that NCLB takes is not providing an equal education \nfor all, eradicating the achievement gap that exists in our country or \nensuring that each student reaches his or her full potential.\n  Rather, the reauthorized ESEA needs to recognize that States and \nlocal communities have the primary responsibility for providing a good \npublic education to our students. The reauthorized ESEA should also \nencourage States and local districts to pursue innovative reform \nefforts including utilizing more robust accountability systems that can \nmeasure student academic growth from year to year and measure student \nacademic growth using multiple forms of assessment, rather than just \nstandardized tests.\n  Today, I am introducing the Improving Student Testing Act to overhaul \nthe Federal testing mandate and provide States and local districts \nflexibility to determine the frequency and use of standardized testing \nin their accountability systems. My legislation is fully offset, while \nproviding approximately $200 million in deficit reduction over the next \n5 years.\n  Nothing in my legislation would force States to alter their \naccountability systems in recognition of the fact that different States \nare at different stages of their education reform efforts and may wish \nto maintain their current assessment systems. However, my legislation \nsays that for Federal accountability purposes, States can choose to \ntest once in grades 3 to 5, 6 to 9, and 10 to 12 rather than the \ncurrent Federal requirement for annual testing in grades 3 through 8 \nand once in high school.\n  For States that choose to test in grade spans instead of annually, my\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\nlegislation encourages them to use more than high-stakes standardized \ntests in their accountability systems. By removing the Federal \nrequirement to test annually, Congress can encourage States and local \ndistricts to lead innovative school reform efforts, including \ndeveloping more robust assessment systems that use a range of academic \nassessments, such as valid and reliable performance-based assessments, \nformative assessments that provide meaningful and timely feedback to \nboth students and teachers, and portfolio assessments that allow \nstudents to accumulate a broad range of student work and assess their \nown learning as they progress through school.\n  I have heard from a number of teachers and administrators who are \nconcerned about the testing burden NCLB imposed on our Nation's \neducational system. The Federal mandate to test annually has strapped \nState and local districts' financial resources. Congress promised \nStates specific funding levels for Title I, part A in NCLB, but \nCongress has failed to live up to those promised resources every year \nsince NCLB was enacted. Despite the lack of adequate resources, our \nschools continue to be forced to test and to ratchet up the \nconsequences associated with these tests.\n  NCLB's testing mandates have also led to a substantial demand for \nincreased numbers of standardized tests and I have heard from some \nWisconsinites concerned that the testing industry cannot keep up with \nthis demand. There have been stories coming in from around the country \ndocumenting the burden faced by the testing industry, including \nincorrectly scored tests, test scores arriving much later than \nexpected, and schools given incorrect testing booklets and supplies by \nthe testing companies.\n  My legislation would help alleviate this testing burden by providing \nStates with the option to reduce the number of grades tested for \nFederal accountability purposes. Eighteen States would then be able to \ndedicate more of their critical Title I dollars toward efforts that \nwill help close the achievement including improving teacher quality \nthrough professional development and providing more targeted \ninstruction to disadvantaged students in critical subject areas.\n  Some may say that with a Federal requirement to test in grade spans \nand not every year, the students in the nontested years will be \nignored. I have more faith in Wisconsin's teachers and other dedicated \nteachers around the country than to assume that because there is no \nexternal, federally required test, teachers will not teach their kids \nor ensure that their students make academic progress. Effective schools \ncontain teachers who work collaboratively within grade levels and \nacross grades to raise the academic achievement of every student. Good \nteachers know that they are responsible for ensuring all their students \nmake substantial academic progress in a given year regardless of \nwhether those students must take a federally imposed standardized test.\n  My legislation also provides States with the flexibility and \nresources to develop high-quality assessments that can be used to give \na more accurate picture of student achievement. I have heard a number \nof criticisms of the standardized tests used in Wisconsin and around \nthe country--namely, that they may not measure higher-order thinking \nskills and that the results are returned to teachers too late in the \nschool year, preventing teachers from receiving feedback that could \nhelp inform their instructional techniques to increase student \nlearning. It is important that Congress listen to the feedback provided \nby teachers and administrators from around the country and provide \nStates and local districts with the flexibility to develop and use \nother types of assessments in their accountability systems.\n\n  My bill authorizes a competitive grant program to help States and \nlocal districts develop multiple forms of high-quality assessments, \nincluding formative assessments, performance-based assessments, and \nportfolio assessments. These assessments can give a more accurate and \ndetailed picture of student achievement than a single standardized \ntest. These assessments can also be designed to provide more immediate \nfeedback to teachers and students than the statewide standardized tests \nused for Federal accountability purposes. By incorporating these richer \nassessments, teachers can better assess student learning throughout the \nschool year and continuously modify their instruction to ensure all \nstudents continue to learn.\n  These high-quality, multiple measures can be more expensive for \nStates to develop and my bill recognizes that cost by authorizing a \ncompetitive grant program to assist States in developing these \nassessments. States and local districts can use these funds for a \nvariety of purposes, including training teachers in how to use these \nassessments, creating the assessments, aligning the assessments with \nState standards, and collaborating with other States to share \ninformation about assessment creation.\n  My legislation makes clear that these funds are not to be used for \nthe purchase of additional test preparation materials. I have long been \nconcerned that NCLB could result in a generation of students who know \nhow to take tests, but who do not have the skills necessary to become \nsuccessful adults. This grant program will help innovative States \ndevelop higher quality assessments to better ensure that the students \nin their State are prepared for careers in the 21st century, including \nthe ability to think critically, analyze new situations, and work \ncollaboratively with others.\n  My legislation also makes clear that these multiple forms of \nassessment are not a loophole for States and local districts to avoid \naccountability. Rather, my legislation recognizes that these multiple \nmeasures can provide a more accurate and more complete picture of \nstudent achievement. My legislation makes clear that these assessments \nmust: be aligned with States' academic and content standards, be peer \nreviewed by the Federal Department of Education, produce timely \nevidence about student learning and achievement, and provide teachers \nwith meaningful feedback so that teachers can modify and improve their \nclassroom instruction to address specific student needs.\n  Congress also needs to reform NCLB's accountability provisions during \nthe reauthorization process, including providing credit to schools that \ndemonstrate their students have made substantial growth from year to \nyear. Right now, NCLB measures students' achievement based primarily on \nreading and math tests, and students either achieve the cut score on \nthe NCLB tests or they do not. A number of teachers and parents in \nWisconsin have expressed concerned that NCLB's current approach leads \nschools to focus on students who are closest to achieving the cut score \non tests so as to continue to boost the number of kids passing the test \neach year. As a result, parents and teachers are concern that the \nlowest achieving students who are not yet proficient and the highest \nperforming students who are already proficient may be ignored in the \neffort to meet AYP each year.\n  My legislation seeks to address this concern by providing flexibility \nfor States that maintain annual testing to develop accountability \nmodels capable of tracking student growth from year to year to better \nensure that every student, regardless of his or her current academic \nlevel, continues to make academic progress. States seeking to use \ngrowth models in their accountability systems would have to prove that \nsuch growth models meet a number of minimum technical requirements, \nincluding ensuring the growth model: is of sufficient technical \ncapacity to function fairly and accurately for all students, uses \nvalid, reliable, and accurate measures, has a statewide privacy-\nprotected data system capable of tracking student growth, does not set \nperformance measures based on a student's background, and is capable of \ntracking student progress in at least reading and math. I am pleased \nthere is substantial agreement in Congress that growth models should be \npart of a reauthorized ESEA, and I will work with my colleagues to \nensure that any growth models included in the ESEA can be fairly \nimplemented and are flexible enough for States and local districts to \nutilize in their accountability systems.\n  NCLB set the ambitious goal that all children will be proficient on \nState reading and math tests by the year 2014. I have heard from a \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\neducators and administrators in Wisconsin and around the country who \nare concerned that very few States will be able to meet NCLB's 2014 \ndeadline. I understand their concern, particularly in light of the fact \nthat Congress has failed to provide the promised financial resources to \nmeet NCLB's mandates. Our Nation needs to have high academic \nexpectations for all of our students, but if Congress is going to set \nsuch ambitious goals for our schools to meet, we need to provide our \nschools with the resources to meet those goals.\n  So far, the Federal Government has not lived up to the funding \npromises it made when Congess passed NCLB in late 2001. The \nappropriated levels for title I, part A have failed to match the \nauthorized levels for title I, part A every year from 2002 to 2007, \nresulting in an underfunding of title I, part A by over $40 billion \nsince 2002. It is one thing to set ambitious targets for our Nation's \nschools with adequate resources provided to reach those targets. It is \nsomething entirely different to hold our schools accountable for \nensuring all students are proficient by 2014 and providing our schools \nwith less resources than were promised to them when NCLB passed. My \nlegislation includes a funding trigger that will waive the 2014 \ndeadline unless Congress fully funds title I, part A from now until \n2014. If Congress maintains the 2014 deadline and does not provide \nadditional resources to our Nation's schools, we are only setting our \nschools up for further failure as we approach 2014.\n  My legislation also reforms the peer-review provisions of NCLB to \nensure that there is more transparency and consistency in the peer-\nreview process. States are currently required to submit their State \nplans for approval by the Department of Education, and I have heard a \nnumber of concerns from my State and others that States do not receive \nconsistent or timely information from the Department of Education \nduring peer review. States have also voiced concern about their \ninability to speak directly with peer reviewers during the peer-review \nprocess in order to clarify reviewers' comments made about their State \nplans.\n  My bill would amend the peer-review language to ensure that the peer-\nreview teams contain balanced representation from State education \nagencies, local education agencies, and practicing educators. My \nlegislation also includes language that requires the Secretary to \nprovide consistency in peer-review decisions among the States and \nrequires the Department's inspector general to conduct independent \nevaluations every 2 years to ensure consistency of approval and denial \ndecisions by the Department of Education from State to State. My bill \nwould also require the Secretary to ensure that States are given the \nopportunity to receive timely feedback from peer-review teams as well \nas directly interact with peer-review panels on issues that need \nclarification during the peer-review process.\n  Despite my concerns regarding the testing provisions of NCLB, there \nare other provisions of the law that I continue to support. I have \nconsistently heard from educators and other interested parties in my \nState of Wisconsin in favor of NCLB's requirement to disaggregate data \nby specific groups of children, including students from major racial \nand ethnic groups, students with disabilities, economically \ndisadvantaged students, and English language learners. Teachers have \ntold me that these provisions have added more transparency to school \ndata and help to ensure that schools continue to remain focused on \nclosing the achievement gap among these various groups of students and \nremain attentive to the academic needs of all students. My legislation \nbuilds on the requirement to disaggregate data by also requiring States \nto disaggregate high school graduation rates on the State report cards \nrequired under NCLB.\n  Justice Louis Brandeis once said, ``sunlight is said to be the best \nof disinfectants,'' and I think his statement can be properly applied \nto NCLB's requirement to disaggregate and report academic data by \nstudent subgroups. Information about the achievement gaps that exist \nthroughout our Nation's schools, whether they are gaps in academic \nachievement or graduation rates, can help parents, educators, local \nschool board members, and others continue to advocate for education \nreform at the local level. Some States already have the ability to \ndisaggregate graduation rates by NCLB's subgroups, and my legislation \nprovides funding to all States to comply with this public reporting \nrequirement.\n  Tracking students' achievement and disaggregating student data are \nfundamental components of No Child Left Behind and require States to \nmaintain large data systems containing detailed information about \nstudents. The bill that I am introducing will also ensure that these \ndata systems are maintained in a way that safeguards individual \nprivacy. Use of the data by educational entities, as well as \ndisclosures of student-level data to third parties, will be carefully \nlimited, and individuals will have a right to know who is inspecting \ntheir information and for what purpose.\n  My legislation also provides additional funding for States to build \nadditional infrastructure at the State and local level in order to \nimprove their educational accountability systems. States and local \ndistricts will have to secure additional resources in order to \nimplement growth models or utilize multiple forms of assessment in \ntheir accountability systems. My bill creates a competitive and \nflexible grant program to help ensure the Federal Government does its \npart in assisting States in accessing these resourses.\n  States have varying capacity needs and funds under this program can \nhelp States build their privacy-protected educational databases, train \nindividuals in how to use multiple measures of student achievement in \nState accountability systems, and provide additional professional \ndevelopment opportunities for both state education agency and local \neducation agency staff members. I have heard from a number of State and \nlocal administrators who are trying diligently to reconcile increased \nFederal and State mandates with less financial resources. Providing \nadditional resources will help build State and local educational \ninfrastructure and will help encourage States to move to accountability \nsystems that can measure student growth and use more than standardized \ntest scores when making decisions about students and schools.\n  There are a number of other issues that we need to address in the \nNCLB reauthorization. My bill seeks to address some of the top concerns \nI have heard about from constituents around the State related to \ntesting. During the reauthorization process, we need to examine and \nmodify NCLB sanctions structure to address implementation problems that \nrural and large urban districts have faced. We also need to recognize \nthat every school and every school district is different and the rigid \nsanctions of NCLB may not allow States and local districts the \nopportunity to implement a variety of other innvative school reform \nefforts.\n  We also need to address the diverse learning needs of students with \ndisabilities and English language learners. We need to ensure that NCLB \nworks in concert with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA, and that students with disabilities are provided with proper \nmodifications on assessments without holding lower academic \nexpectations for these students. I have long supported full funding for \nIDEA and strongly support high academic expectations for students with \ndisabilities. I was disappointed the final NCLB conference report in \n2001 dropped the Senate language on full funding of the Federal share \nof IDEA, and I hope we can be successful during this reauthorization \nprocess in efforts to fully fund IDEA.\n  The number of English language learners is growing around the \ncountry, including in my State of Wisconsin. I have heard concerns from \neducators around Wisconsin that NCLB does not properly address the \nunique learning needs of English language learners. Teachers are \nconcerned about the lack of valid and reliable assessments for English \nlanguage learners and the unfairness of testing these students when \nthey may not yet have learned English well enough to take standardized \ntests in English. During the reauthorization, we need to ensure that \nadditional resources are provided to develop valid and reliable \nassessments for English language learners so that these students are \nfairly assessed while learning the English language.\n\n[[Page S11592]]\n\n  There are many issues that need to be addressed during the \nreauthorization process, and my bill seeks to address some of the \nissues related to testing under NCLB. I am pleased this bill is \ncosponsored by my friend and colleague, Senator Patrick Leahy, and that \nit has the support of the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National Education Association, the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals, the School Social Work \nAssociation of America, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, \nthe Wisconsin Education Association Council, the Milwaukee Teachers \nEducation Association, the Wisconsin National Board Network of \nWisconsin National Board Certified Teachers, and the Wisconsin School \nAdministrator's Alliance, which includes the Association of Wisconsin \nSchool Administrators, the Wisconsin Association of School District \nAdministrators, the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, \nand the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is the key Federal \nlaw impacting our nation's schools, and I have long supported the law's \ncommitment to improving the quality of education provided to our \nNation's most disadvantaged students. I strongly support holding \nschools accountable for both providing equal educational opportunities \nto all our students and for continuing to work to close the achievement \ngaps that exist in our Nation's schools.\n  I also strongly support ensuring that classroom teachers, local \nschool districts, and States have the primary responsibility for making \ndecisions regarding day-to-day classroom instruction. Unfortunately, \nunder NCLB, too much of the activity in classrooms is being dictated by \nthe Federal one-size- fits-all testing mandates and accountability \nprovisions. The Federal Government should leave decisions about the \nfrequency of standardized testing up to the States and local school \ndistricts that a bear the responsibility for educating our children. \nWhile standardized testing does have a role to play in measuring and \nimproving student achievement, one high-stakes test alone cannot \naccurately or responsibly measure our students or our schools.\n  NCLB was based on a flawed premise--that the way to hold schools \naccountable and close the achievement gap was for the Federal \nGovernment to pile on more tests and use the tests as the primary tool \nto evaluate schools. Now, 5 years into the law's implementation, we \nhave evidence showing the need to reduce NCLB's burden on schools, by \nproviding real support for students and teachers and by providing \nflexibility to Sates to use more than standardized tests to measure the \nachievement of students. This country has a long way to go before the \nopportunity for an equal education is afforded to all of America's \nstudents and Congress can take a step toward helping to ensure that \nopportunity by substantially reforming the mandates of NCLB. It is time \nto fix No Child Left Behind, and to get back to learning--not just \ntesting--in all of our Nation's public schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2055. A bill for the relief of Alejandro Gomez and Juan Sebastian \nGomez; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I send to the desk a private relief \nbill to provide permanent resident status to Juan and Alejandro Gomez, \nand ask that it be appropriately referred.\n  Juan, 18, and Alejandro, 20, are natives of Colombia who came to the \nU.S. with their parents in August 1990 on B-2 visitors visas. They \ncurrently reside in Miami, FL with their parents. They are now the \nsubjects of an October 14, 2007, voluntary departure date under an \norder of deportation. The date of their departure has been extended \nfrom September 14, 2007. Juan and Alejandro have lived continuously in \nthe U.S. for the last 17 years. They have both graduated from Miami \nKillian High School and are currently enrolled in Miami Dade Community \nCollege. They have the strong support of their community. It would be \nan extreme hardship to uproot Juan and Alejandro from their community, \nwhich has wholeheartedly embraced them, to send them back to Colombia \nwhere there lives could be in serious danger.\n  We all know that the circumstances of Juan and Alejandro aren't \nunique. Just like many other children here illegally, they had no \ncontrol over their parents' decision to overstay their visas a number \nof years ago. Most of these young people work hard to complete school \nand contribute to their communities. Cases like Juan's and Alejandro's \nare the reason why the so called DREAM Act was attached to the \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation that the Senate attempted \nto pass earlier this year, only to face a filibuster from opponents of \nany comprehensive immigration reform proposal.\n  The DREAM Act has broad partisan support and is not the reason that \nthe immigration bill has stalled in the Senate. I would hope that \nconsideration could be given to de-linking the DREAM Act from the \nlarger bill so that we can put in place a legal framework for dealing \nwith young people who are caught in this unfortunate immigration \nstatus. But that is not likely to happen soon enough to address the \nproblems confronting Juan and Alejandro.\n  That is why I have decided to introduce a private bill on their \nbehalf. I will also be writing to Senator Edward Kennedy, Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Immigration to request, pursuant to the \nSubcommittee's Rules of Procedure, that the Subcommittee formally \nrequest an expedited departmental report from the Bureau of Citizenship \nand Immigration Services regarding the Gomez brothers so that the \nSubcommittee can then move forward to give consideration to this bill \nas soon as possible.\n  I had an opportunity to meet Juan and Alejandro recently. They \nbelieve that America is their home. They love our country and want to \nhave an opportunity to fulfill their dreams of becoming full \nparticipants in this country. Passage of the private bill would give \nthem that opportunity. I look forward to working with the Subcommittee \nto facilitate its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Vitter, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Coburn, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Cochran, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 2056. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrestore financial stability to Medicare anesthesiology teaching \nprograms for resident physicians; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kyl and \nMcCaskill, as well as 12 original cosponsors, to introduce an important \npiece of legislation, the Medicare Teaching Anesthesiology Funding \nRestoration Act of 2007. This legislation would restore equitable \nMedicare reimbursement for teaching anesthesiologists and address our \nnation's growing shortage of trained anesthesiologists.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, in 1991, the Centers for Medicare \n& Medicaid Services, CMS, rolled out a new rule that singled out \nacademic anesthesiology programs for a 50 percent reduction in Medicare \nreimbursement when teaching anesthesiologists supervise residents in \ntwo concurrent cases. The rule took effect in 1994. No other medical \nspecialties or nonphysician providers were affected by this policy \nchange. In fact, payments to nonanesthesiology teaching physicians \ncontinue to be paid using the conventional Medicare Physician Fee \nSchedule. All teaching physicians, except anesthesiologists, can \ncollect the full Medicare fee for working with one resident and also \ncollect an additional full Medicare fee for working with a second \nresident on an overlapping case as long as the teaching physician is \npresent during the ``critical and key'' portions of each procedure and \nis immediately available to return to a case when not physically \npresent.\n  This arbitrary and unfair payment reduction has had a devastating \nimpact on the training of anesthesiologists across the country, \nanesthesiologists who we rely on daily for safe surgical procedures, \ncesarean deliveries during childbirth, emergency and critical care \nprocedures, pain management, and care of our wounded warriors. Because \nof this policy change, teaching hospitals\n\n[[Page S11593]]\n\nreceive only half the cost of anesthesiology treatment for Medicare \npatients. This shortchanges academic anesthesiology programs an average \nof $400,000 annually, with some programs losing more than $1 million \nper year. As a result, academic anesthesiology programs have \nexperienced increased difficulty filling faculty appointments and \nsustaining vital research and development programs. But even more \ndisturbing is the fact that this inconsistent and arbitrary payment \npolicy has forced 28 academic anesthesiology programs to close since \n1994, leaving only 129 programs nationwide.\n  In my home State, we have only one academic anesthesiology program, \nat the West Virginia University in Morgantown. This program is losing \nnearly $700,000 per year because of this unfair Medicare payment \npolicy. When you take into account the fact that many private insurance \ncompanies follow Medicare's lead on reimbursement, the final dollar \nimpact is even greater. Other departments within the medical school are \nbeing called upon to subsidize these losses instead of using their \nresources to advance important research initiatives or recruit highly \nqualified faculty.\n  West Virginia students interested in studying anesthesiology are also \nat risk. Because this is the only academic anesthesiology program in \nthe State, far fewer West Virginians will have the opportunity to enter \nthe specialty of anesthesiology if this program is forced to close. \nThis will have a direct impact on our State's health care \ninfrastructure because the majority of graduates from West Virginia \nUniversity's anesthesiology residency program stay in West Virginia. If \nthis program closes, the number of qualified anesthesiologists in West \nVirginia could plummet, leaving residents with severe access problems \nfor surgery, emergency care, and other high risk procedures.\n  This is not just a West Virginia problem. This is a national problem \nwith severe implications in every community. Academic anesthesiology \nprograms treat the sickest of the sick, patients with multiple \ndiagnoses, unusual conditions and/or in need of highly complex and \nsophisticated surgeries. The arbitrary Medicare payment reductions for \nteaching anesthesiologists could mean that patients of all ages and in \nall communities could see increased anesthesiology shortages in \noperating rooms, pain clinics, the military, critical care units, labor \nand delivery rooms, and emergency rooms.\n  In order to address this problem, the Medicare Anesthesiology \nTeaching Funding Restoration Act eliminates the Medicare payment \ninequity for physicians who teach anesthesiology. It restores Medicare \nreimbursement for academic anesthesiology programs to the level in \nexistence before 1994 and subjects teaching anesthesiologists to the \nsame ``critical and key'' portion rule as other physicians under \nMedicare. This payment restoration will provide physician residents \nwith sufficient opportunities to pursue the specialty of \nanesthesiology. It will also provide patients, especially high risk \npatients, with continued access to quality anesthesia care when they \nneed it. And, finally, this vital legislation will allow academic \nanesthesiology programs to continue making advances in patient safety \nthrough research and development.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2056\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Anesthesiology \n     Teaching Funding Restoration Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIAL PAYMENT RULE FOR TEACHING ANESTHESIOLOGISTS.\n\n       Section 1848(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-4(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (4)(A), by inserting ``except as provided \n     in paragraph (5),'' after ``anesthesia cases,''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Special rule for teaching anesthesiologists.--With \n     respect to physicians' services furnished on or after January \n     1, 2008, in the case of teaching anesthesiologists involved \n     in the training of physician residents in a single anesthesia \n     case or two concurrent anesthesia cases, the fee schedule \n     amount to be applied shall be 100 percent of the fee schedule \n     amount otherwise applicable under this section if the \n     anesthesia services were personally performed by the teaching \n     anesthesiologist alone and paragraph (4) shall not apply if--\n       ``(A) the teaching anesthesiologist is present during all \n     critical or key portions of the anesthesia service or \n     procedure involved; and\n       ``(B) the teaching anesthesiologist (or another \n     anesthesiologist with whom the teaching anesthesiologist has \n     entered into an arrangement) is immediately available to \n     furnish anesthesia services during the entire procedure.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today Senator Rockefeller and I introduce the \nMedicare Anesthesiology Teaching Funding Restoration Act of 2007.\n  I want to thank Senator Rockefeller for his leadership, as well as \nSenator Vitter who introduced a similar bill last Congress.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, Arizona is the Nation's fastest \ngrowing State, and as its population grows, so does the demand for \nhealth care services. Yet Arizona suffers from a critical shortage of \nhealth care professionals.\n  Inadequate Medicare reimbursement exacerbates physician shortages and \ndisrupts patient access to care. In fact, each year Medicare \nshortchanges academic anesthesiology programs nearly $40 million.\n  Currently, a teaching physician may receive the full Medicare fee \nschedule if he or she is involved in two concurrent cases with \nresidents.\n  In 1994 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, singled \nout anesthesiology teaching programs and implemented a payment change. \nThe payment change required that teaching anesthesiologists receive \nonly 50 percent of the Medicare fee schedule if he or she is involved \nin two concurrent cases with residents.\n  As a result, 28 academic anesthesiology programs have closed, leaving \n129 academic anesthesiology programs in existence today.\n  As one of the remaining teaching programs, the University of Arizona \nloses over $300,000 each year.\n  This is likely a conservative estimate as private payers are \nincreasingly adopting Medicare's payment policy, compounding a teaching \nprogram's total financial loss. Medicare's policy challenges a teaching \nprogram's ability to fill vacant faculty positions, retain expert \nfaculty, and train residents, particularly in rural and underserved \ncommunities.\n  Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, as training I programs \nclose, patients will increasingly encounter anesthesiologist shortages.\n  In Arizona alone, the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nHRSA, projects that between 2000 and 2020 the State's population will \ngrow 18 percent and the population 65 and older will grow 72 percent.\n  The Medicare Anesthesiology Teaching Funding Restoration Act of 2007 \nrepeals the 1994 payment change and restores Medicare payment to \nteaching anesthesiologists.\n  Under this bill, the clear winners are patients. Restoring funding \nhelps preserve patient access to safe, quality health care and \nalleviate growing health professional shortages.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2057. A bill to reauthorize the Merit Sytems Protection Board and \nthe Office of Special Counsel, to modify the procedures of the Merit \nSystems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n   Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nFederal Merit System Reauthorization Act of 2007 to reauthorize the \nOffice of Special Counsel, OSC, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, \nMSPB, and make other changes to improve the performance of both \nagencies. I am pleased to note that Representative Danny Davis, \nChairman of the House Federal Workforce Subcommittee, is introducing \ncompanion legislation today as well.\n  Both MSPB and OSC were created by the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978 to safeguard the merit system principles and to help ensure that \nfederal employees are free from discriminatory, arbitrary, and \nretaliatory actions, especially against those who step forward to \ndisclose government waste, fraud,\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\nand abuse. These protections are essential so that employees can \nperform their duties in the best interests of the American public, \nwhich, in turn, helps ensure that the federal government is an employer \nof choice.\n  MSPB is charged with monitoring the Federal Government's merit-based \nsystem of employment by hearing and deciding appeals from Federal \nemployees regarding job removal and other major personnel actions. The \nboard also reviews regulations of the Office of Personnel Management, \nOPM, and conducts studies of the merit systems.\n  OSC is charged with protecting Federal employees and job applicants \nfrom reprisal for whistleblowing and other prohibited personnel \npractices. OSC is to serve as a safe and secure channel for Federal \nworkers who wish to disclose violations of law, gross mismanagement or \nwaste of funds, abuse of authority, and a specific danger to the public \nhealth and safety. In addition, OSC enforces the Hatch Act, which \nrestricts the political activities of Federal employees, and the \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.\n  OSC and MSPB are to be the stalwarts of the merit system. However, \nboth agencies have been criticized for failing to live up to their \nmission.\n  For example, as the author of the Federal Employee Protection of \nDisclosures Act, S. 274, I am deeply concerned by the fact that no \nFederal whistleblower has won on the merits of their claim before the \nBoard since 2003. At the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhistleblowers have won on the merits twice since October 1994, when \nCongress last strengthened the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  In addition, testimony provided at the House and Senate \nreauthorization hearings earlier this year raised several concerns \nabout the structure of the MPSB and the rights and responsibilities of \nthe Chairman of the MSPB compared to the other Members. This raises \nconcerns about the structure of the MSPB and warrants a closer review.\n  At OSC, the most recent Federal employee satisfaction survey shows \nthat less than five percent of the respondents reported any degree of \nsatisfaction with the results obtained by OSC while over 92 percent \nwere dissatisfied. Moreover, in the past few years, OSC has become \nsubject to numerous allegations by employees, good government groups, \nand employee unions who allege that OSC is acting counter to its \nmission by: ignoring whistleblower complaints, failing to protect \nemployees subjected to sexual orientation discrimination, and \nretaliating against whistleblowers at OSC.\n  If true, these practices violate OSC's legal responsibility to be the \nprotector of civil service employees. Given the fact that OSC employees \ncould not make their disclosure to the Special Counsel, the alleged \nindividual who engaged in the wrongdoing and retaliated against them, \nthe employees and stakeholders filed a complaint with the President's \nCouncil on Integrity and Efficiency, PCIE. Unfortunately, the \ninvestigation is still ongoing.\n  As such, the Federal Merit System Reauthorization Act would \nreauthorize OSC and MSPB for a period of three years instead of the 5 \nyears requested by both agencies in order to give Congress a chance to \ntake a closer review of the two agencies. The bill would also \nlegislatively establish a process for OSC employees to bring \nallegations of retaliation against the Special Counsel or the Deputy \nSpecial Counsel to the PCIE and clarify that Federal employees are \nprotected from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. \nFinally the bill would make procedural changes at OSC and MSPB to \nimprove agency operations and customer service and impose new reporting \nrequirements on both agencies.\n  Both OSC and MSPB must be free from allegations of wrongdoing and the \nappearance of any activity that would question their independence. I \nbelieve that the provisions in this bill will make needed improvements \nin both agencies to build trust in the Federal workforce and the \nAmerican people. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to close the \nEnron loophole, prevent price manipulation and excessive speculation in \nthe trading of energy commodities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Close the Enron \nLoophole Act to help prevent price manipulation and dampen the \nexcessive speculation that have unfairly increased the cost of energy \nin the U.S.\n  This legislation is the product of more than 4 years of work \nexamining U.S. energy commodity markets by the Senate Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. That work has shown that \nU.S. market prices for crude oil, natural gas, jet fuel, diesel fuel \nand other energy commodities are more unpredictable and variable than \never before, and too often are imposing huge cost increases on the \nbacks of working American families and businesses. The legislation I am \nintroducing today is essential to help ensure that our energy markets \nprovide prices that reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand for \nenergy instead of prices boosted by manipulation or excessive \nspeculation. It is also essential to close an egregious loophole in the \nlaw that was championed by Enron and other large energy traders in the \nheyday of deregulation and that continues to haunt our energy markets \nand harm American consumers through inflated and distorted energy \nprices.\n  The ``Enron loophole'' is a provision that was inserted at the last-\nminute, without opportunity for debate, into commodity legislation that \nwas attached to an omnibus appropriations bill and passed by Congress \nin late December 2000, in the waning hours of the 106 Congress. This \nloophole exempted from U.S. Government regulation the electronic \ntrading of energy commodities by large traders. The loophole has helped \nfoster the explosive growth of trading on unregulated electronic energy \nexchanges. It has also rendered U.S. energy markets more vulnerable to \nprice manipulation and excessive speculation with resulting price \ndistortions. This legislation is necessary to close the Enron loophole \nand reduce our vulnerability to manipulation and excessive speculation \nby providing for regulation of the electronic trading of energy \ncommodities by large traders.\n  A stable and affordable supply of energy is vital to the national and \neconomic security of the United States. We need energy to heat and cool \nour homes and offices, to generate electricity for lighting, \nmanufacturing, and vital services, and to power our transportation \nsector--automobiles, trucks, boats, and airplanes.\n  Over 80 percent of our energy comes from fossil fuels--oil, natural \ngas, and coal. About 50 percent is from oil and natural gas. The U.S. \nconsumes around 20 million barrels of crude oil each day, over half of \nwhich is imported. About 90 percent of this oil is refined into \nproducts such as gasoline, home heating oil, jet fuel, and diesel fuel.\n  The crude oil market is the largest commodity market in the world, \nand hundreds of millions of barrels are traded daily in the various \ncrude oil futures, over-the-counter, and spot markets. The world's \nleading exchanges for crude oil futures contracts are the New York \nMercantile Exchange, NYMEX, and the Intercontinental Exchange, known as \nICE Futures in London. Futures contracts for gasoline, heating oil, and \ndiesel fuel are also traded on these exchanges. Presently, regulatory \nauthority over the U.S. crude oil market is split between British and \nU.S. regulators.\n  Natural gas heats the majority of American homes, is used to harvest \ncrops, powers 20 percent of our electrical plants, and plays a critical \nrole in many industries, including manufacturers of fertilizers, \npaints, medicines, and chemicals. It is one of the cleanest fuels we \nhave, and we produce most of it ourselves with only 15 percent being \nimported, primarily from Canada. In 2005 alone, U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses spent about $200 billion on natural gas.\n  Only part of the natural gas futures market is regulated. Natural gas \nproduced in the United States is traded on NYMEX and on an unregulated \nICE electronic trading platform located in Georgia. The price of \nnatural gas in both the futures market and in the spot or physical \nmarket depends on the prices on both of these U.S. exchanges.\n  Trading abuses plague existing energy markets. The key federal \nregulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, reports that \noverall in recent years it has issued several hundred million dollars \nin fines for trading abuses in the energy markets. Several major \nenforcement actions are pending.\n  Since 2001, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has \nbeen examining the vulnerability of U.S. energy markets to price \nmanipulation and excessive speculation due to the lack of regulation of \nelectronic energy exchanges under the so called ``Enron loophole.'' \nAlthough the CFTC and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have brought \na number of enforcement cases against energy traders, the CFTC's \nability to prevent abuses before they occur is severely hampered by its \nlack of regulatory authority over key energy markets.\n  The Subcommittee first documented the weaknesses in the regulation of \nour energy markets in a 2003 staff report I initiated called, ``U.S. \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve: Recent Policy Has Increased Costs to \nConsumers But Not Overall U.S. Energy Security.'' The report found that \ncrude oil prices were ``affected by trading not only regulated \nexchanges like the NYMEX, but also on unregulated `over-the-counter', \nOTC, markets which have become major trading centers for energy \ncontracts and derivatives. The lack of information on prices and large \npositions in these OTC markets makes it difficult in many instances, if \nnot impossible in practice, to determine whether traders have \nmanipulated crude oil prices.''\n  In June 2006, the Subcommittee issued a staff report entitled, ``The \nRole of Market Speculation in Rising Oil and Gas Prices: A Need To Put \nthe Cop Back on the Beat.'' This bipartisan staff report analyzed the \nextent to which the increasing amount of financial speculation in \nenergy markets had contributed to the steep rise in energy prices over \nthe past few years. The report concluded that ``[s]peculation has \ncontributed to rising U.S. energy prices,'' and endorsed the estimate \nof various analysts that the influx of speculative investments into \ncrude oil futures accounted for approximately $20 of the then-\nprevailing crude oil price of approximately $70 per barrel.\n\n  The 2006 report recommended that the CFTC be provided with the same \nauthority to regulate and monitor electronic energy exchanges, such as \nICE, as it has with respect to the fully regulated futures markets, \nsuch as NYMEX, to ensure that excessive speculation in the energy \nmarkets did not adversely effect the availability and affordability of \nvital energy commodities through unwarranted price increases.\n  In June 2007, the Subcommittee released another report, ``Excessive \nSpeculation in the Natural Gas Market.'' Our report found that a single \nhedge fund named Amaranth dominated the natural gas market during the \nspring and summer of 2006, and Amaranth's large-scale trading \nsignificantly distorted natural gas prices from their fundamental \nvalues based on supply and demand.\n  The report concluded that the current regulatory system was unable to \nprevent these distortions because much of Amaranth's trading took place \non an unregulated electronic market. The report recommended that \nCongress close the ``Enron loophole'' that exempted such markets from \nregulation.\n  The Subcommittee's Report describes how Amaranth used the major \nunregulated electronic market, ICE, to amass huge positions in natural \ngas contracts, outside regulatory scrutiny, and beyond any regulatory \nauthority. During the spring and summer of 2006, Amaranth held by far \nthe largest positions of any trader in the natural gas market. \nAccording to traders interviewed by the Subcommittee, during this \nperiod natural gas prices for the following winter were ``clearly out \nof whack,'' at ``ridiculous levels,'' and unrelated to supply and \ndemand. At the\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nSubcommittee's hearing in June of this year, natural gas purchasers, \nsuch as the American Public Gas Association and the Industrial Energy \nConsumers of America, explained how these price distortions increased \nthe cost of hedging for natural gas consumers, which ultimately led to \nincreased costs for American industries and households. The Municipal \nGas Authority of Georgia calculated that Amaranth's excesses increased \nthe cost of their winter gas purchases by $18 million.\n  Finally, when Amaranth's positions on the regulated futures market, \nNYMEX, became so large that NYMEX directed Amaranth to reduce the size \nof its positions on NYMEX, Amaranth simply switched those positions to \nICE, an unregulated market that is beyond the reach of the CFTC. In \nother words, in response to NYMEX's order, Amaranth did not reduce its \nsize; it merely moved it from a regulated market to an unregulated \nmarket.\n\n  This regulatory system makes no sense. It is as if a cop on the beat \ntells a liquor store owner that he must obey the law and stop selling \nliquor to minors, yet the store owner is allowed to move his store \nacross the street and sell to whomever he wants because the cop has no \njurisdiction on the other side of the street and none of the same laws \napply. The Amaranth case history shows it is clearly time to put the \ncop on the beat in all of our energy exchanges.\n  The Subcommittee held two days of hearings relating to issues covered \nin its 2007 report. Both of the major energy exchanges, NYMEX and ICE, \ntestified that they would support a change in the law that would \neliminate the current exemption from regulation for electronic energy \nmarkets, in order to reduce the potential for manipulation and \nexcessive speculation. Consumers and users of natural gas and other \nenergy commodities--the American Public Gas Association, the New \nEngland Fuel Institute, the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, \nand the Industrial Energy Consumers of America--also testified in favor \nof closing the Enron loophole.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is intended to end the \nexemption from regulation that electronic energy trading facilities now \nhave. The bill includes suggestions made by the exchanges, the CFTC, \nand natural gas users, and I will continue to seek their input as the \nlegislative process moves forward.\n  Essentially, this bill would restore the CFTC's ability to police all \nU.S. energy exchanges to prevent price manipulation and excessive \nspeculation from hiking energy prices. In particular, it would restore \nCFTC oversight of large-trader energy exchanges that were exempted from \nregulation in the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act by means of \nthe Enron loophole. The bill would require the CFTC to oversee these \nfacilities in the same manner and according to the same standards that \ncurrently apply to futures exchanges like NYMEX. Because these energy \nexchanges currently restrict trading to large traders, however, the \nbill would not require them to comply with rules applicable to retail \ntrading or trading by brokers on behalf of smaller traders. In all \nother respects, however, including the rules that create position \nlimits and accountability levels to stop price manipulation and \nexcessive speculation, the bill would apply the same rules to energy \nexchanges like ICE as currently apply to futures exchanges like NYMEX.\n  The bill also would require large trades in U.S. energy commodities \nconducted from within the United States on a foreign board of trade to \nbe reported to the CFTC. This provision is intended to ensure that the \nCFTC has a more complete view of the positions of U.S. energy traders \nbuying or selling energy commodities for delivery in the United States. \nThis provision could be waived by the CFTC if the CFTC reaches \nagreement with the foreign board of trade to obtain the same \ninformation.\n  Preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation in U.S. \nenergy markets is not an easy undertaking. I welcome good-faith \ncomments on how this bill can be improved. I want to make it clear, \nhowever, that in my opinion the Enron loophole has got to be closed. \nRecent cases have shown us that market abuses and failures did not stop \nwith the fall of Enron. They are still with us. We cannot afford to let \nthe current situation continue, allowing energy traders to use \nunregulated markets to avoid regulated markets. It's time to put the \ncop back on the beat in all U.S. energy markets. The stakes for our \nenergy security and for competition in the market place are too high to \ndo otherwise.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a bill summary, \nand a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2058\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill would close the \n     Enron loophole and require government oversight of the \n     trading of energy commodities by large traders to prevent \n     price manipulation and excessive speculation.\n       Since 2000, the ``Enron loophole'' in Sec. 2(h)(3) of the \n     Commodity Exchange Act has exempted from oversight the \n     electronic trading of energy commodities by large traders. As \n     a hedge fund known as Amaranth Advisors demonstrated in the \n     natural gas market in 2006, the Enron loophole makes it \n     impossible to prevent traders from distorting energy prices \n     through large trades on these unregulated exchanges. Under \n     this bill, a trading facility that functions as an energy \n     exchange would be subject to Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC) oversight to prevent price manipulation and \n     excessive speculation. The bill would:\n       Require oversight of Energy Trading Facilities (ETFs). ETFs \n     would have to comply with the same standards that apply to \n     futures exchanges, like NYMEX, to prevent price manipulation \n     and excessive speculation. The only difference would be that \n     regulatory provisions governing retail trading and brokers on \n     a futures exchange would not apply because trading on an ETF \n     is restricted to large traders trading amongst themselves. \n     ETFs would function as self-regulatory organizations under \n     CFTC oversight in the same manner as futures exchanges.\n       Require ETFs to establish trading limits on traders, such \n     as position limits or accountability levels, to prevent price \n     manipulation and excessive speculation, subject to CFTC \n     approval, in the same manner as futures exchanges. Position \n     limits set a ceiling on the number of contracts that a trader \n     can hold at one time on a trading facility; accountability \n     levels, when exceeded, trigger a review by regulators of a \n     trader's holdings in order to prevent price manipulation and \n     excessive speculation. The CFTC would ensure that position \n     limits and accountability levels for similar contracts on \n     different exchanges are on parity with each other and applied \n     in a functionally equivalent manner. The CFTC would also \n     ensure that a trader's positions on multiple exchanges and \n     other markets, when combined, are not excessive.\n       Define ``energy commodity'' as a commodity used as a source \n     of energy, including crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, diesel \n     fuel, natural gas, and electricity, or results from the \n     burning of fossil fuels, including carbon dioxide and sulfur \n     dioxide.\n       Define ``energy trading facility'' as a trading facility \n     that trades contracts in an energy commodity (other than in \n     the cash or spot market) between large traders (``eligible \n     commercial entities''), and provides either for the clearing \n     of those contracts or a price discovery function in the \n     futures or cash market for that energy commodity. Clearing \n     services, which are already subject to CFTC oversight, \n     generally guarantee the performance of a contract, and \n     facilitate the trading of those contracts. A trading facility \n     performs a price discovery function when the price of \n     transactions are publicly disseminated and can affect the \n     prices of subsequent transactions.\n       Require large-trader reporting for domestic trades on \n     foreign exchanges. Large trades of U.S. energy commodities \n     taking place from the United States on foreign exchanges \n     would have to be reported to the CFTC. Traders would be \n     relieved of this reporting requirement if the CFTC reached \n     agreement with a foreign board of trade to obtain the same \n     information.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Close the Enron Loophole Act Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n     Section 1. Short Title\n       The title of this bill is the ``Close the Enron Loophole \n     Act''.\n     Sec. 2. Energy trading facilities\n       This section amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to \n     regulate energy trading facilities that are currently exempt \n     from Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight \n     under section 2(h)(3) of the CEA. After defining the terms \n     ``energy commodity'' and ``energy trading facility,'' this \n     section delineates the criteria required for an energy \n     trading facility to be registered with the CFTC. The \n     specified criteria are based upon existing criteria in the \n     CEA for futures markets (designated contract markets) and \n     derivatives transaction execution facilities so that energy \n     trading facilities will operate under a comparable degree of \n     self-regulation and CFTC oversight as current facilities, \n     taking into account certain differences between the types of \n     markets.\n       Section 2(a). Definitions. This section defines the terms \n     ``energy commodity'' and ``energy trading facility.''\n       The term ``energy commodity'' means a commodity (other than \n     an excluded commodity, a metal, or an agricultural commodity) \n     that is used as a source of energy or that results from the \n     burning of fossil fuels to produce energy. Examples of energy \n     commodities that are used as a source of energy include crude \n     oil; gasoline, heating oil and other products refined from \n     crude oil; natural gas; and electricity. Examples of energy \n     commodities that result from the burning of fossil fuels to \n     produce energy include carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.\n       The term ``energy trading facility'' means a trading \n     facility (as defined in section la(33) of the CEA) that: (A) \n     is not a designated contract market (DCM); and (B) \n     facilitates the trading of energy commodities between \n     eligible commercial entities (essentially large, \n     sophisticated traders); and either (i) provides a clearing \n     service for products traded on the facility or (ii) the CFTC \n     determines that trading on the facility provides a price \n     discovery function on a trading facility or in the cash \n     market for an energy commodity.\n       The definition of ``energy trading facility'' represents a \n     subset of trading facilities that would otherwise qualify as \n     ``exempt commercial markets'' under current law. In essence, \n     it requires the regulation of energy trading facilities that \n     exhibit the key attributes of a futures exchange--the trading \n     of standardized and cleared contracts for future delivery of \n     a commodity having a finite supply.\n       The definition of ``energy trading facility'' excludes the \n     trading of energy commodities that are ``spot sales of a cash \n     commodity or sales of a cash commodity for deferred shipment \n     or delivery,'' since the bill is not intended to apply to the \n     cash market for energy commodities. This exclusion, however, \n     does not encompass contracts that are commonly referred to as \n     ``swaps,'' since swaps are not spot sales of a cash commodity \n     or sales of a cash commodity for deferred shipment or \n     delivery. Because swaps in the energy market are economically \n     and functionally equivalent to futures contracts for energy \n     commodities, this bill ensures that they will be regulated in \n     a functionally equivalent manner.\n       The definition restricts the bill's application to energy \n     trading facilities that allow only ``exempt commercial \n     entities'' (ECEs) to participate, meaning large sophisticated \n     traders who trade with each other on a principal-to-principal \n     basis. This restriction is identical to the restriction in \n     current law for trading facilities that qualify as exempt \n     commercial markets under section 2(h)(3). A trading facility \n     that permits brokered or intermediated transactions or \n     participation by persons other than ECEs would not qualify as \n     an energy trading facility subject to the type of regulation \n     provided under this bill. Instead, as is the case under \n     current law, a facility that allows the trading of futures \n     contracts by persons other than ECEs must register with and \n     be designated by the CFTC as a contract market subject to the \n     regulations that apply to a DCM.\n       The definition also addresses the concern that, despite the \n     advantages and widespread use of clearing services to \n     facilitate trading, if the presence of a clearing function \n     triggers regulatory oversight, then alternative trading \n     platforms may develop that do not provide clearing services \n     in order to avoid the reporting and monitoring requirements \n     essential to an effective regulatory system. To address this \n     concern, the bill provides that a trading facility that does \n     not provide clearing services still may qualify as an energy \n     trading facility subject to regulation if the CFTC determines \n     the facility ``performs a significant price discovery \n     function in relation to an energy commodity listed for \n     trading on a trading facility or in the cash market for the \n     energy commodity.'' Factors for the CFTC to consider in \n     determining whether a trading facility performs such a \n     significant price discovery function include the extent to \n     which the prices of contracts traded on the facility are \n     linked to or derived from\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\n     the prices of futures contracts traded on a DCM, the volume \n     of trading on the facility, whether prices of completed \n     transactions are immediately posted or disseminated, and the \n     extent to which traders engage in arbitrage trading between \n     the contracts traded on the facility and those traded on a \n     regulated market.\n       Section 2(b). Oversight of Energy Trading Facilities. This \n     section specifies that an energy trading facility, and any \n     agreement, contract, or transaction traded on that facility, \n     shall be subject to the regulatory requirements established \n     in a new CEA section 2(j).\n       Section 2(b)(1) amends CEA section 2(h)(3) to exclude \n     energy trading facilities from qualifying as an exempt \n     commercial market in order to make it clear that those \n     facilities must instead comply with the new CEA section 2(j).\n       Section 2(b)(2) adds a new section 2(h)(7) to the CEA. This \n     new section provides that notwithstanding any other provision \n     of the CEA, an energy trading facility and persons trading on \n     an energy trading facility are subject to the new CEA section \n     2(j). This clarifying provision means, for example, that a \n     trading facility that meets the criteria for an energy \n     trading facility could not operate as a derivatives \n     transaction execution facility (DTEF) under another provision \n     of the CEA.\n       Section 2(c). Standards Applicable to Energy Trading \n     Facilities. This section adds a new section 2(j) to the CEA, \n     specifying the standards that an applicant must meet to \n     register with the CFTC as an energy trading facility.\n       Commission Approval of Energy Trading Facilities. A new \n     section 2(j)(1) makes it illegal for any person to enter into \n     an agreement, contract, or transaction on an energy trading \n     facility unless such facility has been registered with the \n     Commission as an energy trading facility. Section 6 of this \n     bill provides a timeline for facilities in operation on the \n     date of enactment of this Act under CEA section 2(h)(3) to \n     submit an application, obtain registration, and comply with \n     these requirements.\n       Applications for Operation as Energy Trading Facility. New \n     section 2(j)(2) provides that a facility must submit an \n     application to the Commission for operation as an energy \n     trading facility in order to register as an energy trading \n     facility. The Commission is authorized to establish such \n     application requirements as it deems appropriate. New section \n     2(j)(3) provides that the Commission shall make a \n     determination on any such application within 120 days after \n     receiving it.\n       Criteria for Approval of Applications. New section 2(j)(4) \n     specifies the criteria that an applicant must meet for \n     registration as an energy trading facility. Because an energy \n     trading facility may trade instruments that possess the same \n     characteristics as futures contracts traded on a designated \n     contract market, several of the criteria, particularly those \n     regarding prevention of price manipulation, excessive \n     speculation, and price distortion, are identical to the \n     criteria applicable to a designated contract market (DCM). \n     Other DCM criteria are not used, such as those applicable to \n     intermediated or brokered transactions, since those types of \n     transactions are not permitted on an energy trading facility. \n     In addition, because energy trading facilities conduct all \n     trading on a principal-to-principal basis, a number of the \n     criteria applicable to a derivatives transaction execution \n     facility are included in the section. The criteria are as \n     follows.\n       New section 2(j)(4)(A): Prevention of Price Manipulation \n     and Excessive Speculation.--This section requires the \n     facility to have the capacity to prevent price manipulation, \n     excessive speculation, price distortion, and disruption \n     through market surveillance, compliance, and enforcement \n     practices and procedures, including methods for conducting \n     real-time monitoring of trading and comprehensive and \n     accurate trade reconstructions. The term ``excessive \n     speculation'' as used in this bill has the same meaning as \n     the term ``excessive speculation'' in section 4a(a) of the \n     Act as ``causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or \n     unwarranted changes in the price of such commodity.'' \n     [Equivalent to DCM Criteria: Prevention of Market \n     Manipulation, CEA Sec. 5(b)(2)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(B): Monitoring of Trading.--This \n     section requires the facility to monitor trading to prevent \n     price manipulation, excessive speculation, price distortion, \n     and disruption of the delivery or cash-settlement process. \n     [Equivalent to DCM Core Principles: Monitoring of Trading, \n     CEA Sec. 5(d)(4); see also DTEF Core Principles: Monitoring \n     of Trading, CEA Sec. 5a(d)(3)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(C): Contracts Not Readily Susceptible \n     to Manipulation.--This section requires the facility to list \n     for trading only contracts that are not readily susceptible \n     to manipulation. [Equivalent to DCM Core Principles: \n     Contracts Not Readily Susceptible to Manipulation, CEA \n     Sec. 5(d)(3)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(D): Financial Integrity of \n     Transactions.--This section requires the facility to \n     establish and enforce rules and procedures for ensuring the \n     financial integrity of transactions cleared and settled \n     through the facilities of the energy trading facility. [Based \n     on DCM Criteria: Financial Integrity of Transactions, CEA \n     Sec. 5(b)(5); and DTEF Registration Criteria: Transactional \n     Financial Integrity, CEA Sec. 5a(c)(4)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(E): Ability To Obtain Information.--\n     This section requires the facility to establish and enforce \n     rules that will allow the facility to obtain any necessary \n     information to perform any of the functions described in this \n     subsection, including the capacity to carry out such \n     international information-sharing agreements as the \n     Commission may require. [Equivalent to DCM Criteria: Ability \n     to Obtain Information, CEA Sec. 5(b)(8)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(F): Position Limits or Accountability \n     Levels.--This section requires the facility to reduce the \n     potential threat of price manipulation, excessive \n     speculation, price distortion, or disruption of the delivery \n     or cash-settlement process, by adopting position limits or \n     position accountability levels for speculators, where \n     necessary and appropriate. [Equivalent to DCM Core \n     Principles: Position Limitation or Accountability, CEA \n     Sec. 5(d)(5)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(G): Emergency Authority.--This section \n     requires the facility to adopt rules to provide for the \n     exercise of emergency authority to liquidate or transfer open \n     positions in any contract, suspend or curtail trading in any \n     contract, and require market participants in any contract to \n     meet special margin requirements. [Equivalent to DCM Core \n     Principles: Emergency Authority, CEA Sec. 5(d)(6)].\n       New Section 2(j)(4)(H): Daily Publication of Trading \n     Information.--This section requires the facility to make \n     public daily information on settlement prices, volume, open \n     interest, and opening and closing ranges for actively traded \n     contracts on the facility.

New section 2(j)(5) provides that \n     an energy trading facility must continue to comply with all \n     of the criteria in section 2(j)(4) to continue operation, and \n     that violation of any of the criteria shall constitute a \n     violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. The trading facility \n     shall have reasonable discretion in establishing the manner \n     in which it complies with these criteria.\n       Position Limits and Accountability Levels. New section \n     2(j)(6) directs the Commission to ensure that the position \n     limits and accountability levels that are established for \n     energy trading facilities are on a parity with the position \n     limits and accountability levels established for similar \n     contracts traded on a designated contract market and applied \n     in a functionally equivalent manner. This provision is \n     designed to ensure that there is no regulatory advantage to \n     trading on an energy trading facility compared to a \n     designated contract market, or vice versa.\n       Additionally, once a trader's position exceeds a position \n     limit or an accountability level on a particular trading \n     facility, this section directs the Commission to take such \n     action as may be necessary and appropriate, in light of the \n     trader's overall positions in that commodity, to reduce the \n     potential threat of price manipulation, excessive \n     speculation, price distortion, or disruption of the delivery \n     or cash-settlement process.\n       Such a comprehensive approach may have to be undertaken by \n     the CFTC, since it may be beyond the authority of a \n     particular trading facility to obtain information about or \n     limit a trader's relevant positions when those positions are \n     outside of the exchange itself. The Commission may direct a \n     trader, or direct a trading facility to direct a trader, to \n     limit, reduce or liquidate any position in any market, as the \n     Commission determines necessary to reduce the potential \n     threat of price manipulation, excessive speculation, price \n     distortion or disruption of the delivery or cash-settlement \n     process.\n       In order to make a determination on the appropriate action \n     to take, the Commission is authorized to obtain from a trader \n     information regarding all of the trader's exchange and off-\n     exchange positions in that commodity. The Commission will be \n     receiving on a regular basis, through its large trader \n     reporting system, information regarding any trader's \n     positions on a designated contract market or an energy \n     trading facility that exceed the levels for reportable \n     positions; the Commission may choose to request additional \n     information on other positions in the commodity held by the \n     trader if the Commission determines this additional \n     information is necessary to make any determinations required \n     by this section. The authority to obtain this position \n     information parallels the Commission's existing authority \n     under CEA sections 3(b), 4i, and 8a(5) to require traders to \n     retain transaction records for commodities traded on CFTC-\n     regulated facilities and provide them to the Commission upon \n     request. The Commission recently described this authority in \n     its proposed rulemaking ``Maintenance of Books, Records and \n     Reports by Traders,'' 72 Fed. Reg. 34413 (June 22, 2007). The \n     information specified to be provided to the Commission under \n     the new section 2(j)(5)(C) is identical to the information \n     specified to be provided to the Commission in that proposed \n     rulemaking.\n       The Commission's review of a trader's entire position does \n     not relieve an individual exchange of the authority and \n     responsibility to review a trader's position on that exchange \n     once a position limit or accountability level on that \n     exchange has been exceeded. Rather, it is anticipated that \n     the Commission's comprehensive review of the trader's entire \n     position in a commodity will be undertaken in addition to the \n     review conducted by the individual exchange on which the \n     trader has taken a position in excess of an accountability \n     level or position limit. Based on this comprehensive review, \n     the Commission will then determine whether any additional \n     action, beyond that initially taken by the exchange, is \n     necessary to limit, reduce or liquidate the trader's position \n     to reduce the potential threat of price manipulation, \n     excessive speculation, price distortion, or disruption of the \n     delivery or cash-settlement process. In making or \n     implementing any such determinations, the Commission should \n     continue to work in consultation and cooperation with the \n     affected exchanges.\n       New section 2(j)(6)(D) specifies criteria the Commission or \n     an exchange may consider when determining whether to require \n     a trader to limit, reduce, or liquidate a position in an \n     energy commodity in excess of an accountability level. In \n     making any such determination with respect to an energy \n     commodity, the Commission, a designated contract market, or \n     an energy trading facility should consider, as appropriate: \n     (i) the person's open interest in a contract, agreement, or \n     transaction involving an energy commodity relative to the \n     total open interest in such contracts, agreements or \n     transactions; (ii) the daily volume of trading such \n     contracts, agreements or transactions; (iii) the person's \n     overall position in related contracts, including options, and \n     the overall open interest or liquidity in such related \n     contracts and options; (iv) the potential for such positions \n     to cause or allow price manipulation, excessive speculation, \n     price distortion, or disruption of the delivery or cash-\n     settlement process; (v) the person's record of compliance \n     with rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission, a \n     designated contract market, or an energy trading facility, as \n     appropriate; (vi) any justification provided by the person \n     for such positions; and (vii) other such factors determined \n     to be appropriate by the Commission.\n       The criteria specified in this section are not intended to \n     be the exclusive criteria that may be applied, but are set \n     forth to provide additional guidance to the Commission, the \n     exchanges, and persons trading on the exchanges in addition \n     to the general language pertaining to ``excessive \n     speculation'' in section 4 of the CEA.\n       Section 2(d). Information for Price Discovery \n     Determination. This section provides the Commission with the \n     authority to obtain from an electronic trading facility or a \n     derivatives transaction execution facility any information \n     the Commission determines is necessary for the Commission to \n     evaluate whether such a facility performs a price discovery \n     function in relation to a contract in an energy commodity \n     under the definition of energy trading facility.\n       Section 2(e). Conforming Amendments. This section amends \n     the CEA in a variety of sections to provide the Commission \n     with a comparable degree of authority over the operation of \n     an energy trading facility that it possesses with respect to \n     a designated contract market or a derivatives transaction \n     execution facility.\n     Sec. 3. Reporting of Energy Trades\n       Section 3 of the bill adds a new CEA section 2(k) to \n     require persons that trade from within the United States on a \n     foreign board of trade a contract for future delivery of an \n     energy commodity that has a physical delivery point within \n     the United States to keep records of such trades and to \n     report large trades in such contracts to the Commission. The \n     Commission is authorized to waive the reporting requirement \n     if the Commission determines that a foreign board of trade is \n     providing the Commission with equivalent information in a \n     usable format pursuant to an agreement between the Commission \n     and the foreign board of trade. The purpose of this provision \n     is to ensure that U.S. commodity regulators have full access \n     to trading information from U.S. traders conducting \n     transactions from U.S. locations involving U.S. energy \n     commodities such as crude oil and gasoline.\n     Sec. 4. Antifraud authority\n       Section 4 of the bill amends Section 4b of the CEA, the \n     CFTC's main anti-fraud authority. Section 4b is revised to \n     clarify the CFTC's authority to bring fraud actions in off-\n     exchange principal-to-principal futures transactions. In \n     November 2000, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled \n     that the CFTC could only use Section 4b in intermediated \n     transactions--those involving a broker. Commodity Trend \n     Service, Inc. v. CFTC, 233 F.3d 981, 991-992 (7th Cir. 2000). \n     As subsequently amended by the CFMA, the CEA now permits off-\n     exchange futures and options transactions that are done on a \n     principal-to-principal basis, such as energy transactions \n     pursuant to CEA Sections 2(h)(1) and 2(h)(3).\n       Subsection 4b(a)(2) is amended by adding the words `or \n     with' to address the principal-to-principal transactions. \n     This new language clarifies that the CFTC has the authority \n     to bring anti-fraud actions in off-exchange principal-to-\n     principal futures transactions, including exempt commodity \n     transactions in energy under Section 2(h) as well as all \n     transactions conducted on derivatives transaction execution \n     facilities. The new Section 4b clarifies that market \n     participants in these transactions are not required to \n     disclose information that may be material to the market \n     price, rate or level of the commodity in such off-exchange \n     transactions. It also codifies existing law that prohibits \n     market participants from using half-truths in negotiations \n     and solicitations by requiring a person to disclose all \n     necessary information to make any statement they have made \n     not misleading in any material respect. The prohibitions in \n     subparagraphs (A) through (D) of the new Section 4b(a) would \n     apply to all transactions covered by paragraphs (1) and (2). \n     Derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) are not subject to \n     fraud actions under Section 4b in connection with their \n     clearing activities.\n       The amendments to Section 4b(a) of the CEA regarding \n     transactions currently prohibited under subparagraph (iv) \n     (found in paragraph 2(D) of this bill) are not intended to \n     affect in any way the CFTC's historical ability to prosecute \n     cases of indirect bucketing of orders executed on designated \n     contract markets. See, e.g., Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109 (2nd \n     Cir. 1999); In re DeFrancesco, et al., CFTC Docket No. 02-09 \n     (CFTC May 22, 2003) (Order Making Findings and Imposing \n     Remedial Sanctions as to Respondent Brian Thornton).\n       This language clarifying the Commission's anti-fraud \n     authority was included in bills in the previous Congress to \n     reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act, one of which was \n     passed by the House of Representatives (H.R. 4473, passed by \n     the House on Dec. 14, 2005) and the other of which was \n     reported to the full Senate by the Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (S. 1566, S. Rpt. No. \n     109-119; 109th Cong., 1st Sess.).\n     Sec. 5. Commission rulemaking\n       Section 5 of the bill requires the CFTC, within 180 days \n     after enactment of this Act, to issue a proposed rule setting \n     forth the process for submitting an application for \n     registration as an energy trading facility. The section \n     requires the CFTC, within 270 days after the date of \n     enactment, to finalize this rule.\n\n[[Page S11603]]\n\n     Sec. 6. Effective date\n       Section 6(a) of the bill provides that it shall be \n     immediately effective upon enactment, with several \n     exceptions.\n       Existing trading facilities. The first exception applies to \n     existing trading facilities. Section 6(b) provides that a \n     trading facility operating under the exemption in CEA section \n     2(h)(3) on the date of enactment shall have 180 days after \n     the Commission issues a final rule on registration \n     applications to submit such an application. Section 5 of the \n     bill authorizes the Commission to take 270 days to issue this \n     rule. During this period (270 days plus 180 days), the \n     prohibition on trading in the new section 2(j)(1) shall not \n     apply. For any such facility in operation on the date of \n     enactment of this Act that submits an application to the \n     Commission for operation as an energy trading facility within \n     the 180-day period, the suspension of the prohibition in \n     section 2(j)(1) is extended until the Commission makes a \n     determination on whether to approve that application.\n       Subsection (c) provides that if the Commission approves the \n     registration as an energy trading facility of a facility \n     operating under the exemption under CEA section 2(h)(3) on \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the facility may submit a \n     written request to the Commission for a 6-month extension to \n     fully implement any requirement made applicable by this Act--\n     other than an information reporting or recordkeeping \n     requirement--and that the Commission shall grant any such \n     request. The Commission, in its discretion, may grant an \n     additional 6-month extension. The Commission may not grant \n     any extension for any information reporting or recordkeeping \n     requirement. This section is intended to ensure that \n     facilities currently in operation that must register as an \n     energy trading facility will have sufficient time to come \n     into compliance with the new requirements of this Act, and \n     that the operations of those facilities will not be disrupted \n     during the transition period. Altogether, this section \n     effectively provides existing trading facilities with over \n     two years to come into compliance with the Act.\n       Requirements applicable to domestic use of a foreign board \n     of trade. Section 6(d) of the bill states that the reporting \n     requirements applicable to trades from domestic terminals on \n     a foreign board of trade are effective 180 days after \n     enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/09/17/senate-section/article/S11603-1", "month": "09", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 45--COMMENDING THE ED BLOCK COURAGE AWARD \n  FOUNDATION FOR ITS WORK IN AIDING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY \n  CHILD ABUSE, AND DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2007 AS NATIONAL COURAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S.

Once the PRP program ends, the \n     capacity of the United States industrial base to respond to \n     matters arising from the aging and obsolescence of Minuteman \n     III intercontinental ballistic missiles will be extremely \n     diminished, decades-worth of critical program knowledge may \n     be lost, and the current design of the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile is likely to no longer be \n     reproducible.\n       (b) Report Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than March 1, 2008, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report on the capability of the United \n     States industrial base to achieve each of the following:\n       (A) To maintain, modernize, and sustain the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system until at \n     least 2030.\n       (B) To replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missile with a follow-on land-based strategic deterrent \n     system after 2030.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A description of any current plans for extending the \n     Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system after \n     the period from 2020 to 2030, including plans for testing \n     sufficient to account for any aging and obsolescence found in \n     the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile during \n     the remaining life of the system, and an assessment of the \n     risks associated with such plans after the shutdown of \n     associated production lines.\n       (B) A description of any current plans to maintain the \n     Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system after \n     2030, including an assessment of any risks associated with \n     such plans after the shutdown of associated production lines.\n       (C) An explanation why the Minuteman III intercontinental \n     ballistic missile system, the only United States land-based \n     strategic deterrent system, is no longer considered to be of \n     the highest national defense urgency, as indicated by \n     inclusion of the system on the so-called ``DX-Rated Program \n     List'' while the sea-based strategic deterrent system, the \n     Trident II D5 missile system, is still on the so-called ``DX-\n     list''.\n       (D) An analysis of existing commonalities between the \n     service life extension program for the Trident II D5 missile \n     system and any equivalent planned service life extension \n     program for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missile system, including an analysis of the impact on \n     materials, the supplier base, production facilities, and the \n     production workforce of extending all or part of the service \n     life extension program for the Trident II D5 missile system \n     to a service life extension program for the Minuteman III \n     intercontinental ballistic missile system.\n       (E) An assessment of the adequacy of current and \n     anticipated programs, such as missile defense, space launch, \n     and prompt global strike programs, to support the industrial \n     base for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile \n     system, including an analysis of the impact on materials, the \n     supplier base, production facilities, and the production \n     workforce of extending all or part of any such program to the \n     program for the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missile system.\n       (c) Comptroller General Review.--Not later than 60 days \n     after submittal under subsection (b) of the report required \n     by that subsection, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit to the congressional defense committees a \n     report setting forth the Comptroller General's assessment of \n     the matters contained in the report under subsection (b), \n     including an assessment of the consistency of the budget of \n     the President for fiscal year 2009, as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, \n     with the matters contained in the report under subsection \n     (b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2879.

LITTORAL COMBAT SHIP (LCS) PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The plan of the Chief of Naval Operations to \n     recapitalize the United States Navy to at least 313 battle \n     force ships is essential for meeting the long-term \n     requirements of the National Military Strategy.\n       (2) Fiscal challenges to the plan to build a 313-ship fleet \n     require that the Navy exercise discipline in determining \n     warfighter requirements and responsibility in estimating, \n     budgeting, and controlling costs.\n       (3) The 55-ship Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program is \n     central to the shipbuilding plan of the Navy. The inability \n     of the Navy to control requirements and costs on the two lead \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship program raises serious \n     concerns regarding the capacity of the Navy to affordably \n     build a 313-ship fleet.\n       (4) On April 23, 2007, the Naval Inspector General reported \n     to Congress that it determined that cost growth in the \n     Littoral Combat Ship program was attributable to several \n     factors, most notably that--\n       (A) the strategy adopted for the Littoral Combat Ship \n     program, a so-called ``concurrent design-build'' strategy, \n     was a high-risk strategy that did not account for that risk \n     in the cost and schedule for the lead ships in the program;\n       (B) inadequate emphasis was placed on ``bid realism'' in \n     the evaluation of contract proposals under the program;\n       (C) late incorporation of Naval Vessel Rules into the \n     program caused significant design delays and cost growth;\n       (D) the Earned Value Management System of the contractor \n     under the program did not adequately measure shipyard \n     performance, and the Navy did not independently assess cost \n     performance;\n       (E) the program manager for the program was inexperienced \n     as an acquisition professional and had insufficient staff \n     support for the challenges posed by management of such a \n     complex, major program because senior Navy officials waived \n     qualifications of acquisition workforce personnel and chose \n     not to provide adequate support in other areas;\n       (F) the acquisition chain-of-command, from the program \n     office for the program to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy \n     failed to report timely program cost and schedule information \n     within the Navy and to the Office of Secretary of Defense and \n     Congress, which resulted in poor understanding of actual \n     program performance; and\n       (G) the relationship between the Naval Sea Systems Command \n     and the program executive offices for the program was \n     dysfunctional.\n       (b) Requirement.--In order to halt further cost growth in \n     the Littoral Combat Ship program, costs and government \n     liability under future contracts under the Littoral Combat \n     Ship program shall be limited as follows:\n       (1) Limitation of costs.--The total amount obligated or \n     expended for the procurement costs of the fifth and sixth \n     vessels in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class of vessels \n     shall not exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (2) Procurement costs.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     procurement costs shall include all costs for plans, basic \n     construction, change orders, electronics, ordnance, \n     contractor support, and other costs associated with \n     completion of production drawings, ship construction, test, \n     and delivery, including work performed post-delivery that is \n     required to meet original contract requirements.\n       (3) Contract type.--The Navy shall employ a fixed-price \n     type contract for construction of the fifth and following \n     ships of the Littoral Combat Ship class of vessels.\n       (4) Limitation of government liability.--The Navy shall not \n     enter into a contract, or modify a contract, for construction \n     of the fifth or sixth vessel of the Littoral Combat Ship \n     class of vessels if the limitation of the Government's cost \n     liability, when added to the sum of other budgeted \n     procurement costs, would exceed $460,000,000 per vessel.\n       (5) Adjustment of limitation amount.--The Secretary of the \n     Navy may adjust the amount set forth in paragraphs (1) and \n     (4) for either vessel referred to in such paragraph by the \n     following:\n       (A) The amounts of increases or decreases in costs \n     attributable to compliance with changes in Federal, State, or \n     local laws enacted after September 30, 2007.\n       (B) The amounts of outfitting costs and costs required to \n     complete post-delivery test and trials.\n       (c) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 124 of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-163; 119 Stat. 3157) is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2886.
