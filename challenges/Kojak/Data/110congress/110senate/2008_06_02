Mr. President, I very much appreciate that the \nmajority leader has generously allowed me to go ahead and make my \nremarks because I have a meeting.\n  Having spent most of the past week in Kentucky, I can say with a \npretty high level of confidence that the single most important issue to \nthe people of my State is the fact that they are paying about twice as \nmuch for a gallon of gasoline as they were at this time last year. I am \nalso fairly confident that Kentuckians aren't alone in their \nfrustration. Gas prices are, without a doubt, the single most pressing \nissue for Americans at this moment. That is why it is so hard to \ncomprehend the majority's decision to move to a bill at the start of \nthe summer driving season that would raise the price of gas by as much \nas $1.40 a gallon, home electricity bills by 44 percent, and natural \ngas prices by about 20 percent.\n  Now, of all times, is not the time to be increasing the burden on \nAmerican consumers. Now is the time to be considering overdue \nlegislation that would send gas prices down, not up. Now is the time to \nbe considering and approving legislation that would allow Americans to \nincrease energy production within our own borders and to accelerate the \nprocess of moving to clean nuclear energy. Now is the time to do \nsomething about $4-a-gallon gasoline, not something that would give us \n$6-a-gallon gas down the road. So the timing of this bill could not be \nworse, and the substance is just as bad.\n  Let's be clear on something at the outset of this debate: The Senate \nsupports reducing carbon emissions. Just last year, we took a serious \nbipartisan step to increase fuel economy standards in cars and trucks, \nincrease the use of renewable fuels, and expand research into advanced \ntechnologies to reduce pollution and stress on our environment. But in \neverything we have done, we have kept a couple of nonnegotiable \nprinciples in mind: First, any legislation that reduces carbon \nemissions can't kill U.S. jobs, and second, any legislation in this \narea must promote--promote--innovation here at home.\n  This legislation fails both of those tests miserably. If passed, it \nwould have a devastating impact on the U.S. economy. It is at its heart \na stealth and giant tax on virtually every aspect of industrial and \nconsumer life. It would result in massive job losses. It seeks to \nradically alter consumer behavior without any measurable benefit to the \nenvironment in return. Overall, it is expected to result in GDP losses \ntotaling as much as $2.9 trillion by 2050. If our economy were running \non all cylinders, this bill would be terrible economically. At a time \nwhen the economy is struggling, when the price of gas, food, and power \nbills is skyrocketing, this giant tax would be an unbearable new burden \nfor Americans to bear.\n  The Senate has already expressed its willingness to cut carbon \nemissions, and this Congress has acted in a bipartisan way to reduce \ngreenhouse gases by tightening automobile fuel economy standards and by \nrequiring increased use of alternative fuels in last year's Energy \nbill. But moving forward, we should agree, with gas prices as high as \nthey are now, that any further action in this area must protect \nAmerican consumers and American jobs. This means investing in new, \nclean energy technologies, including clean coal technologies, which can \ncapture and store carbon emissions. This means encouraging the \nconstruction of new zero-emission nuclear powerplants and ensuring \ncontinued domestic sources of enriched uranium. It means developing \ncountries must also participate, countries such as India and China, \nwhich already exceed the United States in greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Legislation that fails to address clean coal technologies would have \na disproportionately negative economic impact on States such as \nKentucky that rely on coal-fired powerplants. According to one study, \nthis bill would eliminate nearly 55,000 jobs in my State alone and cost \nthe average Kentucky household more than $6,000 a year. This is an \nunthinkable economic burden to lay on the citizens of my State, \nespecially when developing nations such as India and China wouldn't be \nheld to the same standards. The impact of this climate tax is too great \nto bear for Kentuckians and for the rest of the country.\n  At a time when Americans are struggling to pay their bills and when \nthe price of gas seems to be rising higher and higher every day, the \nmajority is showing itself to be laughably out of touch by moving to a \nbill that would raise the price of gas even higher.\n  This proposed climate tax legislation would be a bad idea even if its \nimpact were beyond dispute. The fact that experts tell us its actual \nimpact on reducing global temperatures is hardly measurable--and will \nbe negligible if China and India do not approve similar measures--makes \nthe wisdom of moving to it at this time even more questionable. Why \nwould we raise the price of gas, the cost of electricity, the cost of \nfood, and put the brakes on our economy when it will be all for nothing \nif China and India aren't willing to do the same? And who exactly \nexpects these developing nations to take similar action to slow their \neconomic growth and raise prices for their consumers? No one expects \nthat. No one seriously anticipates that they will approve anything \nsimilar to this legislation, which means that for American consumers, \nthe Boxer bill is all cost and no benefit.\n  There is a better way to move forward. Climate change is a serious \nissue, and we should continue taking action to address it, as we did in \nlast year's Energy bill. But the way to proceed is to invest in clean \nenergy technologies that allow us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nwithout harming our economy, sending jobs overseas, and raising energy \nprices across the board for U.S. workers, families, farmers, and \ntruckers. Republicans are eager to begin this debate, and we will have \namendments that protect consumers from the price increases and job \nlosses in the Boxer substitute.\n  Some of the problems with this bill have been explored in a number of \nexcellent articles over the past few days. I note in particular an \narticle by George Will entitled ``Carbon's Power Brokers''; an article \nby Charles Krauthammer entitled ``Carbon Chastity''; an editorial in \ntoday's Wall Street Journal entitled ``Cap and Spend''; a column by \nRobert Samuelson; and an article in today's New York Post by Jerry \nTaylor entitled ``Solving Pump Pain.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have all five articles \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Real Clear Politics, June 1, 2008]\n\n                         Carbon's Power Brokers\n\n                            (By George Will)\n\n       Washington.--An unprecedentedly radical government grab for \n     control of the American economy will be debated this week \n     when the Senate considers saving the planet by means of a \n     cap-and-trade system to ration carbon emissions. The plan is \n     co-authored (with John Warner) by Joe Lieberman, an ardent \n     supporter of John McCain, who supports Lieberman's \n     legislation and recently spoke about ``the central facts of \n     rising temperatures, rising waters and all the endless \n     troubles that global warming will bring.''\n       Speaking of endless troubles, ``cap-and-trade'' comes \n     cloaked in reassuring rhetoric about the government merely \n     creating a market, but government actually would create a \n     scarcity so government could sell what it has made scarce. \n     The Wall Street Journal underestimates cap-and-trade's \n     perniciousness when it says the scheme would create a new \n     right (``allowances'') to produce carbon dioxide and would \n     put a price on the right. Actually, because freedom is the \n     silence of the law, that right has always existed in the \n     absence of prohibitions. With cap-and-trade, government would \n     create a right for itself--an extraordinarily lucrative right \n     to ration Americans' exercise of their traditional rights.\n       Businesses with unused emission allowances could sell their \n     surpluses to businesses that exceed their allowances. The \n     more expensive and constraining the allowances, the more \n     money government would gain.\n       If carbon emissions are the planetary menace that the \n     political class suddenly says they are, why not a \n     straightforward tax on fossil fuels based on each fuel's \n     carbon content? This would have none of the enormous \n     administrative costs of the baroque cap-and-trade regime. And \n     a carbon tax would avoid the uncertainties inseparable from \n     cap-and-trade's government allocation of emission permits \n     sector by sector, industry by industry. So a carbon tax would \n     be a clear and candid incentive to adopt energy-saving and \n     carbon-minimizing technologies. That is the problem,\n       A carbon tax would be too clear and candid for political \n     comfort. It would clearly be what cap-and-trade deviously is, \n     a tax, but one with a known cost. Therefore, taxpayers would \n     demand a commensurate reduction of other taxes. Cap-and-\n     trade--government auctioning permits for businesses to \n     continue to do business--is a huge tax hidden in a \n     bureaucratic labyrinth of opaque permit transactions.\n       The proper price of permits for carbon emissions should \n     reflect the future warming costs of current emissions. That \n     is bound to be a guess based on computer models built on \n     guesses. Lieberman guesses that the market value of all \n     permits would be ``about $7 trillion by 2050.'' Will that \n     staggering sum pay for a $7 trillion reduction of other \n     taxes? Not exactly.\n       It would go to a Climate Change Credit Corp., which \n     Lieberman calls ``a private-public entity'' that, operating \n     outside the budget process, would invest ``in many things.'' \n     This would be industrial policy, aka socialism, on a grand \n     scale--government picking winners and losers, all of whom \n     will have powerful incentives to invest in lobbyists to \n     influence government's thousands of new wealth-allocating \n     decisions.\n       Lieberman's legislation also would create a Carbon Market \n     Efficiency Board empowered to ``provide allowances and alter \n     demands'' in response to ``an impact that is much more \n     onerous'' than expected. And Lieberman says that if a foreign \n     company selling a product in America ``enjoys a price \n     advantage over an American competitor'' because the American \n     firm has had to comply with the cap-and-trade regime, ``we \n     will impose a fee'' on the foreign company ``to equalize the \n     price.'' Protectionism-masquerading-as-environmentalism will \n     thicken the unsavory entanglement of commercial life and \n     political life.\n       McCain, who supports Lieberman's unprecedented expansion of \n     government's regulatory reach, is the scourge of all \n     lobbyists (other than those employed by his campaign). But \n     cap-and-trade would be a bonanza for K Street, the lobbyists' \n     habitat, because it would vastly deepen and broaden the \n     upside benefits and downside risks that the government's \n     choices mean for businesses.\n       McCain, the political hygienist, is eager to reduce the \n     amount of money in politics. But cap-and-trade, by hugely \n     increasing the amount of politics in the allocation of money, \n     would guarantee a surge of money into politics.\n       Regarding McCain's ``central facts,'' the U.N.'s World \n     Meteorological Organization, which helped establish the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--co-winner, with Al \n     Gore, of the Nobel Prize--says global temperatures have not \n     risen in a decade. So Congress might be arriving late at the \n     save-the-planet party. Better late than never? No. When \n     government, ever eager to expand its grip on the governed and \n     their wealth, manufactures hysteria as an excuse for doing \n     so, then: better never.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 30, 2008]\n\nCarbon Chastity--The First Commandment of the Church of the Environment\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       I'm not a global warming believer. I'm not a global warming \n     denier. I'm a global warming agnostic who believes \n     instinctively that it can't be very good to pump lots of \n     CO2 into the atmosphere but is equally convinced \n     that those who presume to know exactly where that leads are \n     talking through their hats.\n       Predictions of catastrophe depend on models. Models depend \n     on assumptions about complex planetary systems--from ocean \n     currents to cloud formation--that no one fully understands. \n     Which is why the models are inherently flawed and forever \n     changing. The doomsday scenarios posit a cascade of events, \n     each with a certain probability. The multiple improbability \n     of their simultaneous occurrence renders all such predictions \n     entirely speculative.\n       Yet on the basis of this speculation, environmental \n     activists, attended by compliant scientists and opportunistic \n     politicians, are advocating radical economic and social \n     regulation. ``The largest threat to freedom, democracy, the \n     market economy and prosperity,'' warns Czech President Vaclav \n     Klaus, ``is no longer socialism. It is, instead, the \n     ambitious, arrogant, unscrupulous ideology of \n     environmentalism.''\n       If you doubt the arrogance, you haven't seen that Newsweek \n     cover story that declared the global warming debate over. \n     Consider: If Newton's laws of motion could, after 200 years \n     of unfailing experimental and experiential confirmation, be \n     overthrown, it requires religious fervor to believe that \n     global warming--infinitely more untested, complex and \n     speculative--is a closed issue.\n       But declaring it closed has its rewards. It not only \n     dismisses skeptics as the running dogs of reaction, i.e., of \n     Exxon, Cheney and now Klaus. By fiat, it also hugely re-\n     empowers the intellectual left.\n       For a century, an ambitious, arrogant, unscrupulous \n     knowledge class--social planners, scientists, intellectuals, \n     experts and their left-wing political allies--arrogated to \n     themselves the right to rule either in the name of the \n     oppressed working class (communism) or, in its more benign \n     form, by virtue of their superior expertise in achieving the \n     highest social progress by means of state planning \n     (socialism).\n       Two decades ago, however, socialism and communism died \n     rudely, then were buried forever by the empirical \n     demonstration of the superiority of market capitalism \n     everywhere from Thatcher's England to Deng's China, where \n     just the partial abolition of socialism lifted more people \n     out of poverty more rapidly than ever in human history.\n       Just as the ash heap of history beckoned, the intellectual \n     left was handed the ultimate salvation: environmentalism. Now \n     the experts will regulate your life not in the name of the \n     proletariat or Fabian socialism but--even better--in the name \n     of Earth itself.\n       Environmentalists are Gaia's priests, instructing us in her \n     proper service and casting out those who refuse to genuflect. \n     (See Newsweek above.) And having proclaimed the ultimate \n     commandment--carbon chastity--they are preparing the \n     supporting canonical legislation that will tell you how much \n     you can travel, what kind of light you will read by, and at \n     what temperature you may set your bedroom thermostat.\n       Only Monday, a British parliamentary committee proposed \n     that every citizen be required to carry a carbon card that \n     must be presented, under penalty of law, when buying \n     gasoline, taking an airplane or using electricity. The card \n     contains your yearly carbon ration to be drawn down with \n     every purchase, every trip, every swipe.\n       There's no greater social power than the power to ration. \n     And, other than rationing food, there is no greater \n     instrument of social control than rationing energy, the \n     currency of just about everything one does and uses in an \n     advanced society.\n       So what does the global warming agnostic propose as an \n     alternative? First, more research--untainted and reliable--to \n     determine (a) whether the carbon footprint of man is or is \n     not lost among the massive natural forces (from sunspot \n     activity to ocean currents) that affect climate, and (b) if \n     the human effect is indeed significant, whether the planetary \n     climate system has the homeostatic mechanisms (like the \n     feedback loops in the human body, for example) with which to \n     compensate.\n       Second, reduce our carbon footprint in the interim by doing \n     the doable, rather than the economically ruinous and socially \n     destructive. The most obvious step is a major move to nuclear \n     power, which to the atmosphere is the cleanest of the clean.\n       But your would-be masters have foreseen this contingency. \n     The Church of the Environment promulgates secondary dogmas as \n     well. One of these is a strict nuclear taboo.\n       Rather convenient, is it not? Take this major coal-\n     substituting fix off the table, and we will be rationing all \n     the more. Guess who does the rationing.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 2, 2008]\n\n                             Cap and Spend\n\n       As the Senate opens debate on its mammoth carbon regulation \n     program this week, the phrase of the hour is ``cap and \n     trade.'' This sounds innocuous enough. But anyone who looks \n     at the legislative details will quickly see that a better \n     description is cap and spend. This is easily the largest \n     income redistribution scheme since the income tax.\n       Sponsored by Joe Lieberman and John Warner, the bill would \n     put a cap on carbon\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\n     emissions that gets lowered every year. But to ease the pain \n     and allow for economic adjustment, the bill would dole out \n     ``allowances'' under the cap that would stand for the right \n     to emit greenhouse gases. Senator Barbara Boxer has \n     introduced a package of manager's amendments that mandates \n     total carbon reductions of 66% by 2050, while earmarking the \n     allowances.\n       When cap and trade has been used in the past, such as to \n     reduce acid rain, the allowances were usually distributed for \n     free. A major difference this time is that the allowances \n     will be auctioned off to covered businesses, which means \n     imposing an upfront tax before the trade half of cap and \n     trade even begins. It also means a gigantic revenue windfall \n     for Congress.\n       Ms. Boxer expects to scoop up auction revenues of some \n     $3.32 trillion by 2050. Yes, that's trillion. Her friends in \n     Congress are already salivating over this new pot of gold. \n     The way Congress works, the most vicious floor fights won't \n     be over whether this is a useful tax to create, but over who \n     gets what portion of the spoils. In a conference call with \n     reporters last Thursday, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry \n     explained that he was disturbed by the effects of global \n     warming on ``crustaceans'' and so would be pursuing changes \n     to ensure that New England lobsters benefit from some of the \n     loot.\n       Of course most of the money will go to human \n     constituencies, especially those with the most political \n     clout. In the Boxer plan, revenues are allocated down to the \n     last dime over the next half-century. Thus $802 billion would \n     go for ``relief' for low-income taxpayers, to offset the \n     higher cost of lighting homes or driving cars. Ms. Boxer will \n     judge if you earn too much to qualify.\n       There's also $190 billion to fund training for ``green-\n     collar jobs,'' which are supposed to replace the jobs that \n     will be lost in carbon-emitting industries. Another $288 \n     billion would go to ``wildlife adaptation,'' whatever that \n     means, and another $237 billion to the states for the same \n     goal. Some $342 billion would be spent on international aid, \n     $171 billion for mass transit, and untold billions for \n     alternative energy and research--and we're just starting.\n       Ms. Boxer would only auction about half of the carbon \n     allowances; she reserves the rest for politically favored \n     supplicants. These groups might be Indian tribes (big \n     campaign donors!), or states rewarded for ``taking the lead'' \n     on emissions reductions like Ms. Boxer's California. Those \n     lucky winners would be able to sell those allowances for \n     cash. The Senator estimates that the value of the handouts \n     totals $3.42 trillion. For those keeping track, that's more \n     than $6.7 trillion in revenue handouts so far.\n       The bill also tries to buy off businesses that might \n     otherwise try to defeat the legislation. Thus carbon-heavy \n     manufacturers like steel and cement will get $213 billion \n     ``to help them adjust,'' while fossil-fuel utilities will get \n     $307 billion in ``transition assistance.'' No less than $34 \n     billion is headed to oil refiners. Given that all of these \n     folks have powerful Senate friends, they will probably \n     extract a larger ransom if cap and trade ever does become \n     law.\n       If Congress is really going to impose this carbon tax in \n     the name of saving mankind, the least it should do is forego \n     all of this political largesse. In return for this new tax, \n     Congress should cut taxes elsewhere to make the bill revenue \n     neutral. A ``tax swap'' would offset the deadweight taxes \n     that impede growth and reduce employment. All the more so \n     because even the cap-and-trade friendly Environmental \n     Protection Agency estimates that the bill would reduce GDP \n     between $1 trillion and $2.8 trillion by 2050.\n       Most liberal economists favor using the money to reduce the \n     payroll tax. That has the disadvantage politically of adding \n     Social Security into the debate. A cleaner tax swap would \n     compensate for the new tax on business by cutting taxes on \n     investment--such as slashing the 35% U.S. corporate rate that \n     is the second highest in the developed world. Then there's \n     the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which are set to expire in 2010 \n     and would raise the overall tax burden by $2.8 trillion over \n     the next decade. Democrats who want to raise taxes on capital \n     gains and dividends are proposing a double tax wallop by \n     embracing Warner-Lieberman-Boxer.\n       All of this helps explain why so many in Congress are so \n     enamored of ``doing something'' about global warming. They \n     would lay claim to a vast new chunk of the private economy \n     and enhance their own political power.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 2, 2008]\n\n                      Just Call It ``Cap-and-Tax''\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       We'll have to discard the old adage ``Everyone talks about \n     the weather, but no one does anything about it.'' It is \n     inoperative in this era of global warming, because the whole \n     point of controlling greenhouse gas emissions is to do \n     something about the weather. This promises to be hard and \n     perhaps futile, but there are good and bad ways of attempting \n     it. One of the bad ways is cap-and-trade. Unfortunately, it's \n     the darling of environmental groups and their political \n     allies.\n       The chief political virtue of cap-and-trade--a complex \n     scheme to reduce greenhouse gases--is its complexity. This \n     allows its environmental supporters to shape public \n     perceptions in essentially deceptive ways. Cap-and-trade \n     would act as a tax, but it's not described as a tax. It would \n     regulate economic activity, but it's promoted as a ``free \n     market'' mechanism. Finally, it would trigger a tidal wave of \n     influence-peddling, as lobbyists scrambled to exploit the \n     system for different industries and localities. This would \n     undermine whatever abstract advantages the system has.\n       The Senate is scheduled to begin debating a cap-and-trade \n     proposal today, and although it's unlikely to pass, the \n     concept will return because all the major presidential \n     candidates support it. Cap-and-trade extends the long \n     government tradition of proclaiming lofty goals that are \n     impossible to achieve. We've had ``wars'' against poverty, \n     cancer and drugs, but poverty, cancer and drugs remain. \n     President Bush called his landmark education law No Child \n     Left Behind rather than the more plausible Few Children Left \n     Behind.\n       Carbon-based fuels (oil, coal, natural gas) provide about \n     85 percent of U.S. energy and generate most greenhouse gases. \n     So, the simplest way to stop these emissions is to regulate \n     them out of existence. Naturally, that's what cap-and-trade \n     does. Companies could emit greenhouse gases only if they had \n     annual ``allowances''--quotas--issued by the government. The \n     allowances would gradually decline. That's the ``cap.'' \n     Companies (utilities, oil refineries) that needed extra \n     allowances could buy them from companies willing to sell. \n     That's the ``trade.''\n       In one bill, the 2030 cap on greenhouse gases would be 35 \n     percent below the 2005 level and 44 percent below the level \n     projected without any restrictions. By 2050, U.S. greenhouse \n     gases would be rapidly vanishing. Even better, their \n     disappearance would allegedly be painless. Reviewing five \n     economic models, the Environmental Defense Fund asserts that \n     the cuts can be achieved ``without significant adverse \n     consequences to the economy.'' Fuel prices would rise, but \n     because people would use less energy, the impact on household \n     budgets would be modest.\n       This is mostly make-believe. If we suppress emissions, we \n     also suppress today's energy sources, and because the economy \n     needs energy, we suppress the economy. The models magically \n     assume smooth transitions. If coal is reduced, then \n     conservation or non-fossil-fuel sources will take its place. \n     But in the real world, if coal-fired power plants are \n     canceled (as many were last year), wind or nuclear won't \n     automatically substitute. If the supply of electricity \n     doesn't keep pace with demand, brownouts or blackouts will \n     result. The models don't predict real-world consequences. Of \n     course, they didn't forecast $135-a-barrel oil.\n       As emission cuts deepened, the danger of disruptions would \n     mount. Population increases alone raise energy demand. From \n     2006 to 2030, the U.S. population will grow 22 percent (to \n     366 million) and the number of housing units 25 percent (to \n     141 million), the Energy Information Administration projects. \n     The idea that higher fuel prices will be offset mostly by \n     lower consumption is, at best, optimistic. The Congressional \n     Budget Office has estimated that a 15 percent cut of \n     emissions would raise average household energy costs by \n     almost $1,300 a year.\n       That's how cap-and-trade would tax most Americans. As \n     ``allowances'' became scarcer, their price would rise, and \n     the extra cost would be passed along to customers. Meanwhile, \n     government would expand enormously. It could sell the \n     allowances and spend the proceeds; or it could give them \n     away, providing a windfall to recipients. The Senate proposal \n     does both to the tune of about $1 trillion from 2012 to 2018. \n     Beneficiaries would include farmers, Indian tribes, new \n     technology companies, utilities and states. Call this \n     ``environmental pork,'' and it would just be a start. The \n     program's potential to confer subsidies and preferential \n     treatment would stimulate a lobbying frenzy. Think of today's \n     farm programs--and multiply by 10.\n       Unless we find cost-effective ways of reducing the role of \n     fossil fuels, a cap-and-trade system will ultimately break \n     down. It wouldn't permit satisfactory economic growth. But if \n     we're going to try to stimulate new technologies through \n     price, let's do it honestly. A straightforward tax on carbon \n     would favor alternative fuels and conservation just as much \n     as cap-and-trade but without the rigid emission limits. A tax \n     is more visible and understandable. If environmentalists \n     still prefer an allowance system, let's call it by its proper \n     name: cap-and-tax.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Post, June 2, 2008]\n\n                           Solving Pump Pain\n\n                           (By Jerry Taylor)\n\n       Skyrocketing energy prices are hammering Americans.\n       Five years ago this week, gasoline cost an average of $1.43 \n     a gallon at the pump; this week, it's $3.94. And home \n     electricity averaged 5.43 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2003; it \n     was up to 10.31 cents in December.\n       The underlying cause, of course, is that oil, coal and \n     natural-gas prices have all gone berserk--with no relief in \n     sight.\n       What to do?\n       Individually, of course, most of us will start conserving--\n     people are already driving less, buying more fuel-efficient \n     cars, etc. We'll keep on finding ways to save as prices stay \n     high.\n       Should the government mandate even more conservation? No, \n     ``too much'' conservation is as economically harmful as ``too \n     little.'' Just consider the economic harm that would be \n     delivered by, say, capping speed limits at 30 miles per hour, \n     or banning recreational long-distance travel. Both would save \n     gobs of energy--but at the cost of doing more harm than good.\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\n       The only thing government should do on this front is ensure \n     that prices are ``right''--that is, that they reflect total \n     costs. That's mainly an issue for electricity, where retail \n     power prices typically bear little relation to wholesale \n     prices. State governments need to encourage real-time pricing \n     of electricity--so that consumers will get the signal to, for \n     example, run the clothes dryer at night, when power is \n     cheaper.\n       (Incidentally, those who argue that gas and diesel prices \n     don't reflect important ``external'' environmental and \n     national-security costs are simply wrong--at best, those \n     added costs are trivial on a per-gallon basis.)\n       But there's a fair bit to do on the supply side. Congress \n     could take four positive steps--if it really wants to bring \n     prices down.\n       Open up key areas for oil and gas exploration and \n     development. Washington has declared the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge and 85 percent of the outer continental shelf \n     off-limits. It's absurd for our politicians to fulminate \n     about the need for more oil production from OPEC when they \n     won't lift a finger to increase oil production here at home.\n       That said, it will take years to get these fields on-line \n     (all the more reason to start now!)--and they'll do more for \n     natural-gas prices than for oil.\n       By the time those new fields would be producing, global oil \n     production will probably be about 100 million barrels per \n     day. Optimistically, the fields would yield about 3 million \n     more barrels a day--for a long-run cut in the price of crude \n     of about 3 percent.\n       But U.S. natural-gas reserves are almost certainly far \n     greater--and gas prices are highly sensitive to regional \n     (rather than global) supply and demand issues, so we'd likely \n     see far greater reductions in electricity prices.\n       Open up the West to oil-shale development. The United \n     States has three times more petroleum locked up in shale rock \n     than Saudi Arabia has in all its proved reserves. But this \n     U.S. oil is costly to extract. Oil prices need to be at about \n     $95 a barrel to allow a reasonable profit from extracting oil \n     from Rocky Mountain shale.\n       Well, it's probably profitable now, there's undoubtedly \n     great investor interest in harnessing shale. Only problem: \n     It's mostly on federal land; Washington has so far said, \n     ``Hands off!''\n       Environmentalists object to both these first two ideas--\n     insisting that the wilderness that would be despoiled by \n     energy extraction is worth more than the energy itself. \n     That's nonsense--faith masquerading as fact.\n       How much something is worth is determined by how much \n     people are willing to pay for it. If these lands were \n     auctioned off, energy companies (the market representatives \n     of energy consumers) would outbid environmentalists for \n     virtually all of them.\n       Empty out the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This now holds \n     700 million barrels of oil; draining it could add add up to \n     4.3 billion barrels of crude a day to the market for about \n     five months. That's nothing to sneeze at--it's about half of \n     what the Saudis now pump and almost twice what Kuwait puts on \n     the market.\n       At the very least, this would bring gasoline prices down. \n     And if the theories of a speculator-created ``oil bubble'' \n     are true (I doubt they are), it would pop the bubble and send \n     prices tumbling.\n       What of the national-security risk? Another myth. As long \n     as we're willing to pay market prices for crude oil, we can \n     have all the oil we want--embargo or no embargo.\n       A real U.S. physical shortage is impossible unless a) all \n     international oil actors refused to do business with us--\n     which won't happen, or b) a foreign navy stopped oil \n     shipments to U.S. ports--which is the U.S. Navy is more than \n     competent to prevent.\n       Opening this spigot now also means a $70 billion windfall \n     for the U.S. Treasury.\n       Suspend (or end) federal rules that force refiners to use \n     only low-sulfur oil to make gasoline and diesel. This is \n     easily the best short-term fix for high gas prices.\n       Refiners were once relatively free to use heavy crude to \n     make transportation fuel. Today, environmental regulations \n     make it difficult and costly. And there's actually a \n     (relative) glut of heavy crude right now.\n       Light-crude oil markets are incredibly tight, with no real \n     excess production capacity. Heavy-crude markets are robust, \n     with plenty of crude going unsold for lack of buyers.\n       Suspending low-sulfur rules would bring those heavy crudes \n     into the transportation fuels. Oil economist Phil Verleger \n     says it could well send gasoline and diesel prices \n     plummeting.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my expectation that once we get on the bill, the \nmajority will allow for amendments, and I expect there will be a rather \nrobust debate on the merits of this climate tax legislation. I know \nmany of my Members are anxious to begin the debate.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader for the opportunity to go first \ntoday. I appreciate it very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there are lots of different stories around \nthe country and around the world as to why people feel so strongly \nabout the environment. My story I think is similar to others but just \nin a different context.\n  As most everyone knows by now, I grew up in a little mining town in \nsouthern Nevada--very arid, no water anyplace around. Had it not been \nfor the discovery of gold, there would have been no Searchlight. To get \nwater in Searchlight, you had to go deep into the bowels of the earth--\n500 feet, sometimes deeper than that.\n  I didn't travel much at all as a boy. I was a teenager before I went \n50 miles to a place called Needles, CA. But three or four times during \nthe time I was growing up, we would travel out of Searchlight right \nover the California border, about 20-some-odd miles from Searchlight, \nof course all on dirt roads, to see a freak of nature: these mountains, \nvolcanic black mountains, out of the side of which gushed water. It was \ncalled Piute Springs, Fort Piute.\n  The reason we called it Fort Piute is during the Civil War, the U.S. \nGovernment built a military outpost there. When I was a boy growing up, \nyou could see these big rocks they had built and spent 8 or 9 months \nbuilding this place, and it still had the holes where soldiers could \nstick out their guns.\n  For a young boy, this was about as good as it gets--to go up into \nthat fort and pretend you were one of the soldiers looking out one of \nthose little windows. You had to stand on something they had down there \nto get high enough that you could do that. Even though that was a \nwonder, what was in that spring was even more wondrous. So in a place \nlike Searchlight, where there was no water anyplace, and you could not \ngrow trees--because it was rocky--even if you had water, gushing out of \nthis mountain was a spring that ran for a couple of miles. As it came \nout of the mountain, it created all kinds of lush greenery. It is hard \nto comprehend, but even there--I read about them--they had lily pods, \nthese big green things with flowers on them, floating around in the \nwater. And they had these things--I don't know what they are called, \nbut they are long and shaped like a hot dog; you break them open and \nwhite stuff comes out of them. I don't know what they are called, but \nyou could see them, too.\n  You could take a rock and throw it down in that ditch, which \nsometimes was half as deep as this room we are in--the Senate Chamber--\nand it would sound like an airplane taking off. It was birds, birds--\nhundreds and hundreds of birds.\n  My wife was born in Southern California. I think it is no secret that \nshe was never impressed with Searchlight when we were going to high \nschool. When we went away to college and law school--back here is where \nwe went to law school--I told her about that place. Without in any way \nprejudging her thoughts, I am confident she didn't believe what I was \ntelling her about this lush place not far from Searchlight. It was the \nthing people dream of. But after we had children, I took her to Paiute \nSprings. What a disappointment. During the time I had been gone, people \nhad vandalized the fort and knocked down most of the big rocks. The \nfoundation was still there, but you were lucky to find it that high. \nThey set fire to the trees. The water from the spring was still coming, \nbut it had been trashed. There was garbage all over and it was such a \ndisappointment. That is the day I became an environmentalist. We have \nto protect the wonders of nature, and Paiute Springs is a wonder. It is \na freak of nature. How in the world in this arid volcanic rock \nformation up in those mountains could water possibly be coming out? I \nhave focused on that, and we have spent taxpayer dollars in the last \nfew years improving Paiute Springs, making it more accessible, and \nmaking needed repairs to the damage that has been done to it over these \nmany years. There are wonderful stories about Paiute Springs. I guess \nthat is why I feel so strongly about what we are doing here today.\n  We are going to vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act. I have \nto say that I am stunned by my friend, the distinguished Republican \nleader, who said he was surprised we would move to\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nthis bill now because it might have an impact on gas prices. We all \nknow gas prices are awfully high. In fact, they have gone up more than \n250 percent since the Republicans took over the White House 7\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  What the Republican leader didn't say is that the Energy Information \nAdministration's projections for this climate bill might cause energy \nprices to increase over the next 25 years. He didn't mention that \nenergy consumers will get an $800 billion tax cut to offset these \ngradual cost increases. I guess none of us should be surprised that the \nRepublicans have actually already initiated a filibuster on a motion to \nproceed to this legislation.\n  Now, they will say that later today we are all going to vote for it. \nIf that is the case, we should have been on this bill now--we should be \non it now. We should not have to wait until 30 hours after we vote \ntonight. I hope they will let us go to the bill in the morning. But if \nthe past is prolog, then they are going to eat up and waste 30 hours--\n30 hours that will start running this afternoon about 5:50, and will \nexpire around midnight tomorrow night. This is what they have been \ndoing for a year and almost six months.\n  It is a disappointment that they are adding to their all-time record \nof filibusters, 71. This is too bad. My friend, the distinguished \nRepublican leader, said this bill makes it so that we, the majority, \nare laughably--that is his word--out of touch. With so many Americans \nsuffering the consequences of the Bush economy and so much work for \nCongress to do, that statement is unfortunate. Should we wait until \nTuesday? Of course not. We should be legislating. If there are efforts \nmade to improve the legislation, fine, let them do it.\n  Blocking legislation, as they have done time and time again, is their \nright. But what is the point? What is the purpose? Who does wasting 30 \nhours benefit?\n  I hope that during the debate, Senators will keep their remarks \nfocused on the legislation before us or any specific reasons they have \nfor objecting to proceeding to the bill itself. This is not directly a \ndebate on gas prices. We have tried to do some legislating on that and \nwe have been thwarted at every possible step. How? With Republican \nfilibusters.\n  After the debate on the motion to proceed, of course, we will move to \nthe bill. Senator Boxer will lay down a comprehensive substitute \namendment with the full support of Senators Warner and Lieberman. The \nSenate will then proceed to the most comprehensive global warming \nlegislation ever to come before any legislative body in the history of \nthe world.\n  During consideration of this legislation, Senators will debate many \nsubjects. But beyond all specific points of contention, one fact is \nindisputable: Global warming is real and it is caused mainly by manmade \npollution.\n  The changes we see occurring all around us--drought, altered growing \nseasons, sea level rises, more intense precipitation and wildfires, \nstorms that are shorter and more intense--are caused or worsened by the \nwarming of the Earth.\n  Over the course of human civilization, and growing faster and faster \nsince the Industrial Revolution, we have burned billions upon billions \nof tons of fossil fuels and thrown the waste carbon into the \natmosphere.\n  We have taken carbon from the Earth and put it into the sky. That has \ncaused the Earth to have a fever--a fever that is growing worse every \nday, not better. All of that excess carbon in the atmosphere far \nsurpasses the atmosphere's natural ability to handle it.\n  We know now, with great certainty, that this process has caused \naverage global temperatures to rise. Nobody can dispute that. It is \nmaking oceans more acidic and altering planetary biochemistry.\n\n  As the amount of carbon we put into the atmosphere continues to rise, \nthe risk to our planet and way of life grows more and more dangerous.\n  Nevada is the driest State in the Union. Las Vegas' average yearly \nrainfall is 4 inches. My hometown of Searchlight--approximately 60 \nmiles away--is a regular ``rain forest'' with 8 inches a year.\n  Our entire country and our entire planet face many risks due to \nglobal warming. But for arid States such as Nevada and the desert \nSouthwest, the risk perhaps is the greatest.\n  The upper Colorado region saw better than average rainfall last year. \nWe have been in at least a 10-year drought. This is the water that goes \ninto the Colorado River. It is called the upper Colorado region. Last \nyear, even though it was average rainfall, or a little above, not a \nsingle drop of that moisture got into the river. It all evaporated \nbeforehand.\n  Nevada, like the entire West, is already seeing increased wildfires. \nLonger summers result in more dried-out fuels, which allow fires to \nignite easier and spread faster. The wildfire season in the West is now \n78 days longer than it was three decades ago. During that 78 extra \ndays, there was more lightning, and the fuel is drier. The average \nduration of fires covering more than 2,500 acres has risen five times \nover. A fire of 2,500 acres is no big deal anymore. It used to be.\n  The world's leading climate researchers have concluded that if \ngreenhouse gases continue to increase, the Southwest region faces \nlonger and more intense droughts; still larger, more intense wildfires; \nmore winter and spring flooding but reduced summer and fall runoff, \nwith rivers in these seasons reduced to a trickle; more intense \nprecipitation and storms when it rains, resulting in an increased flood \nrisk; and longer and intense heat, with a correspondingly adverse \nimpact on public health, particularly on the elderly.\n  I have focused only on the Southwest, but this is the way it is all \nover the country. I know more about the Southwest.\n  Hundreds, if not thousands, of American scientists tell us that the \nUnited States must begin making significant reductions by 2015 and \nreduce our emissions by 80 to 90 percent by 2050 if we hope to restore \nbalance to the global climate system. That won't be easy. It could be \nthe most significant challenge the world has ever faced.\n  Not every expert agrees on the quickest and most cost-effective path \nto get there, but all agree that the one thing we cannot afford is \ndelay.\n  The bill before us is a positive and critical first step in a journey \nthat will require innovation and cooperation both here and abroad.\n  This legislation addresses enormous challenges we face with long-term \nsolutions that we leave our children, their children, and generations \nto come with a healthier, more livable planet.\n  The bill now before us does more than simply bring us closer to the \nworthy goal of protecting our environment. At a time Americans are \nlosing their jobs and struggling to compete in the global marketplace, \nthe Boxer-Warner-Lieberman bill is also about creating a new and \npowerful economic engine. It is about creating hundreds of thousands, \nif not millions, of high-paying permanent and sustainable jobs in our \ncountry. These jobs cannot be exported. It is about restoring our \ncountry's place as a global leader in technology and innovation. It is \nabout ending our addiction to oil and our reliance on unfriendly, \nunstable regions from which it is imported.\n  Today we consume 21 million barrels of oil every day. That goes on \ntomorrow, the whole week, every week of the month, and every month of \nthe year. That oil costs our Nation $2.7 billion each day. That is what \nwe are paying for this oil. We import 65 percent or more of the oil we \nuse. We are spending about a trillion dollars every year, which goes \nstraight into the pockets of countries that don't have our best \ninterests at heart--and that is an understatement.\n  The bill is also about creating a clean energy revolution by capping \ncarbon pollution. A dwindling few continue to insist that global \nwarming is a hoax--their word, not mine--and that it is not manmade, or \nthat we should sit on our hands, stand by the status quo and wait for \nmore evidence. They say let the marketplace take care of it. The \nmarketplace has dug this hole we are in now and we are stuck in the \nhole. The marketplace has no roadmap to dig us out of this hole. These \nsame people would have insisted in years past that cigarettes are \nOK; smoking or chewing is fine; there is no need to put seatbelts in \ncars; people have the right to make their own decisions; you don't need \nmotorcycle helmets; certainly there is no reason to have speed limits \nanyplace at any time. These alarmists' and naysayers' time has passed.\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\n  Some say it is even cheaper to do nothing. Said a different way, they \nclaim this is an entirely earthly cycle. Just wait and all will be \nwell; our great Earth will correct it.\n  Some say we should wait until developing nations, such as China and \nIndia, take the lead. We heard the Republican leader say: Let them \nlead, not us. I say the United States, the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world, is obligated to lead, not to follow, on this most \nimportant issue of our time and perhaps of all time.\n  President Bush says: Let's bide our time until 2025. Is it cheaper to \ndo nothing? Of course not. It is the opposite. The longer we wait, the \nmore it will cost to solve this very difficult problem.\n  The Climate Security Act, the bill before us today, will cut taxes by \n$800 billion and finance the transition to clean alternative fuels by \nmaking polluters pay.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the sponsors of this legislation. This \nis bipartisan legislation. This is not some wild idea somebody came up \nwith that sounds good. It is an idea where the two sponsors, Lieberman-\nWarner, a Democrat and a Republican, members of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, got together and said: We need to do something \nabout this situation.\n  They both have records for integrity and advocacy that are in the \nbest keeping of the Senate. I don't always agree with Senator \nLieberman. As everyone knows, I think he has been wrong on the war, and \nI have told him that. Senator Warner and I have disagreed on issues in \nthe past. But I have great respect for both these fine legislators. \nSenator Warner is a man who has made a difference in his 29\\1/2\\ years \nin the Senate. His advocacy is making a difference. So I admire and \nrespect Senators Lieberman and Warner for their work on this \nlegislation.\n  I talked about this legislation cutting taxes by $800 billion, and it \nfinances the transition to clean alternative fuels by making polluters \npay.\n  While we are investing in renewable fuels and renewing our \nenvironment, we will be investing in an entirely new industry--a high-\ntech, ``green collar'' economy--that will create jobs and develop the \ngreat companies of today and tomorrow.\n  Hundreds of thousands of new jobs in renewable energy have already \nbeen created by foresighted investors who see the need for clean energy \nthat does not contribute to global warming. Millions more jobs can be \ncreated with the enactment of a strong cap-and-trade system that is in \nthis legislation.\n  My State, Nevada, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of \nAlabama--those Senators present--are blessed with all kinds of good \nthings in the environment. Specifically, though, Nevada, and most of \nour Nation, is blessed with an abundance of renewable energy resources \nthat far exceed anything we would ever hope to get from fossil fuels.\n  Take, for example, solar energy. In the West, it is tremendously \nabundant. In most all of our country, it is abundant. It is on the \nverge of tremendous cost and efficiency breakthroughs.\n  It is not as if it has not been done in other places. Look what some \nof the Scandinavian countries have done with wind. They don't have a \nlot of Sun, but they have lots of wind, and they are creating huge \nnumbers of jobs and lots of energy with their windmills.\n  There are people in the Midwestern part of the United States today \nwho are farmers who are making more money from their windmills on their \nfarms than they are from the crops they grow.\n  Solar energy, abundant in Nevada and the West, is on the verge of \ntremendous cost and efficiency breakthroughs. Geothermal energy can be \nfound in Nevada, California, New Mexico, and other parts of the West. \nWells can be drilled that harness the steam coming from the ground and \nturn it into productive energy. Wind energy can be effectively \nharnessed all across America.\n  We can break down the last barriers to the success of solar by \nenacting an effective cap-and-trade system that will level the playing \nfield with dirty, polluting energy. We have to win the battle against \ndirty, polluting energy. Should we, as some say, wait for China and \nIndia to act? Of course not. Since when does America let other \ncountries lead the way? It is our responsibility to forge the path \nother nations will follow. But beyond our moral responsibility is a \ntremendous opportunity for the green gold rush to take place here at \nhome.\n  Should we wait until 2025, as President Bush would have us do? I \ndon't think so. By 2025, our window of opportunity may well be closed. \nThat is what the scientists tell us. The tipping point the scientists \nfear--the time at which the environmental impact of global warming \nbecomes severe and irreversible--may have been reached by then, and our \nchance to create millions of new jobs, catalyze technology development, \nand keep investment in America will surely be lost. We must move \nforward. The path of delay, the path of wait and see--the chosen path \nof Bush and Cheney--ends in certain failure.\n  Let's withdraw our focus from oil and focus instead on solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and biomass energies. We must not settle for failure. For \n7\\1/2\\ years of the Bush administration we have come to expect it. We \nneed to do better.\n  The Boxer-Warner-Lieberman bill is bipartisan in the truest sense. \nWhat better opportunity than to show the American people and the world \nthe Senate is ready to move beyond partisanship to do the right thing. \nA time will come not far from now when a future generation will look \nback on us today. They will know what we know--that today global \nwarming is real. Did we take the opportunity, did we accept the \nchallenge to do something about it? That is what future generations are \ngoing to look back on. It is upon us to act now. We have to do it. The \nopportunity is here and we have to take it. That the future of our \nplanet, our economy, and our security depend on choices we make now is \nwithout question.\n  I hope all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will make \nresponsible decisions now to make future generations safe, secure, \nprosperous, and proud.\n  I will finally say, my friend, the distinguished Republican leader, \nin citing his authority for doing nothing, said to read Charles \nKrauthammer. Everyone knows Charles Krauthammer is one of the most \nconservative columnists in America. The Wall Street Journal is not a \nsufficient authority to overrule the vast majority of scientists in \nAmerica today--in the world today.\n  We are behind. Other countries are ahead of us. Great Britain and \nother countries around the world have done much more than we have done. \nWe have a responsibility. Our Earth, I repeat, has a fever. The fever \nis going up, not down, and we have to bring that fever down. This \nlegislation is our start to making our Earth well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4863-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I don't think, with all due respect to \nmy good friend, the majority leader, who decided to bring up this bill, \nthat discussing one of the most massive bills we have seen is a waste \nof time. I don't think 30 hours is too long. The Wall Street Journal, \nwhich he dismisses--I don't dismiss it--said:\n\n       This is easily the largest income redistribution scheme \n     since the income tax.\n\n  That was today's Wall Street Journal editorial. I wish to say, this \nis not a matter that should be lightly dealt with. Thirty hours is not \nenough. We need to spend a lot of time talking about what the \nprovisions are in this legislation, what we can do, as the majority \nleader says--and I agree, there are a lot of things we can do and we \ncan do now--but what we ought not to.\n  I have to defend my friend, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\nleader, who objects to this legislation, and his statement that the \nDemocratic leadership is out of touch. I have been traveling my State. \nI travel it a lot. I talk with a lot of people, and I hear one point: \nPeople are concerned about gasoline prices and energy prices. They know \nit is hurting their family budgets. Families are paying $50, $100 a \nmonth more this year for the same number of gallons of gasoline they \nwere paying 2 years ago.\n  Where is that money going? Sixty percent is going to foreign nations \nwhere our oil is coming from. We are transmitting from our Nation $500 \nbillion a year in wealth to foreign countries to buy this oil. So we \nneed to do something. This wealth transfer is the largest in the \nhistory of the world. We have never seen anything like it, and it is, \nin my view, impacting our economy adversely.\n  I certainly believe we ought to do everything we can to create energy \nsources at home at reasonable prices and that we ought to seek to serve \na lot of different interests.\n  I wish to respond to this sort of putdown of Mr. Charles Krauthammer. \nI think he is a fabulous columnist, a brilliant man, and a commentator. \nI believe the Wall Street Journal is one of the most sophisticated \neditorial pages in the country. I read an article in the Washington \nPost, from Mr. Robert Samuelson, pointing out the flaws in the \nlegislation that is before us today. Patrick Michaels, in the \nWashington Times, and others are talking about the difficulty with this \nlegislation. It is not a good idea, and it should not be done in this \nfashion, in my opinion.\n  We must be good stewards over this marvelous Earth over which we have \ndominion. It is also true that energy is a powerful force for good in \nthe world. It has been estimated that in countries where electricity is \nreadily available, the lifespan of the citizens are twice that in \nplaces where it is not. Electricity energy is the fabulous entity that \nhas provided for the marvelous expansion of our lives, the quality of \nour lives, the health of our children and families, and without it, we \nwould not be the people we are today. We would be still be hauling \nwater in buckets from the spring.\n  It makes no sense that we would see this in any other light than as a \ngood thing--how we can create more of it, cleaner, with less adverse \nimpact on the environment and less adverse impact on our economy--and \nis something we ought to do.\n  Many are convinced and cite a great deal of scientific evidence that \nthe world is warming and the time is short and the danger is great. But \nI think few would dispute the immensity of the Earth and the complexity \nof forces that are at work in our climate. So the warming experts have \ndeveloped the most astounding, complex computer models to study and \nexplain these forces and to monitor the warming trends that have been \noccurring for some decades, although apparently not the last 10 years. \nThese computer models predict a continually abnormal warming trend in \nthe long run. Many of our best scientists are convinced these computer \nmodels are fact, though others have questioned the extent of their \naccuracy of expected rise in temperatures and the negative consequences \nif it were to rise.\n  In a recent article by a senior fellow at Cato, Patrick Michaels, he \nnoted there are some legitimate questions. I say this because I think \nthere is certainly a majority view that we are, by emitting \nparticularly carbon dioxide, warming our planet and that can have \nadverse consequences. But he made these points a couple of days ago. \nOne point he made was that it is certain that the Earth has not warmed \nsince 1998. That was a warm year, a very warm year. And it hasn't \nwarmed since 2001 either. So it raises some questions.\n\n  Another study he quoted was published in Nature magazine by Noah \nKeenlyside of Germany's Leipzig Institute of Marine Science in which he \npredicts no additional global warming ``over the next decade.'' So the \nquestion is, if we haven't had any in the last 10 years, and he is \npredicting another decade in the future, it suggests that we need to be \nthoughtful about how we handle this program; that we need to reduce \ngreenhouse gases, reduce pollution, and we need to take strong steps, \nwhich I would support, but we need to do it in a thoughtful way.\n  Should we take action? Absolutely. Should it be a purely marketplace \nsolution? I don't think so. I don't think we have a purely marketplace \neconomy with regard to energy today. I believe government policies can \nimpact what happens in the energy world, and I think there are things \nthat we as a nation can do. So I would say, yes, I propose that we see \nand agree upon actions that can be taken now that will make a positive \ndifference. And we can do that, I am convinced, in a way that does not \ndrive up unnecessarily the burden on families or that mother who is \ntrying to take care of her children and fill the gas tank and add \nanother $1.50 a gallon.\n  By the way, that $1.50 a gallon increase on gasoline as a result of \nthis cap-and-trade bill was an analysis done by the Environmental \nProtection Agency--our own EPA--a group that certainly has earned its \nreputation for being a fierce advocate for the environment. The \nNational Association of Manufacturers also has scored it. They think it \ncould be as much as $5 a gallon. And the Heritage Foundation has higher \nnumbers than the EPA. So I don't know what it is, but I will tell you \nthat on top of the rise in prices we have already seen, this \nlegislation would drive up prices further. Not a single study suggests \nor says anything other than it will drive up the price of fuel on the \nAmerican consumer.\n  Now, I will be frank with you. I participated in a hearing a couple \nof years ago in the Energy Committee on the cap-and-trade system in \nEurope. It sounded like something we might consider. I was interested \nin the hearings. I had believed that the sulfur dioxide emission cap \nand trade had worked in the United States and that this might work too. \nBut after hearing the Europeans and business people and experts, I came \naway from that hearing in the Energy Committee very troubled.\n  Then, just a few weeks ago, we had another hearing on the economic \ncost of it, and it was very troubling indeed. So I have concluded that \nthose are not the right steps. This kind of legislation is not the \nright step for us to take. I do not believe we should go down this road \nwith this cap-and-trade proposal.\n  I want to note parenthetically, Mr. President, that the Environment \nand Public Works Committee that reported this bill to the floor never \nhad a hearing, never had a hearing on how the trillions of dollars in \ncost that this bill will impose on working Americans and on businesses \nin this country will impact our economy. They never discussed that.\n  So I thank Senator Bingaman, the Democratic chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, for at least having one hearing, with a few government \nexperts who ran some of the numbers and pointed out the cost that could \noccur from this legislation.\n  So I have concluded that the cap-and-trade program is not going to \nwork. It just will not work. It will create more lobbyists than ants in \nour country. It will, without doubt, sharply raise the cost of gasoline \nand electricity in America. It will make American businesses less \ncompetitive in the world, and it will surely damage our economy. It \nwill also be, as everyone who looks at it will admit, a secret, sneaky \ntax. It is a tax of about $7 trillion on the American people, with the \nmoney going to some sort of funds and unelected persons to be spent in \nways that we are not able to know right now how it will all be spent.\n  George Will, writing in the Washington Post on Sunday, called it ``a \nhuge tax hidden in a bureaucratic labyrinth of opaque permit \ntransactions.''\n  Now, is he an extremist? He is good with words, I will admit. I think \nthat is maybe too kind for this legislation. In reality there is an \nelement of power about it, and money. If the persons who propose this--\nat least those from the outside, particularly, who are advocating it--\ncan overwhelm us at this point and overwhelm our common sense and our \nnatural sense of caution, it may be that Congress will then turn over \nto them virtual control over the greatest engine of human progress the \nworld has ever seen, and that is the American economy.\n  If this cap and trade becomes law, there will be politics, campaign \ncontributions, corruption, promises, and lobbyists--yes, many \nlobbyists. It is\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\nperfectly natural. When the Congress takes control of large segments of \nthe productive capacity of our Nation and commences to pass \nlegislation, and bureaucrats begin to issue tens of thousands of \nregulations, the Congress will then be picking winners and losers. And \nbusinesses, union members, workers, cities, counties, States--special \ninterests--all do not want to be losers. They want to be winners. So \nthey must exercise, therefore, their right to petition Congress \nconcerning a host of matters they had heretofore never considered to be \na matter they would hear from Washington about. But now they have to be \nengaged.\n  I can go on, but you can see the picture, and it is not a pretty \nsight. So I have decided this is not the right way to go forward to \ndeal with the challenges that we face. It would be a calamity, I am \nconvinced, to impose this process on the American economy and the \nAmerican people. So I urge those who are listening today to pay close \nattention because those masters of the universe are at it again. They \nare ignoring the legitimate needs of the middle class and the poor for \nlow-cost, clean energy. They think they can just repeal the law of \nsupply and demand if we turn this economy over to them; that they can \ncreate energy and produce technological breakthroughs just by passing a \nlaw or by simply putting pretty words on a piece of paper. It is not \ngoing to work that way.\n\n  The ones who bear this cost will not be the Nobel prize winners \nliving in huge mansions but people who drive their cars and trucks to \nwork every day, who fight our wars, who contribute to their churches \nand other noble causes, and raise their children right. They are the \nones who will pay this cost. So I propose we get away from this \nconcept. It has not worked well in Europe.\n  Scientific American, last November-December, did a fabulous study. \nThis premier scientific journal, which believes in global warming, says \nwe ought to take strong action. You know what they say about it? From \nmemory, my best recollection of the quote is:\n\n       A simple tax is the best way to deal with this problem. But \n     because politicians don't have guts to impose a tax on \n     carbon, what they are going to do is pass this cap-and-trade \n     legislation, and it will be a below-the-radar-screen tax. And \n     as a result, it causes many, many problems in implementation.\n\n  They pointed out those, one after another, in that important piece. \nSo I propose we look for things that work by getting busy now, \naccelerating into production the ideas that may take us further and \nfaster than we could proceed without government policy. In my view, \ncommon ground can be occupied on a need to deal with important issues \nalong with global warming.\n  I think we need to deal with national security--our dependence on \nforeign oil. We need to continue to reduce pollution. We need to make \nsure we do not drive up cost and imperil our economy. We need to reduce \nCO2 global warming gases. We ought to focus on all those \nissues, not just one, and we should take actions that will work by \npromoting hybrid automobiles, which we have done. We have promoted \nethanol, and that has jump-started that industry. We can proceed to \nproducing hydrogen fuel cells. We are not there yet, but it is \npossible.\n  What about diesel automobiles? They get 35 or 40 percent better gas \nmileage. Conservation across the board should be a new ethic in this \ncountry as far as I am concerned. Wind, biofuels, especially cellulosic \nfuels can be beneficial, and I personally have seen that. We need more \nAmerican production of natural gas. Natural gas is much cleaner than \ncoal, and geothermal. But most particularly, I would note we are not \ngoing to reach our global warming goals, as Prime Minister Brown in \nGreat Britain announced recently, without nuclear power. He reversed \ntheir policy and said they are going to add five new nuclear plants.\n  We haven't built a nuclear plant in this country in 30 years. Nuclear \nemits no CO2. It is economically more productive and not \nmore expensive than other sources of energy. It emits no pollution into \nthe atmosphere, and it certainly is an American-made product that \nprovides for our independence from foreign intervention. We must do \nthat. Any legislation that does not deal or does not enhance nuclear \npower--and this one does not--is not going to help us solve this \nproblem.\n  So I would propose that we create an Apollo program, as we did in 8 \nyears when we were planning on going to the Moon. My friend, Senator \nAlexander from Tennessee, proposes a Manhattan project--well, OK--in \nwhich we move in quick order on a host of actions that could actually \nhelp us meet our global warming and our energy independence and our \neconomy's needs. We can do that.\n  Not a dime--not a dime--should unnecessarily be spent on bureaucrats, \nbean counters, technicians, regulators, lawsuits, or lobbyists. You \nthink we would not have lawsuits with this legislation? The effort and \nmoney should be spent on doing what works, and doing that now, the \nthings we know will work. I will support that.\n  I think we need a new department in the Department of Energy that \nwill focus exclusively on implementing a historic, coordinated effort \nto bring forward the many improvements that can make us more energy \nindependent and more secure; that will reduce pollution, strengthen--\nnot damage--our economy, and quickly begin to reduce CO2. I \nknow that can be done.\n  I have been in Alabama this week traveling the State and taking a \nlook at energy projects. Wood and switchgrass are being burned right \nnow in a coal plant generating electricity. I saw a new clean diesel \nengine at the Mercedes plant that can get 35 to 40 percent better \nmileage than gasoline. The Europeans, by the way, have half their cars \nin diesel because it gets much better gas mileage. There is sustained \nwork at the University of Alabama's Transportation Center on hybrids \nand plug-in hybrids. You plug in your car at night, at 11 p.m. to 5 \na.m., and charge your battery from a nuclear powerplant emitting no \nemissions, and you can drive and commute back and forth to work without \nusing a drop of oil.\n  That is the kind of thing that is within our grasp, that is not too \nfar away, and we ought to look at it. Hydrogen fuel cells and other \nideas were also presented at the university. Then, at Auburn \nUniversity, I saw a transportable cellulosic gasification unit that \nwill be brought to Washington on June 19, and they are going to receive \nthe top award in the Nation for that. Wood goes in one end, it is \nheated, and out comes gas or liquid fuel, and at a price we believe can \nbe competitive. It is clean energy, American energy, reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil, and because it is from a plant--cellulose--\nit is not increasing the net CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n  I visited a small Christian school where students are working on \nalgae as a source for gas for fuel. It has promise--trust me. I visited \nHuntsville, where, since 1984, they operate an incinerator to burn \ngarbage for steam that operates the military's base at Redstone. This \nis proven. It is working. No other city in Alabama has such an \nincinerator. Another Alabama plan would take municipal waste and make \nethanol from it. We were briefed on that. I visited the Jenkins Brick \nCompany near Birmingham recently, and the heat they use comes from \ncaptured methane that comes off a landfill. So they are heating and \ncooking their brick with an energy source that, if leaked into the \natmosphere, would be a particularly pernicious greenhouse gas. We have \nseen the collection, in Fairhope and Hoover and other places, of \ncooking oil for biodiesel instead of throwing it in the landfill. These \nare all actions that work.\n  I say let's forget this legislation, let's get busy doing things that \nwill work. I and the American people are fed up with a dependence on \nforeign oil and the resulting high prices driven by the OPEC cartel \nthat meets to decide how much they want to tax the American economy. \nThey want to fight back. They are willing to take strong action now. \nBut they are not understanding what this bill does. They do not expect \nthe Congress to pass a bill that is going to cause them to pay even \nhigher prices; that is going to create a huge bureaucracy with more \nregulations, lawsuits, lobbyists, and trillions of new taxes going to \npeople who are not accountable to the American people--and they should \nnot.\n  Snuffy Smith, the old cartoon guy who, in my youth, lived up in the \nmountains--he was a pretty good ethanol maker himself; maybe Senator\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nWebb would know that neighborhood--used to say, ``Great balls of fire, \ntime's a wastin'.'' I say time's a wastin'. Let's get busy now, but \nlet's do the things that work. Let's not create a bureaucracy that will \nbe counterproductive.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4866-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if you will let me know when I have gone \n20 minutes, I will greatly appreciate it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so notify the \nSenator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a historic day, not only for our \ncountry, but I think the world is watching us. It is because we have a \npressing issue called global warming, climate change; you could call it \neither one. Scientists have told us that in fact we have a very small \nwindow right now within which to respond. But it is a historic day \nbecause for the first time we have what I call tripartisan legislation \nout of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is the Boxer-\nLieberman-Warner bill. It is a Democrat, it is an Independent, and it \nis a Republican. We have come together to say to our colleagues and to \nthe American people: Finally, we are going to deal with this critical \nchallenge.\n  I wish to take a moment to thank Senator Reid for scheduling this \nmatter. There were a lot of voices saying: Why do this now? Why do we \nhave to do this now? I know, because I came to the Congress with Harry \nReid, why he wants to do this now. Because it is, in fact, one of the \ngreatest challenges of our generation and we have to respond with a \nlandmark bill, it will take us a while. We must get started. We \ncertainly hope our colleagues will vote to get started. If they do not \nvote to get started, they are going to have to explain why they have \nturned their backs on the world's leading scientists and on the Bush \nadministration's own political appointees--such as the head of the CDC, \nwho told us that we face real problems if we do not act, such as the \nvectors that will now live in warming waters. They will be turning \ntheir backs on the intelligence community and the military community, \nwho have looked out in the future and have written papers--and this is \nthe main reason John Warner is into this--telling us that if we do not \nact, we are going to see desperate refugees throughout the world. We \nare going to see droughts and floods worse than the ones we have seen. \nWhen refugees are moving because of rising waters, droughts, or floods, \nyou are going to see wars develop in all parts of the world. That is \nwhy Senator Reid said yes. He said yes to American leadership. That is \nwhat we want to say by moving to this bill and supporting it. We say \nyes to green jobs.\n\n  Because the President already said he is going to veto this bill if \nit passes, I have to say it is very interesting that one of the reasons \nhe gave is that in one of the models, it shows that gas prices will go \nup 50 cents a gallon in 20 years. That would be 2 cents a year. In \nfact, if you look at the record of this administration--and they have \ndone nothing to stop it--gas prices have gone up, under their watch, \n250 percent. Just take a look at this chart--250 percent, from $1.47 to \n$3.94; 250 percent. This administration did nothing. Now when they come \nforward and they say we can't pass this bill because gas prices will go \nup, here is the truth.\n  The truth is, because we are going to get better fuel economy--\nbecause of a bill the President did sign, and we are glad he supported \nthis part--you are going to be putting less fuel in your tank. So even \nif it is more per gallon, you are going to be getting better mileage, \nso you are not going to feel that 2 cents a year. And second, and this \nis key, it is fitting for this administration which has supported big \noil and supported foreign oil and goes to the Middle East and holds \nhands with the leaders there and kisses them on the cheek and begs for \noil--it is very fitting: They are still the voice of the status quo. \nThey are still the voice for continuing our dependence on oil.\n  This is what has happened without a climate change bill. This is what \nhas happened without a bill to fight global warming. We see this \nridiculously impossible increase in costs, and then the administration \ndoes nothing about this but is scaring the people and saying they are \ngoing to get hit with higher prices.\n  Let me also address this. In this Boxer-Lieberman-Warner substitute \nthat is before us, we have in there two things we didn't have in the \nLieberman-Warner bill. One is a deficit reduction fund.\n  You can take down the chart now. It is too ugly to look at.\n  In the Boxer-Lieberman bill, we did not have a deficit reduction \ntrust fund, and therefore people could have argued that this is going \nto be a terrible thing for us as we look out in the future. We put that \nin there, and CBO says our bill is deficit neutral.\n  We also have in this bill a very large piece--almost $1 trillion--of \ntax relief. So when we do see some increases in energy costs in the \nearly years--electricity, for example--we can offset that because there \nwill be tax relief and then there will be this consumer relief that \nwill go through the utilities. They will give rebates immediately.\n  For those people who said: Oh, my goodness, we are moving forward \nwith this and we need to make sure we can get off the track, I want to \nsay thank you to Senators Bingaman and Specter who, in their bill, had \ncreated what I thought was a very important off-ramp. The one thing I \ndidn't agree with them on was the price they pegged for the price of \ncarbon because the business people I spoke to, including those in \nSilicon Valley, said: That is a mess. If the price is too low, then \nbusiness will simply not invest. The Silicon Valley people and the \ninvestors from across this country--we had one at a press conference \ntoday who said he represented, I think, a $4 trillion fund,\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\nsaid they are waiting to invest in new green technologies, in new jobs. \nThey are waiting to do it. They are waiting for this legislation. But \nthey will not do it unless we don't have an easy off-ramp, we have an \noff-ramp that can be used in circumstances that warrant it.\n  We have put the number between $22 and $30, which reflects the \nconsensus of the labor groups as well as the environmental groups. We \nhave tried to come together. We have tried to put this together in such \na way that it essentially moves us forward, takes us where we have to \ngo, and takes us there in a way that will mean the creation of millions \nof jobs.\n  Some of our colleagues will say this: Why do this now? We are in a \nrecession. Precisely because we are in a recession is why we should be \ndoing this. This bill is the first thing that brings us hope.\n  We sent a rebate check to people. I am really glad we did it. I voted \nfor it. Guess what. We had no money to do that. We had to go into the \nred to do that. We had to go into deficit spending to send a rebate \ncheck. This bill gives us the funds to give relief to our consumers. \nThis bill does that.\n  I compliment Judd Gregg because I have had meetings with him, and \nthis was his point. Mind you, he wants to give it all back to \ntaxpayers. We use some of it for investments in these new technologies \nso we can swiftly move away from foreign oil and big oil, but it was \nJudd Gregg--who I know was not a fan of our bill, again because of what \nI said--who gave us this idea and this notion that we could have these \nfunds to return to our consumers.\n  I know Senator Warner, who is on the floor now, has many \ncontributions he is going to talk about in this bill. I will not go \ninto details. But he also said it was important that the President has \nan ability to say: Wait a minute, this bill goes a little too far. We \nhave to take a pause, a timeout. He has written it in such a way that I \nam very supportive of it because it balances the powers of the \nPresident and Congress. He will talk more about it.\n  Now that I see my two colleagues are on the floor--I have not had a \nchance to thank him on the Senate floor--I want to say to Senators \nLieberman and Warner how much they mean to me--on this issue and also \npersonally. I will not get overly emotional about it at all, but I will \nsay this about Senator Warner: Senator Warner has a legacy that if he \ndidn't do one more thing in the Senate, if he just decided to come by \nand say ``Hi'' to us for his last 6 or 8 months, it would have been \nenough. It would have been 10 times what most of us will achieve.\n  His legacy on national security is unparalleled; you know that and I \nknow that. You have spoken to me about it. But when Senator Warner came \nto me, since I am now chair of the EPW Committee--which is the deepest \nand greatest honor I have ever had--and he said: I have been doing a \nlot of thinking about this, Barbara, and I think we have to move; we \nhave to get America back into a leadership position; I have told Joe \nLieberman; he said he is going to work with us.\n  I knew at that moment we would, in fact, reach this day. Now, even \nreaching this day was not easy. When you read ``How a Bill Becomes a \nLaw,'' and it says, you take it to the subcommittee, and the \nsubcommittee approves it; you take it to the full committee, the full \ncommittee approves it; then you take it to the floor and the floor \napproves it, this was difficult for us to get through subcommittee and \nthen to get through the full committee and now to take it to the floor. \nWe know this is not easy. We know this is difficult. All great matters \nof the day are not easy. They take time. They take effort.\n  Landmark laws take effort. They do not happen overnight. But at \nmoments such as these, when we are dealing with such a big issue, we \nshould think back to our predecessors, when our predecessors in \nCongress saw rivers on fire from pollution or contaminated water that \nmade us sick or filthy air that filled our lungs, and magnificent \ncreatures such as the bald eagle close to extinction, Congress acted. \nWe were not afraid. We were not afraid. We stepped to the plate and \nsaid: This is America, and our ingenuity can resolve these questions. \nWe could have walked away. They could have walked away. But they did \nnot walk away.\n  Now we are going to find out who is going to walk away from this and \nwho is going to step to the plate. I think it is that important. The \nAmerican people deserve to know who is willing to step to the plate.\n  Now, look, every bill means we have to compromise. Lord knows. I am \nlooking at my friend, Senator Warner, and smiling because I am thinking \nof the many times he said to me: Senator, I do not think I can go there \nwith you.\n  Then he wanted something, and I said: Senator, I do not think I can \ngo there with you. But we met halfway here. We met halfway. That is \nwhat we need to do in the Senate.\n  I wish to say that my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator \nWebb, who is sitting in the chair, have allowed me into their lives, \ninto their offices. We have talked for hours. I have heard their \nconcerns. They have raised questions. In many cases, they have led us \nin a good direction to be stronger.\n  For example, in the case of Senator Webb, he had many concerns. One \nof them happened to be what about the countries we trade with, are not \nthey going to have an advantage? I cited the Bingaman-Specter bill \nagain and said: We took something good from that bill. We took that \npart of Senator Specter that deals with saying, if countries come and \nwant to bring in a lot of products into our Nation, and their countries \nare not doing anything about this, they are going to have buy \nallowances; they are going to have to do their part.\n  These are the kinds of things we hope to strengthen in this bill. \nLook, we have clear evidence, evidence that greenhouse gas pollution \nwill cause our planet to heat up well beyond what is safe. We have to \nact. I do not want to do more than is necessary; I do not want to do \nless than is necessary. I am trying to find that ``just right'' spot.\n  I do agree with Senator Warner that because we are looking out into \nthe future, we have to give the Presidents now and in the future the \nability to say: Let's take another look. We also have to continue to \nlook to the scientists. Therefore, in our bill we say, the scientists \nshould submit a report every few years. We need to see if we are doing \ntoo little or is it just right and adjust to it.\n  I think I mentioned this before. Senator Reid deserves a lot of \ncredit for bringing this bill forward. We have wasted time. Look, I \nblame myself. I blame myself. I did not grab the reins of this thing \nearly enough in my career.\n  I have to say, Senator Lieberman did. Senator McCain raised the issue \nearly on. I had some problems with their approach, and I did not \nengage. I admit this. This is the hardest thing for anyone to admit, \nfor a Senator to say: I was wrong. I was wrong. I did not get it.\n  I have to give Al Gore and all the people who came before the \ncommittee when I got the gavel a year ago, a year and a half by now--\nand we said: You know, we are going to look at this thing. I did not \nhave all the answers then. I had a lot of questions. We had the world's \nleading scientists, we had religious leaders, we had State leaders, we \nhad Republicans, we had Democrats, we had businesses, we had mayors.\n  We had 25 full-blown hearings on this. Plus we had lunches and we had \ndinners where we invited in the scientists, the experts, people from \nEurope who have taken the lead, to ask them questions.\n  They made a lot of mistakes in the beginning. We were nervous about \nthat. I remember one of the first times Senators Lieberman and Warner \nand I spoke was, we have to make sure that whatever bill we work on \ndoes not give rise to speculation and get-rich-quick schemes.\n  So we have been very careful to learn from the mistakes Europe has \nmade. But when you cut it all up and you look at Great Britain, for \nexample, a very small country compared to us, they have cut back carbon \nby 15 percent. In the same time, they have raised their gross domestic \nproduct by 45 percent. They have created 500,000 new jobs.\n  You do not have to go that far. Go to my State of California. We are \nin a terrible mess right now because of the housing crisis. We have so \nmuch of the foreclosure problem. We have a recession in housing and in \nconstruction. I was told unequivocally that because of\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\nour global warming legislation we have there, 450 new solar \nbusinesses--and I am not even looking at nuclear and I am not looking \nat wind, I am looking at solar--450 companies have formed.\n  They are hiring many of the workers who are losing their jobs in the \nconstruction industry. So there are ways to do it that are wrong. There \nare ways to do it that are right. Now, today, you will hear from those \nwho wish to kill this bill, kill it, kill it as dead as they can. They \nsay it is too complicated, that we should do nothing and we should \ncontinue the status quo.\n  Well, the status quo is devastating, my friends. The scientists have \ntold us that. The price of gas is off the charts. My friend, Senator \nLieberman, made this point beautifully at a press conference we had. \nThe whole point of the bill is to get us off oil, is to unleash the \ngenius of America so there are investments in alternatives, alternative \nfuel cars that get better fuel efficiency.\n  I will tell you this, knowing what I know from California, it is \ngoing to have a positive and beneficial effect; whereas, if we turn \naway out of fear, out of fear mongering, out of scare tactics, out of \nsaying global warming is a hoax, it does not exist, look at scientist \nX, look at scientist Y.\n  You will hear it all on this floor. You will hear it all on this \nfloor. But I remind you, there were people who said the world was flat, \neven when everyone knew it was not. There were people who said \ncigarettes did not cause cancer, when the rest of us knew they did. \nThere are still people who say HIV does not cause AIDS. They are wrong. \nI can go on.\n  Oh, airbags, they will not save lives. Wrong. When you stand on the \nSenate floor, whether you are a Democrat or Republican, an Independent, \nwhether you are short or tall or medium, whenever you challenge the \nstatus quo, watch out, folks, because the slings and arrows are going \nto be at your back, at your front, at your side.\n  I am ready. Why am I ready? I am ready because we have unbelievable \nbipartisanship on this bill. The quality of this partnership runs deep. \nLieberman and Warner, Lieberman and Warner.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes 15 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. The bipartnership on this runs deep. \nI have mentioned Senators Lieberman and Warner. Every member of my \ncommittee on the Democratic side and even some on the Republican side \nwho did not like the bill contributed to the debate. Colleagues all \nover the Senate helped us.\n\n  The Energy Committee helped us. I will tell you, I went into member's \noffices, and I got great ideas from many offices. I mentioned Senator \nGregg gave me a great idea. He does not like this bill because he wants \nto give all the money back. He does not want to invest any of the \nmoney, but he gave me a great idea on the tax cut. We had Senators \nCantwell and Murray point out the importance of hydropower and how we \ncould address that.\n  I could name colleague after colleague. Senator John Warner, who will \nbe here for a lot of this debate, is a magnificent voice on this \nsubject. I put him in the category of Al Gore on this subject. He knows \nwhat he is talking about. He helped so much without any credit. He put \ntogether business meetings, he put together dinners. He had people come \nover. We studied together. We studied with scientists. It was like \ngoing to school.\n  Senator Kerry, Senator Casey. And I could go on with other \ncolleagues. The fact is, I am not fearful of what is going to come at \nus starting soon because we have the facts on our side. We have a deep \nwell of support from colleagues who know their stuff. There are 11 \nNational Academies of Science that concluded climate change is real. \nThe Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Committee on Climate Change: \nGlobal warming is unequivocal. Human health impacts, children and the \nelderly vulnerable. I have lots of other information which I do not \nhave the time to do.\n  I mentioned national security. National security. A report by the \nCenter for Naval Analysis found that the United States could more \nfrequently be drawn into situations of conflict to help provide \nstability before conditions worsen and are exploited by extremists. \nThis is what Senator Warner said so wisely.\n  So in summing up at this point, I urge my colleagues to vote yes to \nproceed. I do not know whether there is going to be a deliberate effort \nto try to stop us on this motion to proceed because I have not been \ninformed. I can only say to colleagues: Do not be fearful because you \nhave nothing to be fearful about.\n  I will tell you what there is to be fearful about: doing nothing, \nsaying no, turning your back on the scientists, on the religious \nleaders who are with us, on the mayors, the Governors, on so many \nsupporters who understand this. That would be dangerous because gas \nprices are shooting up to the sky. If we do not get off oil, that is \nour future.\n  With that bill, that is not our future. So if you want to be afraid, \nand that is your motive, to be afraid, you want to be afraid, vote no. \nIf you want to start to address energy independence, clean energy, if \nyou want to address the threats science says we face, vote yes on the \nmotion to proceed. Let's get down to this and have a great debate in \nthe Senate tradition. Because this issue definitely deserves to have \nthat kind of debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could we have the Chair advise the body \nwith regard to the existing time agreement. It would be my hope that I \ncould follow Senator Joseph Lieberman, since the two of us are the \nprincipal sponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what I would like to do, we do have it \nlocked in right now in terms of a UC. It would be Senator Specter next \nfor 5 minutes, me for 25 minutes, and Senator Lieberman for 20 minutes.\n  I will be managing the time in opposition. The time that has been \nrequested from me is for Senator Bond to follow Senator Lieberman. Then \nI am sure you would be on there.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will have to accept that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think I can resolve this. If my \ncolleagues will wait a minute, can you tell me how much time remains on \nour side after Senator Lieberman finishes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is Senator Specter speaking on the \nproponent or opponent side?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think he got some time from Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Undecided.\n  Mr. INHOFE. He is our time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Inhofe said he is speaking on his time, which is \nfine either way. But I am trying to find out how much time remains.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. After Senator Lieberman speaks, \nthere will be 29 minutes left.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I give 2 minutes to Senator Cardin following Senator \nLieberman and the remainder of the time to Senator Warner?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I propose that Senator Warner and I divide the 20 \nminutes I have. I will take 10 and Senator Warner can take 10. Then we \nwill fill in after that. We have been in this together from the \nbeginning and we are going to be on the boat at the end as well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is that all right with the Senator?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is most generous, but you take 15, I will \ntake 5.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I refuse the offer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So it is 10 and 10.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. After we hear from Senators Specter and Inhofe.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for squeezing me in \nfor 5 minutes. I sought this time to talk very briefly about the \nBingaman-Specter bill which is aimed at solving the problem of global \nwarming but is somewhat more moderate than the Warner-Lieberman bill.\n  I will take a few seconds on a personal note. I have had quite a few \npeople take a look at me today and ask me how I am. On C-SPAN 2, some \npeople may notice I am a little pale, a little thin, and a little bald. \nI feel better than I look. I have gone through this chemotherapy for \nHodgkin's once, and I am optimistic about doing it again. But I agree \nwith Senator Boxer that this is an historic day, and I wanted to be \nhere at the outset of this debate.\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\n  I have long been concerned about the problem of global warming, and I \ncongratulate Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman for what they did \nseveral years ago and what Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman are \ndoing now. I think it is vital that we move ahead on this issue, and I \nintend to vote yes on the motion to proceed. It is my hope that in this \ndebate we can reconcile many of the interests. Warner-Lieberman and \nBingaman-Specter have a lot of similarities, but there are significant \ndifferences. I believe it is going to be difficult to get 60 votes to \nimpose cloture so that this bill can move ahead. Senator Bingaman and I \nstarted a long time ago, 18 months ago, in January of 2007, with a \ndraft bill. We were ready for introduction July 11, 2007, and assembled \na large group of labor, business, industry, and environmentalists to \nsupport the bill which we have. I would like to see us attain the goals \nof Lieberman-Warner. I would like it very much. But for reasons which \nare detailed in my extensive written statement, I do not believe that \nis possible.\n  On February 14 of this year, at the request of management and labor, \nI testified before the Finance Committee on the issue of what importers \nwere going to have to do. Illustratively, China wants 30 years. Well, \nin 30 years there won't be a steel industry. We have to reconcile a \ngreat many conflicting interests. My State is a major coal State. One \nof the top experts on Capitol Hill on this subject, Tom Dower, worked \nmonths working through complex issues with labor and management and \nconservationists. The details of a very extensive analysis are set \nforth in my floor statement, but that is the essence of my approach \ntoday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     America's Climate Security Act\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss \n     the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill, S. 2191/S. 3036, \n     ``America's Climate Security Act of 2007.'' It is my \n     intention to support cloture to end debate on the motion to \n     proceed to this legislation, however I have concerns about \n     the legislation some of which I will outline here.\n       Global climate change is potentially the greatest threat to \n     mankind and our planet that our civilization has ever faced. \n     The amount and quality of scientific data continue to improve \n     our understanding of global climate change. This information \n     points toward potentially severe ramifications for Earth's \n     climate, ecosystems, and life as we know it. The most recent \n     assessment in February 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that ``most of the observed \n     increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th \n     century is very likely due to the observed increase in \n     anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.'' This 90% \n     likelihood of human impact on the global climate adds to the \n     compelling case that action to fight climate change is \n     warranted.\n       Some skeptics of the human contribution to this global \n     problem remain, however their voices grow more distant as \n     more information comes to light and the realities that we \n     face in terms of regulatory uncertainty around this issue \n     have given rise to calls for action from the business \n     community. Given past uncertainties, I have previously been \n     unable to support legislative proposals which have threatened \n     U.S. economic interests without meaningful environmental \n     benefit. The Senate voted 95-0 in 1997 to overwhelmingly \n     support the Byrd-Hagel resolution (S. Res. 98) rejecting the \n     Kyoto protocol for its unequal treatment of developed and \n     developing nations, as well as the potential serious harm to \n     the U.S. economy. Subsequently, the Senate has twice voted on \n     climate change legislation offered by Senators McCain and \n     Lieberman--failing by votes of 43-55 in 2003 and 38-60 in \n     2005. As I stated on the Senate floor at the time, the \n     McCain-Lieberman bill did not contain adequate protections \n     for the U.S. economy, nor did it adequately address the \n     global nature of the problem.\n       Given my commitment to finding a way for the U.S. to combat \n     global warming, Senator Bingaman and I offered a Sense of the \n     Senate amendment to the 2005 Energy Policy Act. An effort to \n     set aside our amendment failed 54-43 and it was subsequently \n     passed by voice vote. The resolution called for adoption of \n     an economy-wide program that will slow, stop and reverse \n     greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy and that \n     will encourage action by developing nations. Meeting these \n     dual tests is a great challenge that I believe must be met \n     not just to pass a bill into law, but to ensure the effort's \n     long-term viability and support from the American people.\n       Following the 2005 debate, Senators Domenici and Bingaman \n     as Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources issued white papers \n     and held Committee sessions to debate the merits of various \n     approaches to this issue.\n       In January 2007, Chairman Bingaman and I proposed a \n     ``discussion draft'' of comprehensive legislation to address \n     climate change. Between January and July, our staff held a \n     series of public workshops for stakeholders and Senate, \n     House, and Administration staff. Hundreds of people attended \n     these sessions and hundreds more were involved in other \n     meetings to provide comments, suggestions, and concerns. We \n     heard from electricity generators, mining companies, \n     transportation fuel refiners, natural gas producers, energy-\n     intensive manufacturers, consumer groups, environmental \n     organizations, conservationists, sportsmen, labor unions, \n     faith-based organizations, and many others.\n       The culmination of this process was the introduction of the \n     Bingaman-Specter ``Low Carbon Economy Act of 2007,'' S. 1766, \n     on July 11, 2007. We held a memorable press conference in the \n     Energy Committee hearing room in the Dirksen building flanked \n     by key supporters of our bill from labor groups, energy \n     companies, and conservation organizations. I was very pleased \n     to stand with Richard Trumka (AFL-CIO), Cecil Roberts \n     (Mineworkers), Bill Klinefelter (Steelworkers), John Rowe \n     (Exelon), Jim Miller (PPL), Jim Rogers (Duke Energy), Jeff \n     Sterba (PNM), Mike Morris (AEP), and David Crane (NRG \n     Energy). We also greatly appreciated the support of 21 groups \n     representing millions of hunters, anglers and other \n     conservationists including Ducks Unlimited; Trout Unlimited; \n     National Wild Turkey Federation; and Pheasants Forever. In \n     addition to Senator Bingaman and I, our bipartisan cosponsors \n     included Senators Akaka, Casey, Harkin, Murkowski, and \n     Stevens.\n       The ``Low Carbon Economy Act'' creates a strong and \n     credible approach to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) \n     emissions while protecting the U.S. economy and engaging \n     developing countries. The Act creates a cap-and-trade program \n     for U.S. GHG emissions that is modeled on the successful Acid \n     Rain Program. By setting an annual target and allowing firms \n     to buy, sell, and trade credits to achieve the target, the \n     program is designed to elicit the most cost-effective \n     reductions across the economy. The target is set to avoid \n     harm to the economy and promote a gradual but decisive \n     transition to new, low-carbon technologies.\n       The strategic targets of the Act are: Starting in 2012 \n     reducing U.S. GHG emissions to 2006 levels by 2020 and 1990 \n     levels by 2030. To limit economic uncertainty and price \n     volatility, the government would allow firms to make a \n     payment at a fixed price in lieu of submitting allowances. \n     This fee, referred to in the bill as the ``Technology \n     Accelerator Payment'' (TAP), starts at $12 per metric ton of \n     CO2-equivalent in the first year of the program \n     and rises steadily each year thereafter at 5 percent above \n     the rate of inflation. If technology improves rapidly and if \n     additional GHG reduction policies are adopted, the TAP option \n     will never be engaged. Conversely, if technology improves \n     less rapidly than expected and program costs exceed \n     predictions, companies could make a payment into the ``Energy \n     Technology Deployment Fund'' at the TAP price, to cover a \n     portion or all of their allowance submission requirement.\n       Under the Act, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions \n     from petroleum and natural gas are regulated ``upstream''--\n     that is, at or close to the point of fuel production. For \n     these fuels, regulated entities are required to submit \n     tradable allowances equal to the carbon content of fuels \n     produced or processed at their facilities. Regulated entities \n     that must submit allowances include: Petroleum refineries, \n     natural gas processing facilities, fossil fuel importers, \n     large coal-consuming facilities, and producers/importers of \n     non-CO2 GHGs. GHG emissions from coal are \n     regulated ``downstream'' at the point of fuel consumption.\n       The proposal sets out a detailed methodology for \n     distributing tradable emission allowances. At the beginning \n     of the program in 2012, a majority (53 percent) of allowances \n     are given out for free to the private sector. This amount is \n     gradually reduced each year after the first five years of the \n     program. In addition, 8 percent of allowances will be set \n     aside annually to create incentives for carbon capture and \n     storage to jump-start these critical technologies; 24 percent \n     of total allowances will be auctioned by the government to \n     generate much-needed revenue for the research, development, \n     and deployment of low- and no-carbon technologies, to provide \n     for climate change adaptation measures, and to provide \n     assistance to low-income households; 5 percent of allowances \n     are reserved to promote agricultural sequestration; and 1 \n     percent of the allowances will reward companies that have \n     undertaken ``early actions'' to reduce emissions before \n     program implementation. Another 9 percent of the allowances \n     are to be distributed directly to States which can use \n     associated revenues at their discretion to address regional \n     impacts, promote technology or energy efficiency, and enhance \n     energy security.\n       To effectively engage developing countries, the Act would \n     fund joint research and development partnerships and \n     technology transfer programs similar to the Asia Pacific \n     Partnership. The bill also calls for a Five-Year Review \n     Process that provides an opportunity to reassess domestic \n     action in light of efforts by our major trade partners (and \n     relevant\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\n     scientific and technological developments). If by 2020 other \n     countries are deemed to be making inadequate efforts, the \n     President could recommend to Congress that products imported \n     from such countries must be accompanied by allowances (from a \n     separate reserve of allowances) sufficient to cover their \n     embedded greenhouse-gas content. If there is sufficient \n     international progress in reducing global greenhouse gas \n     emissions, the President could recommend changes in the U.S. \n     program designed to achieve further reductions (e.g., to at \n     least 60 percent below 2006 levels by 2050).\n       There are many other provisions of this comprehensive \n     legislation that help set the U.S. on the right track in \n     taking meaningful steps to combat global climate change and \n     put our trading partners on notice that we take this issue \n     very seriously. Strong U.S. leadership will go a long way in \n     moving the Nation and the world toward a cleaner and more \n     sustainable future.\n       Much of the Lieberman-Warner bill tracks closely to the \n     Bingaman-Specter bill. The two bills regulate the same \n     entities (oil and natural gas producers; coal consumers; and \n     non-CO2 greenhouse gas producers) using the same \n     approach--cap-and-trade. They both initially provide a free \n     allocation of roughly three-quarters of available allowances \n     for affected industries and special purposes, while selling \n     the remaining quarter through a government auction, the \n     proceeds of which are used for technology research, \n     development, and deployment, as well as climate change \n     adaptation and other purposes. Both bills transition many of \n     the free allocations to auctions over time--thus providing an \n     increasing price signal to affected industries that they must \n     invest in new technologies.\n       While these provisions are similar, there are fundamental \n     differences that cause me great concern. First, the emissions \n     reductions ``targets'' or ``caps'' in Lieberman-Warner are \n     very stringent and potentially unattainable without high \n     cost. The bill begins in 2012 and would limit emissions to \n     2005 levels; it would require 19 percent below 2005 by 2020 \n     (1990 levels); and 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\n       The second crucial problem of the Lieberman-Warner bill is \n     the lack of adequate cost control mechanisms like a Bingaman-\n     Specter-style ``safety valve'' or price cap, particularly in \n     the context that we are considering taking unilateral action \n     on a global problem for which many of our trading partners \n     are not. Theoretically, the costs of a cap-and-trade program \n     will be manageable if optimistic assumptions about the \n     availability of affordable low-carbon technologies prove \n     correct, very meaningful improvements in energy efficiency \n     and conservation are attained, and ample ``offsets'' or \n     allowances from non-regulated entities like farmers are \n     readily available. However, there is a great deal of \n     uncertainty about all of these crucial elements.\n       Therefore, there must be some protection for the U.S. \n     economy as a whole and various sectors that would have to \n     shoulder the burden of higher than expected costs. It is for \n     this reason that I believe any cap-and-trade program should \n     include a ``safety valve'' or cap on the price of each ton \n     emissions. Without such a protection, a series of risks \n     remain including cost-sensitive industries moving production \n     overseas as a result of higher energy prices in the U.S. that \n     could not be passed through to consumers in a competitive \n     market. It is worth noting that such production would likely \n     move to countries that are not taking actions to reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions, so essentially making the problem \n     worse. Other risks include raising energy costs in the \n     transportation and electricity sectors to levels that could \n     not be met by consumers, thus exacerbating the overwhelming \n     situation in which many Americans already find themselves.\n       I understand Chairman Boxer has included a new cost control \n     mechanism in her substitute bill that is modeled on \n     suggestions from the Nicholas Institute at Duke University \n     and the National Commission on Energy Policy, as well as the \n     U.S. Climate Action Partnership. My staff participated in a \n     number of meetings with the offices of Senators Boxer, \n     Lieberman, Warner, Baucus, and Bingaman over the timeframe of \n     January through April 2008 in an attempt to explore options \n     to control costs. I am disappointed that Chairman Boxer \n     decided to include these new cost containment auction \n     provisions without first vetting their details with me and my \n     staff. Upon review of the details provided in the substitute, \n     it appears that a number of emission allowances (6 billion \n     tons) would be borrowed from 2030-2050 and placed into a \n     reserve fund that could be used to release into the market in \n     the form of another auction. In 2012, the President would \n     choose a price between $22 and $30 from which this additional \n     auction of allowances would occur, and in subsequent years \n     the auction starting price would rise 5 percent over \n     inflation annually. While this is an interesting concept, it \n     is entirely unclear to me what effect, if any, this would \n     have on the cost of the program. It is clearly complicated \n     and does not likely provide affected industries with the same \n     level of certainty that is inherent in a safety valve with an \n     established price. I believe the new cost containment \n     provisions require extensive review and in the meantime, a \n     safety valve should be added--the details of which should be \n     open to discussion, debate, and analysis as well.\n       Some other concerns I have with the current bill involve \n     the international competitiveness provisions that were first \n     included in the Bingaman-Specter bill and were conceived by \n     American Electric Power (AEP) and the International \n     Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). On February 14, \n     2008, I testified before the Senate Committee on Finance at a \n     hearing on the international implications of climate \n     legislation. I outlined my thoughts that the provisions in \n     the Bingaman-Specter and Lieberman-Warner bill to require \n     imports by the year 2020 to have credits to account for the \n     carbon emitted in their production is consistent with trade \n     law. The Boxer substitute has made some changes to these \n     provisions, including moving forward the start date of import \n     allowance purchases to 2014. While this and other provisions \n     are welcome, I remain concerned that we still have not gotten \n     this part of the legislation quite right. I intend to work \n     with my colleagues and affected industries like steel, glass, \n     iron, aluminum, cement, pulp, paper, chemicals, and \n     industrial ceramics, to shore up these imperative provisions.\n       I also understand that certain emissions from industrial \n     production were intended to be exempted because there is no \n     alternative method of production. These ``process gas \n     emissions'' provisions should be made very clear so as to \n     remove any uncertainty by these industries. Without these \n     protections, the competitiveness issues again might lead \n     companies to shift production of energy-intensive products \n     like steel to countries without emission standards.\n       Finally, as I review the Lieberman-Warner bill, I am \n     concerned that it does not provide the essential pathway to \n     the future of coal use and thereby protect consumers from the \n     price impacts of a rapid shift from coal to natural gas for \n     electricity consumption. The U.S. currently produces half of \n     its electricity through the combustion of coal. While there \n     is also a great deal of capacity to burn natural gas, the \n     high price of natural gas leads most regions of the country \n     to only use it at times of peak demand. However, if a price \n     to carbon places natural gas in a competitive advantage \n     relative to coal use, we could see immediate shifting to this \n     resource which is also used as a feedstock or raw material in \n     chemical and fertilizer production. Natural gas prices in \n     recent years have experienced a great deal of volatility. \n     Coal, by comparison, has been relatively stable and less \n     expensive.\n       If our Nation hopes to meet its rising energy demand into \n     the future and keep prices for consumers affordable, any \n     climate change response will have to factor how to bridge to \n     that point in the future when capture and storage or \n     sequestration of carbon dioxide is commercially deployable \n     and regulated to ensure the environmental integrity of \n     pumping millions of tons of carbon dioxide underground. This \n     technology will not only be a key to meeting domestic energy \n     needs while protecting the environment, but is likely the \n     most effective way we can influence the greenhouse gas \n     emissions of developing countries like China and India that \n     are heavily dependent on coal. Under all modeling scenarios \n     of climate change legislation, carbon capture and storage is \n     shown to be critical. Otherwise, we will have to greatly \n     exceed all expectations for deployment of nuclear energy, \n     renewable energy, efficiency, and conservation, as well as \n     other low carbon technologies, all of which will already be \n     called upon to shoulder a tremendous burden in shifting our \n     economy from one that is carbon-based on low-carbon-based. I \n     intend to work with my colleagues to ensure this clean future \n     for coal use.\n       In conclusion, the Senate has a unique opportunity to pass \n     our Nation's first comprehensive climate change response. \n     While this is an extremely complicated issue, much work has \n     been done to date and it now comes down to finding the right \n     balance between limiting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and \n     protecting the U.S. economy. This is often the challenge of \n     environmental policy and we have found the right approaches \n     in the past--including the acid rain cap-and-trade program \n     after which this legislation is modeled. I look forward to \n     working with all of my Senate colleagues as this debate \n     proceeds. I thank the presiding officer and yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is my hope that we will reconcile all these interests \nand move ahead, but I think it is very important that we not search for \na goal we cannot attain and end up doing nothing. We know the maxim \nthat the perfect is the destroyer of the good.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Oklahoma will yield \nfor a moment, I say to my colleague, we have served together now for 28 \nyears in this body. I wish you well in this latest chapter, but I also \ncommend you for the forthright manner with which you have always come \nforward in this body at any time. If there is an ounce of reduction in \nthe tremendous energy you apply to your work here in the Senate, you \nacknowledge it, but always saying you will be back stronger than ever. \nI wish you well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for those remarks. I \nfeel better than I look, which isn't necessarily saying a whole lot.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to have an opening statement. \nLet me say that my good friend Senator Boxer and I, the last time we \nhad a major bill on the floor, were in agreement with each other having \nto do with the Water Resources Development Act and, prior to that, \ntransportation reauthorization. On this, we very much disagree. She has \nevery right to be wrong. I wish to also mention, since she commented \nabout the possibility that the cloture vote might be tough, I don't \nthink it will be because there are a lot of people who very much oppose \nthis legislation who are going to vote for cloture, including some of \nthe leadership on our side that is opposed to this bill. Although the \nvast majority of the scientists do not believe that manmade \nanthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, are a major contributor \nto climate change, that is not a part of the debate of the Lieberman-\nWarner bill. If it were, it would take a lot more time than we will be \nable to devote. So we are not going to discuss that. That is for \nanother day. As we begin the debate today, the climate legislation, I \nwant to make a few points.\n  First, I wish to discuss what we as Republicans stand for, then talk \nbriefly about the process of how we got to the debate and how we got \nthe debate on the floor today, then, finally, discuss how we wish to \nsee the floor debate progress over the coming days or perhaps the \ncoming weeks, as some believe it might be.\n  First and foremost, we, as Republicans, believe any legislation that \nattempts to address climate change must protect American families and \nmust protect U.S. workers. It has to maintain global fairness and, \nfinally, offer clean energy solutions. Unfortunately, this bill, the \nClimate Security Act of 2008, which, it is my understanding, is what it \nis called now since this has been an amendment or a substitute that we \nare considering, fails on all of these counts.\n  We believe any climate legislation must offer clean energy solutions. \nSubstantial investment must be made in new clean energy technologies \nwhich would generate more energy efficiently by producing less carbon \nwithout the Government picking winners and losers. It makes good \nbusiness sense to produce energy more efficiently, and American \ncompanies are at the forefront of developing these new technologies. We \nsupport investments in solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and other \ninnovative technologies, but we must be careful not to interfere in the \nfree market system or we might stifle new innovations. Any approach \nthat addresses climate change must incorporate more emission-free \nnuclear power. We are on the verge of a nuclear renaissance in this \ncountry, and it is key to our long-term domestic energy independence. \nWe have to address the remaining issues that hinder the construction of \nnew nuclear plants such as loan guarantees, waste, and regulatory \ncertainty. Senator Domenici, the greatest champion the nuclear industry \nhas ever had, is retiring at the end of this year. I can think of no \ngreater honor to him than to make his renaissance a reality, the \nrenaissance of nuclear energy.\n  Coal is our most abundant energy source. It must be a part of any \nsolution. We must invest in clean coal technologies in order to \nincrease our energy security. While we are continuing to explore carbon \ncapture and storage, we cannot hold the future use of coal hostage to \nthis one technological feat. Senator Byrd has been a tireless advocate \nfor greater use of coal, and I know Senator Voinovich and Senator \nBarrasso on the committee have been championing its use.\n  We need to promote natural gas. Increasing supplies of natural gas \nare needed in order to compensate for fuel switching which could harm \nAmerica's industrial base and export jobs. We know that fuel switching \nis taking place right now. We have an almost limitless supply of \nnatural gas available, and we have proven we can develop this important \nresource in an environmentally friendly way. I wish to see us build \nupon Senator Warner's past work and open up more of the offshore \nresources which would be absolutely necessary for us to capture this \nnatural gas.\n  We must seriously consider how climate legislation will impact \neconomic competitiveness. Emissions are a global issue which should be \naddressed globally, not unilaterally. All major emitting countries, \nincluding developing nations, must participate in order for any U.S. \nprogram to produce meaningful reductions in atmospheric concentrations \nof greenhouse gases. Today China emits more carbon dioxide than we do. \nThat divide is only going to grow because 2 years ago we produced more \nthan they did. China is increasing their number of coal-fired \ngenerating plants by two each week. The Kyoto treaty expires next year, \nand any future treaties should include developing nations. Any action \nhas to provide real protections for the American economy and jobs. \nAmerican jobs should not go overseas where environmental laws are less \nstrict and emissions increase. If the United States were to act \nunilaterally, manufacturing facilities will go overseas, because they \nhave to go where the energy is. We know that. That is where the energy \nregulations or emission regulations are more lax. This will result in \nmore emissions at the industrial source and more emissions in \ntransporting products back to the United States.\n  Let me repeat that. In the event we acted unilaterally and we had a \ncap-and-trade system that ended up reducing emissions of \nCO2, then companies that would be the losers in this program \nwould merely move to China or India or down to Mexico. There they don't \nhave any emission requirements. So it would actually have the effect of \nincreasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Any action \nhas to provide real protections for the American economy and jobs. We \nmust protect American families. Any action should not raise the cost of \ngasoline or energy to American families, particularly for the low \nincome and elderly who are most susceptible to energy costs. Those who \nmake $20,000 a year spend one-third or more of their income on energy. \nWe can't turn our back on less fortunate people. We have to carefully \nconsider the policy tools used to enact any climate legislation. Any \nsolution must not include slush funds controlled by Federal \nbureaucracies used to reward political friends. The climate solution \nshould not require an overhaul of our economy, and those decisions \nshould not be made by nameless bureaucrats rewarding friends or pet \nprojects.\n  Senator Corker has examined this legislation carefully and has \noutlined over 45 new programs created by this bill. As the Wall Street \nJournal said last week:\n\n       This bill would impose the most extensive government \n     reorganization of the American economy since the 1930s.\n\n  We can't afford any tax increases either directly or indirectly. We \nmust recognize that true innovation comes from the private sector. This \nbill will raise over $6.7 trillion from carbon sales and auctions \nprimarily coming from consumers. In other words, consumers are going to \nbe paying the $6.7 trillion. But it does direct $2.45 trillion back to \nconsumers. So if all the transition assistance funding goes directly to \nconsumers without the businesses or States keeping any of the funds to \nrun their transition programs, which they are allowed to do, this means \nthat over $4.2 trillion will be used to fund new government programs. \nThe Senator from California referred twice in her opening remarks to \nSenator Gregg, complimenting him, saying he believes the only \ndifference between the two of them is he wishes to send this back to \nthe taxpayers rather than to have $4.2 trillion of new bureaucracies in \nthis country. I agree with that. Any solution has to be national in \nscope without States or regions imposing duplicative or additional \nrequirements on top of a Federal system. It will be impossible for \nAmerican industry to remain competitive if different regions or States \nhave additional climate programs on top of a Federal program.\n\n  Finally, any national program must contain a transparent, effective \ncost-control mechanism to avoid harm to the economy and job losses. \nThere are many ideas out there which might work, including ideas from \nSenators Bingaman and Specter. Senator Specter just spoke. Simply \nborrowing credits from future years will only create a larger problem \nlater on.\n  How we got here: Unfortunately, the bill we are discussing today \nviolates all of these principles. It ignores the needs of American \nfamilies. It jeopardizes the jobs of American workers. It does not\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\noffer a global solution and, in fact, will increase global emissions. \nIt does not promote good, clean energy solutions and, in fact, will \nmake us even more dependent upon foreign sources of energy.\n  One of the chief problems with this legislation is that it was \nhastily considered by the Environment and Public Works Committee \nwithout the benefit of the appropriate legislative process, and a new \nversion is now being considered on the Senate floor that we have had no \nhearings on whatsoever.\n  The chairman of the Environment Committee has stated--and you are \ngoing to hear again and again today and in the next few days and maybe \nthe next few weeks--that the committee held over 20 hearings last year \nbefore proceeding to a substitute and a full committee markup. However, \nyou must take a look at the type of hearings we held. Most of the \nhearings examined the potential impact of climate change 50 years in \nthe future. My favorite example is a hearing held on May 24 last year: \n``The Issue of the Potential Impacts of Global Warming on Recreation \nand the Recreation Industry.'' That was the name of the hearing. The \napparent point of this hearing was to show that if there is no snow in \n50 years, the skiing industry might suffer. Well, I think that is \nprobably a reasonable statement, and I think it would. But the thing \nis, that did not really address a cap-and-trade system that we needed \nto study before coming to the floor.\n  Unfortunately, the list of issues unaddressed by this committee is \nlonger than the actual list of hearings the chairman did hold. These \ntopics, which were never explored by the committee prior to crafting \nthe legislation, include how to draft a cap-and-trade system--how do \nyou do it--how to allocate credits; how to design an auction system; \nhow many credits to assign each industrial sector; how to structure the \nCarbon Market Efficiency Board; how to create a domestic offset \nprogram; what to do with international offsets; what the impacts would \nbe on fuel switching; whether carbon capture and storage technologies \nwill be available by 2030; whether the number of nuclear powerplants \ncan be built in time to provide the necessary electricity; how the \nimpact on the natural gas supply will affect other industries; how many \njobs will be sent overseas; how much worldwide emissions will increase \nwhen U.S. jobs will be sent overseas; what the international \nprovisions' impacts will be on trade and particularly exports; how to \neffectively contain costs through a transparent mechanism. The list \ngoes on and on and on.\n  Contrast this committee process with the process currently underway \nin the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Chairman Dingell's \ncommittee, which has jurisdiction over climate change and environmental \nissues in the House, is pursuing the issue under a much more methodical \nand deliberative process, as any legislation of this magnitude demands. \nAcknowledging the complexity of the issues surrounding any mandatory \ngreenhouse gas reduction policy, the committee has held a series of \nhearings and has released several white papers. The topics have \nincluded the fundamental aspects of greenhouse gas cap-and-trade \npolicy, including the point of regulation and the benefits of auction \nversus allocation schemes; the interaction of climate change policy \nwith other environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act, the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act; State and \nFederal preemption issues; international competitiveness and how to \nengage the developing world; and technology barriers. These are only \nthreshold issues, as each one lends itself to further examination. Now, \nthat is what has been done over in the House of Representatives in \nChairman Dingell's committee, and he has made a lot of progress over \nthere, and there are some things we should pay attention to. In fact, \nwe plan to be using some of that on the floor here.\n  While the subcommittee did hold one legislative hearing prior to the \nmarkup and the full committee held three such hearings over a 2-week \nperiod before the full committee markup, all these hearings were held \nwithout the benefit of any economic or environmental analysis. The \ncommittee members had no idea what the impacts of this legislation \nwould be when we considered the bill in December. We offered a number \nof amendments to protect workers, families, and to try to keep a check \non energy prices. Almost all of them were defeated. But we were \npromised that our issues would be addressed before the bill reached the \nSenate floor. Well, that was last December.\n  On May 20, less than 2 weeks ago, the committee bill and report were \nfinally filed after a more than 5-month delay. For a bill of this \nmagnitude--and I remind my colleagues how the Wall Street Journal \ncharacterized it--I will repeat again--``this bill would impose the \nmost extensive government reorganization of the American economy since \nthe 1930s''--only allowing Senators to review the report for less than \n2 weeks is highly troubling.\n  Even more troubling is that the same week, we all saw for the first \ntime two more versions of the same bill. Later on May 20 a new version \nof the bill with a never before seen amendment was filed and held at \nthe desk as a new bill, S. 3036, which is actually the version we will \nbe voting on this evening.\n  Then finally, on Friday, May 23, a managers' substitute which \ncompletely rewrote the legislation was circulated to Members. I can \nonly assume that once cloture is invoked--and it will be invoked--and \nwe begin debating this bill, the substitute will be offered, which, of \ncourse, is something that has never been the subject of hearings, \neconomic analysis, or an environmental benefits test.\n  Since the markup last December, we have had numerous economic \nmodeling and analysis conducted by the EPA, the Energy Information \nAgency, and multiple private sector analyses. Unfortunately, the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nnever bothered to hold a single hearing on any of these economic \nreports.\n  I would like to point out that the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee held an economic hearing on our bill 2 weeks ago, \nand I applaud Chairman Bingaman for holding that important hearing. I \nwill be quoting from that hearing from the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee several times during the course of this debate.\n  So where are we today? We spent months holding impact hearings and \nthen rushed through a few quickly scheduled legislative hearings and \nheld a markup without any analysis of the bill. We then waited over 5 \nmonths before receiving yet two more drafts of the bill--the last \nversion a mere 10 days ago. The Senate is now being asked to vote for \ncloture on a motion to proceed to a bill that was released 2 weeks ago.\n  Although I believe we really need to debate these issues on the \nSenate floor--and many of the Members who oppose the Lieberman-Warner \nbill are voting to proceed to it--I find it most difficult to vote to \nproceed to the largest tax increase in the history of America. The \nmechanics of this bill, the impacts, and the costs have never been \nfully debated, and they deserve to be. Proponents of this legislation \nhave talked about how important this bill is and why we need to act. I \nbelieve this warrants a full debate.\n  In 1990, the Senate spent over 5 weeks debating the Clean Air Act \namendments. I was serving in the House at that time. It went on and on \nand on. This bill goes much further than the Clean Air Act amendments \nin its impact on the American economy and jobs and our international \ncompetitiveness. It will do more to direct our energy policy for the \nnext 50 years than either the Energy bill of 2007 or the Energy bill of \n2005 combined. I hope the majority intends to provide enough time to \nfully debate this legislation and does not plan to rush it on and off \nthe floor in an attempt to check a box.\n\n  Over the next few days, you will see a number of Republican \namendments, which I believe will get bipartisan support, which will \nattempt to protect our workers, our families, our international \ncompetitiveness, and will promote clean energy solutions.\n  There have been many comments in the press, particularly from the \nchairman of the committee, that this bill will be pulled if any so-\ncalled weakening amendments are adopted. I hope we will have a \nconstructive and open debate on this bill. There will be many \namendments offered and, I hope, debated and voted upon.\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n  This bill is the largest bill we will consider this Congress. In \nfact, it is probably the largest bill ever considered by the Senate in \nits impact on the economy and our entire way of life, and I hope the \nmajority will give it the time it deserves.\n  But 2 weeks from now or whenever that vote does take place--keep in \nmind, tonight's vote at 5:30 is only a cloture vote on a motion to \nproceed. It is a procedural vote. It allows us to limit debate on the \nmotion to proceed to the bill. But whenever the real vote comes or \nhowever long it takes to reach the final vote, it will be both \ninteresting and informative to see how many Members of the Senate vote \nfor the largest tax increase in the history of America.\n  Now, we will be talking about a number of things during the course of \nthis debate. Some of this will be tonight, some of it will be over the \nnext few days. We are anxious to do that. For our purposes today, we \nwill be allocating time, and I would like to announce that after the \ntime that is already under a unanimous consent agreement to go to \nSenators Lieberman and Warner, we will start going back and forth. I \nwill be controlling the time for those who oppose the bill, and Senator \nBoxer or Senator Lieberman will be handling the time for those who \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at this point Senator \nCardin be recognized for up to 5 minutes. The reason for this request \nis Senator Cardin has to preside at 4 o'clock. Then we would go back to \nthe 20 minutes divided between Senator Warner and myself. Then \npresumably there would be somebody the Senator from Oklahoma would \ndesignate to speak. We are happy to add 5 minutes to the Senator's time \nto make it equal.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, that is all right so long as the \nallocation of time does not punish us.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to lock in, after your presentation, \nSenator Bond for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today America takes a major step forward \nin reasserting our leadership on the world stage. Upon enactment, the \nLieberman-Warner Climate Security Act will be the most aggressive \nclimate change bill in the world, slashing American greenhouse gas \nemissions by two-thirds by mid-century, putting America in the lead in \nreducing harmful emissions.\n  Let me begin by acknowledging the tremendous leadership of Senators \nLieberman, Warner, and Boxer. They have worked tirelessly to take on \nthis, the greatest challenge of our time. And they have done so with \ngreat intelligence, great skill, and a remarkable willingness to forge \na consensus that meets our needs. I salute them. They are extraordinary \npublic servants, and the Nation owes them an incalculable debt of \nthanks.\n  The Climate Security Act is truly historic.\n  The legislation will transform the American economy, positioning us \nto continue our global leadership for decades to come. Energy \nefficient, high-performance businesses will flourish here and serve as \ninternational leaders in ushering in sustainable economic growth around \nthe world.\n  Retooling the American economy for the 21st century will put us in \ncharge of our own energy supplies. Our current reliance on other \ncountries, many of whom are not friendly to Americans or the values we \ncherish, puts us at unacceptable risks to disruptions in the fuel \nsupply chain. This bill will put us on a path to energy independence \nand that is a path to improved national security.\n  Dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential to the \nenvironmental health of our planet. This legislation goes further, \nproviding billions of dollars in resources to plant forests, grow \nsustainable sources of biofuels, and protect and restore our most \nprecious natural resources, such as the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act is good for our economy, \ncritical for our national security, and essential for the health of our \nenvironment.\n  The bill will reassert American leadership among the nations of the \nworld. And we will do it the way America has always done it--with \ningenuity and hard work and leadership by example.\n  Global warming presents a real and present threat to our economy.\n  Four global warming impacts--hurricane damage, real estate losses, \nenergy costs, and water costs--will drain billions of dollars annually \nfrom our economy. By the end of the century, the annual costs from \nthese impacts alone will reach an estimated $1.9 trillion annually.\n  Clearly, these impacts would be devastating. Unfortunately, they are \nnot the only adverse economic costs of doing nothing.\n  Rising food prices and global food shortages underscore the need for \nstable, ample, and environmentally sound agricultural practices. But \nclimate change brings with it widespread droughts in some parts of the \nworld, an increase in plant pests and diseases, and reduced crop \nyields. The drought that has persisted in Australia in recent years has \nhad a devastating impact on the world price of wheat. Today's rising \ncost for a loaf of bread is a harbinger of the dramatic impacts on our \nfood supply if we fail to act.\n  And it is not just crops that will suffer. In the Chesapeake Bay \nrising water temperatures are blamed for a dramatic loss of the most \ncommon underwater grass in the lower bay. Eelgrass, as it is called, \nsimply cannot tolerate the warmer waters. That means crabs and other \nspecies have no habitat. Virginia and my home State of Maryland have \njust instituted dramatic reductions in the blue crab harvest next fall \nbecause of the falling numbers of crabs in the bay. Our multimillion \ndollar blue crab fishery is at risk--and at risk today--from global \nwarming.\n  The good news is that the actions we take to reduce global warming \nwill be good for our economy.\n  Through its innovative cap-and-trade system, the bill is designed to \nbe self-financing, and there will be sufficient funds to also make a \nmajor contribution to debt reduction.\n  American businesses will see an unprecedented Federal investment in \nretooling for tomorrow.\n  In the first 10 years, the bill provides $61 billion for renewable \nenergy. Wind, solar, geothermal and other zero- and low-carbon sources \nof power will get the boost they need to become an integral part of our \nenergy distribution system. And to prepare for that capital investment, \nthe bill also provides $18 billion over that same period for an Energy \nEfficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training program. We will have \nboth the infrastructure and trained workforce for a new energy sector.\n  In Frederick, MD, today we already have one of the world's leading \nsolar energy operations. Companies such as BP Solar will have the \nresources they need to grow their businesses and the trained workforce \nto build, install, and operate a new generation of electricity-\ngenerating equipment.\n  Our core heavy industries will benefit from $138 billion by 2022. \nThose funds will help iron, steel, pulp, paper, cement, and other \ncarbon-intensive industries with the assistance they need to remain \ncompetitive while they shift to cleaner energy sources.\n  Lehigh Cement's largest plant in America is located in Union Bridge, \nMD. The plant produces up to 2 million tons annually. The company will \nnow have the resources it needs to become even more efficient--and more \nprofitable--because of this transition assistance.\n  The bill contains provisions that will help American consumers make \nthe transition to tomorrow's economy, too. More than $800 billion is \nreserved for tax credits and tax cuts that will make sure that during \nthe transition average Americans don't have to bear the costs.\n  I am especially proud of a section of the bill I authored that will \ndirect about $171 billion, over the life of the bill, to States and \nlocalities for public transit nationwide. About two-thirds of this \nmoney will go to support existing systems such as Washington Metro, \nMARC and MTA, while about 30 percent will help develop new systems that \nwill take more and more cars off\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nour roads, cut dangerous emissions, ease congestion, and reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy sources, such as OPEC.\n  Today, too much of our national energy needs are supplied by other \nnations. Our reliance on foreign oil weakens our position in the world. \nToday, we are sending massive infusions of American dollars to oil-rich \ncountries that don't share our values and are often active opponents of \nAmerican foreign policy. We know that some of those petrodollars have \nbeen used to finance terrorists.\n  No entity relies on petroleum more than the American Department of \nDefense. We have a great strategic weakness with such a strong reliance \non foreign oil.\n  My senior Senator, Senator Mikulski, and I have been working with \nVolvo-Mack Truck in Hagerstown, MD, to build prototype heavy-duty \nhybrid trucks for military use. These trucks will dramatically reduce \ntheir need for oil because of their increased fuel efficiency. They are \nalso being tooled to handle a wide variety of biofuels. In the future, \nwe envision fuel-efficient vehicles powered by home-grown biofuels.\n  The bill contains funding to support these prototypes, putting them \ninto widespread use. Our military will benefit, along with the entire \ncommercial sector of our economy.\n  Global warming threatens our national defense in another way. Naval \nStation Norfolk in Virginia is a keystone location for American Naval \noperations. But Norfolk is under grave threat because of rising sea \nlevel.\n  At a hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee last \nsummer, scientists told us that sea level rise has been higher in the \nChesapeake Bay than worldwide because of a number of factors including \nland subsidence. Their best prediction is that we could see a 3-foot \nrise is water levels by the end of the century. Our critical national \nsecurity infrastructure lies directly in the path of these rising \nwaters.\n  Just 30 miles east from here in Annapolis, MD, the U.S. Naval Academy \nsits literally on the edge of the Severn River. The Academy has already \nseen damage from major storms. This is a story that is repeated up and \ndown the coasts of America. Our military installations and assets are \nat risk. We need to act to protect them so that our Armed Forces can \nprotect us.\n  While the Climate Security Act will have profound impacts on our \neconomy and our national security, at its heart, this is an \nenvironmental bill. The bill was reported by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. It amends the Clean Air Act. The Environmental \nProtection Agency is the central player.\n  The current administration has been painfully slow in recognizing the \nthreats to the worldwide environment that runaway greenhouse gas \nemissions are causing. Begrudgingly, they are now accepting the fact \nthat the impacts are huge and growing.\n  The legislation will reduce dangerous greenhouse gas emissions by \nover 70 percent from the 2,100 entities covered in the bill. Even with \nthe uncovered segments of the economy included, the emissions are two-\nthirds below 2005 base levels. These are impressive cuts. I think we \ncan do even better. The consensus scientific opinion in the world is \nthat we must do better. Cuts of at least 80 percent are required, and I \nwill support efforts on the floor to set that as our 2050 target.\n  Periodic reviews that are built into the bill will build the case, I \nbelieve, that we will need to do more to curb the most adverse \nenvironmental outcomes.\n  Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is essential to putting our global \necosystem back into balance. Doing so will have other direct health and \nenvironmental benefits. Bringing down CO2 emissions will \nalmost assuredly bring down nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and mercury \nemissions as well. The ozone code red days that are all too commonplace \nevery summer will be reduced as we cut greenhouse gases. Similarly, the \nfish consumption advisories that every State faces because of \nwidespread mercury contamination will gradually be lifted as mercury \nlevels go down.\n  Although the bill modifies the Clean Air Act, we will see major \nbenefits for our coastal areas, including the Chesapeake Bay. Rising \nwater temperatures will abate. The bill also provides extensive funding \nto manage the adaptation that will be needed for our natural systems.\n  A National Wildlife Adaptation Strategy will direct funding to those \nareas most likely to be adversely affected by climate change and ocean \nacidification.\n  The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Program and the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund are existing programs with strong State \npartnerships that have proven track records of effectiveness. Both will \nsee major infusions of financial support: $185 billion for the Wildlife \nRestoration Program and another $52 billion for the Conservation Fund.\n  Annually, Maryland would be expected to receive an additional $52 \nmillion for these well-established programs.\n  The EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and NOAA will all have \ndedicated programs to protect and restore our fresh and estuarine water \nsystems. The Chesapeake Bay is one of several water bodies specifically \nmentioned in the bill because of the value of the resources at risk and \nthe need for priority funding.\n  The Forest Service and the Department of the Interior will have \ncrucial roles to play as well. In all, the Federal investment in \nprograms to protect natural resources will approach $300 billion over \nthe life of the bill.\n  The time to act is now. There is no country in the world better \npositioned than the United States to undertake this historic challenge. \nWe have the world's strongest economy. We are the international leaders \nin climate science. We have an extraordinary history of facing the \ngravest challenges facing mankind. I believe that America is ready to \nmeet this change.\n  The time to act has long since passed. The time to catch up is now. I \nurge my colleagues to support the strongest possible Lieberman-Warner \nClimate Security Act. It is a challenge we can and must meet.\n  Mr. President, again, I acknowledge the tremendous leadership of \nSenators Boxer, Lieberman, and Warner in bringing forward this historic \nlegislation. The Climate Security Act is truly historic. The \nlegislation will transform the American economy, positioning us to \ncontinue our global leadership for decades to come. Energy-efficient, \nhigh-performance businesses will flourish here and serve as \ninternational leaders in ushering in sustainable economic growth around \nthe world.\n  Retooling the American economy for the 21st century will put us in \ncharge of our own energy supplies. Our current reliance on many other \ncountries, many of which are not friendly to Americans or the values we \ncherish, puts us at unacceptable risks to disruptions in the fuel \nsupply chain. This bill will put us on a path to energy independence, \nand that is a path to improved national security. This bill is \nimportant for national security. It is important for our economy, and \nit is certainly important for our environmental health.\n  The legislation goes further, providing billions of dollars in \nresources to plant forests, grow sustainable sources of biofuels, and \nprotect and restore our most precious national resources, such as the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  The Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act is good for our economy, \ngood for our national security, and good for our environmental health. \nThe bill will reassert American leadership among the nations of the \nworld, and we will do it the way America has always done it--with \ningenuity, hard work, and leadership by example.\n  Clearly, we know the scientific information as to the dangers we \nface. The dangers we face are real, with extreme weather conditions, \ndisruptions to our food supplies. We have seen this already. In my own \nState of Maryland, we have a problem today with the blue crab. The \nreason, quite frankly, is the waters of the Chesapeake Bay are just too \nwarm for the seagrasses and juvenile crabs cannot survive. That is bad \nfor our watermen. That is bad for our State. That is bad for our \neconomy. I can give you another 100 examples in Maryland where science \nis telling us that global climate change is real, hurting our economy.\n  The good news is that action we take to reduce global warming will be \ngood\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nfor our economy. Through its innovative cap-and-trade system, the bill \nis designed to be self-financing, and there will be sufficient funds to \nalso make major contributions to debt reduction. Because of the \nfinancing and investments in the legislation, it will help reduce our \nGovernment borrowing. It is good for our economy.\n  American businesses will see an unprecedented Federal investment in \nretooling for tomorrow. In the first 10 years, the bill provides $61 \nbillion for renewable energy. Wind, solar, geothermal, and other zero- \nand low-carbon sources of power will get the boost they need to become \nan integral part of our energy distribution system. To prepare for that \ncapital investment, the bill also provides $18 billion over that same \nperiod for an energy efficiency and renewable energy worker training \nprogram. We will have both the infrastructure and trained workforce for \na new energy sector.\n  For our core heavy industries, they will benefit also. There will be \n$138 billion to help heavy industries. Those funds will help iron, \nsteel, pulp, paper, cement, and other carbon-intensive industries with \nthe assistance they need to remain competitive while they shift to \ncleaner energy sources.\n  LeHigh, the largest cement plant we have in America, is located in \nUnion Bridge, MD. The plant produces up to 2 million tons annually. The \ncompany will now have the resources it needs to become even more \nefficient and more profitable because of this transition assistance.\n  I am especially proud of the section of the bill I helped author that \nwill direct $171 billion over the life of the bill to States and \nlocalities for public transit nationwide. I wish to thank Senator Boxer \nfor helping make this amendment a reality in this bill. About two-\nthirds of this money will go to supporting systems such as the \nWashington Metro, MARC, and MTA, while 30 percent will help develop new \nsystems that will take more cars off the road. This legislation will \nmake public transit convenient and economic.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this bill is important for our country and \nfor our future. I am proud to be a cosponsor. I urge my colleagues not \nonly to vote to bring up this bill, but let's work out the amendments \nand let's pass it so that America can regain its leadership in the \nworld on fighting the rising problems of greenhouse gases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair if I may be informed \nwhen 10 minutes has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  For the first time in the history of the Senate or of the House, a \ncomprehensive bill to curb global warming has reached the floor after \nhaving been reported favorably by the committee of jurisdiction. This \nhas happened, in my opinion, because of two people. One is Senator \nWarner, who joined the fight early on with me, to my great pleasure, \nand made this a bipartisan piece of legislation and was responsible for \nhelping us get it out of the subcommittee and the full committee. The \nsecond person is Chairman Boxer, whose drive and persistence and \nlegislative skill fashioned a majority within the committee and brings \nthis bill to the floor with some momentum behind it.\n  The fact is, twice in the past--in 2003 and 2005--Senator McCain and \nI brought a comprehensive climate measure to a vote in the full Senate, \nbut we had to do it by amendment because in neither case did the \nEnvironment Committee report it out favorably. I will say that the \namendment, as it is known, lost twice with a high vote total of 44. I \nam confident we are going to do a lot better than that in this \nconsideration. So the bottom line is, this Climate Security Act has \nreached this point through the regular order, as we say in the Senate, \nhaving earned increasing and diverse political support along the way. I \nthink that represents a tremendous step forward.\n  The Climate Security Act has a bipartisan list of cosponsors in \naddition to Senator Warner and myself, including Senators Coleman, \nCollins, and Dole, Senators Cardin, Casey, Harkin, Klobuchar, Nelson of \nFlorida, Schumer, and Wyden. Each of those Members contributed \nsubstantially to the bill while also helping garner support for it \namong other Senators and key constituencies. I cannot thank them enough \nfor their help and for the trust they have placed in Senators Warner, \nBoxer, and myself.\n  Senator Warner and I introduced the Climate Security Act for a very \nsimple but serious reason. It was to protect the environment, economy, \nand national security of the United States of America from the worst \neffects of manmade climate change.\n  Is it a problem, climate change? Well, just last week the Bush \nadministration itself released a scientific report confirming that if \nwe as a nation fail to take strong action now to cut our emissions of \ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, then the resulting climate \nchange will impose severe hardship on the American people.\n  The administration's Climate Change Science Report finds that over \nthe next 25 to 50 years increased temperatures will result in slower \neconomic growth and lower yields for staple crops such as corn, \nsoybeans, wheat, and rice. That is slower growth of those crops and \nlower yields. Arid regions of the United States will face more frequent \nwildfires, which will be made worse as fire-resistant plants are \nreplaced in the natural order by more combustible grasses.\n  In the American West, the mountain snows that provide a steady flow \nof water for irrigation and reservoirs will dwindle. Rainfall will come \nat times in amounts that will make it hard to manage. The sustained \ntemperature increases will stress livestock, slowing their reproduction \nand growth rates, thereby decreasing their milk production and \nincreasing the time to market for animal products.\n  Across the Nation, an increased frequency and severity of heat waves \nwill lead to more illness and death, particularly among the young, the \nelderly, the frail, and the poor. The climactic changes will allow \nanimal, water, and food-borne diseases to spread in the Nation or to \nemerge in areas where they have been limited or had not existed.\n  These are the findings of a report of the Bush administration.\n  Unfortunately, our failure to take any action to reduce or even \nstabilize our greenhouse gas emissions since the 1980s, when scientists \nfirst began to warn us about it, means that some part of the negative \nimpacts described by this administration's Science Report are now \ninevitable. That is the reality. Greenhouse gases don't go up and \ndissipate; they accumulate. They are there now, and some consequences \nare inevitable. The scientific community tells us that we can still \nprevent the situation from reaching much worse, even catastrophic \nproportions, if we take the lead now in reducing emissions of \ngreenhouse gases.\n  That is what this Climate Security Act would do. The bill, beginning \nin 2012--remember, that is not now, in 2012. So if we begin by passing \nthis legislation now, we are going to have some time to work with it if \npeople find reasons to fix it as we go along before it goes into \neffect. So beginning in 2012, this legislation would place a cap on the \naggregate greenhouse gas emissions of the 2,100 facilities in America \nthat are responsible for 85 percent of those emissions in this country. \nThis is a very important point.\n  People out there may wonder: Oh, my God. Does this mean in my little \nbusiness, in my factory, on my farm--am I going to have to start to \nfill out a lot of paperwork and get involved in this cap-and-trade \nbusiness? No. This is an upstream piece of legislation. Only 2,100 \nfacilities in America will be part of this cap-and-trade proposal. The \nbill would tighten the caps slowly and steadily, such that the \naggregate emissions of those sources of greenhouse gases would be down \nto about 30 percent of the current level by 2050. That would be a \nsubstantial accomplishment.\n\n  Making conservative assumptions about actions by other nations; that \nis, assuming other nations, including the rising great economic powers \nsuch as China and India--frankly, don't do much. The administration, \nthrough another agency, has determined that the emissions reductions \nachieved by the Climate Security Act would prevent atmospheric \ngreenhouse gas concentrations from reaching the level to which \nscientists ascribe a high risk of catastrophic impacts.\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\n  In other words, assuming that a lot of the other big nations don't do \nmuch of anything, this bill will make sure we fulfill our \nresponsibility to protect our citizens. In fact, it would keep global \nemissions below the catastrophic level.\n  Now, some say it will cost money. It will cost money. But what is the \ncost? Remember, this sets up a system where money is raised through the \nauctioning of allowances. But that money, a lot of it--that is, a lot \nof the money that will be raised--is immediately reinvested in research \nand development of new energy technologies, in subsidies to protect \npeople and businesses that are going to be most likely affected. We \nhave to understand as we consider this bill that it will not only deal \nwith the problem of global warming; this bill is the energy \nindependence, energy security act that America, in its right mind, \nshould have adopted 30 years ago. People have said we need a Manhattan \nProject; we need an Apollo Moon shot project to make America energy \nindependent, to break our dependence on foreign oil. This legislation \nwill invest more than six times the amount of money that the Apollo \nproject and the Manhattan Project combined spent. We need to do it to \nfree ourselves--free America--from dependence on foreign oil, from \ntyrants in places such as Iran and Venezuela.\n  Senator Warner and I asked the Energy Information Agency--a section \nof the Department of Energy of this administration--what would be the \ncost of our legislation. They responded that the Climate Security Act's \nimpact on the Nation's economic growth would be negligible. The fact \nis, under our bill they say America would continue to grow robustly \nuntil 2030, which is the period they measured, and would hit a level \njust 0.3 percent lower than under a business-as-usual scenario.\n  Mr. President, those are my opening comments. With great honor and \ngratitude, I yield to my friend and partner and cosponsor from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I will have further words about my \ncolleague. The chairman of our committee, on behalf of the Senate as a \nwhole, has some information which, certainly, I find very heartwarming. \nSo I wish at this time to yield to the chairman on a matter that is \nunrelated to the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CARDIN). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to read this e-\nmail and then to add 2 minutes to Senator Warner's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Senator Kennedy's Progress\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is the statement of Dr. Allan Freidman, who is \nSenator Kennedy's surgeon:\n\n       I am pleased to report that Senator Kennedy's surgery was \n     successful and accomplished our goals. Senator Kennedy was \n     awake during the resection, and should therefore experience \n     no permanent neurological effects from the surgery. The \n     surgery lasted roughly three and a half hours and is just the \n     first step in Senator Kennedy's treatment plan. After a brief \n     recuperation, he will begin targeted radiation at \n     Massachusetts General Hospital and chemotherapy treatment. I \n     hope that everyone will join us in praying for Senator \n     Kennedy to have an uneventful and robust recovery.\n\n  Mr. President, I share that with all of our colleagues. I think we \nshould take just 10 seconds to think about the Kennedy family and pray \nfor them--just 10 seconds.\n  Thank you so much.\n  I thank the, Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee and our colleague and friend for bringing that to the \nattention of all Senators. I have been privileged to know Senator \nKennedy for many years. His brother and I were in law school together \nat the University of Virginia in 1949. I recall then meeting the \nSenator for the first time when he visited the campus on occasion. But \nhe has been a very dear and valued friend, an absolute tower of \nstrength in this body which he loves so much: the U.S. Senate. So I \ncommend my colleague.\n  I also wish to thank my dear friend, Senator Lieberman. We have been \ntogether on so many legislative measures through the many years we have \nbeen here together, particularly as it relates to national security. He \nis a pillar of strength in his own right on this bill and in many other \nways. I admire the independence of the Senator. I admire his \ncommitment, his fortitude, and the strength which he has been tested on \nso many times. He is a great credit to this Nation and this \ninstitution.\n  Mr. President, I was indeed brought to this moment as a consequence \nof national security measures as there are implications with regard to \nglobal climate changes.\n  I don't use the term ``warming'' because it is, to me, a complexity \nof different climate variations--not only temperature but weather \npatterns manifesting in drought, patterns manifesting in floods, \npatterns manifesting in hurricanes, and all sorts of other things, such \nas tornadoes.\n  I have had the privilege of living a little bit longer than most in \nthis Chamber. Indeed, in my lifetime, I have never seen such a \ncomplexity and changes in weather. Certainly, the evidence seems to be \ncompiling every day that human activity and increasing carbon dioxide \nemissions are the causes. It is now time to deal with that situation.\n  I belong to the school of thought in this debate that we simply \ncannot do nothing; we cannot constantly postpone. Senator Lieberman and \nI, over a period of almost a year now, have put this bill together. It \nrepresents what we deem a consensus--I guess you would say a middle-of-\nthe-road position. We could not satisfy all those who want stronger \ncontrols put in, more immediate corrections; nor could we satisfy those \nwho sort of say let's wait and see. We felt we should put this \ntogether, bringing together the thoughts of so many of our colleagues. \nI would say that several dozen colleagues contributed to this bill. One \nis Senator Specter. In our bill, we relied on much of the good work \nincluded in Bingaman-Specter Low Carbon Economy Act.\n  Most significantly, our legislation includes provisions from their \nbill that protect U.S. manufacturers from competition with other \ncountries not curbing emissions. Second, we also ``borrowed'' their \nidea for providing ``bonus allowances'' to facilities that adopt carbon \ncapture and storage. This incentive is critical. The third point I will \nhighlight is that we tried to provide the price certainty envisioned by \ntheir ``safety value'' by including a ``rainy day account'' of extra \nallowances that would be released to the market if a certain price \npoint is hit. I thank those Senators for their very important \ncontributions in improving this bill.\n  Mr. President, another reason I am drawn to working to address the \nissue of global climate change is that there is a great feeling all \nacross America by people in small towns, large cities, and in State \nlegislatures that we must move and move now; that we simply must do \nsomething. In my view, doing nothing is not an option. We simply must \ndo something.\n  I believe the American people will be the final factor in this bill \nthat is now about to be pending in the Senate, as to whether sufficient \nvotes are garnered to send the bill eventually to the President after \nwe have a conference, hopefully, with the House of Representatives, \nwhich I am certain, if this is passed by 60 votes here, the House will \nquickly put together their own thoughts--they have done a lot of work--\nand we will have a bill that will go to the President. That will be \nlargely owing to the public, as they follow this debate and read about \nit, as they discuss it among themselves. They will send back a message \nto this institution that doing nothing is not an option. Do the best \nyou can. In crafting this legislation, we have done the best we can. If \nmy fellow Senators have ideas to further improve the legislation, I ask \nthem to bring them forward.\n  I commend the distinguished ranking member. He pointed out that he \nwill support going forward with this bill this afternoon and also that \nthere should be a number of amendments, hopefully, to strengthen it \nfrom the perspective of the ranking member and a number of colleagues \non this side of the aisle. Let's show the American public that this \ninstitution can work and address a complicated subject and try to reach \ncommon ground and understanding. To do nothing is not an option.\n  In the substitute amendment, we significantly improved the bill by \ngiving the President of the United States emergency authority to modify \nany requirement of this bill in the event of a\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\nnational, economic or energy emergency. In addition, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Carper and I will be offering an amendment with respect to \nnuclear power. I ask unanimous consent that this section of the \nsubstitute amendment, and my amendment with Senators Lieberman and \nCarper be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, the first provision I refer to deals with the \nauthority of the President of the United States. The Committee reported \nbill, I felt, did not give sufficient protections to the Nation for \nunforeseen things that could occur while this law is being met across \nthe Nation. So we give to the President the authority to change any \nprovision in this bill that he--or possibly she--deems appropriate. And \nthen it is up to the Congress to determine whether they support what \nthe President has done or not. I say that because we have drawn on a \nprocedure that has been time tested by the Senate, and indeed the \nCongress, to give such power to the President regarding legislation. \nSupposing that, as a consequence of the legislation, it is shown it is \ndamaging our ability to recover from what appears now to be a weakened \neconomy? Then the President can readjust the timetable or the provision \nwhich he deems is contributing to that problem.\n  Now, we ask the power industry--most notably those segments of the \nindustry dependent upon coal--coal is our largest natural resource of \nenergy. This bill does not in any way try to damage coal. It, in fact, \nis a bill that will help that industry--our power industry--which \nrequires coal as a source of energy for our daily needs. Give us time \nto explain to the coal industry how this is done. But if technology, in \nterms of capturing the CO2, conveying, transporting it to a \nrepository for sequestration--if that technology is not in place in a \ntimely way, the President can step in and readjust the timetable.\n  If there are national security implications from this bill that the \nPresident deems harmful, he can readjust this bill. So there are more \nthan adequate safety measures in here to protect this Nation, and the \nPresident has full authority to implement them.\n  The Warner-Lieberman-Carper amendment relates to nuclear power. We \nlooked at this in the course of the deliberations in the committee, and \nat that time, it simply was not feasible to include provisions. The \ndistinguished colleague from Oklahoma and others brought forward a \nnumber of provisions about nuclear power during the mark up, which we \ncould not accept at that time for reasons I think are apparent to all. \nBut I am happy to bring forth an amendment now, joined by my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Lieberman and Carper, to look at the \nabsolute essential requirement that we rely on nuclear power as a \ngrowing and a more important daily source of energy for this country.\n  Mr. President, I hope that when this debate has concluded, if it is \nshown that the proponents of this legislation have not met the majority \nrequirements of this body as to what is to be done legislatively now--\nnot in the future--to deal with this global climate change, then I hope \nthat another legislative proposal will be brought forward via \namendment, or perhaps even by a substitute bill, to replace ours. If it \nis the will of a majority to take that substitute, so be it. I hope I \ncan support it. But to do nothing is not an option, Mr. President.\n  How much time do I have under the 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute remains.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield that back to my colleague from Connecticut to \nwrap up for the two of us--in 1 minute, 1 year's work.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Subtitle B--Presidential Emergency Declarations and Proclamations\n\n     SEC. 1711.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 40 years of experience in the United States \n     relating to commercial nuclear power plants have demonstrated \n     that nuclear reactors can be operated safely;\n       (2) in 2007, nuclear power plants produced 19 percent of \n     the electricity generated in the United States;\n       (3) nuclear power plants are the only baseload source of \n     emission-free electric generation, emitting no greenhouse \n     gases or criteria pollutants associated with acid rain, smog, \n     or ozone;\n       (4) in 2007, nuclear power plants in the United States--\n       (A) avoided more than 692,000,000 metric tons of carbon \n     dioxide emissions; and\n       (B) accounted for more than 73 percent of emission-free \n     electric generation in the United States;\n       (5) a lifecycle emissions analysis by the International \n     Energy Agency determined that nuclear power plants emit fewer \n     greenhouse gases than wind energy, solar energy, and biomass \n     on a per kilowatt-hour basis;\n       (6) construction of a new nuclear power plant is estimated \n     to require between 1,400 and 1,800 jobs during a 4-year \n     period, with peak employment reaching as many as 2,400 \n     workers;\n       (7)(A) once operational, a new nuclear power plant is \n     estimated to provide 400 to 600 full-time jobs for up to 60 \n     years; and\n       (B) jobs at nuclear power plants pay, on average, 40 \n     percent more than other jobs in surrounding communities;\n       (8) revitalization of a domestic manufacturing industry to \n     provide nuclear components for new power plants that can be \n     deployed in the United States and exported for use in global \n     carbon reduction programs will provide thousands of new, \n     high-paying jobs and contribute to economic growth in the \n     United States;\n       (9) data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics demonstrate that \n     it is safer to work in a nuclear power plant than to work in \n     the real estate or financial sectors;\n       (10) while aggressive energy efficiency measures and an \n     increased deployment of renewable generation can and should \n     be taken, the United States will be unable to meet climate \n     reduction goals without the construction of new nuclear power \n     plants;\n       (11) modeling conducted by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Energy Information Administration demonstrate \n     that emission reductions are greater, and compliance costs \n     are lower, if nuclear power plants are used to provide a \n     greater percentage of electricity;\n       (12) the United States has been a world leader in nuclear \n     science; and\n       (13) institutions of higher education in the United States \n     will play a critical role in advancing knowledge about the \n     use and the safety of nuclear energy for the production of \n     electricity.\n       (b) Sense of Senate Regarding Use of Funds.--It is the \n     Sense of the Senate that Congress should stimulate private \n     sector investment in the manufacturing of nuclear project \n     components in the United States, including through the \n     financial incentives program established under this subtitle.\n\n     SEC. 902.

The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia. I \nthank him for an excellent statement. I think his point is well taken. \nLet's have a full and open debate and in the classic way and in the \nbest Senate tradition. Let amendments come forward. We believe strongly \nthat this problem is too real and too urgent to keep saying no, no, no.\n  We have come some distance in the Senate's consideration or \ndiscussion off the Senate floor about this. We are now at the place \nwhere almost nobody says this is not a problem, that climate change is \nnot occurring; just about everybody agrees it is.\n  Now the question is, What do we do about it? We have tried to \nfashion--I like what Senator Warner said--a balanced, kind of middle-\nof-the-road response to the problem of global warming. In dealing with \nglobal warming and climate change, there will also be the energy \nindependence declaration program that America needs to secure our \nfuture. You cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions unless you cut \ndependence on oil, and most of that oil comes to America from abroad. \nThis is an opportunity to deal with a big problem with a big solution \nand truly to secure and better the future of our country and its \npeople.\n  I often say, when people ask why Senator Warner decided to join in on \nthis, that he responded with remarkable brevity for a Senator. He said \ntwo words: Science. Grandchildren.\n  The science speaks loudly that we have a problem. He wants to feel, \non his watch, as we all should, that he did something to protect his \ngrandchildren and all our grandchildren from that problem. That is what \nthis legislation gives the Senate an opportunity to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their fine \nremarks about the need to cut carbon emissions. I agree with them on \ncutting carbon emissions. I think that is important. But I think it is \ntimely that we have this discussion now about the cost of it because we \nshould pursue cutting carbon emissions, but we cannot slash family \nbudgets, knock farmers and workers out of jobs and out of productive \nrevenue.\n  At a time when Americans are suffering record pain at the pump, high \nenergy costs, a mortgage crisis, and a soft economy, I am very \nconcerned about raising energy prices on our families and workers.\n  I just returned from a six-city energy tour in my State of Missouri. \nDid I learn something. From Joplin in the southwest of my State, to \nPalmyra in the northeast, families, businesses, farmers, and truckers \nare suffering from record-high prices. Drivers are fed up with gasoline \nprices approaching $4 and diesel prices even higher. One pump in Joplin \nis $4.75 for a gallon of diesel.\n  These truckers and small businesses are saying how they are \nstruggling now. Some are being forced out of business and don't know \nhow they are going to meet their fuel costs and still employ people and \ncarry the goods we need to get to market. When they pay higher prices, \nwe all pay higher prices for everything because transportation costs \nare a critical element. They are squeezing farmers already. Do we want \nto vote to make this misery much worse?\n  I fear that this bill, as currently drafted, will make our suffering \nfamilies and workers much worse off. The sponsors of the substitute \ntell us this bill will raise, between now and 2050, over $6.735 \ntrillion. I apologize that there are nine zeroes on the charts; so you \nhave to have two panels to have all the zeroes in that trillion-dollar \nfigure. It would not fit on one poster board. That is what this bill \nwould cost. Do you know where that cost goes? Similar to lots of stuff, \nit rolls downhill. This would roll down on the consumers. They are the \nones who will pay for it in energy prices--millions of families and \nworkers across the Nation.\n  Now, some may claim they are trying to hit energy companies with the \ncost\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nof this program. Does anybody think energy companies will continue to \nproduce if their costs go up this much? The first thing they do will be \nto pass it along to all of us, and we will feel it. Energy consumers \nand producers will have no other choice. That is because the technology \nto meet deep-and-fast carbon cuts, without massive economic \ndisruptions, doesn't exist today; and as I talk to scientists in my \nState, as we look at projects on which we are working, they will not be \nready for another 15 to 20 years.\n  We are working on some things that will work now. Biofuels is making \na small dent--a small, small dent. We can expand that a little more. \nBut even the advanced cellulosic ethanol processing is not economically \nfeasible now. Thus, the impossible mandates of Lieberman-Warner will be \na massive tax increase for all Americans.\n  To sum it up, cap and trade is a taxation, a massive taxation without \ntechnology. Cap and tax is what it was called in an article today.\n  The $6.7 trillion cost would hit my Missouri constituents \nparticularly hard. Experts at the American Council for Capital \nFormation predict Missouri will lose 76,100 jobs by 2030 if we enact \nLieberman-Warner. The average Missouri household will face a $6,852 \nextra cost per year. Energy cost for electricity will be 153 percent \nhigher. Gasoline cost at the pump will be 140 percent higher.\n  The Lieberman-Warner bill, regrettably, has a particularly unfair and \nharsh impact on America's heartland. This chart shows how much bills \nwill go up depending on where one lives. In the Northeast, it is 40 \npercent. In the Midwest, it is 137 percent. In the South, it is 104 \npercent. In the Great Plains, it is 113 percent. In Mountain/West, it \nis 87 percent. And the West Coast, not much. I mean no offense when I \nsay that it is easy when you look at the chart to see that the primary \nproponents of this measure, in the Northeast and the far West--the pain \nwill be focused primarily on the coal-dependent manufacturing jobs, \nheavy Midwest, South, and Great Plains.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this debate is that for all \nthe pain on families and workers, for all of its $6.7 trillion \npricetag, it will have no measurable impact on world temperatures. That \nis right; the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that if China \nand India do not institute similar plans to the same extent we do, as \nthey have already told us they will not, this bill before us will have \nno measurable impact on world temperatures. That means $6.7 trillion in \npain for American families and workers for no gain in global \ntemperature lowering.\n  I will have more to say about this issue during this debate in the \ncoming days. I also look forward to debating how we can cut carbon \nwithout cutting family budgets or worker payrolls. There is so much we \ncan do to reduce carbon emissions by increasing nuclear power \nproduction, and we do need to get more nuclear power. Do we have the \nscientists, the engineers? No. Do we have the basic vats that are \nneeded? No. We need to develop that industry in the United States. We \nneed to do something about reprocessing spent fuel. Right now we are \nlimited, we are constrained by our inability to get rid of spent \nnuclear fuel. We need to reprocess it and reduce it by 95 percent.\n  We need to expand coal technology, coal to liquid, coal gasification. \nThese are very important. But what do we do with the carbon? That is \nwhy we are working on a project in southwest Missouri, for which I got \nan earmark 4 years ago, to try sequestration underground. Is it going \nto work? We don't know. That is why it is a demonstration project.\n  We need to expand our domestic manufacturing supply base for more \nadvanced batteries to get more hybrid cars and trucks on the road. We \nworked with companies in Missouri to help them build better batteries. \nI would love to see the day when we have a full-size automobile, not a \ngolf cart, that we can plug in at night when power demand is lowest, \ncharge the battery, commute to work and back without ever having to \nstop at a gasoline pump. We are not there yet. We do not have the \nbatteries.\n  We need more next-generation work on cellulosic biofuels. I was \ntalking to the top scientists in Missouri on Wednesday. I was talking \nabout biofuels. We have hundreds and hundreds of square acres with as \nmuch as 4,200 tons of green wood that need to be cleaned out of the \nforest to make it healthy.\n  I said: Congress, in its wisdom, has already mandated we produce 16 \nbillion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022. I said: By the way, how \nis the technology to convert wood to cellulosic ethanol?\n  They said: We are not there yet. We haven't found a means of \nconverting wood to ethanol in an efficient, economically viable way.\n  I said: When do you expect it?\n  They said: We don't know.\n  I said: That is Congress; we passed a law saying you have to produce \n16 billion barrels, and we forgot to ask the scientists when we were \ngoing to get that conversion.\n  We are working on it, but we are not there yet.\n  In each of these areas, I am proud to say that Missouri is leading \nthe way to look for ways to reduce our carbon emissions. We want to do \nthat. Set aside the arguments over the international impact and what \nthe impact is. We will join with you in reducing carbon emissions, but, \nplease, friends, let us develop the technology and not impose taxes \nwhen we put on caps without the technology. Caps without the technology \nis a $6.7 trillion tax increase.\n  We can all be leaders in clean energy for the future. We need to do \nso without ruining our economy, which this bill would do.\n  I look forward to discussing this issue in a constructive manner with \nall my colleagues in the coming week, and I assume in the months and \nyears to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, Senator Domenici is on his way, and I \nwant to yield some time to him. He has been a real hero in our pursuing \none of the forms we are going to have to have if we are ever going to \nrun this great machine called America, and that is nuclear energy.\n  I was glad to hear the comments made by the Senator from Virginia who \nhad complimentary things to say about nuclear energy and what is \nnecessary if we are going to be able to continue to do this.\n  Before the Senator from Missouri leaves, he was referring to a chart \nthat showed the increase in the price of gasoline. I don't know whether \nhe still has that chart or if he has it in his notes. The Senator from \nMissouri went over it so fast. To me that is the focal point, at least \nin my State of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BOND. The price of gasoline----\n  Mr. INHOFE. One hundred forty percent.\n  Mr. BOND. We said 140 percent. There are various figures that would \nadd $1.44 to $1.45. This one is from the National Association of \nManufacturers. I believe the EPA figures say $1.40, $1.45. I can tell \nthe Senator that we are looking at significant increases in the price \nof gasoline. The low number would be $1.40, I believe, from the EPA.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Missouri also to \ncomment on the predictions as to what it would cost to the average \nhousehold. In my presentation--and the Senator was in our caucus when \nwe had a meeting--I had one chart that showed the United States. It \nshowed how much it would cost an average household. My State, Oklahoma, \nand Texas were the largest hit. The increase for each family would be \n$3,300. Missouri was in the next tier down, which I think was around \n$2,800. That is something I think is very significant.\n  Mr. BOND. We have $6,852 on the average Missouri household. Our \nsource for that is National Association of Manufacturers, March 13, \n2008. Obviously, these costs are only estimates. When you realize that \nthose States, such as Missouri, which depend on coal--and no telling \nwhat the grand czars will allocate, the unelected bureaucrats will \nallocate for coal production or utilities burning coal. They are right \nnow $13 a ton on carbon emissions. I think some are trading three times \nthat high in Europe. These numbers are all, at best, estimates. We can \ntell you that there is no way this won't have a significant impact.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest to my friend from Missouri that I am sure \nMissouri\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\nis not that different from Oklahoma and it is the major concern people \nhave. That is all, when I go around the State, people are talking about \nnow.\n  Many different economic studies show gasoline prices rising \nsignificantly under this bill. Madam President, $1.50 is just an \nestimated range. One of the Government EPA studies shows gasoline \nprices going up by $1.40. Another independent agency study, the \nindependent Energy Information Administration, predicts it will go up \nby 41 cents a gallon to $1 a gallon by 2030.\n  As gasoline prices continue to rise and set new record highs every \nday, this bill would only keep prices rising. The Energy Information \nAdministration study predicts that gasoline prices will increase \nanywhere from 41 cents per gallon to $1 per gallon by 2030.\n\n  We are waiting for a Senator. How much more time on the opposing side \ndo we have at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 31 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, before the Senator yields the floor, I \nwonder if I may ask him a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That will be fine on the time on the other side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Of course, whatever the case may be. Because our \ncolleagues are listening to these statistics, I think we better with \ngreater specificity explain from where those numbers are coming. The \nSenator made a comment about the possible increase in the cost of gas. \nBut is that not over the life of the bill, which is 20 years?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is not tomorrow or the next day.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am talking about by 2020 and some of the figures used \nare by 2030. An article in The Hill, just the other day--of course, \nthat was before we had our recess--said that the Senate debate after \nMemorial Day could add up to 50 cents to the price of a gallon of \ngasoline, according to the study. They didn't say the timeframe. That \nwas one of the more objective groups.\n  Here is another one that talks about that. Investors Business Daily \nsays the bill essentially limits how much gasoline and other fossil \nfuels Americans use.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I asked the question, but I will finish \nit up. Let's be candid, we are talking about a bill that is 20 years \nahead of us. Look how much gas has risen, 26 increases in the past, I \nthink, 90 days. It has nothing to do with this bill. This bill has all \ntypes of checks and balances that the President can move in and stop \nthese provisions from being invoked if he is concerned.\n  I listened patiently to my colleague from Missouri: This is wrong, \nthat is wrong, this is wrong. All right, folks, who is going to come \nforward in this Chamber and say this is what is right, here is the \nbetter approach? And let us be careful in the representation about \nthese incredible increases and so forth. Give the time period and then \ncontrast that to what has happened in the last 90 days, which has \nnothing to do with this bill--nothing.\n  What has an impact is if this bill eventually becomes law, then it \nwill put in place the mechanism by which to relieve the crisis we are \nfaced with today--these repeated 26 increases in the cost of gasoline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 28 minutes 19 seconds for the \nopposition, and 18 minutes on your side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Klobuchar, a wonderful \nmember of our committee and, by the way, author of the carbon registry \nportion of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank Chairwoman Boxer for her \ngreat leadership of our committee.\n  Today, we begin a discussion of a historic opportunity--an \nopportunity to restore American leadership on something that is so \ncritical for the future of our country and of the world.\n  I just came back, Madam President, from Minnesota, where I spent the \nlast week. People are glad that spring is here, but I was surprised by \nthe number of people who came and talked to me about the climate change \nissue. They knew this debate was coming. It is not just kids with \npenguin buttons anymore. It is hunters in Hibbing who have seen the \nchanges to our wetlands, people who ice fish, and little city councils \nin places such as Lanesboro, MN, that changed out their light bulbs to \nsave money. And it is business people in Duluth who have seen Lake \nSuperior at historic lows over the last 80 years. People in our State \nare seeing the changes, and they are concerned about the changing \nweather patterns and the frequency of changing weather patterns--with \ntornadoes, with floods, and with fires.\n  Local communities all over this country are taking action. My State \nof Minnesota has one of the most aggressive renewable standards in this \ncountry. We don't view this as a partisan issue. We view this as a \nbipartisan issue. Everyone from our Republican Governor to our \nDemocratic legislature to independent city councils all over the State \nwant to see action on climate change from Washington.\n  Just a year or two ago this Senate was debating whether climate \nchange existed, and now, finally, today, with a vote on this motion, we \ncan start debating how to solve it. We had an event today where people \nfrom all over the country talked about the effect it had in their \ncommunities--global warming. Someone from Alaska joined us to describe \nthe way climate change has affected whale populations and fishing \ntraditions that support her community.\n  It actually made me think of my own State of Minnesota where fishing \nis very important. I would love to ask the Presiding Officer if she \nknew how much money we spend on bait and worms alone in Minnesota every \nyear, but, of course, the rules prohibit her from answering. In fact, \nthe answer is, in the State of Minnesota we spend $50 million a year \nalone on worms and bait. It gives you a sense of how important, in the \nland of 10,000 lakes, fishing and outdoor recreation is to the State.\n  A total of $1.8 billion every year is spent on angling alone. That is \nwhy everybody from snowmobilers to hunters, to people who fish, to \neveryday citizens, care about this issue in my State, and why it is so \nimportant to move forward on this legislation.\n  The other piece of interest is that our State is third in the country \nwith wind. We see the potential for jobs. If we set the standards in \nthis country, the investment will follow. Think of what happened when \nwe raised the gas mileage standard years ago: we saved money. Now we \nare doing it again this year.\n  Think about when John F. Kennedy stood and challenged this country to \nput a man on the Moon. We won that space race, but we did more than \nthat. By drawing that line in the sand, by saying this country was \ngoing to move forward, we produced endless amounts of technology just \nfrom that one moment we said we were going to put a man on the Moon.\n  We produced weather satellites, solar technology, digital \nwristwatches, ultrasound machines, laser surgery, infrared medical \nthermometers, programmable pacemakers, satellite TV broadcasts, high-\ndensity batteries, high-speed, long distance telephone service, \nautomated insulin pumps, CAT scans, radiation blocking sunglasses, and \nmy personal favorite, those little chocolate space sticks that my \nfamily used to take on camping trips in the 1970s.\n  That was all because someone in the Nation's Capital said we were \ngoing to move in a new direction; we were not going to let other \ncountries be the first to put a man on the Moon; we were going to be \nfirst.\n  That is what we have the opportunity to do with this legislation. We \nhave the opportunity to start moving and doing something about climate \nchange. Many people around the world are waiting for us to act, to go \nfirst, as we have so many other times. Other countries have done \nthings, but our country, the United States of America, making a \nstatement on this matter, will make a difference for the rest of the \nworld. We need to set our expectations high. We need to set our \nstandards high. And we have to remember, while climate change is a \nchallenge--and I don't believe it is any longer seriously disputed in \nterms of the science on global warming--it is also an opportunity.\n  I look forward to the debate that we will have in the coming days, \nand I thank Chairwoman Boxer again for her leadership.\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico \nwhatever time he consumes.\n  Before I do that, I say to my good friend from New Mexico that I \ncommented earlier on his being a real champion for nuclear energy, and \nthe recognition that we can't resolve the process we have without a \nvery bold nuclear program. And I would say this: We have over 30 \napplications now in the process, of people saying what they want to do. \nSo I look at this, as I characterized it a few minutes ago, as a \nnuclear renaissance that is taking place, largely due to the efforts of \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, has time been yielded to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, whatever time the Senator shall consume.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me comment on your observation. First, I thank you \nfor indicating that I had something to do with the rise of nuclear \npower, which we are all glad to call a nuclear renaissance. I did have \na lot to do with it, and I am very proud of that.\n  I think the Senator knows I will not be here very long because I have \ndecided to retire after 36 years, and that means this January. But I am \nvery confident that even leaving in that short time from now we have \nset the seeds for the nuclear renaissance. It will be in the world, not \njust in America. But it would always have been short of what it could \nbe and should be if America was not part of this renaissance. If \nAmerica wasn't a part, the world somehow would not feel right about \nnuclear. And since we started it, and then we unpropitiously stopped \nproducing it and stopped all the leadership we had, we are starting \nanew. So there is great excitement in the American nuclear community, \nwhich is expanding dramatically.\n  Universities are establishing new nuclear physics courses. I think \nthe Senator from Oklahoma knows that. We have put money in the energy \nand water bill, $10 million to $15 million a year, for universities to \nget started and bring them up where they were, and that is going to be \nvery exciting. But have no doubt, since the United States knows how to \nproduce the very best nuclear powerplants--the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission is of the highest quality--they are not going to approve \nlicenses unless they are absolutely certain of plant designs and that \nlocations are absolutely the best. And that is going to take a little \nwhile.\n  We had, I think 33 or 34 is the number that are in the process of \napplying, with about 7 or 8 firmed up, completed, and all the process \nthey need to submit being done. That is so exciting when you consider \nthat in 20-plus years we had zero, not a single one, until we passed \nthe Energy Policy Act. And the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma was \nnot on the Energy Committee, but he was very helpful at every step as \nwe produced this Energy Policy Act, which included, as everyone agrees, \nall of the ingredients to cause American nuclear power to have a \nrenaissance, and it is doing that.\n  Now, there is no way we are going to effectively clean the \nCO2 we produce in the use of power without nuclear power. It \nis the one big source of power that has no CO2 emissions \nattached to it, so it is good we are moving there. But today we have a \nbill before us that has to be discussed, debated, and amended, as I see \nit, for such a long period of time for the American people and the \nSenators to understand its implications, that today I choose to just \nspeak about one little part--the impact of this bill on oil and gas \nprices.\n\n  This is a bill that purports to put America on a path of producing \nless and less CO2, but it has some real difficult hurdles to \ncross as we move there. In the meantime, there is no question that it \nhas an impact on a lot of things, and we have to consider whether it is \nworth all the ramifications, considering what the bill will or will not \ndo.\n  So, Madam President, let me remind Senators that we are all coming \nback from our home States. I am returning from my home State of New \nMexico, where I visited constituents and listened to their concerns. In \nevery town I visited, at every event I attended, and during every \nmeeting, I took the same issue and put it before the people and \ndiscussed it with them. They asked the same questions over and over: \nHow will Congress deal with the rising gas prices? I expect that most \nevery Senator had similar experiences during his or her recent recess \ntravels.\n  This morning, the price of gasoline was, on average, a record of \n$3.98. Now, I used an average, and I got that from an appropriate \nofficial. In many places it has already passed the $4 mark, but it \naverages $3.98. At the start of this Congress, the average was just \n$2.33, meaning the cost of gasoline has jumped by 70 percent in just 18 \nmonths.\n  Record gas prices are causing tremendous pain for Americans. In one \nrecent survey, 40 percent of workers said the high price forced them to \nchange the way they get to and from work. Many have stopped driving \naltogether. Public transit ridership is at an all-time high. Others \nhave traded their vehicles in for smaller ones. But most importantly, \nmany are feeling the impact on the family budget. They are just feeling \nlike they can't make it because they only have one way to go to work. \nThey have to work, and if there are two workers in the family, when you \nadd the price of gasoline to that, it becomes an expense they can \nhardly bear.\n  The impact is not limited to transportation. It affects nearly every \naspect of American life and ripples throughout our economy. As fuel \ncosts rise, as I indicated, family budgets are stretched. Millions have \ncanceled vacation plans and cut down on shopping trips. For those \nliving paycheck to paycheck, the price at the pump is the difference \nbetween being able to pay their bills on time and going into debt. \nRunaway energy costs also hurt our businesses, as evidenced by recent \nannouncements from Ford Motors and American Airlines.\n  High gas prices even impact the quality of education that our \nchildren receive. A school district in Minnesota has already announced \nthat schools will move to 4 days a week to avoid budget shortfalls. \nSchools in North Carolina are planning fewer field trips for their \nstudents, which are often among the most memorable experiences that our \nchildren can have.\n  As these examples illustrate, the consequences of high energy prices \nare widely felt, far-reaching, and difficult to overcome. We must take \nreal steps to ensure that these are properly addressed and that we are \nnot telling these same types of stories in the future.\n  After hearing our constituents plead for relief from high gas prices, \nit was my hope that Senators would rededicate themselves to reducing \nthe cost of oil and gas. Instead, by bringing up a bill to establish a \ncap-and-trade regime, which we will hear much about in the ensuing \ndays, the majority has chosen to go in the opposite direction from \nreducing gas prices or holding them steady for our constituents.\n  As the summer driving season begins, and oil prices remain at near \nall-time record highs, it is simply incredible that the first measure \ndebated in this session will not be a bill to lower energy prices by \nproducing more of our own energy but a bill that will, in fact, \nsubstantially increase energy costs.\n  By assigning a cost to the carbon content of traditional fuels, there \nis no question this bill will increase the cost of gasoline. According \nto EIA, gas prices could rise by 41 percent in the year 2030. The EPA \nplaces this figure as high as a $1.01 per gallon by the year 2030.\n  Every policy has a price, but as we continue to face record energy \nprices, the costs of this bill are simply unacceptable, no matter which \nversion is up for debate. An economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of \nDallas recently told the New York Times that:\n\n       Every one-cent increase in gasoline means Americans pay \n     $1.42 billion more a year for gas.\n\n  An absolutely incredible number. You wonder why the economy is being \naffected by these enormous price increases of gasoline and diesel fuel. \nAt a time when they can least afford it, this will translate to even \ngreater pain at the pump for consumers. At a time when the strength of \nour economy is already a serious concern, it will lower the bottom line \nof American business and jeopardize their global competitiveness.\n  When recesses end and we make our way back to Washington, it is our \nobligation to do our best to resolve the\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nconcerns of our constituents. Right now we should be working to find a \nway to reduce energy prices. Instead, as we begin to debate a cap-and-\ntrade regime which may not work, it is clear there is a fundamental \ndisconnect between many in this Chamber and the American people who \nsimply cannot afford to pay more for energy. As the Boxer bill proves, \nthere is much Congress can do to raise these prices and we are setting \nabout to do that.\n  I commend my colleagues for trying to tackle the task of reducing \ncarbon emissions to address global climate change. However, the \nAmerican people are facing higher costs and tough economic concerns. \nThey are worried about their family budgets and about their jobs. This \nbill will make these worries greater and increase those costs even \nmore.\n  I will be speaking at great length as we consider this bill in the \ncoming days and I will speak of many other issues besides the one \ntoday, for there are many more. I speak of only one today which I think \nwe should start with, and know what we are dealing with in terms of the \nside effects of legislation that is controversial. It is not only \ncontroversial but many are quite certain it will not do the job.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am anxious to see action on this issue, \nbut I keep asking myself, are we doing the right thing for the wrong \nreasons, or the wrong thing for the right reasons? Either way, I cannot \nsupport proceeding at this time. The Senate is not yet ready to \nconsider this vastly important and highly complex legislation. It's \nramifications are too unknown.\n  In December 2007, after several hearings and with written comments, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee reported S. 2191, America's \nClimate Security Act. It includes a hefty 334 pages of legislative \ntext. Since then, a new bill has been drafted and placed on the Senate \nLegislative Calendar--S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security \nAct--which is what the Senate will consider if the motion to proceed is \nadopted. And yet another bill--a third bill--is expected to be offered \nas a substitute amendment by the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. That bill includes 491 pages of legislative text. That \nis three bills, in 6 months, totaling 1,167 pages of legislative text. \nThis new bill was circulated only days ago before the Memorial Day \nrecess, and with an additional 157 pages that was not considered by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--no hearings, no economic \nanalysis.\n  In early April, after months of examination, the Congressional Budget \nOffice produced a cost estimate on S. 2191, outlining the $1 trillion \nimpact of that measure on the Federal budget, and the $90 billion \nannual impact on the private sector. Incidentally, this legislation \nwould put hundreds of billions of dollars on automatic pilot, allocated \nby unelected, unaccountable boards, with little congressional \noversight. However, no complete estimates exist for the substitute \namendment that the Senate might consider. In addition, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Energy Information \nAdministration at the Department of Energy have produced their economic \nanalysis of S. 2191, outlining the impact of that legislation on \ndifferent sectors of the economy. But, again, no complete estimates \nexist for the substitute amendment that the Senate might consider if it \nproceeds to the underlying bill.\n  Industry and environmental experts differ widely on how these bills \nwill impact the American economy and energy prices. Without better \nindependent analysis of the facts, there is little to prevent Senators \nfrom simply talking past one another. This being a presidential \nelection year, the atmosphere is already highly charged. There is \nalready too much political posturing on this complex, albeit popular, \nissue. This Chamber, the world's greatest deliberative body, must \ninvestigate further in order to render an informed decision. There are \nall kinds of parliamentary tactics that can be used on both sides of \nthe aisle to limit debate and amendments on this bill, or to force \nvotes on dangerous measures. The process can get out of hand very \nquickly and very easily.\n  I am haunted by another election year debate, when the Congress was \nrushed to judgement in voting for war in Iraq. And last year, it \nobviously did not adequately consider the consequences of a fuels \nmandate, which has contributed to international crisis and famine. In \nboth cases, the result has been far different and far worse than what \nwas thought and said at the time.\n  We must not be rushed to judgement on this vital issue. If not \nproperly drafted, climate change legislation could bring unilateral \ndevastation to critical sectors of the U.S. economy. It could cause \nmassive increases in energy prices for American consumers. If not \nproperly drafted, such legislation could well result in more harm than \ngood.\n  The language of this measure is obviously still evolving, and the \nAmerican people must know what is being asked of them before the Senate \ncommits to mandatory emission caps. Otherwise, we cannot expect them to \nlong endure the consequences that will surely follow. Without long-term \npublic support, any effort to address this issue will eventually, and \nquite certainly, unravel.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, while I am willing to proceed to the \nclimate security bill so that the Senate can debate and amend it, I am \nopposed to this bill in its present form. I am hopeful that the Senate \nwill amend this bill and significantly improve it as we move forward.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me ask how much time is remaining on \nthe opposing side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Just less than 16 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think it is the wish of the majority \nto have us use our time so Senator Boxer will have the remaining time, \nwhich is fine. I invite any Members who are around--I know several will \nwant to speak tomorrow, but we do have time right now if they want to \ncome down.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, this is not a discussion about \nscience. That is something for another day. We have been talking about \nthat now, the lack of science, for a number of years. I have to go back \nto then-Vice President Gore, who had a study done by a very prominent \nscientist--his name was Tom Wiggly. In this study, back when he was \nVice President, he said: If we were to have all of the developed \nnations--not developing, not China, not Mexico, not India, but the \ndeveloped nations--to sign on to, to ratify the Kyoto treaty and live \nby its emission requirements--of course they wouldn't do that anyway \nbecause the emission requirements are not complied with in some 15 \nWestern European countries; only 2 are living within their emission \nrequirements, but he said assuming all developed nations did sign on to \nKyoto and live with the requirements, how much would it reduce the \ntemperature in 50 years?\n  Do you know what his answer was after he did this massive study? Tom \nWiggly, the scientist for Al Gore, said it would reduce the temperature \nby 7/100th of 1 degree Celsius. This is after all the economic pain.\n  I think what I might do is use a little of the time, if no other \nMembers come down, to talk about how other people are looking at this. \nThe Las Vegas Review Journal--I am hoping the leader of the Senate \nwould be reading the Las Vegas Review Journal--said:\n\n       Consumers are already struggling with gasoline approaching \n     $5 a gallon and other utility costs that have been moving \n     steadily higher for the past few years. New mandates placed \n     on producers in the name of ``global warming'' will only make \n     matters worse.\n\n  That was an editorial in the Las Vegas Review Journal a few days ago.\n  From the State of Ohio, The Plain Dealer--I know we are going to have \nSenator Voinovich taking a very active part in this debate. He is \nanother one of the leaders bringing us into a renaissance for nuclear \nenergy in America, which is desperately needed. I have to say, as we \napproach hopefully the solution--not having anything to do with this \nbill, but the energy crisis in America--I agree we need all sources. \nOklahoma is very busy right now and very effective in their research on \nbiomass--cellulosic biomass. Both the University of Oklahoma and \nOklahoma State University, the Noble Foundation, are very active. We \nwant that. It is not here now. That is better, to me, than the ethanol \nmandates that merely use up the market for corn to the extent that my \nlivestock people in Oklahoma are paying a lot more now for feedstock\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nthan they did. You won't have to do it with feedstock in the future \nbecause you will be able to do it with biomass and other forms. When it \ngets down to what the solution is to the energy crisis, we do need to \nhave all these in the future: Wind, solar, and all that, when the \ntechnology is here. But right now we are 53 percent dependent on coal \nfor our ability to run this machine called America.\n  As the Senator from Virginia stated, we will have to have coal as \nwell as nuclear energy. Clean coal technology is out there. We have to \nkeep that going. A lot of people fear this bill is going to put an end \nto coal.\n  The one ingredient we have to have, of course, is natural gas. That \nperforms well. A lot comes from my State of Oklahoma. But one thing \nthat will be necessary to pursue in the future is nuclear energy. Right \nnow some countries such as France are 80 percent dependent upon nuclear \nenergy. We are down around 20 percent. That is an area where we can do \nsomething.\n  Up in Ohio, The Plain Dealer newspaper, in their editorial, said:\n\n       The bill, as conceived, will just bore new holes into an \n     already battered economy.\n\n  In Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review:\n\n       If there indeed is a second Great Depression to come, this \n     will be the government measure that guarantees it arrives \n     with a devastating gut punch.\n\n  That was an editorial called ``The Climate Security Act? Reject The \nIgnorami'' in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.\n  San Francisco Chronicle--this is kind of interesting--from the State \nof California:\n\n       The Senate debate on the climate bill probably will focus \n     on its impact on energy prices and the economy, which in the \n     short run could be considered significant.\n\n  The Associated Press recently said:\n\n       With gasoline at $4 a gallon and home heating and cooling \n     costs soaring, it is getting harder to sell a bill that would \n     transform the country's energy industries and--as critics \n     will argue--cause energy prices to rise even more.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal--there are a couple of them. I quoted already \nfrom the Wall Street Journal. This one was a few days ago.\n\n       This is easily the largest income redistribution scheme \n     since the income tax.\n\n  I think it is interesting when people realize what we are talking \nabout here is redistributing the wealth from the people who are the \npoorest, very poorest people. A CBO report found recently, quoting from \nthat report:\n\n       Most of the cost of meeting a cap on CO2 \n     emissions would be borne by consumers who would face \n     persistently higher prices for products such as electricity \n     and gasoline. Those price increases would be regressive in \n     that poorer households would bear a larger burden relative to \n     their income than wealthier households.\n\n  We are going to hear from the chairman of the committee stating, I am \nsure, in the future: We are taking care of that because we are \nredistributing some of the $6.7 trillion, redistributing $800 billion \nof that to some of the poorer families.\n  Wait a minute, that is $1 out of $8. That is not a very good deal.\n  I think there are so many reports that talk about how devastating \nthis is going to be to all of America but particularly those \nindividuals, the elderly and poor people, because these are the ones \nwho are spending a large portion of their spendable income on energy. \nIt is very appropriate I think to say this is easily the largest income \nredistribution scheme since the income tax.\n\n  The New York Post:\n\n       The only thing that will cool is the United States economy.\n\n  Talking about this bill.\n\n       In effect, the bill would impose an average of more than \n     $80 billion in new energy taxes every year.\n\n  That is the New York Post, entitled ``Cap-&-Trade: Why It's Tax & \nSpend,'' of June 2.\n  Robert Samuelson:\n\n       . . . let's call it by its proper name: cap and tax.\n\n  George Will:\n\n       Speaking of endless troubles, ``cap-and-trade'' comes \n     cloaked in reassuring rhetoric about the government merely \n     creating a market, but the government would actually create a \n     scarcity so government could sell what it had made scarce.\n\n  This is a rather interesting thing. I recommend this. It was \npublished in the Washington Post under ``Carbon's Power Brokers.''\n  Charles Krauthammer had several good editorials. He said:\n\n       There is no greater social power than the power to ration. \n     And other than rationing food, there is no greater instrument \n     of social control than rationing energy, the currency of just \n     about everything one does and uses in an advanced society.\n\n  That was Charles Krauthammer, ``Carbon Chastity,'' an editorial in \nthe Washington Post on May 30.\n  There was a very good one, another from the Wall Street Journal that \nI have already quoted here. This is a different one than I quoted a \nminute ago. The Boxer climate tax bill:\n\n       . . . would impose the most extensive government \n     reorganization of the American economy since the 1930s.\n\n  Investors Business Daily--this is something in an op-ed piece, an \neditorial piece they had on May 29:\n\n       The bill essentially limits the amount of gasoline and \n     other fossil fuels Americans can use, as Klaus puts it--\n\nreferring to the President of the Czech Republic--\n\n     in the name of the planet. A study by Charles River \n     Associates puts the cost (in terms of reduced household \n     spending per year) of Senate bill 2191--\n\nwhich is the Senate bill passed out of the committee\n\n     --at $800 to $1,300 per household by 2015, rising to $1500 to \n     $2,500 by 2050. Electricity prices could jump by 36 percent \n     to 65 percent by 2015 and 80 percent to 125 percent by 2050.\n\n  This was an editorial in Investors Business Daily.\n  It is interesting, I was noticing when Senator Bond from Missouri was \nmaking his very well-stated remarks, the study he had showed it would \nbe closer to $6,000 a household. I do know in my State of Oklahoma and \nin the State of Texas, of all the States that will have the highest \nincrease in taxes, it will amount to a minimum of $3,300 per family.\n  As I go around my State of Oklahoma--and I am back there every \nweekend; I am never here in Washington on weekends--I talk to people. \nThey stop and think about what they do with $3,300 a year--it is not \njust a lot of them want to have another pickup truck or a bass boat or \nother things, but most of them are having real problems right now \nmeeting expenses. This will be something they wouldn't want to have to \ntry to endure.\n  We have had quite a few of the editorial writers around the country \ntalking about it. Several have talked about the raising of gas prices \nand the effect that would have. I think we are all aware of that. I \nthink probably the biggest issue should be the job-killer issue. The \nIndependent Energy Information Administration says the bill would \nresult in a 9.5-percent drop in manufacturing output, and even higher \nenergy costs. The fact that it would grow Government--stop and think \nabout it. This is interesting. The figure the other side uses, the \npromoters of the bill, is $6.7 trillion.\n  Then they say some of this is going to be going back into the \neconomy. It comes down to about $4.2 trillion--$4.2 trillion, and one \nof the basic disagreements Senator Boxer had with the Senator from New \nHampshire was that he wanted to return that to the taxpayers as opposed \nto having Government programs. It appears there will be, hopefully, not \na majority--in fact I don't think there will be a majority of people in \nthis body who are going to put themselves in a position where they say \nwe want to have a $4.2 trillion increase in the bureaucracy.\n  If there is anything that does not need to be increased, it is the \nbureaucracy in America. It frightened me to think about what types of \ngovernmental agencies there are, what, 45 new entities and agencies \nthat would be provided by this bill? Tomorrow we are going to parade \nbefore you some charts to show the various increases in the size of the \nbureaucracy. It is going to be something that will be frightening to \nmost people.\n  However, there is a mentality of many people in the Senate--I respect \nevery Member of the Senate--that somehow you must increase the size and \nthe magnitude and the authority and the power of Government to make \nthings happen. That is not the way our forefathers thought it would be.\n  I would suggest to you that we want to look at this increase in \nGovernment, $4.2 trillion over this period of time, as something that \nwould be devastating to this country and its economy.\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\n  I see that my time has expired, and the remainder of the time will be \nused by my chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the \njunior Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. Today we are going to vote on \nwhether we want to continue the status quo when it comes to energy \npolicy and when it comes to ignoring the great threat to our planet \nthat scientists tell us is very serious.\n  Now, we can vote no, we can weaken this bill. It seems to me that is \nevery Senator's right. But, frankly, this Senator and I know my \ncolleagues who have worked so hard on this bill, Senators Lieberman and \nWarner, feel deep in our heart that this is a moment for us to come \nacross party lines as we go back and remember we have tripartisan \nlegislation, a Democrat, an Independent, and a Republican.\n  Again, we did not agree with each other on every detail. Lord knows \nwe did not. But for the good of this country, for the good of the \nworld, for the good of future generations, we came together.\n  I ask the Chair to let me know when there is 4 minutes remaining so \nit can be equally divided by these wonderful cosponsors. Would the \nChair let me know when 4 minutes remains.\n  Let me take this little time I have to say I do not mind debating on \nthe facts of our bill. But I have heard so much fiction that I had to \ngo over to both Senators Warner and Lieberman and say: Did I hear them \nright? First of all, they are using numbers that are coming out of the \nair by groups that oppose our bill, that have no validity, that are not \nbased on any modeling.\n  We have numbers based on modeling. Then I hear now the new thing. My \ndear friend Senator Inhofe--we are dear friends--says the Boxer tax \nbill. There is no tax in this bill. This bill is modeled on the acid \nrain bill, I say to my friend.\n  Polluters pay. This bill has one of the largest tax cuts in it that \nwe have seen around this place in a very long time. It has a big piece \nof consumer relief. So I say to my friends, do not get up here and say: \nBoxer tax bill. Point to where there is a tax in this bill. There is no \ntax. I will point to where there is a tax cut and a set-aside, a huge \none, almost $1 trillion, and a huge pot of almost $1 trillion in \nconsumer relief which will be given, if necessary, to consumers if the \ncost of the electricity goes up.\n  So here we have a bill that takes care of our consumers, takes care \nof our taxpayers. Then we hear from Senator Domenici and Senator Bond: \nOh, we cannot do this bill because oil prices, gas prices at the pump \nare going to go up.\n  They put out a number that they pull out of the air. The modeling \nshows, worst-case scenario, worst case, gas prices would go up 2 cents \na gallon per year until 2030. By the way, the modeling that Senator \nLieberman has shows that the automobile fuel economy bill we passed \nwill negate all that.\n  So this bill will bring no higher cost at the pump to our drivers. \nBut let's look at what has happened under the last 7 years. Here is the \nstatus quo, folks. We have all lived it; now let's look at it. Gasoline \nprices have gone up 250 percent in the last 7 years. The source: U.S. \nEnergy Information Administration. That is this administration's own \nenergy department.\n  So without a global warming bill or a climate change bill, call it \nwhat you will, we have seen a 250-percent increase in the price of gas. \nWhat we do in our bill will get us off foreign oil, will get us off big \noil, will lead to new technologies which will free us, will free us \nfrom these prices.\n  So those people who say: Do not vote for this bill because it is \ngoing to raise gas prices, only in a humpty-dumpty world, where you are \nover on your head could you come out with that. It makes no sense.\n  Let me show you the job growth that people are telling us we can \nexpect from the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill. First of all, look at \nGreat Britain. They have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 \npercent. They have grown their economy by 40 percent, and they have \n500,000 jobs in the last 5 years in these new green technologies.\n  A report by the Apollo Alliance--that is a beautiful organization \nhere in America--says this bill could create over 3 million new \nAmerican jobs over a 10-year period, stimulating $1.4 trillion in new \ngross domestic product and producing over $280 billion in net energy \nsavings.\n  We are going to get off foreign oil. I do not want to see a President \nhave to run over to Saudi Arabia and hold hands with the Prince \nanymore. I am tired of that. It has to be the end of the status quo. \nThis is an opportunity to do it.\n  Let's take a look. Job growth will follow strong legislation. In \nCalifornia--I mentioned this before--450 solar companies are now \nputting electricians and carpenters and plumbers to work where the \nconstruction industry is laying them off because of the housing crisis \nwe are facing.\n  The top manufacturing States for solar are Ohio, Michigan, \nCalifornia, Tennessee, and Massachusetts. That comes from Solar Energy \nIndustries. So we already are seeing it. Here is the labor support for \nthe Climate Security Act. The Sheet Metal Workers, the Journeymen and \nApprentices of Plumbing and Pipefitting, the United Union of Roofers, \nthe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, the International Association of Heat and \nFrost Insulators. And it goes on. The Building and Construction Trades \nDepartment of the AFL-CIO, the International Union of Operating \nEngineers, the brick layers, the elevator constructors. Why are they \nsupporting this bill? These are the workers that my colleagues on the \nother side are scaring.\n  They are smart, they read the bill. They understand the many billions \nof dollars that are going to go into new technologies. And these \ntechnologies will heat our homes and they will cool our homes and they \nwill run our cars and they will run our businesses.\n  The green jobs that will come are going to be jobs that can only be \nfilled in America. Time is of the essence. Time is of the essence. Sir \nNicholas Stern, former chief economist of the World Bank, found that by \nspending $1 now to address global warming we will save $5.\n  We know we cannot afford to wait. The time is now. People say: Why \nare you doing it before a Presidential election? Why this? Why that? \nThis is above politics. This is above partisanship. If somebody told \nyou, if somebody told you that if you brought your child to the \nsupermarket on a very warm day and say it was your grandchild, because \nI know you are a proud grandma, and you said: Well, I have to run in \nthere just for a minute, can I leave my child alone? Well, obviously \nyou would never do it. The fact is, we would not lock our child in our \nhot car in front of a supermarket.\n\n  We cannot consign the next generation to a hot planet that is going \nto be inhospitable to our grandkids. We cannot do it. It is wrong. That \nis why we find Tony Blair saying: America must lead. He says the \nlegislation sponsored by myself, Joe, and John matters. It shows \nAmerica will act. It will allow the United States to say to others: You \nmust act. We are not going to sit around and wait for India and China. \nSince when do we do that? This is America.\n  I wish to go to the faith community. I think people ought to \nunderstand who is backing our bill. I see the Senator from North \nDakota, who has been weighing this very strongly. The Evangelical \nEnvironmental Network and the Evangelical Climate Initiative, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, the National Council of Churches, the \nReligious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the Jewish Council for \nPublic Affairs, the Interfaith Power and Light Campaign.\n  Let me close by saying why. All you have to do is read, read from the \nScriptures, read from some of the great writings:\n\n       See my handiwork, how beautiful and choice they are. Be \n     careful not to ruin and destroy my world, for if you do ruin \n     it, there is no one to repair it after you.\n\n  This is, it seems to me, the moral reason we must act. I thank you \nvery much. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut and the \nremainder of the time to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, the first thing I would say, in \nresponse to Senator Boxer's eloquent faith-based conclusion, is: Amen, \nSister.\n  Secondly, in this last 2 or 3 hours that we have begun this very \nimportant debate you can see the different\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\narguments forming. There are serious arguments. They are important \narguments. So I appeal to our colleagues on both sides of this issue, \nregardless of whether you have decided to support the bill, vote for \ncloture on the motion to proceed so we can finally have the kind of \ndebate from which we will all learn and from which the American people \nwill take some encouragement that we are dealing with this problem.\n  It is obvious that one of the main arguments, perhaps the main one, \nwill be its cost. This is an important issue which we want to discuss. \nThe part that I respectfully take issue with is those who call this a \ntax increase. It is not a tax increase.\n  Senator Warner and I had some choices to make. One was to do nothing. \nWe rejected that. I suppose if you still feel we should do nothing, \nthat, of course, you will want to come out and argue for that.\n  But we decided we had to do something. We had three choices. One was \na carbon tax. We rejected that. One, because we do not think it is \nviable here. Two, it does not guarantee that you are going to reduce \ncarbon emissions.\n  Second, we had an old-fashioned command-and-control option; mandate \nthat this happens, control everything. We rejected that as well because \nit is inflexible.\n  The third choice was a market-based choice. Set the general ground \nrules, mandate a reduction in the cap, and leave it to the market. The \nfees that are raised under this bill are voluntarily accepted by people \nwho decide they need to buy allowances. This is not a tax increase. We \nrejected a tax increase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am pleased to be here today for the \nopening debate on global climate change and the Lieberman-Warner \nClimate Security Act.\n  The issue of global climate change is a pressing one that has \nramifications far beyond our imagination. It is my firm belief that we \nneed to temporarily put aside what we do not know about climate change \nand its potential impacts and to focus instead on what we do know in \norder to begin to address this critical problem.\n  We know that the science is clear. Some might respectfully disagree, \nbut they are in the minority. In fact, the science is so clear and the \nobservations on the ground are so convincing that more than half of the \nStates of this great Nation and more than 800 cities have taken the \nbull by the horns and have enacted or are working to enact legislation \nto reduce carbon emissions.\n  I am the strongest supporter of states rights and I commend these \nStates for their vision and their leadership absent Federal action. But \nwe cannot have a patchwork approach to addressing climate change. \nFederal leadership is now warranted in this case.\n  We know that allowing global climate change to go unchecked will \nresult in increased threats to global security. In April 2007 the \nCenter for Naval Analysis Corporation issued a report, ``National \nSecurity and the Threat of Climate Change,'' which detailed the \nnumerous threats posed by climate change.\n  The report found that global climate change does pose a significant \nthreat to America's national security. The extreme weather and \necological conditions associated with climate change have the potential \nto ``disrupt our way of life and to force changes in the way we keep \nourselves safe and secure.''\n  Some of the destabilizing impacts described in the report include: \nreduced access to fresh water, impaired food production, human health \nemergencies, and displacement of people. These are hardships that the \nglobe will have to face.\n  These serious implications of climate change will have security \nconsequences for the United States. For example, there will be an \nincreased potential for failed nations and growth of global terrorism.\n  Another serious implication of climate change is the mass migrations \nof people that are likely to occur. Lack of water and food will force \nthe movement of people. In the United States, the rate of immigration \nfrom Mexico is likely to rise because the water situation in Mexico is \nalready marginal and could worsen with less rainfall and more droughts.\n  In addition to these indirect risks to national security, there are \nalso direct impacts on U.S. military systems, infrastructure and \noperations. Climate change will add stress to our weapons system, \nthreaten U.S. bases throughout the world, and have a direct effect on \nmilitary readiness. As stated in the CNA report:\n\n       As military leaders, we know we cannot wait for certainty. \n     Failing to act because a warning isn't precise is \n     unacceptable.\n\n  We know that the fate of the copious coal resources within our \nborders hinges on Congress providing regulatory certainty. Have you \nseen the record of late? Permit after permit for coal-fired powerplant \nis being declined. In fact, 54 percent of coal capacity ordered since \n2000 has been canceled or put on hold in the last 2 years, in part due \nto uncertainty about climate legislation. The way to ensuring coal \nremains a viable resource for the future and allowing coal to continue \nto provide more than half the power in the U.S. is to give regulatory \ncertainty so that investors will once again finance the building of \ncoal-fired powerplants.\n  With that said, I know that the coal industry doesn't support this \nbill. But we have done our best to provide more than the financial \nsupport the industry says is necessary to fund the technologies such as \ncarbon capture and storage that are going to allow coal to remain \nviable. But inaction is not an option for our Nation, and it is not the \nbest path forward for coal.\n  The concept of mandatory, by law, cap-and-trade is proven to work. \nCap-and-trade harnesses the best of free market power and brings in \nindustry, as partners, in solving the energy and emissions challenges \nin the future. With all due respect to those who support the carbon tax \napproach, I believe while the administration of such a new tax may be \nsimpler, there is no guarantee you get the environmental benefit that \nconsumers are paying for.\n  The very suggestion that there will be some huge increase in gas \nprices due to capping pollution is false. It is a scare tactic. Absent \nany program, gas prices have gone up about $1.10 this year alone. What \nthe increases show is that the status quo of laws are not working.\n  The United States will be hostage to the price of oil until we reduce \nour demand--and a cap on carbon is the most effective step we can take \ntoward that goal. This bill provides a very large incentive for the \nprivate sector to receive the investment so they can create improved \nand new alternative sources of energy. It funds advanced vehicle \ntechnology, efficient hybrid fleets, advanced biofuels and mass transit \nthat will transform the transportation sector and reduce our dependence \non oil.\n  Modeling suggests that the Act would reduce imports by 8 million \nbarrels per day by 2025, more than the entire amount currently imported \nfrom OPEC. Overall, it reduces oil imports by up to 58 percent.\n  We also know that the cost of inaction is much more likely to hurt \nAmerican families and the American way of life more than the potential \ncosts of action.\n  Not addressing climate change is not going to keep energy bills low. \nIncreased demand for energy will drive prices up, without the \nincentives for expanding the use of alternative energy sources or \nproviding a safety net for consumers, as my bill would do.\n  I relish this opportunity to debate climate change legislation in the \nSenate. It is my hope that we will have robust debate. I want my \ncolleagues, both those who agree with my bill and those who don't, to \nhave ample opportunity to offer amendments. If we are going to be \nserious, serious consideration must be given to all members who want to \nhave their say in this landmark debate.\n  In closing, I look forward to the time ahead spent on this bill, and \nI am available to address any questions, concerns, or issues my \ncolleagues wish to raise with me.\n  Madam President, once again, I think as we debated this afternoon, \nthe bill has been passed out, put on each desk. I hope that represents \nthe majority of our colleagues will agree to letting this bill go \nforward, because it is not just the bill, it shows the American people \nwe are doing their business.\n  We are trying, through a debate, well-intentioned individuals on both \nsides, to solve one of the most difficult problems ever facing America, \nour energy shortages, our increased prices of\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\nenergy, carbon emissions, how it has affected our environment, all \nthose things.\n  Here it is. This is our joint effort, together with the chairman and \nmembers of the committee. If there is a better idea, bring it forward. \nThis is the function which our Founding Fathers established this \ninstitution for. Bring forth our ideas and let us produce something and \nshow the American people we can solve their problems.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from 20 \ndifferent prominent, well-known industrial firms, confirming that this \nbill is necessary, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned companies and organizations \n     urge you to vote in favor of the Climate Security Act, S. \n     3036 (formerly S. 2191), which is expected to be considered \n     by the full Senate beginning June 2. This is a very important \n     vote on a bipartisan plan to address climate change. Prompt \n     action on climate change is essential to protect America's \n     economy, security, quality of life and natural environment.\n       The Climate Security Act, as revised in the manager's \n     substitute amendment released last week, sets forth a sound \n     overall framework for reducing America's emissions of \n     greenhouse gases. Most notably, it establishes an emissions \n     cap that steadily reduces greenhouse gas emissions from \n     current levels at a rate of about 1.8% annually. The bill \n     creates a flexible cap-and-trade system to achieve these \n     reductions at lower cost by tapping the power of free \n     markets. It includes an unprecedented national investment in \n     zero- and low-carbon technologies, and includes important \n     policies to advance energy efficiency and alternative energy \n     sources. The bill provides assistance to small energy \n     consumers, including low-income families, to ease the \n     transition to a low-carbon economy. And the bill protects \n     American industry to ease the transition to a cleaner future.\n       We all support the framework and approach contained in the \n     Climate Security Act. However, we also recognize that there \n     is continued work to be done to refine the details of the \n     legislation through the amendment process in the Senate and \n     as a bill is taken up in the House. Some of the undersigned \n     groups have already communicated with you on amendments and \n     will continue to do so and others may do so later.\n       However, we think it is notable and a testament to the work \n     of the bill's sponsors and contributors that such a diverse \n     group of interests are united on the following essential \n     issue:\n       A ``yes'' vote for the Climate Security Act represents \n     historic leadership to advance bipartisan solutions to \n     climate change; a ``no'' vote will slow progress and maintain \n     the status quo, which only increases the risks of unavoidable \n     consequences and potentially greater economic costs that \n     could result from the need for even steeper reductions in the \n     future.\n           Sincerely,\n       Lee Califf, Director, Government Affairs, Alcoa.\n       Yvonne A. McIntyre, Vice President, Federal Legislative \n     Affairs, Calpine Corporation.\n       Elizabeth Thompson, Legislative Director, Environmental \n     Defense Action Fund.\n       Betsy Moler, Executive Vice President, Government and \n     Environmental Affairs and Public Policy, Exelon Corporation.\n       Chris Bennett, Executive Vice President, FPL Group.\n       Ann R.

Hite, General President, United Association of \n     Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting \n     Industry of the United States and Canada.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have 1 minute 50 seconds remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have to do this pretty fast. Let me respond to some of \nthe things the majority stated.\n  First of all, when they make the statement that this, talking about \nthe price of gas, all this happened during the Republican \nadministration, let me assure you this happened because of the \nDemocrats in the Senate voting against any increase in supply.\n  Now, if anyone has any doubt about that, go to our Web site www.epw--\nthat stands for Environment and Public Works--epw.senate.gov/minority. \nLook that up. You will see that I have documented the votes all the way \nback to the middle 1990s, when we have tried to increase our supply of \nenergy or our refining capacity.\n  Secondly, the statements that this is not a tax bill, I would only \nread to you the total revenue generated through carbon sales auctions \nfor consumers of power, heating, cooling, and gasoline: $6.7 trillion. \nThat is their figure, not my figure.\n  The maximum potentially rebated to consumers would be $2.5 trillion. \nThat leaves $4.2 trillion. If that is not a $4.2 trillion tax increase, \nI don't know what it is.\n  Thirdly, the fact that all labor seems to be for this. I suggest that \nSenators talk to the United Mine Workers, who are very much opposed to \nit, the United Auto Workers, who are opposed to it. As far as the \nvarious communities on the chart shown by the junior Senator from \nCalifornia, there are many of evangelical associations. We had a press \nconference. They all showed up. They are all very much opposed to this, \nand all these are Scripturally based.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 742, S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner \n     Climate Security Act of 2008.\n         Barbara Boxer, Richard Durbin, Byron L. Dorgan, Charles \n           E. Schumer, Sheldon Whitehouse, Bill Nelson, Amy \n           Klobuchar, Dianne Feinstein, Joseph Lieberman, Daniel \n           K. Akaka, Christopher J. Dodd, Tom Harkin, Daniel K. \n           Inouye, Max Baucus, Ron Wyden, Robert P. Casey, Jr., \n           Harry Reid.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3036, a bill to direct the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease \nemissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes, shall be brought \nto a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), \nthe Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nClinton), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nthe Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), and the Senator from \nMississippi (Mr. Wicker).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 74, nays 14, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 141 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--74\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                                NAYS--14\n\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Coburn\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     McConnell\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n\n                             NOT VOTING--12\n\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Burr\n     Clinton\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     McCain\n     Murkowski\n     Obama\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 74, the nays are \n14. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do not see the ranking member on the \nfloor, but I do see Senator McConnell here. So if I could get Senator \nMcConnell's attention for a brief moment.\n  I understand from my colleagues on the other side that they do not \nintend to filibuster. So I would inquire, based on the vote we have \njust had, can we now agree that following morning business tomorrow we \ncan begin consideration of the legislation?\n  I ask unanimous consent that following morning business on Tuesday, \nJune 3, all postcloture time be yielded back, the motion to proceed be \nagreed to, and the Senate then proceed to the consideration of S. 3036.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Republican side certainly intends to use \nthe full debate time and, therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wonder if I modified my request to \nprovide that following the official Senate photograph on Tuesday, all \npostcloture time be yielded back, the motion to proceed be agreed to, \nand the Senate proceed to S. 3036.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say, I am a little disappointed. \nFirst, I thank my colleagues from the bottom of my heart, and I know \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Warner are very gratified by this vote. \nWe are going to move forward. We are challenging the status quo. We \nwant to get us off foreign oil. We want to begin to move toward energy \nindependence and a clean and healthy environment and green jobs and all \nthe rest. So this is a great start.\n  But I am a little disappointed we cannot move to begin the real \ndebate which comes, obviously, after cloture on the motion to proceed. \nI am sorry that is the case. But I say to my colleagues here, on both \nsides, we look forward to a very important debate on this legislation. \nThis is a matter that is bigger than any one of us here. I think the \nfact that you have a Democrat, an Independent, and a Republican \nbringing you this legislation speaks to this issue. I think this is an \nissue that has to leap over those differences.\n  I hope we can all show up tomorrow. Since we are going to have this \ntime--I am disappointed we cannot get to the amendment process, but we \nwill take advantage of the time. I know Senator Kerry will be here in \nthe morning. He is a national leader on this issue, and I intend to \nyield as much time as he would want. I hope Senator Feinstein will come \ntomorrow. Looking around, Senator Cantwell, Senator Klobuchar, and \nSenator Lincoln have all played such a major role in the part that \ndealt with making sure our consumers who are in need get help. Senator \nCollins just went on the bill. We have a great number of people here \nwhose voices need to be heard, so I look forward to that debate \ntomorrow.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we, too, look forward to the debate. I won't \nlist all of the Members on our side who have asked to be recognized to \nspeak on this bill, but obviously both sides have a lot of Members who \nwish to speak to the bill before we even get to the amendment process. \nThat is the reason we want to utilize the full time that is available \nunder the rules for that purpose, not intending to filibuster the bill. \nBut I think it is also going to be important that we do proceed to \namendments when that 30 hours is used. You will find the Republicans \nmost anxious to go to amendments which can be offered and then debated \nand considered. So we will hold the other side to the proposition of \ngetting votes on lots of amendments on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I can't let that go by. I mean, we are \nready to start the amendment process now. We are ready to start work on \nthis bill now. There is no reason to wait 30 hours. I think colleagues \nin the course of offering amendments can speak for as much time as they \nwant. It is disappointing to hear that we do have to delay. We are \nready, willing, and able to get to the amendment process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I just make one other comment in \nresponse to the Senator from California?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. This is one of the most dramatic--or would be, if passed--\none of the most dramatic changes in law, as one publication pointed \nout, since the 1930s in terms of increasing the scope of Government. \nSurely we can spend 30 hours debating this important legislation. It is \nmassive in its intent, in its goals, in its scope, and in its effect on \nthe American people. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it \nwould result in a tax increase on the American people of over $900 \nbillion and a gas tax increase of 53 cents per gallon. Surely, the \nSenate, the greatest deliberative body in the world, can take 30 hours \nto debate something of this magnitude before we begin the amending \nprocess. I thank my colleagues for appreciating that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would politely point out to the Senator \nfrom Arizona--and I think he knows this full well--that the first \namendment that comes up is subject to endless debate. There is no \nlimit. The notion that we have to have 30 hours before we can get to a \ndebate on an amendment--each amendment is subject to endless debate; \nthe bill itself is subject to endless debate. So the concept of coming \nout here and saying: Oh, we have to have 30 hours--this bill will be \ndebated, every amendment will be debated. But it would serve the \nSenate's purpose to actually get to an amendment now and then we could \nspend 30, 40, 48 hours, a week--we all know this is going to take a \nwhile--legislating an important bill does take a while here. But this \nnotion that we have to spend 30 hours without any amendment just to \ntalk about the bill when the bill will be exhaustively talked about in \nthe context of any amendment is, frankly, specious.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would just add to this debate about \nthe 30 hours that it is going to be a reality, and I would say this: \nSenator Boxer, Senator Warner, and I are going to be on the floor. This \nis an important matter. I think most important to the reality we now \nface of the 30 hours of debate is that our colleagues, no matter what \ntheir position on this legislation, should come to the floor, let's \ndebate\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\nit, and then let's go to the amendments. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I was in my home State last week, and I \ncan tell my colleagues that the American people have a very low \nknowledge of this bill, certainly the vocabulary in it. I think 30 \nhours that we will spend on this floor talking about a bill that is so \nimportant--so important to the environment, so important to energy \nsecurity, at a time when gasoline prices are where they are, combined \nwith the fact that people care deeply about the environment--is most \nappropriate, and my guess is that we are going to have a lot of \ntechnical amendments using language that most people in this body do \nnot use. We are going to be talking about an auction process that has \nnever been put in place in this country, an allocation process that \nwill be allocating trillions of dollars to people around this country. \nI think for us to spend 30 hours talking about that so that all \nSenators are fully aware of what this bill says prior to voting on \namendments is most appropriate. I would think that people who have \nspent a year putting this bill together would relish the time to talk \nabout what this bill actually does and what it says. I look forward to \nbeing a very active participant in that. I thank the sponsors for \nbringing this forward.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thought it would be a good time to thank \nyou, since you are here in the chair today, for all of your hard work \non this bill. This has been a long time in coming. When you got on the \ncommittee, when you came as a new colleague, you worked so hard. You \nand Amy Klobuchar and Ben Cardin and Bernie Sanders, all new Members, \nbecame my right arm on this issue.\n  I wanted to make that note. Also, I want to say specifically that the \nSenator's work on the wildlife and enforcement sections, to name two, I \nthink is really important because we are going to push hard to make \nthis bill the law of the land right now. If we don't achieve that, \neventually we will have a bill that will be the law of the land. The \nSenator's work will be present in all of those iterations going \nforward. So I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am waiting for the closing script, and I will do \nthat when it arrives. I was taken by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nCorker, who has been a very interesting member in terms of this issue. \nHe went with our committee to Greenland and saw the ice melt. I have to \nsay to those who haven't been, it ought to be required if you really \ncare about this issue. It is extraordinary. You can actually sit and \nwatch the ice move and melt--the ice up there in Greenland. The average \nage of these enormous icebergs is 9,000 years.\n  Mr. President, from the minute that ice starts moving, it is a year \nuntil these enormously beautiful icebergs melt to nothing, leaving the \nsea to rise as they melt. Senator Corker was very taken by that. He \nwill speak for himself, but he has problems with this bill. I don't \nagree with him in the way he is interpreting the bill, but that is all \ngoing to come out. He talked about the importance of debating. I have \nto smile because today we had to debate, and we should not have to \ndebate a motion to proceed. That is ridiculous. We should just proceed. \nWe had a 74-to-14 vote to move to the first step.\n  Let's get to the bill. I have never seen a situation where you force \nmore debate time when you really are interested in doing a bill. You \nusually force debate time when you are interested in slowing down the \nbill. This is the way it is here. If you want to move forward, then you \ndon't say: I need 30 hours.\n  It will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow. As Senator Reid \nsaid, I will be on the floor of the Senate all day. I encourage my \ncolleagues--particularly those who worked hard on the bill--to join me. \nLet's see how many from the opposing side come over here. We need to \ndebate them and refute them because already, I say to my friend from \nRhode Island, we had charts on this floor that you would not believe. \nWe had charts that had numbers that were out of the air, predicting a \n140-percent increase in gasoline, when I can tell you right now, we \nlooked at every model, and it is nothing like that.\n  As a matter of fact, we know the slight increase in the cost of \ngasoline that could occur--2 cents a year--from the impact of the bill \nwill be entirely offset by the energy efficiency bill we just voted for \nand is now the law.\n  What we know is that this bill is going to get us off foreign oil, \nmove us away from the status quo. Go out on the street and ask the \naverage American: Are you happy with big oil, the record profits for \nthem and their executives, and we are getting killed at the pumps? They \nwill say: No--unless they are related to one of them.\n  If you say: Do you think it makes us look good when President Bush \ngoes to the Middle East and kisses dictators and holds their hand and \nbegs for oil? Does that make America look strong? They will say: No.\n  Next, if you ask them: Would you support legislation that will lead \nus to energy independence once and for all--and, by the way, we will \nclean up our environment, the greenhouse gas pollution, and we will \nsave the planet? They will say: Yes.\n  So our opponents have a very tough job. They have to fight for the \nstatus quo. I can say from their presentations today--and they worked \nhard on them, believe me--in order to fight our bill, they have to \ndistort it. One of them said it is a tax increase. There is no tax \nincrease in this bill. There is a huge tax relief fund for tax cuts in \nthis bill. There is another almost $1 trillion in a fund to give \nconsumers relief.\n  If today was any indication, we are going to have a spirited debate. \nI only ask my colleagues to debate the bill that is on the Senate \nfloor, not one that came to them from some special interest groups that \noppose this and don't want us to go to energy independence.\n  I wish to read from a statement from former Vice President Al Gore. \nSince Senator Corker is from Tennessee. I thought it would be \ninteresting to put his statement in the Record:\n\n       I want to commend Senator Boxer for her leadership of the \n     Environment and Public Works Committee. We have the first \n     global warming bill in history that is comprehensive, \n     bipartisan, and that enjoys support across the country, from \n     labor and agriculture, to the business and the environmental \n     community.\n\n  Then he says he wants the bill to be stronger, but then he says it is \nvital that Congress begins to act.\n  I think this last line is so important:\n\n       While it is important that people change their light bulbs, \n     it is even more important that we change the laws.\n\n  I think that says it all. We are so late to this issue. We are so \nlate. My Governor, a Republican, and my State legislature, Democratic, \ncrossed party lines and passed laws. We now have just in the last year \nor so hundreds of new solar energy companies that have moved into the \nState, and they are hiring people who are hurting because of the crisis \nwe have in the housing and construction business. So we believe a P-\n32--they have told us this--the bill leading the way in the country, is \nrestoring economic renaissance to our State which otherwise is hurting \nvery badly because of the recession we are all experiencing. We owe \nthis to our grandkids, to our kids. We know the Conference of Mayors \nhas acted, so have the State legislatures, along with Governors \nreaching across party lines, city councils, and boards of supervisors. \nCompanies are saying we should do this. Labor unions are saying we \nshould do this. Environmental and religious groups are saying we should \ndo this. So there is no question that we need to act.\n  When somebody gets up on the other side and says they are not slowing \nit down, but they are going to require 30 hours of extra debate before \nwe get to amending this bill, excuse me, but I have been here long \nenough to know they are trying to slow-walk this bill. The other side \nis slow-walking it.\n  I want them to read the scientific records, listen to the religious \nleaders, and listen to the venture capitalists coming forward and \nsaying we need a signal now. Listen to Tony Blair,\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\nGeorge Bush's best friend internationally, saying we must act because \nAmerica is pivotal. So we have our time tomorrow, after we wait here \nfor people to come and talk, and at some point maybe they will give us \npermission to start the amendment process.\n  Our children want us to act. I have to tell you that one of the great \nmoments was when Senator Warner came to me and said: My daughters \nreally care about this issue. I knew if they were talking to him, he \nmight be open to this issue. He saved the day in committee. He is a man \nwho has such a great legacy already. He didn't have to do one more \npiece of legislation. He has his place in history on national security. \nHe understood that global warming is a national security issue. Our \nNavy intelligence officials tell us that, and we will have some quotes \ntomorrow.\n  This is a win-win bill for national security, for our kids. It is a \nwin for clean air, and it is a win for our consumers and for our \nworkers and our businesses. Anything to the contrary--I believe this so \nmuch--is just scare tactics.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for holding \nthe vote open as long as they could. Unfortunately, both of the trains \nI hoped would get me here were late, and I missed the vote by 10 \nminutes. I wish I had been able to get here in time to deliver this \nstatement in support of cloture on the motion to proceed to the Climate \nSecurity Act, and to vote aye.\n  Mr. President, this is a historic moment. For the first time we have \nbefore the Senate legislation to slow, stop, and reverse greenhouse gas \nemissions in the United States.\n  When such a plan is finally passed, signed and enacted, we will look \nback on this day as the beginning. Let us commit ourselves to that \ngoal.\n  And let us begin this historic process today by allowing the Senate \nto take up the Climate Security Act.\n  In our own country, and among our fellow citizens on this planet, we \nface a common threat. Now is the time for us to fashion a common \nresponse.\n  I introduced climate change legislation over two decades ago, in \n1986, at a time when this issue was just on the horizon. It called for \nthe establishment of national strategy to understand and respond to the \nemerging threat of global warming.\n  Even at that early date, this was a bipartisan effort.\n  I was joined by Senator Mack Mathias, a Maryland Republican. In those \nearly days, Senators Kerry and Gore were also leaders, along with John \nChafee.\n  This remains a bipartisan effort today. In fact, on the legislation \nlaid down this afternoon, the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill, we have all \nthree political parties represented.\n  This debate would not be happening without leadership from both \nparties over the years. Senator McCain joined Senator Lieberman in \nintroducing the first Senate cap-and-trade legislation.\n  Senator Warner has made climate change the issue that will cap his \nalready distinguished career in the Senate.\n  We would not be at this point today, without the leadership of \nSenator Boxer, who has made global warming the signature issue of her \nChairmanship of our Environment Committee.\n  Later in this debate, I intend to offer an amendment, with Senator \nLugar, along with Senators Kerry, Warner, Menendez, and Snowe, calling \nfor renewed leadership by the United States in international climate \nchange negotiations.\n  I make these points because we all know that this debate hangs now in \na delicate balance between the best, bipartisan instincts of the \nSenate, on the one hand, and the temptation, so strong at this time in \nan election year, to score partisan points.\n  I hope that we do not succumb to that temptation. Global warming is \nreal, it is happening now, and the American people look to us for the \npolitical will to fashion a solution.\n  We know that our physical climate is changing. And we all know that \nthe political climate in the United States is changing, too.\n  For too many years, the United States has stayed on the sidelines of \ninternational efforts to combat global warming.\n  We have missed the chance to turn the impending threat of \ncatastrophic climate change into an opportunity to reduce the security \nthreat of our dependence on oil, to reduce the health threat from \npollution, to reduce the sheer waste and inefficiency in our economy.\n  And we missed the chance to do what many of the leading businesses in \nthis country know we should do--capture a leadership position in the \nglobal competition for the next generation of clean technologies.\n  With this debate, we are taking the first steps toward meeting our \nresponsibilities and seizing those opportunities.\n  The physical consequences of global warming are right before our \neyes: the shrinking polar ice cap, retreating glaciers, changing \ngrowing seasons, animal migration, and rainfall patterns.\n  In my own State of Delaware, our coastlines are threatened by rising \nsea levels and the threat of stronger storms from warmer ocean \ntemperatures. Our wetlands, crucial to wildlife, water quality, and \nfisheries, are threatened as salt water intrudes on the richest \nbiological zones in our State.\n  The groundwater we depend on is similarly threatened by saltwater. As \nwe draw from our aquifers, rising levels of sea water seep into the \nwater table, accelerating their depletion.\n  This is not an abstract threat--it is right here at home, where we \nlive.\n  Our national borders, our cities, our cultures, are all built around \npatterns of rainfall, arable land, and coastlines that will be redrawn \nas global warming proceeds.\n  Even the richest nations, the historical source of the emissions \nbehind global warming, will face huge costs coping with those \ncatastrophes.\n  The poorest nations, whose economies have contributed little or \nnothing to the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, will be hit the \nworst, and will have the fewest resources with which to respond.\n  And now a third category has emerged: the rapidly expanding \ndeveloping nations which will be the leading sources of greenhouse \ngases in the future.\n  Those nations must be part of the solution. But the United States \nmust be willing to lead.\n  In the course of becoming the wealthiest nation in history, we became \nthe greatest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses now in the \natmosphere.\n  Now, other nations are following our path to wealth, and will become \nthe next generation of major emitters.\n  It is no answer to say that we must now wait for poorer nations to \nact before we take steps to lead the way to a global solution.\n  That is not the leadership this global threat demands, Mr. President.\n  We must first reach agreement here on our domestic approach to global \nwarming. That is why this debate is so crucial.\n  There will be honest differences on the best way to move to a low-\ncarbon economy. But no serious analyst of this issue believes that the \nworld can sustain business as usual.\n  This is a global problem, that demands a global solution. But that \nsolution will be built on the commitments of each individual nation to \ndo its part.\n  For too long, our differences have been stressed at the expense of \nthe global good. Our constituents look to us to reconcile those \ndifferences, to find a way to respond in the name of the common good.\n  We are now engaged in the search to define and secure a truly global \ncommon good. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture, to join in a \nconstructive debate, in the best tradition of the Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4889-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4889-S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             REVERSAL OF THE HARTNESS V. NICHOLSON DECISION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on April 24, 2008, the Senate passed S. \n1315, the proposed Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. Although \nthe bill passed the Senate by a vote of 96-1, there are some who oppose \nit, expressing the belief that provisions in the bill misallocate VA \npension benefits to reward nonveterans. I seek to set the record \nstraight on S. 1315.\n\n[[Page S4890]]\n\n  S. 1315 is a comprehensive bill that would improve benefits and \nservices for veterans, both young and old. The bill includes numerous \nenhancements to a broad range of veterans' benefits, including life \ninsurance programs for disabled veterans, traumatic injury coverage for \nactive duty servicemembers, and specially adapted housing and \nautomobile and adaptive equipment benefits for individuals with severe \nburn injuries. In addition, the bill includes a provision that would \ncorrect an injustice done to World War II Filipino veterans over 60 \nyears ago. It grants recognition and full veterans' status to these \nindividuals, both those living inside and outside the United States.\n  Many Americans have forgotten that during World War II, the \nPhilippines was not an independent nation as is the case today. The \nPhilippines, along with Puerto Rico and Guam, was ceded to the United \nStates in 1898 following the Spanish-American War. Although plans for \nPhilippine independence from the United States were underway when World \nWar II broke out, the United States government controlled the defense \nand foreign relations of the Philippines when the war began. It was not \nuntil 1946, after the end of World War II, that the Philippines became \nan independent nation. As a result of this relationship, Filipino \nveterans who fought under the United States Command were United States \nveterans until that status was taken away by Congress in 1946.\n  S. 1315, the bill as passed by the Senate, would overturn a 2006 \ndecision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in \nthe case Hartness v. Nicholson. The Hartness decision provided that \ncertain veterans, those who receive a service pension benefit based \nsolely on their age, qualify for additional benefits that are provided \nto very severely disabled veterans, a result not intended by Congress. \nThe savings generated from overturning this court decision would pay \nfor many provisions in the bill, including pension for Filipino \nveterans.\n  Despite the fact that the purpose of the provision in S. 1315 which \nreverses the Hartness decision is to do nothing more than restore the \nclear intent of Congress, it has been mischaracterized by some as an \nattempt to withdraw benefits from deserving veterans in order to fund \nbenefits to Filipino veterans. That is simply not the case. Such \naccusations fail to appreciate the facts of the matter that led the \nSenate to take corrective action.\n  VA nonservice connected disability pension benefits have historically \nbeen paid to wartime veterans with low incomes who are disabled from \nconditions not connected to their service. Under current law, wartime \nveterans who receive pensions based upon disability are eligible to \nreceive certain additional benefits if they are totally disabled and \nare also housebound, blind, or need the aid and attendance of another \nperson to perform daily activities.\n  The statutory provision involved in Hartness was enacted in 2001 so \nas to provide a service pension, not based on disability, to certain \nveterans. Under this law, older, low income wartime veterans are \neligible for a service pension at age 65, without the need to \ndemonstrate any disability. This service pension, which is similar to \none provided many years ago to veterans of the Spanish American War, is \nfound in the service pension section of the statute, not in the section \nof the law where pension for disabled veterans is found.\n  The court in Hartness ruled that elderly persons who are not totally \ndisabled, but who receive a service pension based on age, could also \nreceive the extra benefits available under the disability pension \nbenefit program, even if they did not meet the threshold requirement of \ntotal disability. In so doing, the Hartness court failed to demonstrate \nan understanding of the difference between a service pension and a \npension based on disability.\n  In passing the service pension law in 2001, Congress clearly created \na separate program and did not intend the result in the Hartness \ndecision. Congress intended that veterans who were disabled would \nreceive benefits under the disability pension program, with the \nopportunity to receive the extra benefits if they were more seriously \ndisabled. Veterans who met the age threshold, but who were not \ndisabled, would receive benefits only under the service pension \nprogram, with no basis for receiving the extra benefits. The intent of \nthis action was to create a bright line distinction between the two \npension programs, but the actual statutory construction allowed for \nambiguity, leading the court to misinterpret the law.\n  The provision passed by the Senate in S. 1315 would overturn the \nHartness decision so as to reaffirm that the extra pension benefits are \nonly for those severely disabled veterans who receive pension on the \nbasis of being totally disabled. This result conforms to the original \nCongressional intent of reserving the special additional benefits for \nthose who demonstrate the greatest need based on disability, not simply \nthose who attain a certain age. Even with the repeal of Hartness, aged \nveterans who are totally disabled and who are also housebound or in \nneed of aid and attendance would still qualify for additional money \nunder the nonservice connected disability pension program.\n  S. 1315 is now pending in the House of Representatives and there is \nsome opposition to the bill that seems to stem from a misunderstanding \nof the purpose of VA pension benefits and the Hartness decision. \nCritics of the bill have suggested that it arbitrarily redistributes \nscarce VA benefits to the benefit of individuals to whom our government \nhas no responsibility. These critics fail both to understand the \nhistory of the provisions construed in the Hartness decision and the \nservice of Filipino veterans. Restoring the original purpose of the \nservice pension law would provide the savings needed to pay for \nincreased benefits for veterans with service-connected disabilities as \nwell as justice for Filipino veterans of World War II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4890-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4890-S4891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING CHECKPOINT ONE FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I wish to commend the work of the \nCheckpoint One Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Oregon. \nCheckpoint One assists Iraqis who have served as translators with the \nU.S. military. Under recent legislation authored by myself and my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Kennedy, many of these Iraqis are \nseeking refuge in the United States from persecution in Iraq.\n  Checkpoint One was founded by Jason Faler, one of many Oregonians \ndrawn to public and humanitarian service. Jason served as a military \nintelligence officer with the Oregon Army National Guard in Iraq, where \nhe worked with many brave Iraqis who risked their lives assisting U.S. \ntroops. These Iraqis are far more than just people who translate Arabic \nto English; they are cultural advisers and loyal friends who help our \nsoldiers survive in every dangerous and unfamiliar corner of Iraq. They \nstand shoulder to shoulder with Americans, facing the same bullets and \nbombs, but often without the same protections. In the face of death \nthreats and attacks on them and their families, these Iraqis provide \ninvaluable service to coalition forces. We are morally obligated to \ncome to their aid, as they have come to ours.\n  In response to this obligation, Senator Kennedy and I introduced The \nRefugee Crisis in Iraq Act last year to help bring translators and \nother Iraqis in peril to the United States. The act passed and was \nsigned into law in January 2008. Unfortunately, more than 4 months \nlater, key provisions of the law have not been implemented. The State \nDepartment and Department of Homeland Security have still not described \nhow they plan to meet their new obligations. In-country processing is \nnot available for Iraqi translators and others who are persecuted but \nunable to get out of Iraq. Translators remain waitlisted, in spite of \nthe fact that 5,000 new special immigrant visas are supposed to be \navailable to them. Instead, Iraqi translators remain in danger in the \nred zone, their path to safety still blocked by bureaucratic red tape.\n  Many of the interpreters who apply for these visas are living on \nborrowed time, actively hunted by an insurgency which has brutally \nmurdered their friends and colleagues. The three families that Jason \nbegan helping with the application process in the fall of 2006 arrived \nin September 2007, January 2008, and March 2008, respectively. One \nfamily was kept waiting in Jordan for\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\nover 5 months, and never given a sufficient explanation of the delay in \ntheir case.\n  This is an unacceptable way for the United States to treat Iraqis who \nhave loyally served with our soldiers at great personal risk. Groups \nlike the Checkpoint One Foundation are invaluable in helping the United \nStates repay our debt to those Iraqis translators to whom we owe so \nmuch. Jason Faler, the Checkpoint One Foundation, and similar \norganizations should be highly commended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4891-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING BRENDA ZODY\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I honor a great Hoosier \nteacher, Brenda Zody, whose many accomplishments during 39 years as an \nIndiana educator serve as an example for us all. As Brenda prepares to \nretire from service to the children of Indiana, it is appropriate that \nwe take a moment to give thanks to her for all she has offered to those \nshe has reached throughout her career.\n  Brenda is a native of Martinsville, IN, and is a 1966 graduate of \nMartinsville High School. She received both her BS and MS degrees in \neducation from Indiana State University, and began teaching in 1969 in \nFlint, MI. She moved back to her home state after a year, becoming an \nelementary school teacher at Staunton Elementary in Clay County, IN, \nwhile living in Vigo County.\n  In 1979, she returned to Martinsville with her family and began \nteaching second grade at Green Township Elementary, where she herself \nattended first, second and third grade as a child. She began teaching \nfourth grade in the late 1980s. During her time as a fourth-grade \nteacher, Brenda was involved heavily in the ``Computer at Home/Buddy \nProject,'' an innovative education network which provided fourth and \nfifth graders across the State with take-home computers. She made it a \npoint to take her students each year on Indiana history field trips, \nsuch as the Indiana Statehouse, the James Whitcomb Riley Home, the \nBenjamin Harrison Home, the new and old Indiana State museums, historic \nVincennes and McCormick's Creek State Park. In addition, she was also \nheavily involved in the continuation of annual visits by Martinsville \nstudents to Cross School, one of Morgan County's only surviving one-\nroom schoolhouses. Here, dressed in period clothing, students spend a \nday learning what school meant to children generations ago.\n  Brenda consistently went above and beyond the expectations of her \npost and, in doing so, imparted a love for the State of Indiana on her \nstudents. For these efforts, she was awarded the 2003 Wal-Mart Teacher \nof the Year award in Martinsville. She also played a critical role in \ndeveloping the first written history of Green Township Elementary \nSchool. Today, Brenda resides in Morgan County on property that has \nbeen in her family for about 100 years. She is the mother of John Zody \nof Bloomington and Erin Zody Kaiser of Greenville, and is grandmother \nto Gavin and Ruth Kaiser. Brenda's parents are Bill and Ruth Hammans of \nMartinsville.\n  As Brenda prepares to retire from the Metropolitan School District of \nMartinsville, I am reminded of a quote by Henry Brooks Adams, ``A \nteacher affects eternity; she can never tell where her influence \nstops.'' While no longer in the classroom, her influence upon the \nstudents she has taught will continue to be felt for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4891-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARVEY KORMAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the memory of a very special man, Harvey Korman of Los \nAngeles County, who died May 29, 2008. He was 81 years old.\n  Harvey Korman was a man of many talents and will be fondly remembered \nfor his work in Hollywood as a comedic actor.\n  Harvey Herschel Korman was born to Ellen and Cyril Korman on February \n15, 1927, in Chicago, IL. Interested in acting as a child, Harvey was \nsigned by a local radio station when he was 12 years old. After serving \nin World War II, Harvey came back to Chicago to attend the Chicago \nInstitute's Goodman School of Drama. After his studies at the Goodman \nSchool of Drama, Harvey moved to New York City, where he spent several \nyears trying to find roles in Broadway theater productions.\n  After 13 years in New York, Harvey moved to Hollywood in the early \n1960s. In 1964, Harvey was hired by Danny Kaye to be a part of ``The \nDanny Kaye Show'' ensemble. He stayed with the show for the next 3 \nyears before joining the ``Carol Burnett Show'' in 1967. Harvey's \nversatile acting abilities played a critical role in explaining the \nsuccess of the Burnett show, which appeared without interruption in \ntelevision's top 10 during its 11-year run. It was through the ``Carol \nBurnett Show'' that Harvey also met one of his closest friends, Tim \nConway. Through their many years together performing on the ``Carol \nBurnett Show,'' Korman and Conway formed one of television's most \nformidable comic teams.\n  On the big screen, Harvey made more than 30 films, including four \ncomedies directed by Mel Brooks: ``Blazing Saddles,''1974; ``High \nAnxiety,'' 1977; ``History of the World Part 1,'' 1981; and ``Dracula: \nDead and Loving It,'' 1995.\n  Those who knew Harvey Korman recognized him as an animated and \nbrilliant man. He took pride in promoting comedy to audiences \nworldwide. His work in comedic film and television will be remembered \nfondly by all those whose lives he touched. He will be deeply missed.\n  Harvey is survived by his wife Deborah Fritz and his four children: \nKate, Laura, Maria, and Chris.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4891-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING J.R. SIMPLOT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Idaho lost one of her native sons on \nMay 25, a man who put Idaho on the map and made ``Famous Potatoes'' \nsynonymous with Idaho across the world. John Richard ``J.R.'' Simplot \npassed away at the age of 99, leaving a legendary legacy of hard work \nand shrewd business dealing--a pioneer in every respect. Who would have \nthought that a young man, with no more than an eighth grade education \nwho used to hunt wild horses to feed hogs--his first business venture \nas a teenager--would put Micron on the global map some 50 years later? \nAmong other things, J.R. can be credited with catapulting the \nubiquitous McDonald's French fry to worldwide fame.\n  By the reckoning of some, J.R. Simplot is responsible for the \nemployment of 14,000 Idahoans today, as well as the establishment of \nmany Boise retail and hospitality centers such as the Boise Centre on \nthe Grove, the Boise Factory Outlet and the Qwest Arena.\n  Those of us who knew him knew a man with a colorful personality and a \nresolute sense of self and what he believed in. He was a dogged \nbusinessman, as comfortable in his role in convincing President Reagan \nto support U.S. business interests as he was wandering into a \ncampground near his cabin to visit with folks around the fire. His \npersonality was as multifaceted as the organizations and institutions \nto which he gave millions of dollars. J.R. donated to multiple causes \nincluding millions of dollars to Boise State University and other Idaho \ninstitutions of higher learning, the Ronald McDonald House, the Boys \nand Girls Clubs, the arts, Idaho Public Television, the Boise \nZoological Society, Boise area medical centers, the YMCA and public \nlibraries. Being rated by Forbes as one of the top 100 wealthiest \nAmericans, and the oldest living billionaire in the United States, \ndidn't change J.R.'s outlook on life, nor his habit of driving to \nMcDonald's to eat a few times a week. In his trademark pragmatic way, \nhe outlined for Esquire Magazine, at age 92, what it takes to be \nsuccessful in business. He compared business to playing a game of \nmarbles: ``Each man has his own taw, and if he gets good with that taw, \nhe can knock the hell out of some marbles. And he can win, but he has \nto have strong fingers and the right aim. It's like anything else: You \ngot to work at it.''\n  J.R. was a no-nonsense, down-to-earth, highly perceptive businessman, \nentrepreneur and philanthropist. Idaho can be proud of his incredible \nlegacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/02/senate-section/article/S4891-4", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4891-S4892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN TERRY\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

Res. 580\n\n       Whereas Iran is a party to the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty'') and, by ratifying the Treaty, has foresworn the \n     acquisition of nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas Iran is legally bound to declare all its nuclear \n     activity to the International Atomic Energy Agency and to \n     place such activity under the constant monitoring of the \n     Agency;\n       Whereas for nearly 20 years Iran had a covert nuclear \n     program, until the program was revealed by an opposition \n     group in Iran in 2002;\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency has \n     confirmed that the Government of Iran has engaged in such \n     covert nuclear activities as the illicit importation of \n     uranium hexafluoride, the construction of a uranium \n     enrichment facility, experimentation with plutonium, the \n     importation of centrifuge technology and the construction of \n     centrifuges, and the importation of the design to convert \n     highly enriched uranium gas into a metal and to shape it into \n     the core of a nuclear weapon, as well as significant \n     additional covert nuclear activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to expand the \n     number of centrifuges at its enrichment facility and to \n     enrich uranium in defiance of 3 binding United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions demanding that Iran suspend its \n     uranium enrichment activities;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has announced its intention \n     to begin the installation of 6,000 advanced centrifuges, \n     which, when operational, will dramatically reduce the time it \n     will take Iran to enrich uranium;\n       Whereas the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate reports \n     that the Government of Iran was secretly working on the \n     design and manufacture of a nuclear warhead until at least \n     2003 and that Iran could have enough highly enriched uranium \n     for a nuclear weapon as early as late 2009;\n       Whereas allowing the Government of Iran to obtain a nuclear \n     weapons capability would pose a grave threat to international \n     peace and security;\n       Whereas allowing the Government of Iran to obtain a nuclear \n     weapons capability would fundamentally alter and destabilize \n     the strategic balance of power in the Middle East;\n       Whereas, if it were allowed to obtain a nuclear weapons \n     capability, the Government of Iran could share its nuclear \n     technology, raising the frightening prospect that terrorist \n     groups and rogue regimes might possess nuclear weapons \n     capabilities;\n       Whereas allowing the Government of Iran to obtain a nuclear \n     weapons capability would severely undermine the global \n     nuclear nonproliferation regime that, for more than 4 \n     decades, has contained the spread of nuclear weapons;\n       Whereas it is likely that one or more Arab states would \n     respond to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapons capability by \n     following Iran's example, and several Arab states have \n     already announced their intentions to pursue ``peaceful \n     nuclear'' programs;\n       Whereas the spread of nuclear weapons capabilities \n     throughout the Middle East would make the proliferation of \n     nuclear weapons elsewhere around the globe much more likely;\n       Whereas allowing the Government of Iran to obtain a nuclear \n     weapons capability would directly threaten Europe and \n     ultimately the United States because Iran already has \n     missiles that can reach parts of Europe and is seeking to \n     develop intercontinental ballistic missiles;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has repeatedly called for \n     the elimination of our ally, Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has advocated that the \n     United States withdraw its presence from the Middle East;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council has passed 3 \n     binding resolutions under Chapter VII of the United Nations \n     Charter that impose sanctions on Iran for its failure to \n     comply with the mandatory demand of the Security Council to \n     suspend all uranium enrichment activity;\n       Whereas the United States, the Russian Federation, the \n     People's Republic of China, France, the United Kingdom, and \n     Germany have offered to negotiate a significant package of \n     economic, diplomatic, and security incentives if Iran \n     complies with the Security Council's demands to suspend \n     uranium enrichment;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has consistently refused \n     such offers;\n       Whereas, as a result of the failure of the Government of \n     Iran to comply with the Security Council resolutions, the \n     international community began taking steps in 2006 that have \n     begun to have an impact on the economy of Iran, but the rapid \n     development of nuclear weapons capabilities by the Government \n     of Iran is outpacing the slowly increasing economic and \n     diplomatic sanctions on Iran;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has used its banking system, \n     including the Central Bank of Iran, to support its \n     proliferation efforts and to assist terrorist groups;\n       Whereas, as a result of that use of Iran's banking system, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury has designated 4 large Iranian \n     banks as proliferators and supporters of terrorism and \n     restricted the ability of those banks to conduct \n     international financial transactions in United States \n     dollars; and\n       Whereas Iran must import around 40 percent of its daily \n     requirements for refined petroleum products: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares that preventing the Government of Iran from \n     acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, through all \n     appropriate economic, political, and diplomatic means, is a \n     matter of the highest importance to the national security of \n     the United States and must be dealt with urgently;\n       (2) urges the President, in the strongest of terms, to \n     immediately use the President's existing authority to impose \n     sanctions on--\n       (A) the Central Bank of Iran and any other Iranian bank \n     engaged in proliferation activities or support of terrorist \n     groups;\n       (B) international banks that continue to conduct financial \n     transactions with sanctioned Iranian banks;\n       (C) energy companies that have invested $20,000,000 or more \n     in the petroleum or national gas sector of the economy of \n     Iran in any given year since the date of the enactment of the \n     Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note); and\n       (D) companies that continue to do business with the Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran;\n       (3) demands that the President lead an international effort \n     to immediately and dramatically increase the pressure on the \n     Government of Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear \n     enrichment activities by, among other measures, banning the \n     importation of refined petroleum products to Iran; and\n       (4) asserts that nothing in this resolution shall be \n     construed to authorize the use of force against Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url":
